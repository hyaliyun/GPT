They embarked on the sold out tour on May 25, 2014 in Park City, Kansas and ended it in Los Angeles on July 26, 2014. Due to the success of ticket sales and several sold out venues before the tour had officially kicked off, several more shows were added to the tour schedule, which also sold out. For the tour choreography, the Hough siblings collaborated with Nappytabs. Following the success of the 2014 tour and high demand, the Houghs announced the return of \\"Move Live on Tour\\" in the summer of 2015. Spanning from June 12, 2015 to August 8, 2015, the sold out tour visited over 40 cities throughout the U.S. and Canada, and visited larger venues than in the previous year. Tabitha and Napoleon D'umo \\"Nappytabs\\" returned as collaborating choreographers alongside the Hough siblings. Auditions were also held to recruit a new group of dancers to join the Houghs, although some back-up dancers from the previous year returned. On July 9, 2016, the Houghs held a free fitness pop-up event called 'Move Interactive' in Los Angeles, which they announced would be the first of many. The event started off in Sherman Oaks with a workout session at Pulse Fitness Studios led by celebrity personal trainer and owner, Mark Harari. The participants then took part in a two-mile run along Ventura Blvd, before finishing off with a dance-fitness class at JustDance Los Angeles. According to Hough, the motivation behind the event was to \\"bring health, love, community and human interaction into our everyday lives.\\" The following week, on July 14, the Hough's held a second free Move Interactive event in Fryman Canyon, LA, which included a hike and team building exercises.

The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)?

A proponent of natural philosophy, he believed in an innate mathematical order in nature and he attempted biological classifications based on the Quinarian system. Biography. He was born at Darmstadt. After studying at Göttingen and Heidelberg he spent two years at Leiden, where his attention was specially devoted to the amphibians and fishes. He then returned to Darmstadt as an assistant in the grand ducal museum, of which in 1840 he became inspector. In 1829 he published \\"Skizze zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der europäischen Thierwelt\\", in which he regarded the animal world as developed from lower to higher forms, from the amphibians through the birds to the beasts of prey; but subsequently he repudiated this work as a youthful indiscretion, and on the publication of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" he declared himself against its doctrines. The extensive fossil deposits in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt gave him ample opportunities for palaeontological inquiries, and he gained considerable reputation by his \\"Beiträge zur näheren Kenntniss der urweltlichen Säugethiere\\" (18551862). He also wrote \\"Classification der Säugethiere und Vögel\\" (1844), and, with Heinrich Georg Bronn, \\"Die Gavial-artigen Reste aus dem Lias\\" (18421844). - The Quinarian system was a method of zoological classification which had a brief period of popularity in the mid 19th century, especially among British naturalists. It was largely developed by the entomologist William Sharp MacLeay in 1819. The system was further promoted in the works of Nicholas Aylward Vigors, William John Swainson and Johann Jakob Kaup. Swainson's work on ornithology gave wide publicity to the idea. The system had opponents even before the publication of Charles Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species\\" (1859 ) which paved the way for evolutionary trees. - Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature (from Latin \\"philosophia naturalis\\") was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science.

Answer the following question: What former astronaut was a character in the 1995 film Apollo 13, as well as Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert? Answer:","completion":"The former astronaut character in the 1995 film Apollo 13, along with Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert, is Fred Haise. The film is a docudrama that tells the story of the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission, which was NASA's third mission intended to land astronauts on the moon. The mission had to be aborted when one of the spacecraft's oxygen tanks exploded, and the crew faced a life-threatening situation while returning to Earth. Fred Haise, played by Bill Paxton in the movie, was the Lunar Module Pilot on the Apollo 13 mission. He was born on November 14, 1933, in Biloxi, Mississippi, and joined NASA in 1966 as an astronaut. Before joining NASA, Haise had already built an impressive career as a military test pilot and aeronautical engineer. He was instrumental in the development of several prominent military aircraft, including the F-111 and F-14 Tomcat. In the film Apollo 13, which was directed by Ron Howard, actors Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton play the three astronauts Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise. The film closely follows the real-life events of the Apollo 13 mission, accurately portraying the challenges and dangers faced by the astronauts. The movie is based on the book \\"Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13,\\" written by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger. The astronauts' bravery, resourcefulness, and determination to survive the harrowing ordeal are vividly depicted in the movie. Apollo 13 highlights the importance of teamwork, ingenuity, and quick thinking under immense pressure to adapt and overcome life-threatening situations. The movie was a critical and commercial success, receiving nine Academy Award nominations and winning two for Best Film Editing and Best Sound. In summary, Fred Haise is the former astronaut who was a character in the 1995 film Apollo 13, alongside Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert. While their mission did not go as planned, the story of Apollo 13 has lived on as a testament to human ingenuity and the will to survive in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller.

However, many people don't smile because they think they have ugly teeth. For example, one of my classmates, Mike, doesn't have very nice teeth, so that is why he seldom opens his mouth. He even says that he has lost confidence because of his teeth. So it is very important for us to look after our teeth. In fact, a lot of people have this problem. Some people inherit teeth problems from their parents, while others' teeth are damaged because of bad habits, like heavy smoking, eating too much sugar or not brushing teeth often. If your teeth are in bad shape, you should see a dentist and ask for help. They can help improve your teeth and tell you how to take care of them. Smiling can help you to feel more confidence and make people think of you as a more friendly person. If you want to keep healthy, you should not only smile but also laugh.

Context: \\"Puritan\\" (ACM-16/MMA-16) was built for the United States Army as U.S. Army Mine Planter (USAMP) \\"Col. Alfred A. Maybach\\" MP-13. The ship was transferred to the United States Navy and classified as an auxiliary minelayer. \\"Puritan\\" was never commissioned and thus never bore the \\"United States Ship\\" (USS) prefix showing status as a commissioned ship of the U.S. Navy. Hypothesis: \\"Puritan\\" was never a commissioned ship of the U.S. Navy.","completion":"From the provided context, we can draw the hypothesis that \\"Puritan\\" was never a commissioned ship of the U.S. Navy. The context gives us several reasons to support this hypothesis which are explained in detail below. 1. The initial purpose of the ship: The context states that the \\"Puritan\\" was built for the United States Army as the U.S. Army Mine Planter (USAMP) under the name \\"Col. Alfred A. Maybach\\" MP-13. This indicates that its original function was to serve in the capacity of a mine planter for the U.S. Army, and not necessarily a commissioned ship for the U.S. Navy. 2. Transfer to the U.S. Navy: The context also mentions that the ship was indeed transferred to the United States Navy, specifically as an auxiliary minelayer. This illustrates that while the ship eventually came under the jurisdiction of the Navy, its role was still primarily focused on performing a specific support function, which was in line with its original purpose as a mine planter. 3. Lack of commissioning: The fact that the \\"Puritan\\" was never commissioned is provided in the context as well. A ship is commissioned when it is placed in active service and formally becomes part of the naval fleet. The commissioning of a ship typically involves a ceremony and the ship is then granted the \\"United States Ship\\" (USS) prefix. Since \\"Puritan\\" was never commissioned, it never went through this formal process, hence it was never granted the USS prefix. 4. No USS prefix: The context explicitly states that \\"Puritan\\" never bore the \\"United States Ship\\" (USS) prefix, a clear indication that it was not considered a commissioned ship of the U.S. Navy. This prefix is only applied to commissioned ships, which serve as a testament to their status within the Navy. In conclusion, considering all these factors, we can draw the hypothesis that \\"Puritan\\" was never a commissioned ship of the U.S. Navy. The information from the context demonstrates that the ship's original and primary purpose was to function as a mine planter for the U.S. Army, later serving an auxiliary support role for the U.S. Navy, and it was never commissioned or granted the USS prefix."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was sent to prison, where he committed suicide. Samantha Finley (Erin Marie Hogan), her older brother Thomas (Shane Van Dyke), and their mother Ellen (Fia Perera) believe that Ellen has been making contact with her deceased husband, David. Soon the family claims that a demon is haunting them. At first, they think it is David, but after a series of horrible attacks on Samantha, they suspect otherwise. One night the camera records Ellen sitting up in bed and leaving her bedroom. She walks into the living room, where she writes something on a piece of paper. She then crumples the paper and walks back down the hallway. Thomas finds the paper under Samantha's pillow and sees that it spells out the word \\"MARON\\". Thomas suggests that Ellen and Samantha stay at a hotel while he sets up traps around the house with bells and wire. When the bells ring, Thomas investigates. The wire and bell outside his door are ripped from the wall and thrown at him. Thomas shuts himself in the bedroom and the demon bangs on his door. Thomas receives a phone call from Ellen, who is in hysterics after the demon apparently followed them and attacked Samantha. Upon returning to the house, Samantha hunches over in pain.

The Athenian general Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) led his own army against them at the shores. The Greeks brutally and effortlessly take down the invading Persians one by one, paving the way for Themistocles to take aim at Darius, who is watching the massacre of his men from his ship offshore. Themistocles raises a bow and arrow, ready to commit the act that would make him known as a legend. He releases the bow just in time for Darius's son, Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) to watch. He runs to his father's side but is too late to save him as the arrow pierces him. Xerxes holds his father in his arms and locks eyes with Themistocles. The latter walks away, with Gorgo stating that he knew in his heart that he made a mistake not to kill Xerxes when he had the chance.Darius is returned to his kingdom to lie in his deathbed. He and Xerxes are joined by Artemisia (Eva Green), Darius's commanding naval officer, said to be as vicious as she is beautiful. She holds Darius's hand.

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.

Help as much as you can. Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The Gunpowder Plot was conspiracy to kill King James I, as well as the members of the House of Lords and Commons at the re-opening of Parliament. It was designed by a group of Catholics in protest against the anti-Catholic laws that were being introduced by the king. Robert Catesby was the leader of the group. It was he and his cousin, Thomas Wintour, and two other friends, Thomas Percy and John Wright, who formed the center of the group. They were joined by nine more men; among them was Guy Fawkes, from the city of York in the north of England. Fawkes found a store room directly under the House of Lords and rented it out under the false name of John Johnson. The conspirators stored thirty-six barrels of gunpowder there, and Fawkes, who was an explosives expert, was to light the fuses on 5th November 1605. The plot failed because one of the conspirators, Francis Tresham, sent a letter to his relative, who was a member of the House of Lords. The letter warned him not to attend the opening ceremony of Parliament. The letter was passed on to the authorities, who took action. Guy Fawkes was found in the cellar on the night of 4th November with the thirty-six barrels and a number of fuses. He was imprisoned and ill-treated, eventually giving away the names of the conspirators. Soldiers of the king surrounded Holbeach House, in the Midlands, where they knew the conspirators to be hiding. In the fight that followed, four of them were shot dead, including Catesby and Percy, who were actually killed by the same bullet. The others were imprisoned and hanged along with Guy Fawkes on 31st January 1606. These days, on 5th November, children all over Britain celebrate Guy Fawkes Night by building huge bonfires and lighting fireworks. It's a family tradition and an occasion to eat potatoes baked by the flames. There is always a 'guy' on top of the fire, a model of Guy Fawkes, dressed in the clothes of the 17th century.

The bulletproof armoured car that kept Al Capone safe from his enemies is up for auction for £325,000. The U.S, gangster’s 1928 Cadillac V-8 Town Sedan was fitted with 3,000lb of steel armour and painted green with black fenders to mimic a police car, with flashing lights, a siren and police-band radio receiver. The bulletproof windows could be raised to reveal holes through which machine guns could be fired, while the rear window could be dropped to let his henchman fire on those chasing them. Untouchable: A Cadillac which was kitted out with steel armour and bulletproof windows to protect its owner - legendary Chicago gangster Al Capone - is going on sale. Capone was eventually jailed for tax. evasion, and ironically his 84-year-old car is classed as a classic and. is therefore tax exempt. Latterly owned by a U.S. car collector, it will be sold at RM Auctions in California on August 20. The car even had a flashing light, siren and the first police-band radio receiver in private hands. To further protect its precious load the bulletproof glass windows could be wound further than normal to reveal circular holes through which machine guns could be fired. And in case this was not enough to deter any drivers taking up the chase, the rear window of the ride was rigged to drop at an instant so Capone’s henchmen could open fire at any following cars. The car, which is thought to have been. briefly used by President Franklin Roosevelt after Capone was imprisoned. for tax evasion, is expected to fetch a six figure sum at auction. Decked out: Al Capone would have been safe in this one, the 1928 Cadillac V-8 Town Sedan has 3,000lbs of steel armour fitted and was used by President Roosevelt after Capone's imprisonment. Machine gun friendly: The bullet proof glass had muzzle sized holes for Capone and his fellow gangsters to fit their guns and even a drop down rear window, pictured, to mow down pursuers. Considering his crime – the one he was. imprisoned for – Capone would probably have been pleased to know that. his old car, being 84-years-old, is classed as a classic and is. therefore tax exempt. After. Capone’s imprisonment the vehicle went on to be shown around the world,. even making a trip to the UK in the 1950’s displayed at the. Southend-on-Sea amusement park and at the Blackpool funfair. It later entered the collection of the. US motor enthusiast John O'Quinn who died last year in a car crash and. it is now being sold as part of his estate. The car is going on sale at the end of August and is expected to fetch £325,000 at the auction. In. their research into the origins of the car, auctioneers uncovered. 92-year-old Richard Capstran, whose mechanic father fitted the armour. He said Capone's mobsters arrived and told him what they wanted doing. Mr Capstran said: ‘My dad said “we don't do that kind of work here,” and they said “you do now.”’ The car was then backed into the garage so no one could see what was happening to it. Mr. Capstran said Capone turned up to pay the bill himself and even gave. the ten-year-old Mr Capstran a ten dollar note - a small fortune to a. young boy at the time. A. spokesman for RM Auctions said: ‘This is. widely considered as one of the most historically significant pre-war. American cars. ‘It is. liveried in green with black fenders to mirror the Cadillacs supplied to. the Chicago police and city officials at the time. ‘It. is one of the earliest surviving \\"bulletproof\\" cars and was fitted new. with heavy glass measuring nearly an inch thick and completely lined. with 3,000lbs of steel armour plating. ‘‘It has undergone restoration and is a fabulous piece of history.’ Alphonse 'Al' Capone was born to Italian immigrants in Brooklyn, New York in 1899. After being kicked out of school aged 14. he became involved in local teenage gangs and but moved to Chicago in. his early twenties to take advantage of the thriving market for illegal. alcohol during the first years of Prohibition. Capone, imprisoned for tax evasion, would probably have a laugh at his old ride being tax exempt. There he ran prostitution rings, illegal gambling halls but made most of his money running speakeasy bars where thirsty Chicago dwellers could get their hands on banned alcohol. He rose to become the leader of 'The Chicago Outfit' gang, which later became known as 'The Capone Family' and ruled the streets of Chicago from the early 1920's until his capture in 1931. Despite his gangster ways Capone was a highly visible public figure in Chicago and even opened charity soup kitchens and worked for the safety of the city's children. Capone has been credited with ordering one of the most famous mass murders in 20th century America - the Valentine's Day Massacre - where members of his gang gunned down seven of the rival Moran gang whilst dressed in police uniforms. The law finally caught up with the mob leader in 1931 when he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for tax evasion. He spent a majority of his sentence in the famous Alcatraz prison where he was famous for manipulating prison guards. His health deteriorated in prison and he was no longer capable to run 'The Chicago Outfit' upon his release. Suffering from neurosyphilis his mental health broke down and when examined a few years after his release he was said to have the mental capacity of a 12-year-old. Al Capone died in 1947 in Palm Island, Florida. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"This article talks about a very special car that belonged to a famous gangster named Al Capone. He was a big boss in a city called Chicago a long, long time ago. Al Capone had a car called a 1928 Cadillac V-8 Town Sedan, and it was made to help keep him safe from bad people who wanted to hurt him. The car had really thick steel armor, which is like a strong metal coat, and special windows that were bulletproof, so bullets from guns couldn't go through them. The car was painted green and black to look like a police car. It even had flashy lights, a loud siren, and something to listen to police radio. The car also had hidden holes for machine guns and a special back window that could quickly open for his friends to shoot from if they were being chased. After Al Capone went to jail and couldn't use the car anymore, a president named Franklin Roosevelt used it for a short time. Now, the car is being sold in an auction for a lot of money, around £325,000!

Information: - A castle (from ) is a type of fortified structure built in Europe and the Middle East during the Middle Ages by nobility. Scholars debate the scope of the word \\"castle\\", but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for nobility; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls and arrowslits, were commonplace. - Schio is a town and comune in the province of Vicenza (region of Veneto, northern Italy) situated North of Vicenza and East of the Lake of Garda. It is surrounded by the Little Dolomites (Italian Prealps) and Mount Pasubio.\\"'\\"Which is Sheridan more like, Mantova or Verona or Vicenza? It isn't like any of those. It is right up against the mountains, almost like Schio.\\" \\"Ernest Hemingway\\" History. Its name comes from Latin: escletum was a wood of oaks and it was first used in a document of some Benedictines from Vicenza. The first settlements were around two old hills, where now there are respectively the ruins of an old castle and a majestic neoclassical cathedral. - An all-terrain vehicle (ATV), also known as a quad, quad bike, three-wheeler, four-wheeler, or quadricycle as defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is a vehicle that travels on low-pressure tires, with a seat that is straddled by the operator, along with handlebars for steering control. As the name implies, it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles. Although it is a street-legal vehicle in some countries, it is not street-legal within most states and provinces of Australia, the United States or Canada. - A moped (/mopd/ MOH-ped) is a small motorcycle, generally having a less stringent licensing requirement than motorcycles or automobiles because mopeds typically travel about the same speed as bicycles on public roadways. Strictly speaking, mopeds are driven by both an engine and by bicycle pedals, but in common usage and in many jurisdictions the term moped is used for similar vehicles including a scooter, though this is quite erroneous. Mopeds occasionally resemble powered bicycles, more commonly called a motorized bicycle, though since ca. 2006 there has been a glut of engine kits shipped from China (although Tanaka had offered drive kits since the 1960s) designed in theory to transform a standard bicycle into a motor vehicle but lacking the benefit of proper brakes and lighting. In addition, the added stresses can cause the rear rim to warp, and the spokes to break, and if the engine is the least bit out of alignment the drive chain will come off the drive sprocket, causing the rim to warp and the spokes to break, as well as lodging the chain in the chainstay and causing injury to the operator. Some mopeds are of a step-through type design, while others are step-over, or \\"top tank\\", designs, having a motorcycle-like frame, including a \\"backbone\\" and a raised fuel tank (known as a \\"top tank\\" among moped enthusiasts), mounted directly between the saddle and the head tube. Most are similar to a regular motorcycle, only having the addition of pedals, in which the rider can both manually power the vehicle through a bicycle-like crankset in addition to a small displacement engine. Although mopeds usually have two wheels, some regions classify low-powered three- or (rarely) four-wheeled vehicles as a moped. Many(US ?)states have laws on the books that anyone convicted of a DUI cannot legally operate any motor vehicle powered by gasoline for the entire length of their sentence. - Derbi is a manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters, mopeds and recreational all-terrain vehicles produced by Nacional Motor S.A.U., a Spanish subsidiary of Piaggio & Co.

Honda was the eighth largest automobile manufacturer in the world behind General Motors, Volkswagen Group, Toyota, Hyundai Motor Group, Ford, Nissan, and PSA Peugeot Citroën in 2011. - A cathedral (French: \\"cathédrale\\" from Latin: \\"cathedra\\", \\"seat\\" from the Greek \\"kathédra\\" (), seat, bench, from \\"kata\\" \\"down\\" + \\"hedra\\" seat, base, chair) is a Christian church which contains the seat of a bishop, thus serving as the central church of a diocese, conference, or episcopate. The counterpart term for such a church in German is \\"Dom\\" from Latin \\"domus ecclesiae\\" or \\"domus episcopalis\\"; also Italian Duomo, Dutch \\"Domkerk\\" and cognates in many other European languages. Churches with the function of \\"cathedral\\" are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and some Lutheran and Methodist churches. Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in Italy, Gaul, Spain and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches and episcopal residences.

Passage: On the other hand, in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels.

It Won’t Matter for U.S. Basketball in Rio Stephen Curry isn’t on the team, and neither is LeBron James or Russell Westbrook. Nor is Kawhi Leonard, Chris Paul or James Harden. Though all these players would be automatic selections to a “best American” basketball team, each has bowed out of consideration for the United States Olympic team, citing fatigue or injury. But the 12 men who were named to the team Monday morning are still a formidable group and will be heavily favored to win another gold medal. In other words, the United States bench is deep. Meet the 2016 U.S. Olympic Men’s Basketball TeamRoster: https://t.co/SVpGiA5Dxl#UNITE #RoadToRio #USABMNT pic.twitter.com/hcg1tqPUOX The best American gymnasts or volleyball players wouldn’t pass up an Olympic opportunity. And most international men’s basketball stars keep playing for their home countries as long as they can. Dirk Nowitzki was still plugging away last fall at age 37 for Germany at the European Championships. But with a grueling N.B.A. schedule just completed and another one around the corner, many of America’s best have decided this is not the year to add a summer tournament to their schedules. Does this open up an opportunity for Nigeria or Venezuela to win the gold in Rio? Well, no. The United States team starts with one no-arguments superstar, Kevin Durant. No other country will feature a player with close to his all-around skills. Curry is missing, but the other Splash brother, Klay Thompson, is on the team, along with his Warriors teammates Draymond Green and Harrison Barnes. Though James is taking the summer off, the N.B.A. champion Cleveland Cavaliers are represented by Kyrie Irving. The American team is notably versatile. Except for the two centers, DeMarcus Cousins and DeAndre Jordan, and the two point guards, Irving and Kyle Lowry, every player is listed from 6-foot-7 to 6-9, and many play multiple positions. Paul George is also on the team, despite having sustained a serious leg injury while training for the 2014 World Cup of Basketball, which caused him to miss nearly a full N.B.A. season. The team is rounded out by Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan and Carmelo Anthony, playing in his fourth Olympics. The Americans’ status as gold medal favorites is enhanced by the other contenders’ relatively weak rosters. Spain has been the second best team in the world for many years, but is led by a 36-year-old, Pau Gasol. The status of his brother Marc, who broke his foot with the Grizzlies in February, is unclear, and Serge Ibaka, the Orlando Magic star, will not play, citing the long N.B.A. season. That leaves Ricky Rubio as Spain’s No. 2 star. Other contenders have even fewer N.B.A.-quality players. Lithuania, runner-up to Spain in last year’s Euros, is led by Jonas Valanciunas, a solid center for the Raptors who would not have come close to the Olympics were he an American. Other teams have legitimate N.B.A. stars who are getting toward the end of their careers. Manu Ginobili of Argentina is 38. Anderson Varejão and Leandro Barbosa of host Brazil are 33. Tony Parker and Boris Diaw of France are both 34 (and France has not yet qualified for the Games). While all of these teams have good players from the European leagues, even the biggest Europhile acknowledges the huge gulf between the quality of the N.B.A. and Italy’s Serie A or Spain’s Liga ACB. In 2012, a more star-studded United States team finished 8-0, but faced two close games, a 5-point win over Lithuania in the group stage and a 7-point win in the gold medal game over Spain. Durant had 30 points in the final, which was close throughout. In 2008, the Americans were again 8-0 with an 11-point win over Spain for the gold medal the closest game. Knowing that the Americans are likely to win the gold medal won’t make you rich. Sky Bet currently offers odds of 1-14 on the United States — a 14 bet will earn you just a buck. Spain is the second favorite at 10-1, and Brazil is 20-1. After the group stage, the Olympic tournament moves to single-elimination quarterfinals, semifinals and final, so a fluky loss is not impossible. But even without its biggest stars, the United States is playing with by far the best team.

Given the question: Given the following context: The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display.

The modern Republic of Turkey dates only from 1923, but the history of the land within its borders stretches back to the dawn of humanity. Widespread finds of Stone Age implements in cave excavations show that Anatolia was already inhabited during the Middle of the Palaeolithic period (about 200,000 to 40,000 years ago). By Neolithic times, organized communities had arisen, such as the one at Çatalhöyük, near Konya, Turkey's most important prehistoric site. This town, which flourished between 6500 and 5500 b.c. , had flat-roofed houses of mud and timber decorated with wall-paintings, some of which show patterns that still appear on Anatolian kilims. The advent of the Bronze Age (about 3200 b.c. ), and the spread of city-states ruled by kings, is marked by the appearance of royal tombs containing bronze objects in such places as Troy in the west, and Alacahöyük near Ankara. Around this time the Sumerian civilization living in Mesopotamia (the region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present-day Iraq) founded and developed the cuneiform script, the world's oldest form of writing on record. The technique was introduced by Assyrian traders 1,000 years later in­to Anatolia, where it was qui­ck­ly adopted by the indigenous Hatti people, who, at this point, had already reached an ad­­vanced state of civilization. The Hittites: The capital of the Hatti was Kanesh (modern Kültepe, near Kayseri). Cuneiform tablets found here record the arrival in Anatolia of warlike invaders around the second mill­ennium b.c. Their origins remain a my­s­tery (their written language was finally deciphered in 1915), but they came from the direction of the Caucasus moun­tains, spreading destruction and disorder throughout Anatolia. It was two hundred years before they were firmly entrenched in their newly conquered empire. The newcomers were the Hittites, and their domination of Anatolia can be divided into three distinct periods: the Old Kingdom (c. 1600–1450 b.c. ), then the New or Empire Period (c. 1450–1200 b.c. ), and the Late Hittite Period (c.

It is the first time the West African country has hosted the VIP event since the Geneva-based WEF came to the continent nearly a quarter century ago -- but the spotlight has shifted. Focus is now on the Nigeria's list of problems in the North: kidnappings, terrorist attacks and killings. The country has been a terrific economic growth story for the past few years, humming along at around 7%. It is at the heart of what many define as an African Renaissance. After decades of loans from international lenders such as the World Bank, high debt and little development, Africa is coming alive. That is why Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and his highly regarded economic team were eager to bring global CEOs to their turf. But Nigeria does have a couple of obvious economic black-eyes, most notably an inability to close the wealth gap between the North and South, which in turn has given fuel to the Boko Haram movement and, by extension, radical Islam. These groups take issue with what they see as the negative influences of globalization. The WEF is seen as standing at the forefront of a policy discussion and networking linked to more, not less, globalization. The best indicator for the wealth gap is per capita income. Let's start in the financial capital of Lagos and work our way North. In Lagos, it is pegged at just over 2,900, according to a survey by Renaissance Capital. In the political capital of Abuja, where the economic forum is taking place, it rises to 4,000. But if one heads North to Borno -- the birthplace of Boko Haram -- per capita income is just 1,631. There is an overemphasis on farming, very little in the way of an industrial base and the financial situation is even worse in surrounding states. In Borno, alarmingly, 60% of the population lives in extreme poverty, according to the Nigeria Security Tracker. Poverty and violence often go hand-in-hand, and that is the case here. Nearly a third of all violent deaths in the country over the past two years have taken place in this region. One cannot overlook the effort by the terrorist group to ramp up the heat ahead of this high-profile business forum. But at the same time one cannot ignore the lack of progress in fighting off the violence and persistent corruption. This government's track record of unleashing pent-up demand is solid. After re-basing its economy in early April to take in services growth, Nigeria zoomed ahead of South Africa as the continent's biggest economy. Nigeria and South Africa are both plagued with high unemployment, but the former's GDP now stands at over a half trillion dollars while the latter's is at 325 billion. South Africa also struggles with less than a third of Nigeria's growth. South Africa's President Jacob Zuma goes to the polls making the case that his country can serve as a springboard into the faster growing economies of West and East Africa, due to its lead in financial and trade services. Nigerian private sector banks and telecom providers have a different view. Nigeria has all the ingredients for growth: 170 million people, a low debt level and low budget deficit with the blessing of sizable proven oil reserves. At 37 billion barrels, the country is ranked second on the continent behind Libya. It is a nice recipe for growth, but the rule of law and rooting out corruption rank high on the foreign investor check list. That is where Nigeria remains vulnerable.

They are excited because their country has been doing very well and making lots of money. But there is a problem too: there are some people in the North of Nigeria who are very unhappy about this event and the way the country is being run. They are causing trouble, like kidnapping and attacking others. This is because they feel left out since they are much poorer than people in the other parts of Nigeria. Even though Nigeria has all the right things to grow and be successful, like lots of people, money from oil and not much debt, they need to make sure that they follow the law and treat everyone fairly. This will help them become an even better country and make people all around the world want to join them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To bring peace, Merlin (Nicol Williamson) secures the mystical sword Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake (Hilary Joyalle) and gives it to Uther. Impressed by this symbol of power and Uther's promise of land, Cornwall relents and recognizes Uther as king. Cornwall hosts a celebration, where his wife, Igrayne (Katrine Boorman) dances. Uther cannot hide his lust and the fragile truce is broken.Uther besieges Cornwall's castle. He again asks Merlin to intervene. Merlin agrees to give him Igrayne but only if Merlin will receive the result of Uther's lust. That night, Uther's men draw Cornwall out of his castle and ambush him, killing him. Merlin transforms Uther to resemble Cornwall. Uther enters the castle, makes rough love to Igrayne and impregnates her as Cornwall breathes his last.Nine months later, Igrayne gives birth to a son. Upon seeing his son for the first time, Uther vows to become a peaceful king and secure his kingdom for his son. Merlin, who has not been seen since the night Cornwall died, appears and takes the child, as per their agreement. Igrayne is distraught and as Merlin disappears into the forest, Uther tries to stop him but is attacked by knights still loyal to Cornwall.

This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The Hellenistic period of colonization differed from earlier periods of conquest in several ways. Firstly, Hellenistic colonization was marked by the establishment of Greek cities and kingdoms in diverse regions, including Asia, Africa, and Southwest Asia, whereas earlier colonization was primarily focused on the Mediterranean. Secondly, Hellenistic colonization involved the export of Greek culture and language to these new regions, leading to a fusion of Greek culture with local cultures. This contrasts with earlier Greek attitudes of superiority over \\"barbarian\\" cultures. Thirdly, the colonists in Hellenistic cities came from various parts of the Greek world, rather than a specific \\"mother city\\" as was the case in earlier periods. This resulted in the emergence of a common Attic-based dialect, Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca throughout the Hellenistic world.

The name \\"Jack the Ripper\\" originated in a letter written by someone claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax and may have been written by journalists in an attempt to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers' circulation.

(CNN) -- Cuba will pardon more than 2,900 prisoners, the government said Friday, though U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross is not among those who will be freed. The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter. Do you have any questions?","completion":"Alright, so here's what happened: In Cuba, the leader named Raul Castro said they will let more than 2,900 prisoners go home. They are doing this because their families, and some religious groups, asked for it and because it's a kind thing to do. They will let out people who are old, sick, or didn't do really bad things. But they won't let out people who did very bad things like spying and hurting others. However, an American man named Alan Gross won't be let out, even though he says he didn't do anything bad. The leader also said they are doing this nice thing because a special guest, Pope Benedict XVI, is coming to visit Cuba soon."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: A person can live a normal, healthy life with just one kidney.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this","completion":"The phrase \\"guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this\\" can be characterized as negative. To comprehend why this phrase reflects a negative sentiment, we first need to break it down and examine each component. The term \\"guilty\\" implies that an error or misdeed has been committed, typically associated with a sense of wrongness or fault. In this context, guilt is tied to the \\"worst sin.\\" The word \\"sin\\" suggests a behavior or act that goes against a moral philosophy or system of beliefs. When coupled with the adjective \\"worst,\\" this insinuates that the act is not only unacceptable but also represents the most egregious violation possible. The phrase \\"attributable to a movie like this\\" demonstrates a direct connection between the \\"worst sin\\" and the movie being discussed. By linking the two, the speaker or writer is pointing out an undesirable quality or element about the movie. Since the phrase emphasizes the gravity of the transgression, it offers a strong critique of the movie and intimates that the production has failed in a significant way. Considering the various elements of this phrase, it becomes clear that it conveys disapproval and criticism. Thus, the phrase can be regarded as negative, as it is used to express dissatisfaction and disappointment in relation to a movie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Upon finding out her email address we had a brief email exchange culminating in me sending her a list of potential questions for the interview. Claire quite liked a lot of the questions, but overall there were too many, so we proceeded to reduce the number of questions to six main questions. These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows: How would you define creativity? What does it mean to you to be an artist? Do you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy? Change and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography. You seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like “Dark Matter”, “Touching Infinity”, “We are made of Stars”, “Rising tides” and “A drop in the ocean” or “Alchemy”. Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences? What continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist? We both felt these questions addressed the initial topic of exploring creativity, explored why Claire became an artist, gives insight into Claire’s work and practise and looks toward the future of Claire’s practice. After refining the questions, we proceeded to organise a day to film, which will be on the 16th September. Hopefully if all goes well we will both have an artist portrait that lives up to our expectations. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is the interview being used for?

We achieve this by employing high levels of redundancy in the way we store our data and the key hardware components that are essential for smooth operations. To maintain the highest levels of reliability and prevent service interruptions, the following strategies have been implemented in our cloud infrastructure: 1. Data Redundancy: We utilize multiple levels of data redundancy to ensure that data remains accessible and secure even in the face of hardware failures. This includes: a. Replication: Data is continuously replicated across multiple storage devices and data centers. This ensures that the loss of any single device or data center will not result in the loss of any data. b. Backup: In addition to real-time replication, we also perform regular data backups. These backups are securely stored in geographically separated locations to further safeguard against data loss. 2. Hardware Redundancy: To minimize the chances of hardware failures causing service interruptions, we utilize redundant hardware components wherever possible. This includes: a. Servers: Our cloud infrastructure relies on clustered server configurations, with multiple servers operating in parallel. If a server experiences a failure, the remaining servers in the cluster can continue to handle requests without interruption. b. Networking: We deploy multiple network connections and pathways to ensure that traffic can continue to flow even if a network hardware component fails or becomes compromised. c. Power: Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) and backup generators are implemented in our data centers to ensure that power outages do not disrupt service. 3. Fault-tolerant Design: Our cloud infrastructure has been designed with fault tolerance in mind. This ensures that if a failure occurs within a component, the system can automatically recover and continue to function without manual intervention. a. Load balancing: We use advanced load balancing techniques to distribute traffic evenly among multiple servers. This not only enhances performance but also provides a level of redundancy, as the failure of a single server will not result in a loss of service. b. Automatic failover: In the event of a failure, our systems are designed to automatically detect and route around the issue, keeping your service running smoothly. 4. Monitoring and Maintenance: Regular monitoring and maintenance are performed by our skilled technicians to identify and address potential issues before they can escalate into larger problems. a. Monitoring: We have implemented continuous monitoring across our entire infrastructure to detect issues before they result in service interruptions or data losses. b. Maintenance: Routine maintenance tasks are performed to proactively address potential hardware, software, and network issues, ensuring our cloud remains highly available and reliable.

Is raise used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences? To raise Sandy Hook light. Raise the specter of unemployment.","completion":"I will analyze and compare the meanings of \\"raise\\" in these two sentences. Sentence 1: To raise Sandy Hook light. Step 1: Define \\"raise\\" in this context. In this sentence, \\"raise\\" likely means to elevate or lift something (Sandy Hook light) to a higher position. Step 2: Analyze the object being raised (Sandy Hook light). Sandy Hook light could refer to a lighthouse or a light situated in Sandy Hook, an area in the United States. In this context, raising the light would involve physically lifting it to a higher position, perhaps to increase its visibility or adjust its angle. Sentence 2: Raise the specter of unemployment. Step 1: Define \\"raise\\" in this context. In this sentence, \\"raise\\" has a metaphorical meaning. It means to bring up or introduce a topic, idea, or concern. Step 2: Analyze the object being raised (the specter of unemployment). The \\"specter of unemployment\\" is an abstract concept referring to the fear or concern of possible job loss in a certain context. Raising the specter of unemployment means discussing or drawing attention to potential unemployment problems or consequences. After analyzing these sentences, I conclude that the word \\"raise\\" is used differently in the two sentences. In the first sentence, it means to physically lift or elevate something, while in the second sentence, it implies bringing attention to or discussing a subject or concern."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Herb Jeffries (born Umberto Alexander Valentino; September 24, 1913 - May 25, 2014) was an African-American actor of film and television and popular music and jazz singer-songwriter, known of his baritone voice. He was of African descent and Hollywood's first singing black cowboy. In the 1940s and 1950s Jeffries recorded for a number of labels, including RCA Victor, Exclusive, Coral, Decca, Bethlehem, Columbia, Mercury and Trend. His album Jamaica, recorded by RKO, is a concept album of self-composed calypso songs. Touring the Deep South with Hines, Jeffries was struck by the realities of segregation, as the Orchestra's playing was restricted to tobacco warehouses and black-only movie theatres. Watching young boys fill theatres to watch the latest western, Jeffries resolved to create a cowboy hero geared specifically for such an audience. A self-confessed western buff who had grown up watching the silent escapades of Tom Mix and Jack Holt, in the 1930s Jeffries set out to produce a low-budget western with an all-black cast. Though the silent era had seen a number of films starring only black actors, they had all but disappeared with the economic downturn and the arrival of the talkies, which proved too expensive for many of the \\"white independents\\" funding such projects. Jeffries's ambition was to produce sound cinema's \\"first all-Negro musical western\\". To fund his project, Jeffries approached a veteran B-movie producer named Jed Buell. Jeffries, having obtained finances, wrote his own songs for the film and hired Spencer Williams to appear with him. When Buell wanted to know of a likely candidate for the lead role, Jeffries nominated himself. Having grown up partly on his grandfather's farm, he had all the requisite horse-riding and roping skills, beside a fine singing voice, but Buell expressed concerns; Jeffries, whose mother was of Irish descent, was \\"not black enough\\". Eventually they went ahead, using make-up to darken the leading man's skin tone. Jeffries made his debut as a crooning cowboy with Harlem on the Prairie, which was considered the first black western following the inauguration of the talkies and the first sound Western with an all-black cast. The movie was shot in 1937 over five days at N.B. Murray's Dude Ranch in Apple Valley, California, with Jeffries performing all his own stunts. Though critical reception was mixed, the film received a write-up in Time magazine and grossed 50,000 in its first 12 months. Playing a singing cowboy in low-budget films, Jeffries became known as the \\"Bronze Buckaroo\\" by his fans. In a time of American racial segregation, such \\"race movies\\" played mostly in theaters catering to African-American audiences. The films include Harlem on the Prairie, The Bronze Buckaroo, Harlem Rides the Range and Two-Gun Man from Harlem. Jeffries went on to star in another three musical westerns over the next two years. Jeffries starred as a singing cowboy, in several all-black Western films, in which he sang his own western compositions. In those films, Jeffries starred as cowboy Bob Blake, sang and performed his own stunts. Bob Blake was the good guy, with a thin mustache, who wore a white Stetson and rode a white horse named Stardusk. Jeffries went on to make other films, starring in the title film role of Calypso Joe co-starring Angie Dickinson in Calypso Joe (1957). In 1968, Jeffries appeared in the long-running western TV series The Virginian playing a gunslinger who intimidated the town. In the 1970s he appeared on episodes of I Dream of Jeannie and Hawaii Five-0. He later directed and produced Mundo depravados, a cult film starring his wife, Tempest Storm. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: when did his film career begin","completion":"Herb Jeffries' film career began in the 1930s when he set out to produce a low-budget western with an all-black cast.

The motif of deceptively realistic naturalism in art (aletheia) is reflected in stories such as that of the painter Zeuxis, who was said to have painted grapes that seemed so real that birds came and pecked at them. The female nude also became more popular as epitomized by the Aphrodite of Cnidos of Praxiteles and art in general became more erotic (e.g. Leda and the Swan and Scopa's Pothos). The dominant ideals of Hellenistic art were those of sensuality and passion.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In the context provided, \\"ethos\\" is not a language but rather a concept from Ancient Greek art and philosophy. In this context, ethos refers to the character, disposition, or moral nature of a person or group as depicted in artistic representation. The term \\"ethos\\" is derived from the Greek word \\"ἦθος,\\" which means character or disposition. During the Hellenistic period, art began to focus more on the portrayal of emotion (pathos) and character (ethos), with an emphasis on realistically capturing human nature.

Q:You are given a new situation: David is a biologist. He was in the African savanna to study different species. Especially, he was interested in two species, rhinos and impalas. He noticed that in response to constant human encroachment of wildlife habitats, impalas have acquired some behaviors that help them and their young. Rhinos also have acquired some behaviors in response to the same threat. But their behaviors mostly failed them in that aspect. and a hint : All of these animal behaviors are important. They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals’ fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection. Please answer this question : In which species the behaviors in question would make them more fit, rhino or impala? A:","completion":"The behaviors in question would make the impalas more fit. This is because the impalas have acquired behaviors that help them and their young survive in response to constant human encroachment of wildlife habitats.

Sheba eventually tells Steven that the affair is over. However, when she refuses to give in to Barbara's demands on her time, Barbara reveals the secret to a male teacher who tells her that he is attracted to Sheba and asks her to act as an intermediary.After the affair becomes public, Barbara and Sheba both lose their jobs. The school principal suspects that Barbara knew about the affair and did not notify the authorities; he also learned that a former teacher at the school had taken out a restraining order against Barbara for stalking her and her fiance. Sheba is thrown out of her home by her husband and moves into Barbara's house. Sheba is unaware that Barbara is the reason she was found out, believing the affair became known because Steven confessed it to his mother. When Sheba finds Barbara's diary and learns it was Barbara who leaked the story of the affair, she confronts Barbara and strikes her in anger. A row ensues, and Sheba runs outside with Barbara's journal to a crowd of reporters and photographers. When she becomes hemmed in by them, Barbara rescues her.

He rejects much of modern technology, not even carrying any identification such as a driver's license or draft card. He can't provide an address because he just sleeps wherever he finds a place. As Burns crosses a highway into a town in New Mexico, his horse Whiskey has a difficult time crossing the road, confused and scared by the traffic. They enter town to visit Jerry (Gena Rowlands). She is the wife of an old friend, Paul Bondi (Michael Kane), who has been jailed for giving aid to illegal immigrants. Jack explains his dislike for a society that restricts a man on where he can or can't go, what he can or can't do. To break Bondi out of jail, Burns decides he himself needs to get arrested. After a violent barroom fight against a one-armed man (Bill Raisch) in which he is forced to use only one arm himself, Burns is arrested. When the police decide to let him go, he deliberately punches a cop to get himself re-arrested. He is now facing a probable sentence of a year in jail, which allows him to see Bondi, with a purpose of helping him escape. The town is a sleepy border town and the cops are mostly bored, occasionally dealing with minor offenses. The Sheriff, Morey Johnson (Walter Matthau), has to compel them to pay attention to their duties at times. During the course of the story, the seemingly unrelated progress of a tractor-trailer truck carrying toilets, driven by Carroll O'Connor, is inter-cut with the principal events. Joining Bondi in jail, Burns tries to persuade him to escape. He tells Bondi he couldn't spend a year locked up because he'd probably kill someone.

The breakdown of glucose is a biochemical process that occurs in living organisms as a way to generate energy, while radioactive decay is a nuclear process occurring in unstable atomic nuclei. In the breakdown of glucose, living cells convert glucose molecules into energy by a series of chemical reactions. This process, called cellular respiration, generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which serves as an energy source for the cells. On the other hand, radioactive decay occurs when an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation, either in the form of alpha or beta particles. This process is unrelated to glucose metabolism and is governed by the properties of the unstable nuclei themselves, not by the availability of glucose. Therefore, the amount of glucose broken down has no effect on the occurrence of radioactive decay. Whether more, less, or the same amount of glucose is being broken down, the rate of radioactive decay remains independent and is dictated by the decay characteristics of the particular atomic nuclei involved."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Der Idee eines Verhaltenskodexes zur Regelung der Beziehungen zwischen der WTO und den Nichtregierungsorganisationen stimme ich voll und ganz zu. Translate this to English?","completion":"I fully agree with the idea of a code of conduct governing the relationship between the WTO and non-governmental organizations. The concept of establishing a code of conduct for regulating the relationships between the World Trade Organization (WTO) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is crucial in promoting cooperation and collaboration in international trade. By implementing a code of conduct, a set of principles and responsibilities can be introduced to guide and facilitate interactions between these organizations effectively. The code of conduct can include provisions that address transparency and openness in decision-making, ensuring that NGOs have access to relevant information and can participate in WTO processes. This would enable them to contribute their expertise and provide valuable input in shaping trade agreements. Moreover, the code of conduct should emphasize the importance of respect and mutual understanding between the WTO and NGOs. This can be achieved by fostering regular communication, sharing of information, and providing opportunities for dialogue. This will enable both parties to work towards common goals, learn from one another's experiences and adapt their approaches accordingly. Additionally, the code should outline guidelines for advocacy and lobbying activities, ensuring that NGOs can engage in meaningful discourse without compromising the integrity of the WTO's processes. This can involve setting rules and limits on how and when NGOs can submit their input during negotiations, as well as how they can solicit support for specific issues. The code of conduct could also cover conflict resolution mechanisms in case disputes arise between the WTO and NGOs. Having a transparent, fair, and impartial process for addressing disagreements can help to maintain trust and promote long-term working relationships. Furthermore, the code should include provisions for capacity building and education. This can involve facilitating training sessions, workshops, and seminars to help NGOs better understand the intricacies of global trade and the workings of the WTO, ultimately empowering them to play a more active role in advocating for policies that benefit a broader range of stakeholders. Lastly, the code should ensure that there is an ongoing process for monitoring and evaluating how well the code of conduct is adhered to by both the WTO and NGOs. This could involve regular reviews and, if necessary, revisions to the code to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness. In conclusion, a comprehensive code of conduct can contribute significantly to improving the relationship between the WTO and NGOs by establishing guidelines and expectations for both parties to follow. Through transparent communication and mutual respect, they can collaborate effectively and work towards a more sustainable, equitable, and inclusive global trade system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One of the platforms they've turned to is Groupon – a discount voucher platform for merchants. However, not all businesses have found success through this platform, with some even claiming Groupon's slow payment model has caused more harm than good. Among them is the owner of Back Alley Waffles, who has recently closed down the restaurant and offered an unconventional compensation plan for his loss. Step 1: Discuss the allegations against Groupon The story of Back Alley Waffles' closure has drawn attention, with the owner pointing fingers at Groupon for their slow payments model. Groupon offers a system where merchants receive payments in three installments, which potentially puts pressure on businesses to deliver services and products even before they receive full compensation. For businesses still striving to establish their footing, this arrangement can lead to significant stress on their finances. Step 2: Introduce the tongue-in-cheek 450 waffles idea In a defiant move, the restaurant owner has decided to offer tongue-in-cheek 450 waffles in an attempt to compensate for the loss of income caused by Groupon's slow payments. This unconventional approach is sure to grab public attention and drive home the message that the restaurant owner seeks to convey. Step 3: Mention the impact on other businesses Back Alley Waffles is not alone in feeling the pinch from Groupon's business model. Several other businesses have also reported concerns with the company's practices. While there have been success stories, the overall trend of businesses being hurt by the platform continues to persist, triggering questions on whether this model is sustainable in the long run. Step 4: Discuss Groupon's stock prices faltering Groupon's struggles have not gone unnoticed on the stock market. The company's stock prices have continued to falter, suggesting that investors and stakeholders are losing confidence in its performance. As businesses increasingly voice their concerns and dissatisfaction with Groupon, it is important for the company to reevaluate its practices and strategies in order to regain its momentum in the market. Conclusion: The story of Back Alley Waffles showcases the challenges some businesses face when partnering with platforms like Groupon. With the restaurant owner taking a bold step in offering 450 waffles to compensate for his losses, the situation highlights the need for businesses to carefully evaluate the platforms they engage with and the impact it can have on their finances. Groupon, too, must take a closer look at the concerns raised by these businesses and consider modifications to their model in order to ensure a better experience for both merchants and customers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: When the heart expels more blood with each stroke, the heart has to beat less often in order to maintain the same volume of blood flow. If someone has a smaller than average physical heart then it will beat more or less in order to pump blood? The answer is:","completion":"To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between heart size, stroke volume, and heart rate. We will go step-by-step to analyze the given situation and reach a conclusion. Step 1: Understand the concept of stroke volume Stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped by the heart with each beat. When the heart expels more blood with each stroke, it means that the stroke volume has increased. In such a case, it is mentioned that the heart has to beat less often to maintain the same volume of blood flow. Step 2: Understand the concept of heart rate Heart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute. A higher heart rate indicates that the heart is beating more frequently, and a lower heart rate indicates that it is beating less often. Step 3: Understand the relationship between heart size and stroke volume Generally, a larger physical heart may have a higher stroke volume because it can hold more blood per contraction. Conversely, a smaller physical heart may have a lower stroke volume due to its reduced capacity to hold blood. Step 4: Analyze the given situation In the given situation, someone has a smaller than average physical heart. Since a smaller heart generally has lower stroke volume, we need to determine the effect it has on the heart rate to maintain the same volume of blood flow. Step 5: Determine the effect on heart rate As per the question, if the heart expels more blood with each stroke (increased stroke volume), the heart has to beat less often (reduced heart rate) to maintain the same volume of blood flow. In the case of a smaller heart with lower stroke volume, to maintain the same volume of blood flow, the heart has to work in the opposite direction, meaning it has to beat more often (increased heart rate) to compensate for the decreased stroke volume. Conclusion: If someone has a smaller than average physical heart, it will beat more often in order to pump blood and maintain the same volume of blood flow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Sitting at a desk in a classroom all day can be pretty boring. The teachers at Ward Elementary in Winston -Salem,North Carolina ,picked up on that and traded in their students' desks for exercise bikes as a part of their Read and Ride program! The Read and Ride program began five years ago.One classroom has enough bikes for every student in any given class,and throughout the day teachers bring in their students to the room to ride them and read their books. Even regular classrooms have one bike in the back of each room for students who just can't sit still to use to help them burn energy in a good way. Students love being more active! Teachers enjoy seeing students eager to read.Parents appreciate stronger,smarter children.Headmasters value this effective and cost-free program.\\"Riding exercise bikes makes reading fun for many kids who get frustrated when they read.Thus,they have a way to release that frustration while they ride,\\"said Scott Ertl,who started the program.\\"As we can see,everyone wants to promote literacy and lose weight! But many students who are overweight struggle with sports and activities since they don't want to always be the last or lose with others watching on the playground.On exercise bikes,however,students are able to exert themselves at their own level--without anyone noticing when they slow down or take a break.\\" As it turns out,not only are the bikes helping the students burn calories,they're also helping them learn better and stay focused.At the end of the school year the school analyzed testing data and found that students that spent more time reading and riding did more than twice as well on reading tests than their fellow students who spent the least time in the program. Question: According to Scott Ertl,riding exercise bikes _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"call benefit overweight students in both ways\\"? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, according to Scott Ertl, riding exercise bikes can indeed benefit overweight students in both ways. His statement in the article emphasizes that the Read and Ride program not only helps promote literacy and a love for reading among students, but also serves as a medium for physical exertion that can combat issues with weight, particularly for overweight students. He highlights that these students often face challenges when it comes to traditional sports and activities, due to fear of judgment or embarrassment, asserting that they dislike being the last or losing while others watch on the playground. The exercise bikes, however, offer them the opportunity to exert themselves at their own level without experiencing such pressures. They can slow down, take a break, or push themselves as hard as they want without any fear of others observing their performance. Ertl associates exercise bikes with making reading fun for kids who often get frustrated while reading, thereby implying that physical activity can trigger a positive emotional response. This positive experience, in turn, can possibly alleviate the pressures or frustrations that overweight kids might feel in other areas of their school life, contributing to their overall well-being. In conclusion, yes, according to Scott Ertl's statements, riding exercise bikes can benefit overweight students in two ways: It can improve their reading abilities and literacy, and at the same time, it can aid with weight issues by enabling them to exert physical effort in a comfortable and personal environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Passage: In a game that various analysts considered a potential Super Bowl XLVII preview, the 7-1 Bears faced the also 7-1 Houston Texans on Sunday Night Football, in a game waged in the rain. The first half proved disastrous for Chicago, as Kellen Davis had the ball stripped by former Bear Danieal Manning, and recovered by Texans linebacker Tim Dobbins. Shayne Graham later kicked a 20-yard field goal to give Houston the first points of the game. On Chicago's next possession, Michael Bush fumbled, and the Texans recovered again. The Texans drive wouldn't last long, as Tim Jennings would intercept Matt Schaub. However, the Bears failed to take advantage of the turnover, as Jay Cutler's pass would get intercepted by Manning. A quarter later, Jennings once again intercepted Schaub, which set up a Robbie Gould 51-yard field goal. Later in the quarter, Justin Forsett broke a 25-yard run to the Bears 3-yard line, which set up Arian Foster's 2-yard touchdown catch. Late in the first half, Cutler was hit by Dobbins, giving him a concussion, which sidelined him for the rest of the game, and was replaced by Jason Campbell. With less than two minutes left in the third quarter, Gould hit a 24-yard field goal to draw the Bears within four points, but Graham would make a 42-yarder to increase the deficit to seven with less than five minutes left in the game. Gould had attempted a 48-yard field goal earlier in the fourth quarter, but the ball hit the left upright. The loss snapped Chicago's six-game winning streak, the longest since their seven-game streak in 2006, and dropped Chicago to a 7-2 record, and 0-3 all-time against the Texans.

In a world where information is plentiful and abundant, traders are always trying to make money by finding that hidden advantage. Many are betting that 140 characters is all it takes to beat the market. Some professionals in the world of high finance are relying on Twitter and other social media to try to get the edge on the competition. Markets went into a spin last year when someone hacked the AP's Twitter account and sent bogus tweets about an explosion at the White House, showing just how powerful a sentence can be when millions of dollars are put behind it. Twitter has transformed communication across a host of industries, but many industries remain straightforward in how they use it. Especially in the world of commodities. In Chicago, traders trade futures contracts in every kind of product, from corn to pork belly to orange juice concentrate futures. Essentially, they are making bets on the demand and supply of these items at a later date. Every extra speck of information can make the difference. Some traders expressly follow farmers across the American Midwest and try to get a sense of how much soybean or maize is coming in this year's crop. Others actively engage with the people that make the products they trade, looking for that edge, directly tweeting farmers for information on what weather they are having and what crops they are growing. But others are using Twitter to in more innovative ways to stay ahead of the pack. \\"Our systems can analyze and determine a Tweet in less than a second from the moment a person tweets,\\" says Paul Hawtin, the founder of the investment management firm Cayman Atlantic. \\"Analyzing untapped and unstructured data sets such as Twitter gives us a distinct advantage over other investment managers.\\" Hawtin has been working on a fund based exclusively on using sentiment analysis of Twitter for years, analyzing tweets for relevance and for positive and negative sentiment to base its trades on. His first fund was in July 2010, when the U.S. debt stand-off caused huge turmoil in the financial markets and forced the 25 million fund to close after just a month. Hawtin is launching his second try at such a fund later this year. \\"We're in the process of raising Â£5 million (8.3 million) for the new fund and we've secured Â£1.5 million so far,\\" he says. If his first fund had taken off, Cayman Atlantic's simulated real-time account showed that it would have returned 23.8% last year -- impressive, but not as good as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which returned 26.5% over the same period. For Hawtin, the benefits of going Twitter-only are obvious. \\"Breaking news, information trends and global events hit the Twitter network before anywhere else,\\" he says. Twitter appears to be a special case. They have tried to feed in data from Facebook and Bit.ly, the URL shortener, but to no avail. \\"When people tweet they tend to be talking about real-world events as opposed to Facebook which is more personal and relevant only to friends and family.\\" Others are trying to turn the world of trading into the new Twitter. Yoni Assia founded eToro in 2007 as a social network for investing and sees it as democratizing the space. \\"It's about opening the global market and investing and trading in a transparent way,\\" he says. \\"When you're using Facebook or Twitter, it's about social signals. So not all your friends are ones whose financial investments you really want to copy.\\" His network allows anyone to trade both virtual and real money, connect with one other and compare investment bets -- and copy the trading strategies of others. EToro, which is not yet available in the U.S. because of regulatory hurdles, has 3.5 million registered users, of which most are using virtual money. About 300,000 are trading with their own cash on the site. It's Facebook-meets-fantasy football for wannabe day traders. Assia thinks we're at the start of a change in how we invest, one that will transform trading decisions to ones not just based off reactions to real-world events or mathematical modelling, but one based on the analysis of social media as well. \\"I think in the future you'll have not just fundamental and technical analysis, but social analysis,\\" he says. Hawtin, the founder of the Cayman Islands-based hedge fund, concurs. \\"We're in the middle of a data explosion,\\" he says. \\"Trend-following has been a successful trading strategy for over a century and that forms the core of our investment process. What makes us different from any other trend-following hedge fund is the data we use.\\" With billions to be made, Twitter and social media may end up being one of the democratizing forces in the world of finance.

The reviewer specifically mentions that they enjoyed the movie and found it to be suspenseful with unexpected twists. They praise the performance of the lead actor, Brad Rowe, and state that the production was professionally made, which counters some negative opinions mentioned in other reviews. Since the reviewer emphasizes the positive aspects of the movie, such as its suspense, thrillers, and unexpected twists, it could be inferred that if someone enjoys these aspects in a movie, they might be more inclined to give this product a try. It is crucial to take into account multiple reviews when making product decisions, as tastes and opinions can vary greatly. In this case, it is essential to weigh the positives mentioned in this review against any negatives mentioned in other reviews. One helpful tip could be to look for patterns in the reviews – if a particular positive or negative aspect is mentioned in several reviews, it can be assumed to be more reliable. Additionally, while the positive review of the movie generates interest, the role of a viewer's preferences cannot be dismissed. If someone prefers action movies or comedies, for example, this review, highlighting suspense and thriller aspects, might not persuade them to watch this movie. In conclusion, this review would likely increase the chances of purchasing the product, but individual preferences and other reviews should also be considered to make a well-informed decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Child care programs help us work towards the future of our children, and right from the time they are born until they graduate. It is our job to look for the best educational programs. One of the most important things of a good child care program or child day care is the teacher to child ratio . It means that every student needs a certain amount of attention in order to grow and learn correctly. It's for this reason that small-sized class in schools are leading to bigger and better opportunities. With smaller classes, each student is given personal attention when it comes to their class work, their personal health and their mental growth. When there are too many children in a class, individuals get lost in the crowd. They always couldn't get enough attention. When it comes to the educational result, they don't learn well because some are afraid to ask questions in front of so many people. Others become lazy for not having been attended by the teacher. Some schools are overcrowded these days. Most children don't even get their basic educational work done in schools. How is one expected to grow into a successful , healthy adult if the basics are not done? For these and several other reasons, schools with small class sizes are turning out to be very good for children. Diana Autumn is Director of Anne Sullivan School.

It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices. - Country pop is a subgenre of country music and pop music that was developed by members of the Country genre out of a desire to reach a larger, mainstream audience. By producing country songs that employed many styles and sounds found in pop music, the country music industry was effective in gaining new listeners without alienating its traditional country audience. It is a continuation of similar efforts that began in the late 1950s originally known as Nashville sound and later on Countrypolitan. By the mid-1970s, many country artists were transitioning to the pop-country sound which led to some records charting high on mainstream top 40 as well as country \\"Billboard\\" charts. - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan. - I 'm Leaving It All Up to You is the debut album by Donny & Marie Osmond , released in 1974 .

Osmond has also been a talk and game show host, record producer and author. In the mid-1960s, he and four of his elder brothers gained fame as the Osmonds. Osmond went solo in the early 1970s, covering such hits as \\"Go Away Little Girl\\" and \\"Puppy Love\\". - A doll is a model of a human being, often used as a toy for children. Dolls have traditionally been used in magic and religious rituals throughout the world, and traditional dolls made of materials such as clay and wood are found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe. The earliest documented dolls go back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome. The use of dolls as toys was documented in Greece around 100 AD. They have been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art. Modern doll manufacturing has its roots in Germany, going back to the 15th century. With industrialization and new materials such as porcelain and plastic, dolls were increasingly mass-produced. During the 20th century, dolls became increasingly popular as collectibles. - Olive Marie Osmond (born October 13, 1959) is an American singer, actress, doll designer, and a member of the show business family the Osmonds. Although she was never part of her family's singing group, she gained success as a solo country music artist in the 1970s and 1980s.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink.

The Osmonds are devout members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and their religious values have influenced their careers. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats.

Answer the following question. Which Italian had Beethoven, Liszt and Schubert as pupils?","completion":"The Italian composer, conductor, and music teacher who had the great fortune of having famed musicians such as Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Liszt, and Franz Schubert as his pupils was Antonio Salieri. Born on August 18, 1750, in Legnago, Italy, Salieri went on to become one of the most influential musicians of his time, leaving a profound impact on the world of classical music. Antonio Salieri moved to Vienna in his early teenage years and studied under the instruction of well-known composer and conductor Christoph Willibald Gluck. Salieri's remarkable talents were evident from an early age, and his name began to spread throughout Europe as he gained recognition for his composition skills and incredible operas. As Kapellmeister (music director) of the Habsburg court, Salieri held one of the most prestigious musical posts in Europe from 1788 to 1824. Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, and Franz Liszt were highly esteemed composers in their own right who, at various stages, were under Salieri's tutelage. Beethoven, while primarily trained by Joseph Haydn, received specific training in vocal composition from Salieri. It is known that they maintained a cordial relationship, and Beethoven even dedicated one of his violin sonatas to Salieri. Franz Schubert studied with Salieri as a young boy when he was a member of the Imperial Court Chapel choir in Vienna. Salieri took a keen interest in Schubert, teaching him composition techniques and fostering his talent. Schubert, in his letters, expressed gratitude and admiration for Salieri, stating that his guidance was invaluable in his development as a composer. Franz Liszt, a prominent pianist, and composer received lessons from Salieri at a very young age in Vienna. While Liszt's time with Salieri was brief, it helped lay the foundation for his meteoric rise as a virtuoso and later as a composer. Antonio Salieri's contributions to the world of music go beyond his extraordinary skill as a composer. His passion for teaching and the encouragement he provided to the next generation of musical geniuses is a testament to his impact on the classical music landscape. Salieri's guidance played a critical role in molding the talents of Beethoven, Schubert, and Liszt, each of whom went on to create some of the most iconic and well-regarded musical works in history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A DSE file is a specific format that might require a dedicated software application to open and interact with its content. Windows has built-in intelligence to associate file types, identified by their extensions, to corresponding software applications installed on the user's computer. This capability allows users to easily open files without having to manually search and select an appropriate program each time they want to access a file with a particular extension. When a user double-clicks a file with a known extension, Windows will automatically launch the default program associated with that file type. This eliminates the need for the user to manually locate and open the software before loading the file. The intelligent association system in Windows is beneficial because it saves users time and effort while enhancing the overall user experience. However, it is also worth noting that not all file formats or extensions may be correctly associated with a software application by default.

How to upgrade the birthday candle tradition Make or buy a cupcake for the birthday person. Hold the actual cake aside and put candles on one (or more) cupcakes. Let the celebrant blow away.","completion":"The evolution and transformation of the traditional birthday candle ritual can be viewed from several angles; it's not just about changing the cake for a cupcake, but also about constructing a more unique, personalized, and exciting experience for the birthday celebrant. By placing the candles on a cupcake or cupcakes, the birthday person now has a separate special cake just for them, which brings a novel excitement to this time-honored tradition. First and foremost, one of the main reasons to switch to a cupcake for the birthday candle-blowing tradition is accessibility. Cupcakes are easy to make or buy and come in a variety of flavors, catering to the specific tastes of the birthday person. Ingredients for cupcakes are readily available and they can be baked in a short amount of time. For those not into baking, numerous bakeries and grocery stores sell cupcakes in an assortment of sizes and flavors. Secondly, the cupcake idea enables the birthday candles to be the centerpiece of the celebration. Instead of being just a part of the large cake, the candles now have their unique and significant platform on the cupcake. This change allows for the birthday candle-blowing tradition to exist independently from the actual birthday cake cutting ceremony. The birthday celebrant gets to make a wish and blow out the candles on their cupcake, which is then followed by the cutting of the birthday cake for everyone to enjoy. The trend of putting birthday candles on cupcakes provides an interesting embellishment to the decoration process. This can range from employing a simple single cupcake with one candle serving as the \\"birthday cake, \\"or a more extravagant display comprising multiple cupcakes each having a candle. This allows the celebrant to blow out candles in a variety of ways, adding more fun and entertainment to the celebration. This upgraded tradition also offers a hygiene benefit. When the birthday person blows out the candles on their cupcake, they prevent spreading germs over the communal cake. In the post-pandemic world, as people become more health-conscious, this upgrade provides a practical and sanitary solution to the tradition. Additionally, having a separate cupcake for the candle blowing makes for a memorable and personalized experience. The birthday person can choose their preferred flavor for the cupcake and make a dedicated wish while blowing out the candles. This also helps in creating wonderful photo opportunities as blowing out candles is always a highlight of any birthday party. In conclusion, trading the traditional birthday cake for a cupcake or cupcakes to carry the candles not only upholds the spirit of the candle-blowing tradition but also offers a new fun-filled and engaging way to celebrate the birthday. The freedom to customize, convenience, and the hygienic aspect of this practice makes it a great upgrade to the timeless birthday candle ritual. Whether the celebrant is a kid or an adult, putting candles on cupcakes paves the way for a great start to a fantastic year ahead. As the birthday person blows away, their friends and family are ready to join in the festivities for a memorable celebration. So next time you plan a birthday, consider the cupcake with candles idea. It rejuvenates the traditional birthday candle blowing and revolutionizes the way we celebrate this special day in our lives. With this upgrade, every birthday becomes a unique, customized, and exciting celebration that everyone looks forward to."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

News article: What Are Startups Afraid of? The Answers Say a Lot About Tech Y Combinator, which helped incubate Airbnb Inc. and Instacart Inc., has a reputation for having an application process that’s more exclusive than Harvard University’s. About 6,000 aspiring startups applied to the Silicon Valley business incubator’s summer 2016 class in hopes of being one of the 107 or so to receive a 120,000 investment and access to the group’s well-connected investors and executives. Beneath the techie buzzwords and fanciful projections, the applications provide a unique view into the rapidly changing technology scene from the perspective of up-and-comers. Online marketing and data firm Priceonomics recently analyzed eight years of Y Combinator submissions. The results give a snapshot of industry trends and entrepreneurs’ views of who’s hot and who’s not in tech. Y Combinator asks applicants to list their competitors. Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. dominate the responses, but Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb are gaining quickly. Their names were mentioned more than half as many times as Google’s in 2016, according to the Priceonomics analysis. Uber, a ride-hailing company that’s established itself as a Valley golden child with a valuation of 62.5 billion, was mentioned in 2.6 percent of applications this year. Slack Technologies Inc., a messaging app for businesses, has seen a significant uptick in mentions. Bloomberg Beta, the venture capital arm of Bloomberg LP, is an investor in Slack. Willett Advisors, the investment arm for the personal and philanthropic assets of Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg LP, invests in Y Combinator startups. Facebook’s Instagram is a perennial threat on startups’ radar. But WhatsApp, which Facebook spent far more to acquire in a 22 billion deal, has plateaued in the eyes of Y Combinator hopefuls. Snapchat Inc., another messaging app Facebook has targeted, was on a similar trajectory in the last year. For Dropbox Inc., the hype cycle has been winding down for the last few years. After leading a list of five highly valued private companies in 2012, Dropbox’s presence in Y Combinator submissions has been on a steady decline since 2013, according to the Priceonomics study. Dropbox’s drop coincides with concerns expressed by the company’s own investors, several of which have repeatedly written down the value of their stakes. However, Dropbox, which makes money by charging users for more cloud storage space, is well-positioned for another trend: the rise of subscription-based software businesses. Y Combinator applicants have increased references to so-called software-as-a-service revenue models by 400 percent since 2008. Meanwhile, advertising is falling out of vogue. The shift highlights a rush toward sustainable, more predictable businesses as venture capitalists begin to prioritize revenue over user growth. Startups are staying private longer -- no tech company went public last quarter -- leaving VCs concerned they’ll have to invest more over longer periods of time to keep startups afloat.

Question: Background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted. Paragraph: Kat and Joe were into vegetable gardening. Joe started the no-till gardening method, while Kat applied conventional gardening methods. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which gardener had plants with more underground rot? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information, Joe, who used the no-till gardening method, is more likely to have plants with more underground rot.

News article: NASA's James Webb Space Telescope Survives Funding Battle When last we heard about the James Webb Space Telescope, the souped-up, long-planned successor to the Hubble, the news was not good. Hard on the heels of a report blasting the Webb project for being badly behind schedule and over budget, a House committee voted to axe the partially completed telescope entirely. Even a space nut could appreciate where they were coming from: originally envisioned in the 1990s as a monster scope 26 ft. (8 m) across, with more than 17 times the light-gathering power of the Hubble, the Webb was going to cost no more than 500 million and launch by 2007  cross NASA's heart and hope to die! No one really bought that, but no one really expected the budget to swell to 2.6 billion and then to 6.2 billion, or the launch date to slip to 2015 and then 2018 either. When all that did happen, D.C. bean counters concluded that nothing would become the Webb project quite as much as the end of it. (See photos of West Virginia's Green Bank Radio Telescope.) Fortunately for science, though, the rumors of the project's death were greatly exaggerated. Congress ended up funding the Webb after all, and in a telephone call the other day, Scott Willoughby, the Webb program manager at Northrop Grumman (the contractor that's building the telescope for NASA), reported that the slow, meticulous process of building the most powerful stargazing instrument in history is moving steadily ahead. \\"In terms of the things we said we'd accomplish by now,\\" he says, \\"we're on track, and in some areas, we're actually ahead of schedule.\\" The most significant of these milestones, says Willoughby: \\"We've completed  and that's a big word  all 18 segments of the primary mirror, which have been in production for seven or eight years now.\\" Unlike the Hubble's big light-gathering mirror, the Webb's can't be made in one piece. That's because no rocket exists that can hold something so wide. Instead, the mirrors, made of beryllium metal with a microscopically thin coating of gold, will unfurl in space like flower petals to reach their full size. Back in December, the gold was applied, and the mirrors were being readied for testing in a cryogenic test chamber at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. That test is a critical one since engineers need to know the material can survive the frigid conditions in deep space. (See TIME's graphics \\"The World's Largest Radio Telescope.\\") For the Webb, cold isn't just an obstacle: it's a necessity if the telescope is going to work. Astronomers have learned that many of the biggest unanswered questions of their field  How and when did the very first stars appear? How were the galaxies assembled from those stars? How do planets form? Does the chemistry of distant planets' atmospheres suggest the existence of life?  are best answered by looking in infrared, not visible light. To detect the faint glow of infrared, a telescope works best if it's as cold as possible, so that heat from the telescope itself doesn't contaminate the signal. In space, that's no problem. It isn't, anyway, if the telescope can be shielded from the heat of the sun  and even from the faint heat given off by the earth. To accomplish that, the Webb will sit atop a sunshield, about the size of a tennis court. The shield, which always stays between the Webb on one side and the sun, moon and earth on the other, is made of five layers, separated by a bit of empty space for extra cooling. (See \\"Giant Eye Will Peer at the Sky.\\") Given that it's even bigger than the telescope itself, the sunshade will have to unfold in space as well. So the entire assembly  telescope, mirrors, sunshade and scientific instruments  will be unfolded on the ground for testing, and that will happen more than once. \\"We'll deploy each component several times as we assemble,\\" says Willoughby, \\"and then the entire observatory will be stowed and deployed.\\" It will also be shaken to simulate the rigors of launch, in a chamber originally built to test the Apollo spacecraft. \\"Deploy, shake, deploy,\\" says Willoughby. \\"This is space. It has to work the first time.\\" That's all the more true because while the Hubble zips along just 300 miles (483 km) above the earth's surface, the Webb will sit closer to a million miles (1.6 million km) away, at a spot known as Lagrange Point 2, or L2. From that stable spot, where the gravity of the earth, moon and sun effectively cancel one another out, the three bodies also remain in the same direction relative to the telescope all the time, making the sunshield's cooling job easier. Simplicity and reliability are essential, because unlike the Hubble, the Webb will hardly be within reach of any astronaut repair crews. Assuming the next six years go smoothly, the Webb telescope will undoubtedly revolutionize astronomy when it goes up in 2018. It is, however, a mixed blessing: the mission's voracious appetite for money has sucked funding from other space-science projects, and NASA is expected to announce more cuts as early as this week. Once those spectacular images start rolling in, though, it will be hard to argue that the James Webb Space Telescope was ever worth canceling. See photos of the Hubble Space Telescope through its history. See TIME's video \\"Herschel: The Telescope for Invisible Stars.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1. The James Webb Space Telescope, originally facing budget cuts and cancellation, has ultimately survived funding battles and is moving forward with its construction. 2. The telescope's 18-segment primary mirror has been completed, a significant milestone. 3. The Webb telescope is designed to answer major questions in astronomy by observing the universe in infrared, as opposed to visible light. 4. To function correctly, the telescope needs to be kept very cold and shielded from the sun using a sunshield the size of a tennis court. 5. The telescope will be positioned at Lagrange Point 2 (L2), almost a million miles from Earth, to maintain a consistent orientation relative to the Earth, moon, and sun. 6. The planned launch date for the telescope is 2018, and once operational, it's expected to revolutionize astronomy; however, its budget might affect funding for other space-science projects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet.

A police force making cuts of £50million is using unqualified detectives to investigate serious crimes because of a 'critical' shortage of staff. A whistleblower said officers had been moved into the Criminal Investigation Department in Brighton, West Sussex - which deals with murders and rapes - without taking compulsory detective exams. Sussex Police has now admitted officers had to be moved into Brighton CID 'temporarily' to keep up the numbers, prompting a warning from the county's Police Commissioner. Shortage: Police in Brighton (pictured) admitted they were facing what they called 'challenging times' The whistleblower reported his concerns to local newspaper the Brighton Argus. He added: 'Officers are having to be drafted in from other departments with almost no notice and with many of these officers not even having passed the detectives exam - a national requirement - and with little or no additional training to prepare them for dealing with the serious crimes investigated by","completion":"CID. This clearly compromises the quality and effectiveness of the investigations being conducted.' In response to the whistleblower's claims, Sussex Police acknowledged that the force has been facing financial challenges and personnel shortages, which have led to the necessity of reallocating officers from other departments to Brighton CID. The force stated that these moves were intended to be temporary measures, but it was vital to maintain an adequate workforce to investigate serious crimes, such as murder and rape, in the area. The Police Commissioner for Sussex expressed concern over the situation, stating that proper training and qualifications for detectives should not be compromised, as it is essential for the thorough and efficient investigation of serious crimes. He urged the force to take immediate steps to address the staffing shortages and ensure that all officers within CID have the appropriate training and qualifications. Furthermore, the Police Commissioner called for a review of the current budget and resource allocation, to determine whether additional funding could be made available to help address the ongoing issues facing the force. He emphasized the importance of maintaining public confidence in the police and their ability to carry out their duties effectively, especially when handling sensitive and high-profile cases. The Brighton Argus, having received the whistleblower's report, has since published an exposé on the issue, raising awareness among the local community about the challenges their police force is experiencing. In response, some residents have expressed their concern and urged local authorities to take immediate action in addressing the crisis. As the debate around the budget cuts and staffing shortages continues, it is clear that the situation within Sussex Police is not an isolated problem. Police forces throughout the UK are grappling with similar issues, and many are calling for a reassessment of the resources and funding allocated to law enforcement agencies to ensure they can effectively protect their communities and prevent crime."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Goals in either half from Tony Andreu - a sensational volley - and Thomas Mikkelsen eclipsed Rory Loy's strike. The Buddies had created the better first-half chances and also had spells of dominance in the second period. It was the Tannadice club's first victory in the tournament, which features clubs from the Championship, League One and League Two. And this year's competition also included Premiership colt teams and sides from Northern Ireland and Wales. Chance after chance fell St Mirren's way in the Lanarkshire sunshine on a pristine pitch in front of 8,089 spectators. Loy hit the post, Lewis Morgan produced a wonderful breakaway from the United centre-halves, drew Cammy Bell and then shot across goal and Gary MacKenzie sent a header past the post when he was totally unmarked. United had hardly threatened Billy O'Brien until Andreu produced a diamond of a goal which flew past the Paisley goalkeeper, a first-time curling volley with the outside of his boot. It was a goal worthy of winning a cup, but it actually only gave United the lead for seconds. From the restart, Jack Ross' side went up the park and Gary Irvine cut back for Loy to equalise. Tangerines manager Ray McKinnon's fury at his team's inability to stay switched on was clear, but there was no doubt that St Mirren, still anchored at the bottom of the Championship, had been the better team. Nick van der Velden was replaced with less than an hour gone by Mikkelsen and his introduction would change the game. Simon Murray whipped in a cross from the left and the substitute met it with a powerful header beyond O'Brien. It was against the run of play, but goals win cups and Mikkelsen's effort had the scent of glory all over it. The quality of the game was never the same in the second half, but that seemed to suit McKinnon and his team simply saw out the last minutes, nursing their lead over the finishing line. They will now hope to follow their cup triumph with promotion to the Premiership, with the Tangerines currently in the play-off positions. Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon told BBC Alba: \\"I'm absolutely delighted. It was a tough game and a lot of pressure on us, but I thought the guys delivered. \\"There has been a bit of criticism our way, probably self-inflicted. \\"We have got ourselves caught in battles and the message today was to get the ball down and play - and I think they did that. \\"A lot of credit must go to St Mirren - they made it very difficult for us. \\"But we have won a cup, we have had the experience of dealing with the final and the pressure that goes with it. \\"So that will be good for me and the players for the rest of the season. They should take a lot of confidence from this.\\" St Mirren manager Jack Ross told BBC Alba: \\"It was a very evenly contested, competitive match and I thought we had the better opportunities. \\"But congratulations to Dundee United, it is about taking your chances on the day. \\"I can't fault my players - the effort was terrific. We continued to play in the manner we have done and the level of performance was very much at what it has been. \\"Despite our league position, this is a good group and we will use this to continue to move forward. \\"We have a real focus about us and they know their performance level deserved more.\\" Summary:","completion":"Dundee United claimed their first victory in the Scottish Challenge Cup, defeating St Mirren 2-1, with goals from Tony Andreu and Thomas Mikkelsen overshadowing Rory Loy's efforts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

See options at the end Paint at the hardware store was purchased by Nelson from Randy because Choose your answer from: [I] Nelson is a salesman.; [II] Randy is a salesman.;","completion":"Randy is a salesman. [II] The sentence ends with \\"Randy is a salesman\\" because, in the given context, it is suggested that Nelson and Randy are engaged in a negotiation, whereas Randy is in the position of selling paint to Nelson. Here's a detailed analysis of the sentence structure and the roles of the individuals involved: Firstly, the sentence gives us certain essential information about the situation: Nelson has purchased paint at a hardware store, and Randy is the other person involved in that transaction. Based on this information, let's examine each answer option: Option I - Nelson is a salesman: This option does not fit logically with the given information available in the sentence, as it states that Nelson is a salesman. However, according to the sentence, Nelson is the one who purchased the paint, and it is highly unlikely that a salesman would be buying products from his own shop. Furthermore, this option does not reveal anything about Randy's role in the scenario, and the sentence maintains some ambiguity about his involvement. Option II - Randy is a salesman: This option aligns with the context provided in the sentence. Here, Nelson has purchased paint from a hardware store, and Randy is the one who has just sold it to him. With this option, the sentence makes sense, as it conveys that Nelson approached the hardware store to buy paint, and Randy, being a salesman at the store, assisted him during the transaction by offering the product he needed. Additionally, this option clarifies the nature of Randy's role in the situation, eliminating any ambiguity or confusion. To sum it up, the sentence should end with \\"Randy is a salesman\\" as it is a more coherent and logical conclusion based on the given context. The complete sentence would be: \\"Paint at the hardware store was purchased by Nelson from Randy because Randy is a salesman.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Fax (short for facsimile), sometimes called telecopying or telefax (the latter short for telefacsimile), is the telephonic transmission of scanned printed material (both text and images), normally to a telephone number connected to a printer or other output device. The original document is scanned with a fax machine (or a telecopier), which processes the contents (text or images) as a single fixed graphic image, converting it into a bitmap, and then transmitting it through the telephone system in the form of audio-frequency tones. The receiving fax machine interprets the tones and reconstructs the image, printing a paper copy. Early systems used direct conversions of image darkness to audio tone in a continuous or analog manner. Since the 1980s, most machines modulate the transmitted audio frequencies using a digital representation of the page which is compressed to quickly transmit areas which are all-white or all-black. Scottish inventor Alexander Bain worked on chemical mechanical fax type devices and in 1846 was able to reproduce graphic signs in laboratory experiments. He received British patent 9745 on May 27, 1843 for his \\"Electric Printing Telegraph.\\" Frederick Bakewell made several improvements on Bain's design and demonstrated a telefax machine.

I read this background article the other day: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.

Question: Who wanted to kill Jerry? Movie title: The Mexican Movie plot: The story follows Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt) as he travels through Mexico to find a valuable antique gun, The Mexican, and smuggle it into the United States. Five years earlier, Welbach had caused a traffic accident in which he hit the car of local mobster Arnold Margolese (Gene Hackman), who was jailed for five years after the police searched his car following the crash, finding someone tied up in his trunk. In compensation for the jail time, Welbach has been sent on various errands by Margolese's prickly second-in-command, Bernie Nayman (Bob Balaban). Retrieving the gun will be his final errand. Welbach has a girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts), with whom he argues constantly and who leaves Jerry prior to the trip over his lack of commitment to their relationship. Jerry arrives in Mexico and makes his way to pick up Beck (David Krumholtz), the Margolese employee now in possession of the gun. There, a drunken Beck tells Jerry about the gun's history as a suicide weapon used as part of a jilted love-triangle between a woman, a nobleman, and the son of the gunsmith who forged the weapon, as well as its curse to misfire. Jerry helps Beck to his car, only for the man to be killed by celebratory gunfire from a nearby festival. Panicked but determined, Jerry buries the body and then calls Bernie to report on the situation, only for his vehicle to be stolen while he makes the call, the gun still inside. Jerry briefly has an uncooperative donkey as transportation to follow the thief, then buys an old, damaged truck. Meanwhile, Samantha gets kidnapped by a hit man named Leroy (James Gandolfini), who tells her that Jerry hired him to make sure she is safe from anybody that wants her dead. It is then revealed that Leroy is gay, which doesn't bother Samantha. They pick up a postal worker named Frank (Michael Cerveris), who then has a relationship with Leroy.

What countries has Canada defeated in war? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"To answer your question, I will provide a general analysis without going deep into the military capabilities of individual countries. This analysis will consider the military aspects, geopolitical factors, and historical context of the question in order to reach a justified conclusion. Step 1: Assessing Canada's military capabilities First, it's important to note that Canada has the 14th strongest military in the world, according to Global Firepower, with significant resources including highly trained personnel, advanced technology, and access to NATO allies. Step 2: Identifying historical context and precedence Canada has participated in various wars and conflicts in the past, such as the World Wars, the Korean War, and various peacekeeping missions under the United Nations. Throughout its military history, Canada has demonstrated its capability to successfully engage in warfare, usually as a part of coalition forces. Step 3: Considering geopolitical factors Engaging in warfare requires significant consideration of the potential political and diplomatic consequences. Alliances and international relations play a major role in determining which countries Canada could engage in a conflict with. For example, as a member of NATO, Canada is unlikely to engage any NATO nation in a war and would more likely cooperate with these countries as allies instead. Step 4: Analyzing potential opponents It is challenging to provide an exhaustive list of countries that Canada could defeat in a war, as this depends on the specific circumstances and conditions of the conflict. However, it would be reasonable to say that Canada has a higher military capability compared to many smaller nations, which suggests that, in a hypothetical conflict, Canada could likely emerge victorious against countries with considerably smaller and less advanced militaries. To answer your second question, the countries Canada has defeated in war are primarily Germany during both World War I and II, as well as Italy and the other Axis powers during World War II. However, it's important to note that Canada's victories were achieved as part of a larger coalition of nations, and not through unilateral military action. Regarding your final question, the two questions are not exactly the same. The first question asks for a hypothetical scenario about which countries Canada can potentially defeat in a war based on their military capabilities.

Detailed Instructions: This task is about creating an unanswerable question based on a given passage. Construct a question that looks relevant to the given context but is unanswerable. Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions: (i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage (ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer (iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question (iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Q: Passage: As heirs of the Dominican priory of Poissy in France, the Dartford sisters were also heirs to a tradition of profound learning and piety. Sections of translations of spiritual writings in Dartford's library, such as Suso's Little Book of Eternal Wisdom and Laurent du Bois' Somme le Roi, show that the \\"ghoostli\\" link to Europe was not lost in the crossing of the Channel. It survived in the minds of the nuns. Also, the nuns shared a unique identity with Poissy as a religious house founded by a royal house. The English nuns were proud of this heritage, and aware that many of them shared in England's great history as members of the noble class, as seen in the next chapter. A:","completion":"Part #1: Creating questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage. Usage: \\"How many total pages were in the Dartford's library collection of spiritual writings during the 15th century?\\" This question meets the criteria because it asks for a specific number of pages in the library collection, a constraint that is not mentioned anywhere in the passage. Part #2: Creating questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer. Usage: \\"What was the daily routine of the nuns at the Dominican priory of Poissy?\\" This question requires information that is not provided in the passage, as there is no mention of the nuns' daily routines. Part #3: Replacing an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with another entity, number, date, and using it in the question. Usage: \\"Did the Dartford sisters inherit a tradition of profound learning and piety from the Dominican priory of Rome, Italy?\\" This question meets the criteria because it replaces the original location (Poissy in France) with another location (Rome, Italy), making it unanswerable based on the passage. Part #4: Creating a question which is answerable from the passage and then replacing one or two words by their antonyms or inserting/removing negation words to make it unanswerable. Usage: \\"Were the English nuns uninterested in their unique identity with Poissy as a religious house founded by a royal house?\\" This question meets the criteria because it inserts a negation word \\"uninterested,\\" making it unanswerable based on the passage, which states that the nuns were proud of their heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Process: - When water freezes it becomes 10% bigger, or takes up 10% more space - As water expands it puts great pressure on the walls of anything containing it, including any rocks which happen to be surrounding it - The force of the pressure exerted on the rock surrounding it is enough to wedge the walls of the crack farther apart, thus expanding and deepening the crack - Clay expends when wet like ice does - This causes rock to break apart - Some plants like mosses and lichens are capable of growing without soil on bare rock - When they do this their roots penetrate pores and crevices and cause rocks to split apart as the roots force their way down through the rocks - suppose it is warmer so there is less ice formed happens, how will it affect there is more ice. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. Justification: In the given scenario, it is mentioned that the temperature is warmer, which would lead to less ice being formed. The process of water freezing and expanding, exerting pressure on the walls of the rocks, is one of the main steps in the process. Since the warmer temperature would result in less ice being formed, it indirectly impacts this particular step of the process.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device Stuart Lancaster, 46, left his position as head coach on Wednesday after England became the first sole hosts to exit a World Cup at the pool stages. \\"We won in 2003, 2007 was not great, 2011 got poorer and, as for 2015, we have come off the precipice,\\" Thomas told BBC Radio 5 live. \\"To be a successful national team coach you've got to have an X factor. \\" England's World Cup exit saw them become the worst-performing host nation in tournament history. In his Daily Mail column, England's 2003 World Cup-winning coach Sir Clive Woodward wrote that Rugby Football Union chief executive Ian Ritchie should also be held accountable. Media playback is not supported on this device But Ritchie, who says he accepts responsibility for the World Cup disappointment, believes he is still the right man to lead the search for a replacement of \\"proven international experience\\". \\"I'm the chief executive, I run the organisation, of course I feel personally about what's gone on,\\" said Ritchie. \\"It's equally important that I continue to deliver for the organisation and move it forward.\\" Lancaster's departure followed a review into England's performance, which involved an RFU panel taking \\"extensive feedback\\" from some members of the squad and all 12 directors of rugby at Premiership clubs.

It is our job to look for the best educational programs. One of the most important things of a good child care program or child day care is the teacher to child ratio . It means that every student needs a certain amount of attention in order to grow and learn correctly. It's for this reason that small-sized class in schools are leading to bigger and better opportunities. With smaller classes, each student is given personal attention when it comes to their class work, their personal health and their mental growth. When there are too many children in a class, individuals get lost in the crowd. They always couldn't get enough attention. When it comes to the educational result, they don't learn well because some are afraid to ask questions in front of so many people. Others become lazy for not having been attended by the teacher. Some schools are overcrowded these days. Most children don't even get their basic educational work done in schools. How is one expected to grow into a successful , healthy adult if the basics are not done? For these and several other reasons, schools with small class sizes are turning out to be very good for children. Diana Autumn is Director of Anne Sullivan School.

You know that friction also causes heat. Think about when you rub your hands together. It is friction that makes them warm. But why does this happen? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster. Faster moving particles have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts. This coating of oil makes them slippery. When things are slippery there is less friction. Have you ever seen a sign that says, slippery when wet? This too has to do with friction. Water, like oil, can reduce friction. The wet surface may allow your shoes to slide more easily.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Astronauts Taylor (Charlton Heston), Landon (Robert Gunner), Dodge (Jeff Burton) and Stewart are in deep hibernation when their spaceship crashes in a lake on an unknown planet after a long near-light speed voyage, during which, due to time dilation, the crew ages only 18 months. As the ship sinks, Taylor finds Stewart dead and her body desiccated. They throw an inflatable raft from the ship and climb down into it; before departing the ship, Taylor notes that the date is November 25, 3978, approximately two millennia after their departure in 1972. Once ashore, Dodge performs a soil test and pronounces the soil incapable of sustaining life. After abandoning their raft, the astronauts set off through a desolate wasteland in hopes of finding food and water before their provisions run out. Eventually, they encounter plant life. They find an oasis at the edge of the desert and go swimming, ignoring eerie scarecrow-like figures around the edge of the water. While they are swimming, their clothes are stolen. Pursuing the thieves, the astronauts find their clothes torn to shreds, their supplies pillaged and the perpetrators â a group of humans that are apparently so primitive that they cannot even talk and dressed in torn clothes â raiding a cornfield. Taylor is attracted to one of the humans, whom he later names Nova (Linda Harrison). Suddenly, armed and uniformed gorillas on horseback charge through the cornfield, brandishing firearms, snares, and nets. They capture some humans and kill the rest. In the chaos, Dodge is shot in the back and killed, Landon is wounded and rendered unconscious, and Taylor is shot in the throat and taken prisoner. The gorillas take Taylor to Ape City, where his life is saved after a blood transfusion administered by two chimpanzees, an animal psychologist Zira (Kim Hunter) and surgeon Galen (Wright King). While his throat wound is healing, he is unable to speak. Taylor discovers that the various apes, who can talk and are in control, are in a strict caste system: gorillas are police... Answer:","completion":"What event leads to Taylor's capture by the gorillas, and how does it ultimately affect his ability to communicate with the apes in Ape City?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize: No matter what vehicle you’re using, it’s important to keep 2 hands on the wheel at all times. To give yourself maximum control, imagine that your steering wheel is a clock and keep your hands at the 9-o’clock and 3-o’clock positions. This is particularly important for vans because, if you don’t keep a firm grasp on the wheel, you could lose control of the vehicle and cause a rollover. Vans are heavier and bulkier than normal cars, meaning they take longer to brake. To account for this, leave more space than normal between yourself and other cars. As a general rule, leave at least 4 seconds of distance between you and the car in front of you. To calculate how far behind a car you are, wait until the car passes a clear object or road marker. As soon as it does, count how many seconds it takes until you pass that same object. Depending on the area and the exact size of the vehicle, your van may be subject to special speed restrictions different from the posted speed limit. In most cases, this will be 10 miles (16 km) per hour lower than the max for standard cars. To see if an area you’re traveling in enforces van-specific speed limits, contact the local Department of Motor Vehicles or search online for local driving regulations. Vans are tall and narrow, which means they’re more prone to tipping over. Though not usually a problem on straight paths, this can make turning more precarious. To minimize the risk of tipping, slow down to around 5 to 10 miles (8.0 to 16.1 km) per hour before making sharp turns. To avoid colliding with curbs, road signs, and other vehicles, make sure your van is positioned in the left or right-most lane, depending on which direction you need to turn. Make sure other vehicles are far enough away from the van that you won’t side sweep them when turning. Then, make your turn, waiting until you are far enough into the intersection that your vehicle’s back end won’t hit other cars. Before changing lanes or backing up, put on your blinkers to indicate your intentions. Then, check all your mirrors for other cars and pedestrians. If your cargo van has a clear back window, turn your head and look through it to make sure there are no cars in your blind spot. If necessary, get out of your van to check the surroundings before backing up. Though vans are not as large as semi trucks, they are significantly taller than normal cars, meaning they may not be able to go under bridges and ledges other vehicles can. Before going under a low ledge, check the clearance sign on top to see if your van is short enough to fit underneath. Do not go under ledges that are lower than your vehicle. Most major bridges are tall enough to accomodate semi trucks, so look out primarily for old, small-town bridges and clearance poles at places like gas stations and fast food restaurants.","completion":"Maintain control of your vehicle by keeping both hands on the steering wheel at 9 and 3 o'clock positions. Give additional space, at least 4 seconds, between your van and other cars due to their longer braking time. Be aware of area-specific van speed limits, which could be 10 mph lower than standard cars. Slow down for sharp turns and maintain proper lane position to prevent tipping or collisions. Alert others with blinkers, check mirrors, and for cargo vans, check blind spots through the back window or physically assess surrounding areas before changing lanes or reversing. Be cautious of low bridges or ledges, checking clearance signs to ensure your van will fit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Process: - Human industry produces chemical compounds - Chemical compounds rise into the air - Chemical compounds mix with elements in clouds - The affected rain falls to the earth - The affected rain can harm natural and man-made objects because of its acidic content. Question: suppose using less coal happens, how will it affect LESS damage by acid rain. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If less coal is used in human industry, then the primary change to the process described will be a reduction in the production of chemical compounds. This is because burning coal releases sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, which contribute to the formation of acid rain. Step by step analysis and justification: 1. Less coal use: By using less coal, we reduce the emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) that are direct causes of acid rain. 2. Reduction in chemical compounds: As the production of harmful chemical compounds decreases, the amount of these compounds released into the atmosphere is also reduced. 3. Lower concentration in clouds: With fewer chemical compounds released into the air, they will not mix with elements in clouds to the same extent, reducing the formation of acid rain. 4. Less affected rain: Since the interaction between these chemical compounds and elements in clouds has decreased, the rain that falls to the earth will contain less acidic content. 5. Less damage to natural and man-made objects: As the acidic content of the rain decreases, the harm it causes to natural and man-made objects will also be reduced. In conclusion, using less coal will have a positive effect on reducing the damage caused by acid rain. The supposed perturbation will result in less damage to natural and man-made objects due to decreased acidic content in the rain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Ara Raoul Parseghian (May 21, 1923 - August 2, 2017) was an American football player and coach who guided the University of Notre Dame to national championships in 1966 and 1973. He is noted for bringing Notre Dame's Fighting Irish football program from years of futility back into a national contender in 1964 and is widely regarded alongside Knute Rockne and Frank Leahy as a part of the \\"Holy Trinity\\" of Notre Dame head coaches. Parseghian grew up in Akron, Ohio, and played football beginning in his junior year of high school. He enrolled at the University of Akron, but soon quit to join the U.S. Navy for two years during World War II. In 1966, Parseghian guided Notre Dame to its first national championship since the Leahy era. Led by quarterback Terry Hanratty, running back Nick Eddy, star receiver Jim Seymour, and fullback Larry Conjar, the offense was best in the nation in scoring, with an average of 36.2 points per game. The defense was second in the country in points allowed, thanks to strong performances by linebacker Jim Lynch and defensive end Alan Page. The season began with eight straight victories, propelling Notre Dame to the top of the national polls. The team then faced Michigan State (who had Bubba Smith), which ranked second in the polls and was also undefeated. The contest, one among a number referred to as the \\"game of the century\\", ended in a 10-10 tie. Parseghian was criticized for winding down the clock instead of trying to score despite having the ball in the final seconds of the game. He defended his strategy by maintaining that several key starters had been knocked out of action early in the game and that he did not want to spoil a courageous comeback from a 10-0 deficit by risking a turnover deep in his own territory late in the game. When Parseghian's team trounced USC 51-0 the following week, critics alleged that he ran up the score to impress poll voters who had split the number-one ranking between Notre Dame and Michigan State following the tie. Subsequent to the USC rout, the final wire service polls gave Parseghian's team the national championship, although Notre Dame did not participate in a post-season bowl game. Nine members of the team were selected as All-Americans, and Parseghian was named coach of the year by Sporting News. Several winning seasons followed, but Notre Dame did not repeat as national champion in the late 1960s. In 1969, the team finished with an 8-2-1 record and accepted an invitation to play in the postseason Cotton Bowl. With this game, the school ended a long-standing policy of not playing in bowl games. The university urgently needed money to fund minority scholarships and decided to use the proceeds from bowl games for this purpose. Parseghian's team lost the game, 21-17, to the eventual national champion Texas Longhorns.

Choices: - bus depot - state park - bus stop - train station - school The rationale to choose \\"bus depot\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"Each of the choices - bus depot, state park, bus stop, train station, and school - are places where it's common to find benches. However, the likelihood and number of benches varies from location to location, depending on their function and the number of people they serve. 1. Bus Depot: A bus depot is a designated place where city or intercity buses are parked and maintained or left overnight. Although you might find benches in bus depots' waiting areas, these are usually intended more for employees and not for a vast public, depending on the specific layout and design of the depot. Therefore, the quantity may not be as high as other public areas. 2. State Park: State parks are large areas of land protected by the government because of their natural beauty. These parks are often equipped with benches for visitors to rest and enjoy the scenery. The number of benches can vary significantly from one park to another, depending on the park's size and the number of visitors it can handle. 3. Bus Stop: Bus stops are important establishments in urban and suburban settings. They would typically have a bench or two for passengers to use while waiting for their bus. However, given that bus stops are generally small and caters to a limited number of people at a time, they are unlikely to have \\"many\\" benches. 4. Train Station: Train stations are key locations where passenger trains load or unload passengers. They're typically much larger than bus stops and often include waiting areas with many benches. The number could be very high, especially in major train stations serving a large city or region. 5. School: Schools, especially larger ones like high schools and universities, have numerous benches. These can be found in the cafeteria, library, classrooms, outdoor spaces, recreation areas, and more. Given the large number of students these institutions serve, they are likely to have a significant number of benches. Taking into account the size of the location, its function, and the volume of people it needs to cater to, a train station likely has a higher number of benches. However, schools might also compete closely, especially if you consider a large campus with multiple buildings and outdoor spaces. In conclusion, while each location often has benches, the numerical predominance of benches could be more found in train stations and schools, depending generally on their size and the volume of people that they serve. The actual specifics would, however, depend on each individual location’s layout, design, and infrastructure. It's wise to note that the specific number of benches may point to the ease of getting a spot to sit, rest or wait, but it would depend on the volume of users in those public spaces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court. - A judge presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a panel of judges. The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions. The judge is supposed to conduct the trial impartially and in an open court. The judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling on the matter at hand based on his or her interpretation of the law and his or her own personal judgment. In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a jury. In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation, a judge might also be an examining magistrate. - A running mate is a person running together with another person on a joint ticket during an election. The term is most often used in reference to the person in the subordinate position (such as the vice presidential candidate running with a presidential candidate) but can also properly be used when referring to \\"both\\" candidates, such as by saying Barack Obama and Joe Biden were running mates in 2008 and 2012. - Carlos Gustave Spaht , I ( August 2 , 1906 - April 29 , 2001 ) , was a Louisiana judge best remembered for having lost the Democratic gubernatorial runoff election in January 1952 to fellow Judge Robert F. Kennon of Minden , the seat of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana . Spaht 's unsuccessful running mate for lieutenant governor was future Governor John J. McKeithen of Columbia , the seat of Caldwell Parish in north Louisiana . McKeithen lost to then State Senator C.E. \`\` Cap '' Barham of Ruston , the seat of Lincoln Parish , also in north Louisiana . At the time , McKeithen was an outgoing member of the Louisiana House of Representatives . Spaht was affiliated for years with the Baton Rouge law firm Kantrow , Spaht , Weaver & Blitzer . - Joseph Robinette \\"Joe\\" Biden Jr. (born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who was the 47th Vice President of the United States from 2009 to 2017, having been jointly elected twice with President Barack Obama. A member of the Democratic Party, Biden represented Delaware as a United States Senator from 1973 until becoming Vice President in 2009.

It was released in July 2007 in North America and Europe , and in August 2007 in Australia . Players use a guitar - shaped controller ( purchased separately ) to simulate playing rock music by hitting notes as they scroll towards the player . Rocks the 80s is an incremental title in the Guitar Hero series , rather than a full sequel . No changes in gameplay from Guitar Hero II have been introduced to this game . As implied by the game 's title , the game features a 1980s theme , consisting of songs from the decade and playable characters , fashions , and artwork that reflect the time period . The game was not as well - received as the prior two Guitar Hero games , due to the lack of new gameplay features and reduced soundtrack . Rocks the 80s is the third and final title in the Guitar Hero series to be developed by Harmonix before they moved on to create Rock Band . The next major installment of the series , Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock , was developed by Activision 's Neversoft division . - A game controller is a device used with games or entertainment systems to provide input to a video game, typically to control an object or character in the game. A controller is usually connected to a game console or computer by means of a wire or cord, although, since the mid-2000s, wireless controllers have become widespread. Input devices that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards, mouses, gamepads, joysticks, etc. Special purpose devices, such as steering wheels for driving games and light guns for shooting games, are also game controllers. - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion. - Rhythm game or rhythm action is a genre of music-themed action video game that challenges a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads may be used as input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.

Title: Traffic Movie plot: Mexico storyline[edit] In Mexico, police officer Javier Rodriguez (del Toro) and his partner Manolo Sanchez (Vargas) stop a drug transport and arrest the couriers. Their arrest is interrupted by General Salazar (Milian), a high-ranking Mexican official who decides to hire Javier. Salazar instructs him to apprehend Francisco Flores (Collins), a hitman for the Tijuana Cartel, headed by the ObregÃ³n brothers. Back in Tijuana, Flores, under torture, gives Salazar the names of important members of the ObregÃ³n cartel, who are arrested. Javier and Salazar's efforts begin to cripple the ObregÃ³n brothers' cocaine outfit, but Javier soon discovers Salazar is a pawn for the JuÃ¡rez Cartel, the rival of the ObregÃ³n brothers. That entire portion of the Mexican anti-drug campaign is a fraud, as Salazar is wiping out one cartel because he has aligned with another for profit. Javier's partner Sanchez attempts to sell the information of Salazar's true affiliation to the DEA but is killed for his betrayal. Javier, who can no longer stomach working for Salazar, decides to make a deal with the DEA. In exchange for his testimony, Javier requests electricity in his neighborhood so the kids can play baseball at night rather than be tempted by street gangs and crime. Salazar's secrets are revealed to the public, and he is arrested and is shown suffering probable torture in prison.

Available choices: [I] unacceptable. [II] acceptable.","completion":"I would consider the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"The boy whose guardian's we elected employer president betrayed us\\" as [I] unacceptable. Here's a detailed explanation as to why the sentence does not adhere to proper linguistic standards. 1. Ambiguity: The sentence is quite ambiguous and fails to convey the intended message clearly. There are multiple interpretations that could potentially be derived from the sentence, making it difficult for the reader to understand the main point that the writer is trying to make. 2. Word Order: The word order in the sentence is quite unusual, not following conventional English grammar rules. For example, the placement of \\"we elected\\" before \\"employer president\\" creates confusion, with the reader struggling to piece together the meaning and relationship between the two phrases. 3. Syntax: The syntax in the sentence is problematic as well. The use of the possessive form \\"guardian's\\" before \\"we elected\\" implies a relationship between the two phrases, but the sentence structure creates confusion concerning the exact nature of this relationship. More specifically, the reader is left wondering as to whom the guardian's employer is and how this person relates to the betrayal. 4. Clarity: The absence of punctuation marks or additional words to pause and connect different elements of the sentence leads to difficulties in discerning the intended meaning. The sentence reads like a long, uninterrupted chain of words, making it difficult to fully understand the writer's thoughts and ideas. To rephrase the sentence and improve its linguistic integrity, it might be better to rewrite it as follows: \\"We elected the employer of the boy's guardian as president, but he betrayed us.\\" Here, the message is clearer, and the reader can grasp the relationships amongst the different elements more easily.

Plot: The story begins with Count Dracula arriving in England under the guise of a wealthy nobleman. He buys an estate near Dr. Seward's insane asylum and befriends the doctor as part of his plan to infiltrate high society. Through Dr. Seward, Count Dracula is introduced to Lucy Westenra, Dr. Seward's fiancée, who catches his eye and becomes the object of his dark desires. As Dracula starts frequenting Dr. Seward's social circle, he becomes fascinated by the world of the opera. Dr. Seward, his family, Lucy, and Mina Harker acquire tickets to attend a highly anticipated opera performance. Unbeknownst to them, Dracula also secures a seat in their box. The grand night finally arrives, and the atmosphere is filled with excitement, glamour, and elegance. During the opera performance, Dracula subtly starts seducing Lucy with his charm and supernatural powers. Unnoticed by others, he makes Lucy feel a strong attraction towards him, making her doubt her love for Dr. Seward. As the opera continues into the night, Lucy begins to experience strange sensations and begins to feel torn between her loyalty to Dr. Seward and the mysterious allure of Count Dracula. Meanwhile, Mina Harker becomes suspicious of Dracula's intentions and starts to investigate him. Her research leads her to rumors about the existence of vampires and Dracula's true identity. Feeling alarmed, she confides her findings with Abraham Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter, who turns out to be Dr. Seward's former mentor. Together, they join forces to thwart Dracula's plans and save Lucy from his clutches. The dramatic climax of the story occurs when Dracula, in all his sinister glory, finally reveals his true nature to Lucy during the final act of the opera. As chaos erupts in the opera hall, Dr. Seward, Mina, and Van Helsing race to save Lucy from Dracula's evil grasp. A high-stakes battle ensues between the noble vampire hunter and the ancient horror in the shadows of the opera house. In the end, Dracula is defeated by Van Helsing's cunning and knowledge of vampire lore, forcing him to retreat. Lucy, saved from the clutches of darkness, reaffirms her love for Dr. Seward, and together they vow to put this terrifying ordeal behind them. Mina Harker is celebrated for her bravery and resourcefulness, and a new partnership is formed between her, Van Helsing, and Dr. Seward to prevent any such horrors from returning. The movie concludes with the Seward family, now closer than ever, attending another opera performance – this time, free of any darkness lurking in the shadows. While it appears that the story has a happy ending, the closing shot of the film reveals Count Dracula watching the family from a distant balcony, hinting at the possibility of a sequel and his intent of revenge. A Night at the Opera with Dracula is a thrilling, gothic horror period drama that combines the glamour of high society with the chilling darkness of the vampire world. It explores themes of love, lust, loyalty, and the eternal struggle between good and evil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This move has implications on both Taiwan's domestic market and its international trade relations with the United States. This article delves into the reasons behind this decision and its potential impact on both countries. Step 1: Understand the background of the decision To fully comprehend the ongoing situation, it is essential to be aware of the past trade disputes and health concerns surrounding imported US beef. In the late 2000s, Taiwan had imposed a complete ban on US beef products due to concerns over health risks, particularly mad cow disease. However, following negotiations, the ban was lifted with some restrictions still in place. Step 2: Analyze the reasons for reinstating the partial ban Taiwan's decision to restore the partial ban on US beef imports is being driven by multiple factors: - Health concerns: Despite the initial lifting of the ban, fears over health risks persist, particularly concerning growth hormones and feed additives that are common in American cattle-farming practices. - Consumer preferences: Taiwanese consumers' preference for locally-sourced and organic produce has been growing stronger, which puts pressure on the government to promote domestic agriculture. - Trade negotiations: The partial ban may be seen as a negotiating tactic to gain leverage in future trade talks with the US. Step 3: Assess the impact on Taiwan's economy and domestic market The reinstated partial ban is expected to have repercussions on Taiwan's domestic markets: - Reduced supply of imported beef: The partial ban will inevitably lead to a decrease in the availability of imported US beef in the Taiwanese market. - Higher prices: The reduced supply may potentially result in a price increase of beef products, affecting local consumers. - Support for local agriculture: However, the ban may also provide an opportunity for Taiwan's domestic beef industry to expand and capture a larger market share. Step 4: Evaluate the implications for US-Taiwan trade relations The restoration of the partial ban is expected to have implications on the trade relations between the US and Taiwan: - Trade disputes: The ban may spark a new round of trade disputes between the two countries, hindering the progress of any ongoing trade negotiations. - US farmers' concerns: US beef producers, who have already been negatively impacted by trade disputes with China, are likely to express concerns about losing another market. Conclusion: In conclusion, Taiwan's restoration of the partial ban on US beef imports is a complex issue driven by multiple factors, ranging from health concerns to trade negotiations. The outcome of this decision is likely to affect the economies of both nations and may strain their existing trade ties. However, this also presents an opportunity for Taiwan's domestic beef industry to expand and satisfy local consumers' preferences for locally-produced meats."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Something is wrong here. Very wrong. April 2, 2006 I didn't realize until this morning that yesterday was April Fools day. Some kind of sick joke? But that's not like Walter either. He was a little crazy, but not that kind of crazy. Still I keep half expecting to pick up my voice and hear his voice yell, \\"Gotcha!\\" But it is no joke. I know he is dead. (Later) Got a package today. From Walter. Scary considering what I wrote about expecting him to call. I can't express the chill I got when I saw his name on the label. A message from the dead.

Question: - The earth changes energy from the sun into heat - Heat rises from the ground - Greenhouse gas molecules in the atmosphere prevent the heat from going into space - The temperature of the earth increases - The temperature continues to rise and melts the polar ice caps - The temperature rises even faster. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process of Earth changing energy from the sun and eventually leading to melting polar ice caps can be explained as follows: 1. Solar radiation and energy absorption: Our planet receives energy from the sun in the form of solar radiation. Approximately 30% of the incoming solar radiation is reflected back into space by the Earth's atmosphere, clouds, and the surface, while the remaining 70% is absorbed by the land and oceans. The absorbed solar radiation is responsible for heating the Earth's surface and atmosphere, thus providing the necessary warmth for life to thrive. As the Earth absorbs this incoming solar energy, the planet's temperature rises and gradually converts the absorbed energy into heat. This process of transformation and energy transfer plays a crucial role in regulating our planet's climate. 2. Heat transfer processes: Once solar energy is absorbed, heat from the sun penetrates the Earth's surface and is then transferred through the atmosphere by various processes such as conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction occurs when heat is transferred molecules within a solid object or between direct contact of solid objects or between a solid object and liquid or gas. Convection takes place in liquids and gases, where heated particles rise and cooler particles sink, thus creating circulation patterns that transfer heat energy. Radiation is the transfer of heat energy through space via electromagnetic waves. 3. The greenhouse effect: As heat rises from the ground, it is absorbed and re-emitted by greenhouse gases present in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor. These gases help trap heat in the atmosphere, acting like a blanket around the planet and preventing it from escaping into space. This phenomenon is called the greenhouse effect and is a vital natural process that maintains Earth's temperature within a range suitable for life. However, increased human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, have led to a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions have amplified the greenhouse effect, causing the Earth to retain more heat than it should, leading to global warming. 4. Global warming and polar ice caps melting: As global temperatures continue to rise due to the enhanced greenhouse effect and global warming, the adverse impact on the Earth's climate systems becomes more apparent. The polar regions, specifically the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps, are especially vulnerable to these rising temperatures. As the Earth's temperature increases, the polar ice caps start to melt at an accelerated rate, leading to more heat being absorbed by the ocean and the atmosphere. The melting of the polar ice caps contributes to a feedback loop where the loss of ice exposes more of the dark ocean surface. The dark ocean surface absorbs more solar radiation, further accelerating global warming and leading to even faster melting of ice caps. This vicious cycle causes sea levels to rise, resulting in severe consequences for coastal areas and global ecosystems. In summary, the first step of the process is the solar radiation emitted by the sun and absorbed by the Earth, which sets off a chain of events that ultimately lead to global warming and melting of the polar ice caps. It is crucial to address the human-induced factors causing the acceleration of this process to mitigate the harmful effects of global warming on our environment."},{"prompt":"Joseph Trapanese is an American composer arranger and producer.

Answer the following question: Information: - Ristar, released as in Japan, is a platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis, which released worldwide in February 1995. A Sega Game Gear game, of the same name and genre, \\"Ristar\\", was also released, which shared similar themes, while possessing different level design and gameplay mechanics. - Softdisk is a software and Internet company based in Shreveport, Louisiana. Founded in 1981, its original products were disk magazines (which they termed \\"magazettes\\", for \\"magazine on diskette\\"). They were affiliated and partly owned by paper magazine \\"Softalk\\" at their founding, but survived its demise. - John D. Carmack (born August 20, 1970) is an American game programmer, aerospace and virtual reality engineer. He co-founded id Software. Carmack was the lead programmer of the id video games \\"Commander Keen\\", \\"Wolfenstein 3D\\", \\"Doom\\", \\"Quake\\", \\"Rage\\" and their sequels. Carmack is best known for his innovations in 3D graphics, such as his famous Carmack's Reverse algorithm for shadow volumes, and is also a rocketry enthusiast and the founder and lead engineer of Armadillo Aerospace. In August 2013, Carmack took the position of CTO at Oculus VR, which in 2014 became a subsidiary of Facebook. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - id Software LLC (formerly id Software, Inc., ; see Company name) is an American video game developer headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The company was founded on February 1, 1991, by four members of the computer company Softdisk, programmers John Carmack and John Romero, game designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack (no relation to John Carmack). Business manager Jay Wilbur was also involved. - A disk magazine, colloquially known as a diskmag or diskzine, is a magazine that is distributed in electronic form to be read using computers. These had some popularity in the 1980s and 1990s as periodicals distributed on floppy disk, hence their name. The rise of the Internet in the late 1990s caused them to be superseded almost entirely by online publications, which are sometimes still called \\"diskmags\\" despite the lack of physical disks. - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\".

It is a basic platform game with a considerable influence by the early Ninja Gaiden games . What is the relationship between 'shadow knights' and 'floppy disk'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between 'Shadow Knights' and 'floppy disk' lies in the medium of distribution and the era in which they were prevalent. 'Shadow Knights' is a platform game created by id Software and published by Softdisk in 1991, during a time when floppy disks were a common method of distributing software, including video games. At that time, Softdisk was a company known for producing and distributing disk magazines, which were periodicals distributed on floppy disks, also known as \\"diskmags\\" or \\"diskzines\\". As a result, it is highly likely that 'Shadow Knights' was distributed via floppy disks, given the widespread use of this storage medium during the early 1990s. Floppy disks were used to store and distribute software, games, and other digital content before the rise of the internet and the advent of other storage mediums like CDs and digital downloads. The relationship between 'Shadow Knights' and 'floppy disk' therefore represents a historical connection between the game and the technology used for software distribution at the time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential music band. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\"; as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the band were integral to pop music's evolution into an art form and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s. Context: In Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever, Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz describe the Beatles' musical evolution: In their initial incarnation as cheerful, wisecracking moptops, the Fab Four revolutionised the sound, style, and attitude of popular music and opened rock and roll's doors to a tidal wave of British rock acts. Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era's most influential cultural forces, but they didn't stop there. Although their initial style was a highly original, irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R&B, the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers, consistently staking out new musical territory on each release. The band's increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres, including folk-rock, country, psychedelia, and baroque pop, without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work. In The Beatles as Musicians, Walter Everett describes Lennon and McCartney's contrasting motivations and approaches to composition: \\"McCartney may be said to have constantly developed - as a means to entertain - a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreed-upon common language that he did much to enrich. Conversely, Lennon's mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious, searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility.\\" Ian MacDonald describes McCartney as \\"a natural melodist - a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony\\". His melody lines are characterised as primarily \\"vertical\\", employing wide, consonant intervals which express his \\"extrovert energy and optimism\\". Conversely, Lennon's \\"sedentary, ironic personality\\" is reflected in a \\"horizontal\\" approach featuring minimal, dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest: \\"Basically a realist, he instinctively kept his melodies close to the rhythms and cadences of speech, colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own.\\" MacDonald praises Harrison's lead guitar work for the role his \\"characterful lines and textural colourings\\" play in supporting Lennon and McCartney's parts, and describes Starr as \\"the father of modern pop/rock drumming\\". Question: What did they say. Whats the answer?","completion":"The authors described in detail the musical evolution and individual approaches to composition of the Beatles. Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz in \\"Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever\\" emphasized how the Beatles not only revolutionized the sound, style, and attitude of popular music but also continued to expand rock's stylistic frontiers throughout the 1960s. They experimented with numerous genres while maintaining their mass appeal. In \\"The Beatles as Musicians,\\" Walter Everett highlights the contrasting motivations and approaches of Lennon and McCartney. McCartney constantly developed his focused musical talent to entertain, enriching the common language of music with his understanding of counterpoint. On the other hand, Lennon's music is more daring, stemming from an unconscious, searching, but undisciplined artistic sensibility. Ian MacDonald describes McCartney as a natural melodist, with vertical melody lines expressing his extrovert energy and optimism. In contrast, Lennon's horizontal approach uses minimal and dissonant intervals, reflecting his sedentary and ironic personality. His melodies stay close to the rhythms and cadences of speech, relying on harmony to create interest. MacDonald also highlights Harrison's significant contributions as a lead guitarist, adding character and texture to support Lennon and McCartney's parts. Moreover, he praises Ringo Starr as the father of modern pop/rock drumming. In summary, the Beatles' musical evolution is characterized by their continuous expansion of rock's stylistic frontiers and the unique contributions and contrasting approaches of its individual members. Their work transformed the sound and attitude of popular music, establishing them as one of the most influential cultural forces of their era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – About half of US adults—more than 117 million people—are part of a \\"virtual, perpetual lineup\\" thanks to the increasing and unregulated use of facial recognition technology by the country's law enforcement agencies, according to a report released Tuesday by Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology. The center's executive director tells the Guardian the use of this surveillance technology \\"can change the basic freedom we have to go about our lives.\\" The big difference between this new virtual lineup and traditional databases of fingerprints and DNA is that it is \\"overwhelmingly made up of\\" innocent people. Sixteen states let police use driver's license photos of residents for facial recognition purposes without a warrant, the New York Times reports. Others use passports, visa applications, and more. And while the report calls the current use of facial recognition technology \\"highly problematic,\\" it recognizes it as a useful tool—provided there's more oversight. According to the Intercept, 52 law enforcement agencies admitted using facial recognition technology in the report; 51 of them say they are doing so without legislative approval. The report worries the technology will be used to crackdown on freedom of speech—police have used it to scan faces at anti-police protests, and only one agency in the country says it can't be used to track people exercising their right to political or religious speech. Facial recognition technology also disproportionately affects people of color for multiple reasons, including that its algorithms are 10% less accurate for black faces than white ones. (Disney gets patent to take pictures of park guests' feet.)","completion":"Title: The Perpetual Lineup: Facial Recognition Technology and Its Impact on US Citizens Introduction In recent years, facial recognition technology has become more prevalent within law enforcement agencies in the United States. According to a report released by Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology, over half of US adults - more than 117 million people - are now part of an ongoing \\"virtual, perpetual lineup.\\" This new form of surveillance raises significant concerns, particularly regarding privacy rights, disproportionate impact on people of color, and the potential for abuse in monitoring freedom of speech. This article will delve further into the issues surrounding facial recognition technology and explore the need for greater oversight. I. The Virtual, Perpetual Lineup The use of facial recognition technology has fundamentally changed the way law enforcement operates. Unlike traditional databases, which contain fingerprints and DNA of predominantly guilty people, facial recognition assembles an extensive array of images of innocent civilians. With 16 states allowing police access to driver's license photos without a warrant, and others utilizing passports and visa applications, the prevalence of facial recognition technology raises serious concerns about its impact on our basic freedoms. II. The Call for Oversight and Regulation Despite its current controversial usage, facial recognition technology is widely acknowledged as a valuable tool for law enforcement. However, the report emphasizes that its use should be subject to greater oversight and regulation. Out of 52 law enforcement agencies acknowledged as employing facial recognition technology, 51 stated they were doing so without legislative approval. This lack of regulation exposes the considerable potential for abuse and misuse of the technology. III. Facial Recognition Technology and Freedom of Speech One of the most pressing concerns arising from the use of facial recognition technology is its potential impact on freedom of speech. Law enforcement agencies have already demonstrated their willingness to use these technologies to monitor anti-police protests, with only one agency explicitly prohibiting the tracking of individuals exercising their right to political or religious speech. This highlights the need to establish clear guidelines for the appropriate use of facial recognition, ensuring that it does not infringe upon fundamental liberties. IV. Disproportionate Impact on People of Color Apart from the broader privacy issues, facial recognition technology disproportionately affects people of color. The algorithms employed in facial recognition software are 10% less accurate for black faces compared to white ones. This discrepancy may lead to an increased risk of misidentification and wrongful accusations, further exacerbating existing social inequalities and tensions between law enforcement and minority communities. Conclusion The adoption of facial recognition technology by law enforcement agencies across the United States has led to the creation of a virtual, perpetual lineup of over 117 million people. Though facial recognition may be a useful tool for law enforcement, its use must be balanced against the need for privacy protection, freedom of speech, and equal treatment under the law. For these reasons, greater oversight and regulation are needed to establish a fair and transparent framework for the responsible application of facial recognition technology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: At Fillmore East is the first live album by American rock band the Allman Brothers Band, and their third release overall. Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was released in July 1971 in the United States by Capricorn Records. As the title indicates, the recording took place at the New York City music venue Fillmore East, which was run by concert promoter Bill Graham. It was recorded over the course of three nights in March 1971 and features the band performing extended jam versions of songs such as \\"Whipping Post\\", \\" The band devised the cover idea for At Fillmore East rather than leaving it in the hands of Atlantic executives (Allman was particularly disgusted with the artwork for Sam & Dave's Hold On, I'm Comin' album). Initially, the album cover was to be shots of the band taken in front of the Fillmore East with their names on the marquee above them, but no one was satisfied with the results. The band's main purpose for the cover was that it be as \\"meat and potatoes\\" as the band's ethos and performing, and someone suggested the band make it a photograph of the band in an alley waiting with their gear to go onstage. The image was shot by photographer Jim Marshall one morning in the band's home of Macon, Georgia. The group were not very happy about being woken up early to shoot (\\"we figured it didn't make a damn bit of difference what the cover was or what time we took it,\\" said guitarist Dickey Betts). Normally the band hated being photographed; the cover of later retrospective release The Fillmore Concerts shows them displaying terminal boredom. However, during the session, Duane spotted a dealer friend, raced over and grabbed a bag of contraband, then returned to his seat, discreetly clutching the stash in his lap. This made the whole band laugh, resulting in a memorable image. Marshall stenciled the album title on one of the road cases, which were stacked in front of the wall. The back cover shows their road crew gathered in the same spot with 16 oz cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer provided by the photographer as a reward to the roadies for lugging out and stacking the band's heavy equipment for the shoot. Among the crew on the back cover are Joseph \\"Red Dog\\" Campbell, Kim Payne, Mike Callahan, Joe Dan Petty and Willie Perkins (the last two the newest additions to the crew at the time). The idea to have the crew on the back cover was Duane Allman's idea, as all involved viewed them the \\"unsung heroes\\" in the operation. A photo of Lyndon, then in jail awaiting his trial, was superimposed to the wall behind the crew. What did the artwork consist of?","completion":"The artwork for At Fillmore East consisted of a photograph of the band in an alley waiting with their gear to go onstage, shot by photographer Jim Marshall in Macon, Georgia.

In mild to moderate cases, the symptoms can last for a few hours to a few days, depending on the severity of the exposure and the treatment. In more severe cases, long-term effects or permanent damage may occur. Step 2: Research how long food poisoning still shows in the blood The duration in which food poisoning can still be detected in the blood depends on the type of foodborne illness and the specific test used for detection. For example, Salmonella bacteria can typically be detected in the blood for up to a week after infection, while other bacteria, viruses, or parasites might have different timelines. It is important to note that the actual symptoms of food poisoning may last from several hours to a few days, depending on the severity and the individual's immune response.

The first question relates to the duration of carbon monoxide poisoning symptoms after the exposure has stopped, whereas the second question pertains to how long food poisoning can still be detected in the blood. Although both questions deal with the effects of poisoning, they focus on different aspects and have distinct implications for the individual's health.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. Question: 'Who's country was Stoltenberg told by someone would be very rich? Options: A. Kim B. Trump C. Moon D. not enough information Answer:","completion":"A.

Given the question: I can use this background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. Now, I have a new situation: Two neighboring towns had different demographics. Hill town had younger inhabitants, most of them in their 30's and 40's. Lake town was inhabited by elderly people, most of them above 65 years of age. Answer this question please: Which town had fewer people that freed up time for their grandchildren? The answer is:","completion":"Hill town had fewer people that freed up time for their grandchildren. To reach this conclusion, let's analyze both towns in the context of the background information provided about old age. Since old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life, it is reasonable to assume that elderly people above the age of 65 are more likely to have retired and have time for their grandchildren as compared to those in their 30s and 40s who would still be working. Now, let's consider the demographics of each town. Hill town has younger inhabitants, most of them in their 30s and 40s, which means that the majority of the population is still in their working years. As a result, these individuals have less time to spend with their grandchildren because they are still actively engaged in their careers and other responsibilities. On the other hand, Lake town is inhabited by elderly people, most of them above 65 years of age. This implies that the majority of the population in Lake town is in the old age category, which is characterized by retirement and having more free time for hobbies, interests, and grandchildren. Therefore, compared to Lake town, Hill town has a smaller proportion of its population that has freed up time for their grandchildren because most of its inhabitants are in their 30s and 40s, still working, and have not yet reached the retirement age in which their time becomes more liberated. In contrast, Lake town's elderly population is more likely to have retired and have greater availability to spend with their grandchildren, making Hill town the right choice when considering the town with fewer people that freed up time for their grandchildren."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? how do you order food at a restaurant?","completion":"Ordering food at a restaurant involves several steps to ensure a smooth dining experience. Here's a detailed guide on how to go about ordering food in a restaurant: 1. Select the restaurant: Choose your preferred restaurant, taking into consideration factors such as cuisine, price range, ambiance, and location. Check for the restaurant's hours to ensure it's open when you plan to dine. Researching the restaurant's menu and reviews online can also help you get a better idea of their offerings before you dine there. Making a reservation may be necessary, depending on the popularity of the restaurant. 2. Arrive at the restaurant: Arrive at the restaurant at the appointed time. If you made a reservation, provide the host with your name or reservation details. If you are a walk-in customer, expect to wait until a table becomes available. 3. Get seated: The host or hostess will lead you to your table. After you're seated, take some time to get comfortable and review the menu. 4. Review the menu: Study the menu to familiarize yourself with the food and drink options. Look for appetizers, entrées, side dishes, desserts, and beverages that pique your interest. Many restaurants include descriptions of the dishes and their ingredients to help guide your choice. 5. Inquire about specials or recommendations: The server will usually mention any daily specials or seasonal dishes when they greet you. Don't hesitate to ask for recommendations or inquire about ingredients or preparation methods if you have specific dietary preferences or allergies. 6. Place your drink order: When the server approaches to take your order, start with your beverage preferences. This could include water, soda, juices, cocktails, wines, or beers. Most restaurants typically bring complimentary water to the table, but you may need to request it if it’s not automatically provided. 7. Order appetizers/starters: If you plan to have appetizers, order them next. Some options might include soups, salads, or small plates. Waitstaff may ask about your choice of dressing or any additional toppings you’d like to add to your order. 8. Choose your main course: Decide on your main course (entrée) and any accompanying side dishes. Make note of any preferences on preparation, cooking doneness, or modifications like substitutions or omissions. For example, if you're ordering a steak, mention your desired cooking temperature (e.g., rare, medium, or well-done). 9. Finalize your order: After everyone in your party has placed their orders, the server will confirm the details before leaving the table to place your orders in the kitchen. This is an excellent opportunity to double-check and make sure your order is correct regarding food preferences and any specific requests. 10. Enjoy your meal: Once your food arrives, take time to savor your dishes and engage in conversation with your dining companions. If you have any issues with your meal, politely inform your server so they can attempt to rectify the situation. 11. Order dessert (optional): If you wish to order dessert, servers typically provide a dessert menu after the main meal has been served. Choose your dessert and place the order when ready. 12. Request the check: After you've finished your meal, ask your server for the check. Make sure to review the bill for accuracy and, if satisfied, place your payment (cash or credit card) in the check presenter or folder. Calculate an appropriate tip based on the quality of service, usually between 15-20% of the pre-tax total. 13. Leaving the restaurant: Once your payment has been processed and change (if applicable) returned, gather your belongings, thank your server, and exit the restaurant.

The premise itself states that the bairro is \\"a legacy of the Moors,\\" which suggests that its origins are more closely tied to the Moors' influence rather than the Romans. To evaluate this hypothesis more accurately, it would be important to delve deeper into the historical context and understand the distinctions between the Moors and the Romans. The Moors were a Muslim people from North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula who were primarily of Berber and Arab descent. They conquered and ruled significant portions of the Iberian Peninsula from 711 to 1492. The Moors brought with them their Islamic religion, unique architectural styles, and various cultural practices. As the given premise suggests, the bairro resembles a typical Moorish neighborhood with its labyrinthine cobbled streets, decaying houses and palaces, and fado music clubs. It is important to note that fado music, popular in Portugal, has its roots in the Moorish culture too. On the other hand, the Romans ruled over much of Europe, including the Iberian Peninsula, from around 200 BC to 476 AD. The Romans left a lasting impact on the regions they conquered, with their influence still evident in many aspects of European culture, language, government systems, and architecture. However, the premise does not provide any indication that the bairro has elements or characteristics linked to the Roman legacy. Based on this information and the lack of evidence tying the bairro to the Romans in the premise provided, it would be inappropriate to conclude that the hypothesis \\"The bairro is part of the Roman legacy\\" is true.

As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - Reprise Records is an American major record label, founded in 1960 by Frank Sinatra.

Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What did Xerxestron accidentally trip on? Movie plot title: Meet the Spartans Movie plot: The film opens with a Spartan elder inspecting a talking baby ogre. The baby vomits on the inspector and is then discarded with a punt off the hill. Next, he inspects a Vietnamese baby, and Brangelina instantly adopts it. Baby Leonidas is then inspected, having a six-pack, biceps, and beard from birth. He is accepted as a Spartan and prepared for kinghood through his childhood training, from fighting his grandmother to enduring torture. Leonidas (Sean Maguire) is then cast out into the wild, and survives the harsh winter while killing a giant dancing penguin. Returning a king for his inauguration ceremony, Leonidas sees Margo (Carmen Electra) dancing and asks her to marry him, to which she responds by giving him the combination to her chastity belt.Years later, Leonidas is training when Captain (Kevin Sorbo) informs him that a Persian messenger has arrived. The messenger has come to present Xerxes' demands for Sparta's submission. Leonidas arrives to greet the messenger in the Spartan way (high-fives for the women and open mouth tongue kisses for the men). After growing angry with both the messenger's disrespect and making out with his wife, Leonidas kicks him, the messenger's bodyguards, and then several other people he simply disliked, ranging from Britney Spears (Nicole Parker), Ryan Seacrest, Michael Jackson and Kevin Federline (Nick Steele) to Sanjaya Malakar (Tony Yalda) and the American Idol judges into \\"the pit of death\\". As Leonidas walks off he turns to a column that has a switch that reads \\"Garbage Disposal\\", and flips the switch causing the celebrities to spiral to their \\"death\\".Resolving to face the Persians, Leonidas visits the Oracle, proposing an \\"erotic-sounding\\" strategy to repel the numerically superior enemy after offering the priests various skin-care lotions for guidance. The Oracle, Ugly Betty (Crista Flanagan), reveals that Leonidas will die should he go to war.

To do this, let's add 5*v to both sides: -5*v + 5*v = 19*v - 72 + 5*v Since adding the same quantity to both sides does not change the inequality, we can simplify: 0 = 24*v - 72 Step 2: Isolate the variable v. We will first add 72 to both sides of the equation: 24*v - 72 + 72 = 0 + 72 24*v = 72 Now, divide both sides by the coefficient of v, which is 24: (24*v) / 24 = 72 / 24 Thus, we get: v = 3 The solution for the linear equation -5*v = 19*v - 72 is v = 3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Secondly, the speaker expresses a sense of relief or gratitude for not having had similar experiences themselves. The phrase \\"knock on wood\\" is traditionally used as a superstitious gesture for warding off bad luck or hoping to continue a lucky streak, suggesting that the speaker is aware that their good fortune might not be universal and that others may not have been as fortunate in their experiences. Moreover, the speaker seems to emphasize the severity of these bad experiences by expressing their shock at the end of the month. Although the specific context of the conversation is not provided, it is evident that the speaker feels a significant emotional response to people's negative experiences. The use of shock could indicate that whatever these experiences entail, they have evoked a powerful response from the speaker, reinforcing the notion that some people have indeed had really bad experiences. In conclusion, the premise clearly supports the hypothesis that \\"Some people have had really bad experiences.\\" Through the speaker's acknowledgment of individuals' negative experiences, their expression of relief for not having faced similar challenges, and their emotive reaction towards these unfortunate occurrences, the proposition strongly indicates that some individuals have, in fact, had extremely unfavorable experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Use evidence from the fact that August is during the winter in the southern hemisphere to answer this question: \\"Where does August take place during the winter?\\"","completion":"August, as a month in the Gregorian calendar, occurs simultaneously in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. However, the experience of the season during August differs based on the location in either of these hemispheres. To provide a detailed answer to the question \\"Where does August take place during the winter?\\", we need to examine the seasonal variations and climatic factors unique to the Southern Hemisphere, as well as specific regions and countries experiencing winter during August. The Earth's axial tilt of about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the sun results in the seasonal variation experienced across the globe. As the Earth orbits the sun, this tilt causes the solar insolation or the distribution of sunlight to vary, resulting in different seasons. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted towards the sun, receiving more direct sunlight and thus experiencing higher temperatures. Conversely, during the same period, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, receiving less direct sunlight and experiencing winter. August, being the eighth month of the year, takes place during winter in the Southern Hemisphere due to this phenomenon. Various regions and countries within this hemisphere experience the winter season and its associated climatic conditions, such as cooler temperatures, shorter days, and in some cases, increased precipitation or snowfall. 1. South America: During August, countries in the southern part of South America, such as Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, and the southern parts of Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru, experience winter. In Patagonia, shared by Argentina and Chile, winter sports and activities like skiing and snowboarding become popular pastimes as snowfall increases. 2. Africa: Southern African countries like South Africa, Lesotho, Eswatini, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, southern parts of Mozambique and Angola also experience winter during August. South Africa in particular sees cooler temperatures and occasional snowfall in some elevated regions, like the Drakensberg Mountains. 3. Oceania: In Oceania, Australia, and New Zealand mainly witness winter during August. Snow sports become popular in southeastern Australia, particularly in the states of New South Wales, Victoria, and the Australian Capital Territory. Tasmania, being Australia's southernmost state, also experiences extended periods of snow cover in winter. New Zealand's South Island transforms into a winter sports destination, with tourists flocking to popular ski resorts like Queenstown and Wanaka. 4. Antarctica: Finally, Antarctica, the southernmost continent, experiences extreme winter conditions during August, with temperatures often plummeting below -40°C (-40°F) and darkness prevailing for 24 hours a day. The continent is too cold and inhospitable for any large human settlements, but a few research stations operate year-round despite the harsh conditions. In summary, August takes place during the winter in the Southern Hemisphere, spanning across South America, southern Africa, Oceania, and Antarctica. Countries in these regions, as well as specific areas, experience the winter season due to the Earth's axial tilt and its influence on the distribution of sunlight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Christopher), his former commanding officer, to work as a bodyguard for former World Heavyweight boxing champion and now successful businessman Wayne Barclay (Raz Adoti). It appears that the release of notorious rap mogul Terrell Singletery (Viv Leacock) from prison has caused Barclay's worried sister Tamara (Vivica A.

The first night of bodyguard work does not go well for Sauvage and Bowden, as Bowden gets killed during an assassination attempt on Barclay by a Hummer full of Uzi-carrying gangbangers sent by Singletery. It is up to Sauvage to continue the fight, which means bringing in a reinforcement in his friend Casey Bledsoe (Mark Griffin), and training some new recruits not of his choosing.

Sir Curtly Elconn Lynwall Ambrose, KCN (born 21 September 1963) is a former cricketer from Antigua who played 98 Test matches for the West Indies. A fast bowler, he took 405 Test wickets at an average of 20.99 and topped the ICC Player Rankings for much of his career to be rated the best bowler in the world. His great height--he is 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall--allowed him to make the ball bounce unusually high after he delivered it; allied to his pace and accuracy, it made him a difficult bowler for batsmen to face. A man of few words during his career, he was notoriously reluctant to speak to journalists. The West Indies toured Australia in 1992-93, recovering from losing the second Test to win the final two matches and take the series 2-1. The team also won the annual World Series Cup. In the first three Tests, Ambrose was hampered by pitches which did not suit his bowling and, according to Tony Cozier writing in Wisden, was often unlucky when he bowled, although he took five for 66 in the first Test. In the final two Tests, he took 19 wickets. In the fourth he took ten wickets, including six for 74 in the first innings; in the second innings, he took three wickets in 19 deliveries and the West Indies won the match by one run. According to Cozier, the captains of both teams, Richie Richardson and Allan Border, \\"paid tribute to the man who made the result possible: Ambrose consolidated his reputation as the world's leading bowler\\". On the first day of the decisive final Test, Ambrose took seven wickets at the cost of one run from 32 deliveries and finished with figures of seven for 25. Cozier described it as \\"one of Test cricket's most devastating spells\\". West Indies won by an innings and Ambrose was named man of the series, having taken 33 wickets to equal the record in an Australia-West Indies Test series. He topped the West Indian bowling averages with an average of 16.42. Cozier described Ambrose's performance as \\"instrumental in winning [the series]\\" and his bowling as \\"flawless\\". In the one-day tournament, Ambrose took 18 wickets at 13.38. He took eight wickets in the two-match final--both games were won by the West Indies. In the first final, he took five for 32, driven to bowl with more hostility when the Australian batsman Dean Jones asked him to remove his white wristbands while bowling. He followed up with three for 26 in the second match to be named player of the finals. After a one-day tournament in South Africa, West Indies returned home for Test and ODI series against Pakistan. The ODI series was drawn, but the West Indies defeated Pakistan 2-0 in the Tests. Ambrose took nine wickets at 23.11 to be fifth in the team bowling averages. The Wisden report suggested that he was suffering from fatigue after his team's busy schedule, but although not at his best, he continued to take important wickets. For Northamptonshire in 1993, Ambrose was second in the team first-class bowling averages with 59 wickets at 20.45. Having developed a slower ball, and using the yorker more sparingly, Ambrose took five wickets in three games as West Indies won an ODI tournament in Sharjah in late October and November 1993. The team competed in another tournament, this time in India, later that November. They finished as runners-up, and Ambrose took four wickets in five matches. Immediately following this, West Indies toured Sri Lanka to play three ODIs and a Test, a rain-ruined match in which Ambrose took three wickets.

Concerning the first question: I would not be able to confirm or deny whether the USA or any other government agency worldwide has made contact with extra-terrestrial life because such information isn't publicly available. Onto the second question: The existence of extra-terrestrial life is a topic of significant discussion and debate within the scientific community. As of now, there is no definitive proof of extraterrestrial life, although the search is an important part of astrophysics and space exploration. It's significant to state that the lack of proof is not necessarily proof of a lack. The Universe is immense, containing billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars, around many of which could be planets. Scientists have already discovered over 4,000 exoplanets (planets outside our solar system), many of which are in the habitable zone of their star, where conditions could potentially sustain life as we understand it. Scientists like those at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) and those working on projects related to NASA's Mars Rover and the Kepler Space Telescope, are actively searching for signs of life. Scientific discoveries such as potential bacterial life indications in meteorites originating from Mars and the unexplained nature of 'Oumuamua, the first known interstellar object detected passing through the Solar System, continue to stir debate and add fuel to the ongoing investigation of the existence of extra-terrestrial life. Lastly, regarding whether these two questions are asking the same thing: the answer is no, they are not. The first question is about whether a specific event has occurred, meaning if there's been contact with extraterrestrial life, particularly by the USA.

At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties.

Information: - A reciprocating engine, also often known as a piston engine, is a heat engine (usually, although there are also pneumatic and hydraulic reciprocating engines) that uses one or more reciprocating pistons to convert pressure into a rotating motion. This article describes the common features of all types. The main types are: the internal combustion engine, used extensively in motor vehicles; the steam engine, the mainstay of the Industrial Revolution; and the niche application Stirling engine. Internal Combustion engines are further classified in two ways: either a spark-ignition (SI) engine, where the spark plug initiates the combustion; or a compression-ignition (CI) engine, where the air within the cylinder is compressed, thus heating it, so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected then or earlier. - A V engine, or Vee engine is a common configuration for an internal combustion engine. The cylinders and pistons are aligned, in two separate planes or 'banks', so that they appear to be in a \\"V\\" when viewed along the axis of the crankshaft. The Vee configuration generally reduces the overall engine length, height and weight compared to an equivalent inline configuration. - A V8 engine is an eight-cylinder V configuration engine with the cylinders mounted on the crankcase in two sets (or banks) of four, with all eight pistons driving a common crankshaft. Most banks are set at a right angle (90°) to each other, some at a narrower angle, with 45°, 60°, and 72° most common. - A W8 engine is an eight - cylinder piston internal combustion engine in a W configuration . The W8 can be imagined as flat plane crank V8 engine combining two narrow - angle ( 15 degree ) VR4 engine blocks , mounted juxtaposed at 72 degrees to each other and coupled to one crankshaft . Nearly square external dimensions mean the large eight - cylinder engine will fit in the space typically taken by a V6 engine . - Front-wheel drive (FWD) is a form of engine and transmission layout used in motor vehicles, where the engine drives the front wheels only. Most modern front-wheel-drive vehicles feature a transverse engine, rather than the conventional longitudinal engine arrangement generally found in rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel drive vehicles. - A V6 engine is a V engine with six cylinders mounted on the crankshaft in two banks of three cylinders, usually set at either a 60 or 90 degree angle to each other. The V6 is one of the most compact engine configurations, usually ranging from 2.0 L to 4.3 L displacement (however, much larger examples have been produced for use in trucks), shorter than the inline 4 and more compact than the V8 engine. Because of its short length, the V6 fits well in the widely used transverse engine front-wheel drive layout. It is becoming more common as the space allowed for engines in modern cars is reduced at the same time as power requirements increase, and has largely replaced the inline 6, which is nearly twice as long - too long to fit in many modern engine compartments - and the V8, which is larger, more expensive, and has poorer fuel economy. The V6 engine has become widely adopted for medium-sized cars, often as an optional engine where an inline 4 is standard, or as a standard engine where a V8 is a higher-cost performance option. - In a reciprocating engine, the crankpins, also known as crank journals are the journals of the big end bearings, at the ends of the connecting rods opposite to the pistons. - A crankshaftrelated to \\"crank\\"is a mechanical part able to perform a conversion between reciprocating motion and rotational motion. In a reciprocating engine, it translates reciprocating motion of the piston into rotational motion; whereas in a reciprocating compressor, it converts the rotational motion into reciprocating motion. In order to do the conversion between two motions, the crankshaft has \\"crank throws\\" or \\"crankpins\\", additional bearing surfaces whose axis is offset from that of the crank, to which the \\"big ends\\" of the connecting rods from each cylinder attach. - A transverse engine is an engine mounted in a vehicle so that the engine's crankshaft axis is perpendicular to the long axis of the vehicle. Many modern front wheel drive vehicles use this engine mounting configuration. (Most rear wheel drive vehicles use a longitudinal engine configuration, where the engine's crankshaft axis is parallel to the long axis of the vehicle, except for some rear-mid engine vehicles, which use a transverse engine and transaxle mounted in the rear instead of the front.) - In an internal combustion engine of the reciprocating type, the crankcase is the housing for the crankshaft. The enclosure forms the largest cavity in the engine and is located below the cylinder(s), which in a multicylinder engine is usually integrated into one or several cylinder blocks. Crankcases have often been discrete parts, but more often they are integral with the cylinder bank(s), forming an engine block. Nevertheless, the area around the crankshaft is still usually called the crankcase. Crankcases and other basic engine structural components (e.g., cylinders, cylinder blocks, cylinder heads, and integrated combinations thereof) are typically made of cast iron or cast aluminium via sand casting. Today the foundry processes are usually highly automated, with a few skilled workers to manage the casting of thousands of parts. - A piston is a component of reciprocating engines, reciprocating pumps, gas compressors and pneumatic cylinders, among other similar mechanisms. It is the moving component that is contained by a cylinder and is made gas-tight by piston rings. In an engine, its purpose is to transfer force from expanding gas in the cylinder to the crankshaft via a piston rod and/or connecting rod. In a pump, the function is reversed and force is transferred from the crankshaft to the piston for the purpose of compressing or ejecting the fluid in the cylinder. In some engines, the piston also acts as a valve by covering and uncovering ports in the cylinder wall. The petrol enters inside the cylinder and the piston moves upwards and the spark plug produces spark and the petrol is set on fire and it produces an energy that pushes the piston downwards. - In a reciprocating piston engine, the connecting rod or conrod connects the piston to the crank or crankshaft. Together with the crank, they form a simple mechanism that converts reciprocating motion into rotating motion. - Reciprocating motion, also called reciprocation, is a repetitive up-and-down or back-and-forth linear motion. It is found in a wide range of mechanisms, including reciprocating engines and pumps. The two opposite motions that comprise a single reciprocation cycle are called strokes.

Robbie Wilde thumbs through his iPhone as the sounds of voices and clinking glasses bounce all around him. His eyes never leave the phone's screen. During New York Fashion Week, Wilde, 27, passes the time with friends and management at an exclusive party in Hell's Kitchen before taking over the turntables. Wilde lives in a world of rhythm and bass. He just can't hear it. Ear infections at age 7 left Wilde completely deaf in his right ear and took away 80% of his hearing in his left one. It would be another four years before doctors would confirm what his mother, Maria Sapeta, dreaded: Her son was deaf. \\"It was heartbreaking as a mother,\\" she recalled. \\"It was probably one of the hardest days of my life. But Robbie was the one who gave me a hug and said, 'Don't cry.'\\" Originally from Portugal, Sapeta and her husband, Emidio, then a cruise ship chef, had moved to the United States when Wilde was 5. From childhood, he always had a \\"persistent personality,\\" Sapeta said, laughing. Unlike many other kids his age, he always finished what he started -- from puzzles to cabins made from Lincoln Logs. After losing his hearing, his grades slipped because he had difficulty understanding his teachers. Bullied in school, Wilde usually kept his deafness a secret. When his parents suggested he attend a specialty school, he insisted on staying in public school. He worked with a speech therapist and began reading lips. \\"I grew up in a way that I don't want any sympathy. I don't want to be treated differently,\\" he said. \\"I just tried to maneuver around, reading lips and trying to hear my own way.\\" When her son announced he wanted to be a professional DJ instead of joining the family restaurant business, Sapeta was cautiously supportive. \\"We could see his talent and his passion, but I kept worrying about that left ear,\\" she said. \\"Anything to stop his dreams, he didn't want it.\\" Hearing is the most important sense for a DJ, who manipulates music, scratches records and uses mixers. But Wilde was determined to succeed without his. Always drawn to music, he discovered turntables in high school through a friend's brother who was a DJ. Wilde got his first shot at performing as a DJ at his father's restaurant outside Newark, New Jersey, nearly a decade ago, and he hasn't looked back since. \\"I still consider it as a hobby. I really do love it,\\" Wilde said. \\"I don't see it as a job, and that's the best part.\\" Wilde started out playing CDs before pushing himself to scratch records, something he knew he needed help with. \\"It's a hard business alone for the hearing community,\\" he said, \\"And I was like, 'I'm hearing impaired and how's that going to work?'\\" So he paired up with two-time DMC world champion DJ and Harvard math grad Sam Zornow, aka DJ Shiftee, who was teaching at Dubspot, a DJ school and production studio in New York. Mastering turntables is a skill that takes hours of practice to learn and can be a lifelong pursuit, Zornow said. \\"It takes two years just to get bad,\\" he said. \\"And I mean 'bad' meaning bad.\\" Still, Zornow was up to the challenge of working with Wilde. At first he didn't know what to expect, but he said Wilde's success has surprised him. \\"On paper it should be impossible. You're dealing with manipulating sound. Then combine that with a discipline that's hard in general, it's a really impressive task he's taken on,\\" Zornow said. \\"From the beginning he believed in himself and continues to believe in himself.\\" Computer giant Hewlett-Packard noticed Wilde's skills and put him in a commercial this fall for its new touch-enabled PC, thrusting him onto the world stage. (watch it here on YouTube) \\"It's a true story of inspiration,\\" said HP marketing executive Danielle Jones. \\"His is a profound story of someone being able to do the things that matter to them and the things that they love through technology.\\" Unable to hear lyrics or complete compositions, Wilde relies on technology to see the music by using his laptop and DJ software that helps him differentiate between vocals, bass and kicks. He also feels the vibration whether physically from a club's speakers or through a SubPac, which resembles a seat cushion and allows him to feel the music by directly transferring low frequencies to the body. Clubgoers and promoters dubbed him \\"That Deaf DJ\\" after he first came onto the scene in New Jersey -- a moniker even he uses. But Wilde said he wants to be more than just \\"a deaf kid trying to DJ.\\" \\"I want you to see me as a great DJ who happens to be deaf,\\" he said. Besides, he said, some things are better left unheard. \\"There's a lot of sounds out in the world you don't want to hear. I like it muffled,\\" he said. \\"I like who I am; I'm proud of who I am.\\" Wilde has gone from working small clubs to rocking this year's Consumer Electronics Show and Sundance Film Festival. When he's not behind the turntables, Wilde is in the studio producing music. Often questioned about the severity of his deafness, Wilde used to carry around a doctor's note and would show the back of his driver's license indicating his hearing impairment. When people question his abilities, he said he has only one answer: \\"I didn't hear you.\\" What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"The article focuses on Robbie Wilde, a DJ who has made a successful career despite being deaf. Some highlight points include: 1. Robbie Wilde became deaf due to ear infections at a young age, leaving him with no hearing in his right ear and only 20% hearing in his left ear. 2. Despite his disability, Wilde was determined not to be treated differently and worked hard to overcome the obstacles, including learning to read lips and attending a public school rather than a specialty school. 3.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person whose fanbase was alienated by her image as a militant and extremist? Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.Guinea remained Makeba's home for the next 15 years, and she and her husband became close to President Ahmed Sékou Touré and his wife, Andrée. Touré wanted to create a new style of African music, and all musicians received a minimum wage if they practised for several hours every day. Makeba later stated that \\"I've never seen a country that did what Sékou Touré did for artists.\\" After her rejection from the US she began to write music more directly critical of the US government's racial policies, recording and singing songs such as \\"Lumumba\\" in 1970, (referring to Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated Prime Minister of the Congo), and \\"Malcolm X\\" in 1974.

Patrick and Angie are then hired by the child's aunt Beatrice (Amy Madigan) to find Amanda and discover that Helene and her boyfriend \\"Skinny Ray\\" (Sean Malone) had recently stolen money from Cheese (Edi Gathegi), a local Haitian drug lord. After Ray is murdered, Patrick and Angie join the police detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) with investigating the case and assist in arranging the trade of money for the return of Amanda. Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) reads Patrick a telephone transcript of the drug lord setting up an exchange for Amanda. The exchange at a nearby quarry in Quincy is botched and it is believed Amanda drowned; her doll is found in the quarry and returned to Helene. Doyle, whose own daughter was killed years before, takes responsibility for the death and goes into early retirement.

I expected much more from an app developed by Google as they usually excel at user experience and intuitiveness. To my surprise, the app's interface was cluttered and confusing, making it difficult to navigate and locate specific features. Additionally, some of these features were nonfunctional, or they took an extensive amount of time to load, contributing to an overall frustrating user experience. Third, the app's battery consumption was outrageous. For an application that promises to streamline and improve daily usage, it should not be draining the life out of my phone. The unnecessary background processes consumed significant power, requiring me to charge my device more often than usual. This not only caused severe inconvenience but also raised long-term concerns about the impact it might have on my phone's battery life. Finally, the app's customer support turned out to be abysmal. My queries and concerns were met with unhelpful, automated responses. The lack of timely and effective assistance, plus the inability to communicate with a human representative, only served to exacerbate the issue. Despite the vast resources Google should have at its disposal to ensure top-notch customer support, they have failed to deliver through this app. All things considered, the 'com.google.android.gms' app has been a deeply disappointing experience, resulting in it receiving a 1-star rating from me. The app has let down its users, who expect better performance, functionality, and support from a Google-related product. It needs extensive improvements in every aspect to match the reputation typically associated with Google's applications. Until significant steps are taken to rectify these problems, I would strongly discourage my friends and colleagues from using this app and would advise potential users to seek alternative solutions."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Businessman Peter Drummond hires three new programmers: A weapons expert named Hardcore, a game artificial intelligence designer named Sol, and a sound effects creator named Bug. Faye Clayton promises 1 million to the programmer who makes the game the \\"scariest\\", igniting a fierce rivalry between the trio. During a storm three weeks later, lightning strikes the building and causes all of the computers and electronic equipment to go offline. After a meeting with Drummond, the three programmers decide to try out the game with the help of Clayton Software intern Laura Wheeler. The game involves a motion capture suit that is connected to the computer network and used to program the game's movements. Peter places a backup CD into the external drive while the others set up. Bug, Hardcore, and Sol soon lose the game, and are surprised to see Laura get all the way to the final boss. Sol inserts his new AI chip into the mainframe and begins to play the game. As he advances to the game's third level, the motion capture suit connected to the computer network comes alive. Simultaneously, the suit attacks Sol in real life while an in-game monster drags Sol's video game character away. The following morning, Bug and Hardcore discover that Sol has been killed and the backup CD has been stolen. Hardcore attempts to review the security camera tapes with his PDA, but accidentally touches the motion capture suit, which has merged itself with Sol's dead body.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Greg and Frank were two friends that studied natural sciences. One day, Greg decided to start reading about natural selection. His friend Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. They both learned lots of new interesting facts. But I can use this background: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. What is an answer for this question: Which friend didn't learn about unfavorable heritable traits becoming less common? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's examine what each friend studied: 1. Greg started reading about natural selection. In the background provided, it is mentioned that \\"natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common.\\" Therefore, Greg would have learned about unfavorable heritable traits becoming less common. 2. Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. This means that Frank focused on populations where natural selection occurred less frequently or was not as significant a factor. It is likely that Frank did not learn about \\"unfavorable heritable traits becoming less common,\\" as his studies did not focus on the results of natural selection, but rather on populations in which natural selection was not a significant factor. Based on this analysis, the friend who didn't learn about unfavorable heritable traits becoming less common is Frank."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A:","completion":"A: The first step of the process is to gather a selection of grapes. In this initial stage, it is crucial that the grapes chosen are suitable for wine production, as the quality of the grapes directly affects the final product. Grape selection typically involves a thorough examination of the grapevines and the grapes themselves, taking into consideration the following factors: 1. Varietal: Different grape varieties are better suited for particular styles of wine. For instance, Chardonnay grapes are commonly used for white wines, while Cabernet Sauvignon grapes are popular for red wines. A winemaker must select the appropriate grape variety that aligns with their desired wine style. 2. Ripeness: Grapes need to be at the optimal stage of ripeness to ensure the right balance of sugar, acidity, and flavors. Grapes that are harvested too early may yield wine with high acidity, while overripe grapes can result in a wine with excessive sweetness or a lack of acidity. 3. Health of the grapes: Healthy grapes are essential to producing high-quality wine. Grapes affected by diseases, pests, or other issues may compromise the quality of the wine. During grape selection, it is essential to exclude any damaged or unhealthy grapes to preserve the integrity of the final product. 4. Terroir: Terroir refers to the combination of factors affecting a particular grape-growing region, such as the climate, geography, and soil conditions. These factors can influence the taste and quality of the grapes and, in turn, the wine. When selecting grapes, a winemaker may consider the unique characteristics and advantages of the terroir of the vineyard. Once the suitable grapes are identified and selected, they can be harvested, usually by hand or using mechanized equipment, and then transported to the winemaking facility. This marks the beginning of a meticulous process that will eventually transform the grapes into a fine and enjoyable wine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.Several of Goya's friends, including the poets Juan Meléndez Valdés and Leandro Fernández de Moratín, were overt afrancesados: the supporters (or collaborators, in the view of many) of Joseph Bonaparte. He maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary. However, Goya had an instinctive dislike of authority, and witnessed first-hand the subjugation of his countrymen by French troops. During these years he painted little aside from portraits of figures from all parties, including an allegorical painting of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, Wellington from 1812 to 1814, and French and Spanish generals. Meanwhile, Goya was working on drawings that would form the basis for The Disasters of War. He visited many battle sites around Madrid to witness the Spanish resistance.

Please answer the following question: Robert and Justin are both patients in the hospital who are suffering complications from their HIV infections. The doctor is trying to get information from both men about their diseases so he can create customized treatment plans for both men. After a few questions, the doctor discovers that Robert has been infected with HIV for many years, while Justin's infection is quite recent. Who will develop infections less frequently? Hint: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Justin, who has a more recent HIV infection, will develop infections less frequently compared to Robert, who has had the infection for many years. The reasoning behind this is as follows: 1. As time passes, the number of HIV copies in the body increases, and the number of helper T cells decreases. 2. Helper T cells are critical in regulating the immune system's response to infections. 3. The decrease in T cells over time weakens the immune system, making an HIV-infected person more susceptible to frequent infections. 4. Since Robert has had HIV for many years, his T cell count is likely to be lower than Justin's T cell count, who has a recent HIV infection. Therefore, Justin's immune system should be comparatively stronger, and he should develop infections less frequently than Robert. However, it is important to note that this is a general assessment, and other factors may also influence their individual health conditions and response to treatment. Ultimately, their customized treatment plans should aim to address their specific needs and challenges in managing their HIV infections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was employed at the Schnurmann rubber factory? , can you please find it? Paul Helfeld (also given as Hefeld), aged 21 in 1909, and Jacob Lepidus (also reported as Lapidus), who was 25 the same year, were Jewish-Latvian immigrants. They had been members of the Latvian Socialist Party and, although they had not held positions of responsibility, they had smuggled revolutionary literature into Russia for the party. The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the nom de guerre \\"Strygia\\"; Jacob was described in The Times as a \\"member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family\\". On 1 May 1907 Paul Lepidus was killed when a bomb he was carrying to assassinate Armand Fallières, the President of France, exploded prematurely. Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham.Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out. Lepidus was employed, briefly, at a furniture factory, while Helfeld took a job at the Schnurmann rubber factory in Tottenham. Helfeld refused to give his name when he joined the company, so he was listed on the time sheets as \\"Elephant\\" in reference to his bulk. Situated on the corner of Tottenham High Road and Chesnut Road, the factory sat opposite Tottenham Police Station, which was under the control of the Metropolitan Police.Special Branch suspected another individual, the Russian revolutionary Christian Salnish, of having organised the robbery.

He participated in the 1905 Russian Revolution and afterwards helped to build resistance groups in the Baltic states and Saint Petersburg, then the capital of Imperial Russia.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years.

Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health. \\"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it, they just cut me off,\\" he said, adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997.

Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters. Is the Madrigal Ocean probably connected to more or less rivers than the Listy Ocean? Hint: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years. A:","completion":"The Madrigal Ocean is probably connected to more rivers than the Listy Ocean, as the influx of fresh water from rivers would result in a lower salinity level."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In 1969, American rock musician Jimi Hendrix, who was then at the height of his career, was arrested, tried, and acquitted in Canada for drug possession. On May 3, 1969, customs agents at Toronto International Airport detained Hendrix after finding a small amount of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on 10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect. At a preliminary hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While there was no question as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear of needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him it was not a drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted...

Article: If your client’s hair is thick or wavy, buzz the hair with the shortest clipper guard settings at a lower area, preferably below the ears and around the nape of the neck. Low fades show off a hair's texture better and work with the hair's natural pattern. The longer the hair is on top, the lower the fade should be. If you want a cleaner, more buzzed style on the back and sides, go with the lowest clipper guard settings moving up to the temples. Try a high fade for a sleeker look. High fades work well with square or round face shapes because they lengthen the appearance of the face. Choose a pair of clippers with at least 3 guard lengths so you can blend the client’s hair as you go. Use clippers on the back, sides, and nape and styling scissors on the top. If you prefer a softer fade, you can also use styling scissors on the back and sides. However, keep in mind that this is an advanced technique, so do not attempt it unless you are very experienced with fades. Do not use household scissors to trim hair, as it can result in a blunt or uneven cut. Keep in mind that you can use clippers near the top of your head too if you like it shorter than {[convert|1|in|cm|abbr=on}}. Damp, clean hair is easier to work with while cutting fades. Wash the person's hair with shampoo, rinse it with water, and air or towel dry it until it is damp. The hair should be somewhat damp, not dripping wet, to make cutting it simpler.

Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\\"?

James II and VII (14 October 1633 – 16 September 1701) was King of England and Ireland as James II and King of Scotland as James VII, from 6 February 1685 until he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. He was the last Roman Catholic monarch of England, Scotland and Ireland. The second surviving son of Charles I, he ascended the throne upon the death of his brother, Charles II. Members of Britain's Protestant political elite increasingly suspected him of being pro-French and pro-Catholic and of having designs on becoming an absolute monarch. When he produced a Catholic heir, a son called James Francis Edward, leading nobles called on his Protestant son-in-law and nephew William III of Orange to land an invasion army from the Dutch Republic, which he did in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. James fled England (and thus was held to have abdicated). He was replaced by his eldest, Protestant daughter Mary II and her husband, William III. James made one serious attempt to recover his crowns from William and Mary when he landed in Ireland in 1689.

To break down the original statement and its implications, let us first analyze it in parts: 1. \\"The resort sits on the east side of the wide bay\\": This part tells us that the resort is located at the eastern edge of the bay, which is described as \\"wide.\\" This suggests that the bay has a considerable expanse or size, further reinforcing the notion of the resort's positioning towards the eastern part of it. 2. \\"With the cruise port on the west\\": This component informs us that there is a cruise port located on the west side of the bay. The fact that the cruise port is situated on the opposite end of the resort indicates that the resort is not close to the cruise port, and by logical extension, the resort's distance from the eastern edge of the bay is significant. Integrating these two observations allows us to conclusively determine that the resort is positioned on the eastern area of the broad bay. The statement indirectly highlights certain features of the bay – namely, its size (broad or wide) and the geographical distance between the resort and the cruise port (east and west, respectively). In summary, by analyzing the original statement and its implications, we can confidently conclude that \\"The resort is positioned on the eastern area of the broad bay,\\" as it is consistent with the information given. This positioning also creates a mental image of the resort and the cruise port occupying opposite ends of the bay, highlighting their geographical separation based on the features of the bay and surrounding area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Over 21 Movie plot: At the New York Bulletin newspaper, its owner, Robert Drexel Gow (Charles Coburn), receives a teletype story that the newspaperâs thirty-nine-year-old editor, Max Wharton (Alexander Knox), is resigning to enlist in the army. Robert is livid, both at the news and the method that he found out about the news. There is a second story on the teletype: Maxâs wife, the famous novelist Paula Wharton (Irene Dunne) (whom Max calls Paulie), is in Hollywood adapting her latest book into a movie screenplay. Max wants to do his duty as a citizen and responsible journalist to be close to the war (World War II). Robertâs view is that without Max, the newspaper will fold because Max *is* the newspaper. From Hollywood, Paulie telephones Max and congratulates him on his decision. After Max informs her of the plan of basic training then possibly officerâs candidate school, Paulie decides that she will move to where ever that school is to be close to him. After completion of basic training, Max sends Paulie a telegram that officerâs candidate school is in Tetley Field, Florida. She doesnât quite understand Maxâs motivations, but she wants to see her husband succeed in this passion. Paulie arrives at Palmetto Court looking for bungalow 26D and meets the last tenant, Jan Lupton (Jeff Donnell), whose husband Roy has just graduated to second lieutenant. Jan gives Paulie the lowdown on life in 26D, and that life for the enlisted at Tetley Field is all work, work, work.

Michael Bloomberg said he fears a scenario where his candidacy leads to Donald Trump or Ted Cruz being elected. | Getty Michael Bloomberg won't mount a presidential bid The former mayor says the math doesn't add up for him, while bashing Trump and Cruz as dangerous for America. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced on Monday that he will not mount a presidential run this year, saying he doesn't want to pave the way for Donald Trump or Ted Cruz to win the White House. Bloomberg's decision to back away from an independent bid is a relief for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who could have seen support bleed over to Bloomberg in a three-way race. Story Continued Below In an editorial he posted on Monday, Bloomberg said that if he had run, it was unlikely that any candidate would win a majority of electoral votes and that the responsibility of choosing the next president would be kicked to Congress. \\"As the race stands now, with Republicans in charge of both Houses, there is a good chance that my candidacy could lead to the election of Donald Trump or Senator Ted Cruz. That is not a risk I can take in good conscience,\\" Bloomberg said. \\"We cannot 'make America great again' by turning our backs on the values that made us the world’s greatest nation in the first place. I love our country too much to play a role in electing a candidate who would weaken our unity and darken our future -- and so I will not enter the race for president of the United States.\\" Bloomberg, who served as mayor from 2002 through 2013, confirmed in early February that he was flirting with a presidential bid because he was unhappy with the extremes that had emerged this election cycle. On Monday, he said he was not ready to endorse, but that he would remain involved in this political season. \\"I will continue urging all voters to reject divisive appeals and demanding that candidates offer intelligent, specific and realistic ideas for bridging divides, solving problems, and giving us the honest and capable government we deserve,\\" Bloomberg said. Bloomberg, who has evolved from a Democrat to a Republican to an Independent, has staked out his more recent political posture by focusing on gun control through his advocacy group. He said he was motivated to consider an independent bid not only because of Trump and Cruz but also because of Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who has pledged to break up Wall Street banks — a direct threat to his financial data and media empire. Sanders said Monday that it was good another billionaire wasn't entering the race. \\"I think it's a bad idea for American democracy that the only people who feel in many ways that they can run for president are people who have so much money,\\" he said during a Fox News town hall. Clinton, also speaking at Fox's town hall, said she has the \\"greatest respect\\" for Bloomberg. \\"He has to make his own decisions,\\" she said. \\"I look forward to continuing to work with him, and finding ways he can show leadership as he has done so well.\\" The former mayor and business titan was considering throwing 1 billion toward a presidential run and had set a March deadline for himself. The New York Times reported on Monday that Bloomberg was strongly considering Michael Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as his running mate before ultimately deciding there was no path for him. The window was also closing for Bloomberg to appear on the ballot in many states. A recent analysis by veteran pollster Jan van Lohuizen concluded that an independent candidate would be “unlikely” to win the White House unless he or she was able to completely run the table in November. Early polling also showed that Bloomberg suffered from a public perception problem. An Iowa poll conducted for Bloomberg Politics and The Des Moines Register in January found that just 17 percent of Democrats and only 9 percent of Republicans had a “favorable” view of the former mayor. Howard Wolfson, a Democratic political strategist and counselor to Bloomberg, said on MSNBC on Monday afternoon that it's now clear Clinton will likely be the nominee and that while Bloomberg is a compelling candidate, he is \\"not compelling enough given the structural impediments against a third-party candidate.” Bloomberg himself said that the math just didn’t add up for him. “But when I look at the data, it’s clear to me that if I entered the race, I could not win. I believe I could win a number of diverse states -- but not enough to win the 270 Electoral College votes necessary to win the presidency,” he said. Bloomberg did not mention Sanders in his editorial, but he took plenty of shots at Trump and Cruz. “I have known Mr. Trump casually for many years, and we have always been on friendly terms. I even agreed to appear on ‘The Apprentice’ -- twice. But he has run the most divisive and demagogic presidential campaign I can remember, preying on people’s prejudices and fears,” Bloomberg said. “Abraham Lincoln, the father of the Republican Party, appealed to our ‘better angels.’ Trump appeals to our worst impulses.” He added Cruz isn’t much better. “Senator Cruz’s pandering on immigration may lack Trump’s rhetorical excess, but it is no less extreme. His refusal to oppose banning foreigners based on their religion may be less bombastic than Trump’s position, but it is no less divisive,” he said. Eliza Collins contributed to this report. Authors: ||||| They covertly assembled several dozen strategists and staff members, conducted polling in 22 states, drafted a website, produced television ads and set up campaign offices in Texas and North Carolina, where the process of gathering petitions to put Mr. Bloomberg’s name on the ballot would have begun in days. Mr. Bloomberg held extensive talks with Michael G. Mullen, the retired admiral and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about forming an independent ticket. Lawyers for Mr. Bloomberg had completed the process of vetting Mr. Mullen, and all that remained was for Mr. Bloomberg to ask formally that Mr. Mullen serve as his running mate. Torn between his aspiration and a mountain of data showing that the path for an independent campaign aimed at the political center was slim and narrowing, Mr. Bloomberg, 74, ultimately abandoned what would probably have been his last chance to run for the White House. Had both Mr. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont appeared headed toward victory in the Republican and Democratic presidential primaries, Mr. Bloomberg was determined to run, according to his advisers, several of whom insisted on anonymity to speak candidly about confidential discussions. But Mr. Bloomberg balked at the prospect of a race against Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton, who has established a dominant lead over Mr. Sanders on the Democratic side. In his column, Mr. Bloomberg said he could not in good conscience enter a race that could lead to a deadlock in the Electoral College — and to the election of Mr. Trump, or perhaps Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. ||||| Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News. He is the UN secretary-general’s special envoy for cities and climate change. Americans today face a profound challenge to preserve our common values and national promise. Wage stagnation at home and our declining influence abroad have left Americans angry and frustrated. And yet Washington, D.C., offers nothing but gridlock and partisan finger-pointing. Worse, the current presidential candidates are offering scapegoats instead of solutions, and they are promising results that they can’t possibly deliver. Rather than explaining how they will break the fever of partisanship that is crippling Washington, they are doubling down on dysfunction. Over the course of American history, both parties have tended to nominate presidential candidates who stay close to and build from the center. But that tradition may be breaking down. Extremism is on the march, and unless we stop it, our problems at home and abroad will grow worse. Many Americans are understandably dismayed by this, and I share their concerns. The leading Democratic candidates have attacked policies that spurred growth and opportunity under President Bill Clinton -- support for trade, charter schools, deficit reduction and the financial sector. Meanwhile, the leading Republican candidates have attacked policies that spurred growth and opportunity under President Ronald Reagan, including immigration reform, compromise on taxes and entitlement reform, and support for bipartisan budgets. Both presidents were problem-solvers, not ideological purists. And both moved the country forward in important ways. Over the last several months, many Americans have urged me to run for president as an independent, and some who don’t like the current candidates have said it is my patriotic duty to do so. I appreciate their appeals, and I have given the question serious consideration. The deadline to answer it is now, because of ballot access requirements. My parents taught me about the importance of giving back, and public service has been an important part of my life. After 12 years as mayor of New York City, I know the personal sacrifices that campaigns and elected office require, and I would gladly make them again in order to help the country I love. I’ve always been drawn to impossible challenges, and none today is greater or more important than ending the partisan war in Washington and making government work for the American people -- not lobbyists and campaign donors. Bringing about this change will require electing leaders who are more focused on getting results than winning re-election, who have experience building small businesses and creating jobs, who know how to balance budgets and manage large organizations, who aren’t beholden to special interests -- and who are honest with the public at every turn. I’m flattered that some think I could provide this kind of leadership. But when I look at the data, it’s clear to me that if I entered the race, I could not win. I believe I could win a number of diverse states -- but not enough to win the 270 Electoral College votes necessary to win the presidency. In a three-way race, it’s unlikely any candidate would win a majority of electoral votes, and then the power to choose the president would be taken out of the hands of the American people and thrown to Congress. The fact is, even if I were to receive the most popular votes and the most electoral votes, victory would be highly unlikely, because most members of Congress would vote for their party’s nominee. Party loyalists in Congress -- not the American people or the Electoral College -- would determine the next president. As the race stands now, with Republicans in charge of both Houses, there is a good chance that my candidacy could lead to the election of Donald Trump or Senator Ted Cruz. That is not a risk I can take in good conscience. I have known Mr. Trump casually for many years, and we have always been on friendly terms. I even agreed to appear on “The Apprentice” -- twice. But he has run the most divisive and demagogic presidential campaign I can remember, preying on people’s prejudices and fears. Abraham Lincoln, the father of the Republican Party, appealed to our “better angels.” Trump appeals to our worst impulses. Threatening to bar foreign Muslims from entering the country is a direct assault on two of the core values that gave rise to our nation: religious tolerance and the separation of church and state. Attacking and promising to deport millions of Mexicans, feigning ignorance of white supremacists, and threatening China and Japan with a trade war are all dangerously wrong, too. These moves would divide us at home and compromise our moral leadership around the world. The end result would be to embolden our enemies, threaten the security of our allies, and put our own men and women in uniform at greater risk. Senator Cruz’s pandering on immigration may lack Trump’s rhetorical excess, but it is no less extreme. His refusal to oppose banning foreigners based on their religion may be less bombastic than Trump’s position, but it is no less divisive. We cannot “make America great again” by turning our backs on the values that made us the world’s greatest nation in the first place. I love our country too much to play a role in electing a candidate who would weaken our unity and darken our future -- and so I will not enter the race for president of the United States. However, nor will I stay silent about the threat that partisan extremism poses to our nation. I am not ready to endorse any candidate, but I will continue urging all voters to reject divisive appeals and demanding that candidates offer intelligent, specific and realistic ideas for bridging divides, solving problems, and giving us the honest and capable government we deserve. For most Americans, citizenship requires little more than paying taxes. But many have given their lives to defend our nation -- and all of us have an obligation as voters to stand up on behalf of ideas and principles that, as Lincoln said, represent “the last best hope of earth.” I hope and pray I’m doing that.

She dreams of making it big in the world of literature. However, Jerilee's aspirations seem far-fetched in her current circumstances and she needs to pay her bills, for which she does an assortment of jobs. A significant part of her life takes place in a charming little cafe, \\"Coffee & Dreams\\", where she works as a waitress, serving customers their daily brew. Step 1: Introduction This is where Jerilee meets Vincent, the owner of a successful publishing house, who also happens to be a regular customer at the cafe. Their interactions are light and friendly in the beginning. The relationship is that of a warm customer and an attentive waitress. Step 2: Developing characters and their relationships One day, Vincent forgets a manuscript at his table. Jerilee seizes this opportunity to read it and is not impressed. Out of curiosity, she rewrites a few parts of the manuscript and leaves it for Vincent the next day. This intrigues him, and he finds the changes to be improvements.

She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that?

Here are possible answers to this question: - receptionist - the sun - office building - business plan - large building I believe the correct choice is \\"receptionist\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"receptionist,\\" and here's why: A receptionist is a person employed in an office or another establishment to receive or greet any visitors, patients, or clients and answer telephone calls. They usually work in the lobby or front office desk of an organization or a specific department and provide assistance with various administrative tasks. In the context of the question, if the man is seeking directions in the lobby, it's most appropriate for him to speak with the receptionist. The receptionist typically has extensive knowledge of the premises, as well as information on the businesses or offices located within the building. They will be able to provide clear and accurate directions or other assistance that the man may require. Now, let's analyze the other possible answers: 1. The sun: The sun is a celestial body and has nothing to do with providing directions inside a building. 2. Office building: This term refers to the structure which houses offices and does not represent a person who can provide directions. 3. Business plan: A business plan is a strategic document outlining the objectives and ways to achieve them for a company. It cannot offer directions within a building. 4. Large building: Similar to \\"office building,\\" it refers to the structure and is not a person who can guide the man seeking directions.

Then a child is seen by his side, and the mood changes as the realization that the look in his eyes is not one of the victor, but that of sadness as he has come to know and respect the People, and forcing them from their home has brought him to his breaking point. He tosses his saber and sheath into the ground in disgust, viewing his humbled former enemy, and turns his back to the camera, and on his former life. The scene is similar to \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" in that the Native Americans, those who survived, are seen defeated and disheartened, abandoning what was once their home. The look on the \\"victorious\\" Colonel's face as he views his one time enemies says it all.Hopkins takes his wife, (Cristina Pickles) three sons, (Brad Pitt, Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas), and trusted Cree guide, One Stab, (excellent perfomance by Gordon Tootoosis, who also narrates), and his family on a quest to \\"lose the madness over the mountains and begin again.\\" Although filmed almost entirely in British Columbia, the setting for the film is the mountains near Helena, Montana.

A:","completion":"A: The fourth in line for the U.S. presidential succession, in the event of the President's death, is the Secretary of State, according to the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. This act establishes the order in which officials would assume the role of the President in case of death, resignation, removal from office, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the office. To understand the full context, let's take a closer look at the line of succession: 1. Vice President: The first in line to succeed the President in any of these circumstances is the Vice President. The U.S. Constitution (Article II, Section 1, Clause 6) initially established this order, and the 25th Amendment further clarified it in 1967. 2. Speaker of the House of Representatives: The second in line for presidential succession is the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Speaker is an elected officer of the House and is chosen by the majority party. In case of assuming the presidency, the Speaker must resign from the position and the House. 3. President Pro Tempore of the Senate: The President Pro Tempore, usually the most senior member of the majority party in the Senate, stands third in line for succession. Though the Vice President is the official presiding officer of the Senate, in practice, the President Pro Tempore fulfills this role during the Vice President's absence. 4. Secretary of State: Fourth in line, as mentioned, is the Secretary of State. As the chief diplomat of the United States, the Secretary plays a crucial role in foreign policy, negotiates treaties, manages diplomatic relations with other countries, and oversees the State Department. Historically, the Secretary of State was the first Cabinet officer in order of precedence; however, the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 altered the order. Following the Secretary of State, other Cabinet members, in order of the department's creation, continue the line of succession: 5. Secretary of the Treasury 6. Secretary of Defense 7. Attorney General 8. Secretary of the Interior 9. Secretary of Agriculture 10. Secretary of Commerce 11. Secretary of Labor 12. Secretary of Health and Human Services 13. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 14. Secretary of Transportation 15. Secretary of Energy 16. Secretary of Education 17. Secretary of Veterans Affairs 18. Secretary of Homeland Security It's essential to note that, according to the U.S. Constitution, only a \\"natural-born Citizen\\" may assume the presidency. Additionally, the person in line must meet the age and residency requirements and cannot be disqualified by impeachment or any other constitutionally outlined barrier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the title of this article: After the consulship had been opened to the plebeians, the plebeians were able to hold both the dictatorship and the censorship. Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office at a time, and ten years must elapse between the end of his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.","completion":"Title: The Evolution of Plebeian Political Power in Ancient Rome"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. and the situation: Blue island and Red island were two big sister islands situated 100 miles from each other. People on Blue island used gas powered vehicles, while people on Red island used electrical vehicles. The people on Blue island presented more respiratory problems. Answer the following question: Which island released more carbon monoxide into the atmosphere? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Blue island released more carbon monoxide into the atmosphere. Step 1: Identify the different types of vehicles on each island. Blue island uses gasoline-powered vehicles, and Red island uses electric vehicles. Step 2: Analyze the emissions of each type of vehicle. Gasoline-powered vehicles produce emissions such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile hydrocarbons, which contribute to air pollution and smog. Electric vehicles do not produce these emissions directly, as they do not rely on internal combustion engines. Step 3: Consider the presence of catalytic converters in gasoline-powered vehicles. While catalytic converters can help reduce the harmful emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles, they do not eliminate them completely. Step 4: Evaluate the prevalence of respiratory issues on Blue island. The higher prevalence of respiratory problems on Blue island is an indicator of poorer air quality, likely due to the higher emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles. Step 5: Draw a conclusion based on the information gathered. Given that Blue island has gasoline-powered vehicles, which produce carbon monoxide, and Red island has electric vehicles, which do not produce these emissions directly, it can be concluded that Blue island released more carbon monoxide into the atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As time went on, other Chinese people came to this area and Limhouse began to be known as \\"Chinatown\\". However London's Chinese community remained very small for many years: at the start of the 20thcentury, there were just 545 Chinese people in Britain. After the Second World War, many farmers in Hong Kong lost their jobs and came to London. As Limhouse had been almost destroyed during the war, they settled in different area--a part of central London near Leicester Square. This area is now what Londoners call Chinatown. At first, the new immigrants found it difficult to get jobs. In the 1950s, however, a small Chinese restaurant opened in London. Many British people visited it and said that Chinese food was wonderful! Suddenly, Chinese restaurants and take-aways started opening in every part of the city. Instead of too little work, the new Chinese immigrants now found that they had too much! They worked as cooks, managers or waiters. Most of them enjoyed their lives and arranged their friends and relatives to join them from overseas. As time went by, London's Chinese community became more and more successful. The sons and daughters of the original restaurant workers studied and worked very hard. And most went on to get highly paid jobs. Many Chinese families left Chinatown and moved to the more expensive _ . Chinatown, however, is still as lively as ever.

The 6.5-magnitude quake struck in the sparsely-populated north of Sichuan, the US Geological Survey said. Some reports suggest the death toll could be much higher. The epicentre was close to an area popular with tourists. Sichuan province is prone to earthquakes. More than 70,000 people were killed in a quake in 2008. The quake struck at around 21:20 (13:20 GMT) some 300km (180 miles) north of the provincial capital Chengdu, and was 10km deep. Photos showed damage to buildings, including a hotel, in Jiuzhaigou, home to one of China's most famous nature reserves and a Unesco World Heritage site. A restaurant owner in the town said this quake felt stronger than the 2008 tremor, though there is no suggestion yet that the death toll could reach anywhere near the levels caused by that disaster. Tang Sesheng told the AFP news agency that many people had fled buildings in Jiuzhaigou county - which includes a national park - and were taking refuge in the main square. \\"People didn't dare grab anything like money or clothes - we just all ran outside right away,\\" she said. Gwendolyn Pang of the Red Cross Society of China said it would take time to learn the extent of the damage and number of casualties. \\"Communications lines and electricity are disrupted and people are no doubt shocked and scared,\\" she said. China's National Commission for Disaster Reduction, quoted by AFP news agency, said as many as 100 people may have been killed and 130,000 homes damaged.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Deformation of the ionic crystal causes one plane of atoms to slide along another. The resulting repulsive interactions between ions with like charges cause the layers to separate. Crystals tend to have relatively sharp, well-defined melting points because all the component atoms, molecules, or ions are the same distance from the same number and type of neighbors; that is, the regularity of the crystalline lattice creates local environments that are the same. Thus the intermolecular forces holding the solid together are uniform, and the same amount of thermal energy is needed to break every interaction simultaneously. Amorphous solids have two characteristic properties. When cleaved or broken, they produce fragments with irregular, often curved surfaces; and they have poorly defined patterns when exposed to x-rays because their components are not arranged in a regular array. An amorphous, translucent solid is called a glass. Almost any substance can solidify. Q: Why do crystals have relatively sharp and well-defined melting points?

Answer the following question: Information: - Maurice Bavaud ( January 15 , 1916 in Neuchâtel -- May 14 , 1941 in Berlin - Plötzensee ) was a Swiss theology student who in 1938 attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler . - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust. - The National Socialist German Workers' Party (abbreviated NSDAP), commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party, was a political party in Germany that was active between 1920 and 1945 and practised the ideology of Nazism. Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (\\"Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. - The Chancellor of Germany is the head of government of Germany. The official title in German is \\"Bundeskanzler(in)\\" (literally, Federal Chancellor), sometimes shortened to \\"Kanzler(in)\\". The term, dating from the early Middle Ages, is derived from the Latin term \\"cancellarius\\". - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Lake Neuchâtel is a lake primarily in Romandy, Switzerland (French-speaking Switzerland). The lake lies mainly in the canton of Neuchâtel, but is also shared by the cantons of Vaud, of Fribourg, and of Bern. With a surface of , it is the largest lake entirely in Switzerland and the 59th largest lake in Europe. Lake Neuchâtel lies approximately at coordinates . It is long and no more than wide. Its surface is above sea level, with a maximum depth of . The total water volume is . The lake's drainage area is approximately and its culminating point is Le Chasseron at . The lake receives the Orbe River (called \\"Thielle or Thièle\\" from the city of Orbe onwards), the Arnon, the Areuse (which traverses the Val de Travers), Seyon (flowing through the Val de Ruz), the \\"canal de la Sauge\\" (which drains Lake Murten and receives the Broye River), and the Mentue (at Yvonand). The \\"canal of Thielle\\" (or \\"Zihlkanal\\" in German) drains the lake into Lake Biel-Bienne and is part of regulation system for the lakes and the rivers of the Seeland region. Lake Neuchâtel was the home of the now extinct species of deepwater trout \\"Salvelinus neocomensis\\". - Neuchâtel; (\\"new\\" and \\"chatel\\" \\"castle\\" ) is the capital of the Swiss canton of Neuchâtel on Lake Neuchâtel. - The Invasion of Poland, also known as the September Campaign, or the 1939 Defensive War in Poland (or \\"Wojna obronna 1939 roku\\"), and alternatively the Poland Campaign or \\"Fall Weiss\\" in Germany (Case White), was a joint invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, the Free City of Danzig, the Soviet Union, and a small Slovak contingent, that marked the beginning of World War II in Europe. The German invasion began on 1 September 1939, one week after the signing of the MolotovRibbentrop Pact, while the Soviet invasion commenced on 17 September following the Molotov-Tg agreement that terminated the Russian and Japanese hostilities in the east on 16 September. The campaign ended on 6 October with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing and annexing the whole of Poland under the terms of the German-Soviet Frontier Treaty. - Führer (spelled Fuehrer when the umlaut is not available) is a German word meaning \\"leader\\" or \\"guide\\". As a political title it is most associated with the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. Adolf Hitler was the only person to hold the position of Führer. The word Führer in the sense of \\"guide\\" remains common in German, and it is used in numerous compound words. However, because of its strong association with Nazi Germany, the isolated word may come with some stigma and negative connotations when used with the meaning of \\"leader\\", especially in political contexts. The word \\"Führer\\" has cognates in the Scandinavian languages, spelled \\"fører\\" which have the same meaning and use as the German word, but without political connotations.

Don't worry, we've all been there. I remember when I was trying to solve some complex physics problems, and I felt like I was hitting a brick wall. It can be tough, but the good news is, there are ways to work through it. First off, let's take a step back and maybe identify the specific areas or concepts that you're struggling with. Are there particular chapters or topics that you find more difficult than others? Alternatively, you might be able to pinpoint specific types of problems that give you trouble. Once we know which areas you need help with, we can start breaking things down and focus on improving your understanding. Physics problems often boil down to a few key principles that you can apply, so by focusing on those principles, many problems will become more manageable. Another tip is to not hesitate to ask for help. Physics isn't a subject to tackle alone, and there's no shame in seeking assistance. Your teachers and classmates are valuable resources, and even I would be more than happy to help you out when I can. Sometimes, just discussing the problem with someone else can shed new light on the solution. Moreover, it's essential to practice regularly. Physics, like any other skill, gets better with consistent practice. The more problems you solve, the more your confidence will grow, and the better you'll understand the concepts. It can also be helpful to learn and remember the formulas and relationships that are frequently used in physics problems, as these can be essential tools when solving complex questions. Lastly, don't forget to take breaks and give yourself some time to relax and recharge during your study sessions. It's important not to overwork your brain, as it can lead to more frustration and stress, which ultimately hinders your progress. I hope these suggestions can help you in your physics journey. Remember, it's okay to struggle, and it's perfectly normal to need help. We're all here to support you, and I'm confident that you'll overcome these challenges. So, let's start by identifying the specific areas you're struggling with, and we'll take it from there. Together, I'm sure we can get through this.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sudden burst of spring produce in the market after a long, monotonous winter of cavolo nero and bright oranges is one of the things that constantly reminds me why I love living and eating in Italy. A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto. And then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid’s hair than a monk’s beard, their English namesake. A few years ago, this wasn’t such a common sight at the market in Florence. It still isn’t, in that you won’t get them by the crateful like you do fava beans and artichokes, though they’re not particularly difficult to find now. They’re just one of those special things that don’t last long. Blink and you’ll miss them, or come late to the market and they could easily be sold out. It’s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course). If you’ve never tasted agretti before, it’s worth seeking out if you’re in the right place at the right time and find a bunch or see it on a menu.

Does the term draw mean the same thing in both these sentences?","completion":"No, the term \\"draw\\" does not mean the same thing in both of these sentences. In the first sentence, \\"At the start of their turn, each player must draw a card,\\" the term \\"draw\\" is used in the context of selecting a card, presumably from a deck, pile or hand of cards in some type of game. This action does not typically involve the creation of anything new, but simply the removal of a card from one location to be held or viewed by a player. The result of this action can affect the player's strategies or capabilities in the game. \\"Draw\\" in this context is often random and involves an element of chance. Meanwhile in the second sentence, \\"She drew an elephant,\\" the term \\"draw\\" is used in the context of creating a visual representation or image - in this case, an image of an elephant. This use of \\"draw\\" typically involves manual skill, such as using a pencil, pen, brush, or other instrument to apply lines, shapes, and shading on a surface like paper or canvas. The result of this action is a new piece of art or a visual representation of something. Thus, while both uses of \\"draw\\" involve an action resulting in a new situation or product (a game state or a piece of art), the processes, skills, and outcomes involved are different.

The bridle will easily fit over their head. Then, place the bit inside the horse’s mouth so their tongue lies underneath. Attach the curb chain to the hook on both sides of the bit so the bridle stays put on their head. The bit is a slightly curved metal piece that sits in the horse’s mouth. This helps control the horse. Connected to the bit is a curb chain and 2 rings for the reins. After the bit and curb chain are in place, strap the reins to both of the rings on the bit.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional Japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads 'KUSHIATA KYOTO, JAPAN 1840'. A young Japanese trainee Samurai named Masanori (Toshiya Maruyama) walks up the winding path to the house, inside waits Otami (Mako Hattori) with whom he is having an affair behind her husband, Shugoro's (Tsuiyuki Sasaki as Toshiyuki Sasaki) back who happens to be Masanori's teacher. Shugoro unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other. His honour destroyed the enraged Samurai brutally murders both Otami and Masanori before committing suicide. Over a century later and Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) arrives in Japan on a working holiday with his wife Laura (Susan George) and their young daughter Amy (Amy Barrett). Their close friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure) who works for the American consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay, you don't need me to you where! He jokingly says it's going so cheap because it's haunted, to which both Ted and Laura laugh off as they obviously don't believe in ghosts, at least for the time being that is. Almost immediately the film goes into cliché mode. Lights turn on and off by themselves, Laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local Zen Monk (Henry Mitowa) gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it's too late which they ignore, of course. The spirits of Otami, Masanori and Shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a Majyo witches (Tsuyako Olajima) curse put upon them. But there may be a way they can break the curse, unfortunately for the Fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage, daughter and possibly even their very lives. Directed by Kevin Connor I thought this was a pretty average film, OK to watch once if you've got nothing better to do but after a day or two you'll probably have completely forgotten it. Nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there's nothing particularly good about the film either. The script by Robert Suhosky from the novel by James Hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly by-the-numbers, a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction doesn't help things. There are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic crabs that try to get Amy and her babysitter, Noriko (Mayumi Umeda). And there is a scene where the Zen Monk exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished outside unable to get back in, however that is until Ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in, some exorcism! One more thing, I think it was a bad idea to have Doug McClure who was 47 when he made this, try his hand at Kung-Fu and oriental sword fighting! George gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very unerotic sex scene with McClure, although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensure no below the waist nudity was present. Apart from a couple of mostly off screen decapitations there's no blood, gore or violence to speak about. The 'transparent' ghost effects are OK but they ain't going to impress many people these days. It's professionally enough made and looks quite nice but the potential in the Japanese setting and myths is squandered as this film could have been set in America, England or any Western country without having to change a thing.

To be fair, this observation is also frequently made of Canada and Canadians, and should best be considered North American. There are, of course, exceptions. Small-minded officials, rude waiters, and ill-mannered taxi drivers are hardly unknown in the US. Yet American's friendliness and helpfulness is an observation made so frequently that it deserves comment. For a long period of time and in many parts of the country, a traveler was a welcome break in an otherwise dull existence. Dullness and loneliness were common problems of the families who generally lived distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were welcome sources of distraction, and brought news of the outside world. The tough realities of the border also shaped this tradition of hospitality. Someone traveling alone, if hungry, injured, or ill, often had nowhere to turn except to the nearest settler agent. It was not a matter of choice for the traveler or only a charitable impulse on the part of the settlers. It reflected the hardship of daily life: if you didn't take in the stranger and take care of him, there was no one else who would. And someday, remember, you might be in the same situation. Today there are many charitable organizations which specialize in helping the exhausted traveler. Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to strangers is still very strong in the US, especially in the smaller cities and towns away from the busy tourist routes. \\"I was just traveling through, got talking with this American, and pretty soon he invited me home for dinner, amazing.\\" Such observations reported by visitors to the US are not uncommon, but are not always understood properly.

Context: The wildfire smoke cleared on the morning of our family wedding, just in time for the bride and groom to say their vows overlooking coal harbour. We took this as a sign that we needed to book our Vancouver seaplane flight, to really explore the azure harbour waters and take in an eagle-eyed view of this city. I suppose it was ok… oh, who am I kidding, the harbour is spectacular. Let me also point out that none of these images are touched by editing. Like 99% of my images in this blog (the other 1% is cropping and making slight adjustments), these are entirely un-doctored. We began as all good things do, by hanging out in their airport lounge, offered a mini-pastry and a hot beverage – I adventurously went for an ‘English Mist’, an Earl-Grey Latte to make myself feel a little more soothed boarding a tiny propeller plane (note: it didn’t work.) With a slightly chaotic boarding process (more noticeable after such a serene start) we were too busy sorting out the seats to realise that we had hopped on board, and within in seconds it seemed, our pilot had lifted off smoothly in a flurry of water foam. As we began to watch the world turn into a Lilliput version of itself, we barely blinked for watching beautiful vistas unfold. From tiny little islands (the above Passage Island technically belongs to West Vancouver, known as the Hollywood suburb of the city, and a couple of the homes are allegedly owned by celebrities) where the residents enjoy views of downtown Vancouver, the University of British Columbia campus, Vancouver Island, and the snow-capped mountains of Howe Sound – to the fjords all the way along the Sea to Sky Highway to Whistler. They just scatter along the horizon, like a giant has skittered his toys along an azure sheet of silk. We looped around, looking back over the stunning Stanley Park and towering grid of Vancouver downtown buildings. From prehistoric forests, to gleaming silver confections of modernity.

He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox.

At least 6,200 people, half of them civilians, have been killed and almost three million others have been displaced since March 2015.

Article: In 1644, René Descartes theorized that pain was a disturbance that passed down along nerve fibers until the disturbance reached the brain, a development that transformed the perception of pain from a spiritual, mystical experience to a physical, mechanical sensation[citation needed]. Descartes's work, along with Avicenna's, prefigured the 19th-century development of specificity theory. Specificity theory saw pain as \\"a specific sensation, with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses\\". Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory, which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality, but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light, pressure or temperature. By the mid-1890s, specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians, and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists. However, after a series of clinical observations by Henry Head and experiments by Max von Frey, the psychologists migrated to specificity almost en masse, and by century's end, most textbooks on physiology and psychology were presenting pain specificity as fact. Question: What state does the intensive theory conceive pain as being?","completion":"The intensive theory conceives pain as being an emotional state, rather than a unique sensory modality. According to this theory, pain is not a specific sensation with its own sensory apparatus, as the specificity theory suggests, but rather a result of exposure to stronger than normal stimuli, such as intense light, pressure, or temperature. This perspective views pain as a byproduct of our emotional response to these heightened stimuli, emphasizing the emotional and psychological aspects of the pain experience rather than its physical or mechanical nature. In the 18th and 19th centuries, this theory was primarily supported by psychologists, while the specificity theory was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians. However, by the end of the 19th century, after a series of clinical observations and experiments, the majority of psychologists shifted their support to the specificity theory, leading to its widespread acceptance and incorporation in textbooks on physiology and psychology as fact."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

John Holmes is so famous, he's infamous (as the Three Amigos would say). This is a Rashomon-like story about the events surrounding the Wonderland Murders of the early 1980's, in Los Angeles. The story is pieced together from the retelling of a few of the participants. There is story from the friend's perspective, namely David Lind (played by Dylan McDermott). He is a participant in the robbery assault at Eddie Nash's place (Eddie Nash is a infamous drug dealer - and is the suppose to be the same character Alfred Molina played in Boogie Nights) and is heavily into the drug scene. There is John Holmes' perspective (played by Val Kilmer), which makes him out to be a pawn stuck between two kings (with a severe case of cocaine cravings). There is also the patchwork recollections of John's wife (Sharon - played by Lisa Kudrow) and his girlfriend (Dawn - played by Kate Bosworth) that fill in the spaces between the two stories. It is basically the same time frame that we are looking at, just each character's version. The only thing that is missing is the perspective from the dead people. Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights portrays John Holmes as a slightly heroic character, with a tragic yet comedic karma. He is a caricature of a real person. He was more of less, a mixed up kid that got what he got through his \\"large\\" endowment. Director James Cox turns the comedy off and makes this episode in John's life into a nightmare for all of us watching. The details of the real life murders make this movie even more eerie. Val Kilmer took what he learned of Jim Morrison, from the Doors, enhanced the performance for the Salton Sea, and then further enhanced that to bring us the deterioration of John Holmes through cocaine. All of the actors pull off very realistic looking portrayal's of cocaine junkies. Josh Lucas' performance stands out as one of the best in the movie. He plays Ron Launius (I think this character is suppose to be the same as the Thomas Jane character from Boogie Nights). Ron was the leader of the gang, loved having John Holmes around as a novelty and had a cocaine craving like sharks enjoy blood. The cocaine use seems so realistic as to make one think. Did they really use Splenda ?? Where Boogie Nights has a bubblegum pop feel to it (lots of color and 70's nostalgia), Wonderland is dark. The action is fast and furious, with a lot of jumps. It is twitchy and grainy. There is no comedy, just a never ending pace, as if the director is trying to put us into the nervous, fast paced, edgy cocaine high to make us feel what the characters are feeling. This is a graphic movie. It has one of the most intensely violent scenes I have ever seen in a movie. It actually shows the murders themselves (through the eyes of John Holmes at first and then from a third person perspective). It is so graphic, it looks like police evidence of a crime. I had to pause after this scene and remind myself this was just a movie. This movie is definitely not recommended for everyone. I recommend it as a good alternative to Boogie Nights, for those interested in the other sides of John Holmes. -Celluloid Rehab Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"This review thought positively of the movie, highlighting the realistic portrayals of the characters, the intense and immersive atmosphere, and praising the acting performances.

This triumphant tale dances a mesmerizing waltz between the raw power of human emotions and the sheer resilience of the human spirit. As a result, it leaves its viewers breathless with a renewed appreciation for the world around them. Helming the director's chair, visionary filmmaker, Christopher Lumière, has sculpted a narrative that takes us on a whirlwind journey of healing, forgiveness, and learning to embrace life's many obstacles. Like a maestro creating a soul-stirring composition, Lumière conducts a flawless orchestra of talent that flawlessly synchronizes breathtaking visuals, profound storytelling, and poignant performances. On center stage, we have Catherine Fleur, a thespian who truly transcends the term 'performance' by breathing life into the troubled yet fierce protagonist, Seraphina Rose. Fleur's portrayal of the character is a masterclass in the art of acting. Through every tear, smile, and fiery outburst, she delivers a heart-stopping display of vulnerability and strength intertwined in a seamless dance. As her tale of adversity unfolds, we are privileged to witness the raw essence of a soul emerging from the darkness. One cannot mention Fleur's remarkable performance without acknowledging the phenomenal ensemble cast. Each character is intricately layered, with every actor delivering astounding depth, injecting palpable energy, and embodying the spirit of their roles. John Francis, in particular, shines brightly as the enigmatic and wise stranger that guides Seraphina through her metamorphosis. Complementing the two leads, the supporting cast weaves an emotionally intense tapestry that serves as the backbone of this powerful narrative. Cinematographer, Henry Caldwell, captures the elegance of this journey through his kaleidoscopic lens. With panoramic vistas that sweep across breathtaking landscapes to intimate close-ups that plunge us into the depths of the characters' souls, Caldwell's visual storytelling transports us into an alternate realm where the magnificence of nature mirrors the turmoil and ultimate triumph of the human spirit. In tandem with the visuals, we are swept away by the soul-shattering musical score from renowned composer, Amelia Wells. With each note, Wells' composition adds a delicate nuance to the narrative, guiding us through a vivid emotional spectrum from enchanting serenity to the turmoil of inner demons. This sonic symbiosis with the storytelling encapsulates the audience in a mesmerizing cocoon of texture and emotion unparalleled in contemporary cinema. \\"A Symphony of Life's Beauty\\" is not just a film; it is a testament to the indomitable will within each of us to conquer our fears, face our monsters, and ultimately find love and meaning in the chaos of existence. It is a celebration of the human spirit that awakens the slumbering embers within our hearts and sets them ablaze with newfound purpose. In conclusion, the film stands tall as a gleaming beacon in the pantheon of cinematic achievements. \\"A Symphony of Life's Beauty\\" ebbs and flows like a tide, connecting us to the essence of humanity, and serenading us with the music of life itself. This is truly a must-see film, which serves as a reminder that hope will always triumph over despair, and that the beauty of life is in the journey, not merely the destination. Watch it, embrace it, and let it resonate within the deepest chambers of your soul."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What was the plan? Context: An earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, titled Go Set a Watchman, was controversially released on July 14, 2015. This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how \\"Watchman\\" was seen as just the first draft of \\"Mockingbird\\". Instances where many passages overlap between the two books, in some case word for word, also refutes this assertion. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The plan was to publish \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" as the first book of a trilogy, followed by a shorter connecting novel, and then \\"Go Set a Watchman\\" as the last book."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is very unfit happens, how will it affect more oxygen reaches the lungs. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a person being very unfit can have an indirect effect on the process of oxygen reaching the lungs. When a person is unfit, their respiratory system may not function as efficiently due to reduced lung capacity or decreased muscle strength around the diaphragm and chest wall. This may lead to shorter and shallower breaths, resulting in less air and oxygen being inhaled and reaching the lungs. Additionally, an unfit person may experience increased heart rate, which could lead to a higher demand for oxygen by the body, further exacerbating the issue. Overall, this may cause the oxygen exchange process to be less effective, leading to potential shortness of breath and fatigue."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For many purposes, it is desirable to have a solution which is capable of resisting such large changes in pH when relatively small amounts of acid or base are added to them. Such a solution is called a buffer. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid or a base and its salt. Both components must be present for the system to act as a buffer to resist changes in pH. Commercial buffer solutions, which have a wide variety of pH values, can be obtained. and the situation: John is a scientist in a large pharmaceutical company.

What type of thing is the question \\"How many colored squares are there on a Rubik 's Cube ?\\" asking about?","completion":"The question \\"How many colored squares are there on a Rubik's Cube?\\" is asking about the structure and specific elements of a well-known 3D puzzle, the Rubik’s Cube. To answer this question, one must have a good understanding of the Rubik’s Cube, its design and structural elements. Each face of the cube is made up of multiple smaller squares, which are typically colored. Therefore, the question centers on the total count of these squares across all faces of the cube. The Rubik’s Cube is recognized for its colorful and multi-dimensional mechanical design which was initially meant to help individuals understand 3D geometry. This colored aspect of the Rubik’s Cube is primarily what the question is centred around. Each of these colored squares is a fundamental part of solving the puzzle, as the typical goal of using a Rubik’s cube is to rearrange these squares so that every face of the cube is a single, uniform color. From a broader perspective, this question is querying specific characteristics of real-world objects and involves numerical data related to that object. In the domain of learning, it falls into the category of observation, quantitative reasoning, and spatial awareness. It ignites critical thinking by stimulating the need to visualize the Rubik's Cube, count its individual elements, and combine these facts to answer the question. Further, this question indirectly touches on history and cultural context. The Rubik’s Cube is an iconic puzzle that was invented in 1974 by a Hungarian architect Ernő Rubik. Since then, it became a worldwide craze and remains popular to this day, with numerous competitions held to solve it in the quickest time. Moreover, the type and nature of this query could be used in different fields such as mathematics and geometry (as an example to explain concepts), art (discussions about color patterns), and even in psychology (exploring aspects of problem-solving, patience, spatial intelligence). In summary, this question is querying about the quantitative aspects and physical characteristics of a widely recognized and culturally significant three-dimensional puzzle, named the Rubik's Cube."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What was restored by Nigel Williams in 1988–1989? from the following article ? The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who is often described as looking at herself on the mirror in the work? ? The Rokeby Venus (; also known as The Toilet of Venus, Venus at her Mirror, Venus and Cupid, or La Venus del espejo) is a painting by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London. Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.

Deveraux and Scott's corpses are recovered by a second squad and cryo-genically frozen, their deaths covered up as \\"missing in action\\". Deveraux and Scott are revived without memories of their previous lives and are selected for the \\"Universal Soldier\\" program, an elite counter terrorism unit, and are deployed via an Aero Spacelines Mini Guppy to the Hoover Dam to resolve a hostage situation. Devereaux used efficient means to dispatch terrorists, but Scott used excessive force, which causes concern among the project technicians. The team demonstrates their superior training and physical abilities against the terrorists, such as when GR76 (Ralf MÃ¶ller) withstands close-range rifle fire. After the area is secured, Devereaux begins to regain patches of memory from his former life upon seeing two hostages who strongly resemble the villagers he tried to save in Vietnam, causing him to ignore commands from the control team and become unresponsive. In the mobile command center, it is revealed that the UniSols are genetically augmented soldiers with enhanced healing abilities and superior strength, but also have a tendency to overheat and shut down. They are given a neural serum to keep their minds susceptible and their previous memories suppressed.

Unlike other trekking routes in Nepal, there were no hotels, guest houses, begging, or souvenir sales. Instead, the locals stared at us unstrained, especially at the camps. These unsullied places were a stark contrast to the regularly frequented paths most travelers take through Nepal. These villages, nestled amid the verdant foliage, were home to the indigenous Rai and Limbu tribes. A unique and interesting cultural experience, it was a window into Nepal's rich tribal history. Travelers here got the chance to witness a way of life preserved from the influx of modernity and tourism. The Rai and Limbu tribes are two ethnic groups native to Nepal. They have been living in these areas for centuries, following a rural lifestyle where they rely mainly on agriculture. The Rai tribe is known for their distinct dance forms, social organization and religious rituals. The Limbu tribe, on the other hand, is recognized for their significant contribution to the Gorkha Regiments of the Indian Army, British Army, and Nepalese Army. Both tribes share similarities in language and culture, despite their distinct identities. Unlike other trekking routes in Nepal which are teeming with hotels, guesthouses, and establishments catering to tourists, this relatively less explored area had none of that. There were no haggling for souvenirs, no one begging, and most notably, no bustling hotels or guesthouses to accommodate the trekkers. Existence and livelihood here were simpler, stripped down to the more basic necessities in life. The absence of these commercial establishments contributed to the genuine unspoilt beauty of these villages. Furthermore, the behavior of the locals was unique. As opposed to the often-intrusive curiosity from locals that travelers sometimes encounter, the residents of these Rai and Limbu villages were reserved yet attentive. They stared unstrained at the trekkers - a silent show of interest, a subtle mark of their hospitality. There was a welcoming vibe to their gaze, putting the trekkers at ease. This spectacle was enhanced at the camps, heightened by the serene setting as the last rays of the sun vanished behind the landscape, instilling a sense of tranquility amongst the hills, forests, and valleys. The existence of these tribal villages along the trekking route was a fascinating blend of untouched natural beauty and preserved cultural heritage. These elements, combined with the locals' welcoming demeanor, altogether made the journey an authentic and memorable experience for any traveler, providing a unique glimpse of the real Nepal away from the frenetic buzz of the more established tourist routes. Whether it's the physical demand of the trek or the cultural immersion in these villages, the journey provides an extraordinary opportunity to connect with the country's diverse environment and its people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It hurt some, my lips were lacerated, I scared my wife when I came in to take a look at it in the mirror but the pain to come was far worse. Tooth was intact thank goodness and was a bit wobbly and I said to myself yup, this could be a problem. A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head. Tooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain. Problem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more.

Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park.

Write a title for this article: The United States is no longer considered among the safest financial risks in the world after Standard & Poors downgraded the U.S. credit rating, but the head of the team that made the change says entitlement reform would go a long way to restoring the country's status. David Beers, global head of sovereign and international public finance ratings at S&P, told \\"Fox News Sunday\\" that governments and Congresses come and go, but spending on entitlements persistently drags U.S. debt further into the red. \\"The key thing is, yes, entitlement reform is important because entitlements are the biggest component of spending, and the part of spending where the cost pressures are greatest,\\" Beers said. Beers said he faults both Congress and the Obama administration for \\"the difficulty of all sides in finding a consensus around fiscal policy choices,\\" but any agreement must command the support from both political parties in order to be durable. S&P lowered the U.S. outlook on Friday evening, saying that political gridlock has prevented the U.S. from reaching a plausible solution to getting its financial house in order. It remarked that the agreement last week to reduce the nation's debt by at least 2.1 trillion over the next 10 years \\"fell well short\\" of comprehensive reforms that some had advocated. It added that it foresees the select congressional committee to be organized to find additional savings will likely avoid raising taxes or doing any significant entitlement reform. \\"It appears that for now, new revenues have dropped down on the menu of policy options. In addition, the plan envisions only minor policy changes on Medicare and little change in other entitlements, the containment of which we and most other independent observers regard as key to long-term fiscal sustainability,\\" the announcement reads. Though the announcement noted that S&P \\"takes no position on the mix of spending and revenue measures that Congress and the administration might conclude is appropriate for putting the U.S.'s finances on a sustainable footing,\\" the credit ratings group suggested that tax hikes may be necessary to reduce the overall debt burden needed to improve the long-term outlook. Beers drew no such conclusion on Sunday, though John Chambers, managing director of S&P, told ABC's \\"This Week\\" that President Obama's fiscal commission last year \\"had plenty of sensible recommendations\\" for reducing U.S. debt. Those recommendations, which included cutting spending and increasing revenues on a 3-1 ratio, were ignored. \\"It was a pity that those really weren't followed through on,\\" Chambers said. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he's not surprised by S&P's decision since even with the select committee's recommendations, the debt will continue to climb. Ryan added that he's willing to discuss tax reforms in a way that would promote economic growth and job creation, including addressing \\"special interest-driven loopholes,\\" but qualified any reforms by adding, \\"if you're just raising revenues to chase ever high spending, that's not good policy.\\" Ryan said ultimately the U.S. has to fix its entitlement system. \\"The president just created two brand new health care entitlements, expanded Medicaid, a third, and then put this new rationing board in charge of Medicare,\\" Ryan told \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" \\"So they're unwilling to open up and restructure these entitlements, which according to S&P are the primary drivers of this debt.\\" Bill Miller of Legg Mason Capital Management, who appeared with Ryan, said the markets are looking to see a \\"reduction in uncertainty,\\" which means both fundamental tax reform and changes to the entitlement structure. \\"Discretionary spending doesn't matter at all in this thing except that it'll be a little bit of a drag on the economy. It's pro-growth policies and fundamental entitlement reform, especially on health care, that are the key things for to our long-term fiscal health and therefore the long-term confidence in the markets toward our country,\\" Miller said.","completion":"Title: Entitlement Reform: The Key to Restoring the United States' Financial Reputation and Stability Amid Credit Rating Downgrade"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Doors were an American rock band formed in 1965 in Los Angeles, with vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and John Densmore on drums. The band got its name, at Morrison's suggestion from the title of Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, which itself was a reference to a quote made by William Blake, \\"If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is, infinite.\\" They were unique and among the most controversial and influential rock acts of the 1960s, mostly because of Morrison's lyrics and charismatic but unpredictable stage persona. After Morrison's death in 1971, the remaining members continued as a trio until disbanding in 1973. Despite Morrison's conviction and the fallout from their appearance in New Orleans, The Doors set out to reclaim their status as a premier act with L.A. Woman in 1971. The album included rhythm guitarist Marc Benno on several tracks and prominently featured bassist Jerry Scheff, best known for his work in Elvis Presley's TCB Band. Despite a comparatively low Billboard chart peak at #9, L.A. Woman contained two Top 20 hits and went on to be their second best-selling studio album, surpassed in sales only by their debut. The album explored their R&B roots, although during rehearsals they had a falling-out with Paul Rothchild, who was dissatisfied with the band's effort. Denouncing \\"Love Her Madly\\" as \\"cocktail lounge music\\", he quit and handed the production to Bruce Botnick and the Doors. The title track and two singles (\\"Love Her Madly\\" and \\"Riders on the Storm\\") remain mainstays of rock radio programming, with the last of these being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for its special significance to recorded music. In the song \\"L.A. Woman\\", Jim Morrison scrambles the letters of his own name to chant \\"Mr. Mojo Risin\\". During the sessions, a short clip of the band performing \\"Crawling King Snake\\" was filmed. As far as is known, this is the last clip of the Doors performing with Morrison. On March 13, 1971, following the recording of L.A. Woman, Morrison took a leave of absence from the Doors and moved to Paris with Pamela Courson. He had visited the city the previous summer and was interested in moving there to become a writer in exile.","completion":"This text is about the American rock band, The Doors.

What is the answer: The most famous symbol of what people of North Africa is the Tagelmust, an indigo blue-colored veil that gives them the name 'People of the Veil'?","completion":"The most famous symbol of the people of North Africa, known as the Tagelmust, is an indigo blue-colored veil that represents the Tuareg people. This iconic and culturally significant piece of clothing has earned them the name \\"People of the Veil.\\" The Tuareg people are a large Berber ethnic group that inhabits a vast area across North and West Africa, primarily in the Sahara and Sahel regions. This includes countries like Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Algeria, and Libya. They speak a Berber language known as Tamacheq and have a unique and distinct culture that sets them apart from the other groups in the region. The Tagelmust represents a crucial aspect of their identity, with men in particular wearing this traditional garment as they go about their daily activities. The Tagelmust is a combination of a headscarf and a turban, which are made from cotton, and are dyed in indigo, a natural dye obtained from plants. The deep indigo blue color has an important cultural significance and is often regarded as the color of wisdom and eternity. The color ultimately symbolizes the vast Saharan sky and represents the Tuareg's connection with their environment. Additionally, since the Tuareg people traditionally have a noble, warrior societal structure, the indigo blue color also signifies strength and nobility. The practical function of the Tagelmust is to protect the wearer from the harsh desert elements, such as the sun, wind, and sand. When wrapped around the head and face, it effectively shields the individual from these environmental factors, making it easier for them to navigate their surroundings. The Tuareg people also believe that wearing the Tagelmust preserves moisture in the breathing passages and prevents dryness and dehydration. On a cultural and spiritual level, the Tagelmust plays an essential role in the Tuareg society. It is primarily worn by adult men, and it signifies that they have reached the age of maturity and responsibility. It is also considered a sign of modesty and respect, as the Tagelmust covers the lower half of the wearer's face when in the presence of those outside their immediate family or other men. The Tagelmust is an important aspect of the Tuareg's traditional attire, and beyond its practical use, it carries a deep cultural and spiritual meaning. As such, the Tagelmust is a symbol of the Tuareg people's rich history, unique way of life, and their strong connection to the natural environment. It plays a crucial role in the group's identity and is a recognizable symbol of the Tuareg people throughout North Africa and the world."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What state claimed their independence on 5 October 1908? , can you please find it? The Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire. It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning Moesia, Macedonia and Thrace, roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, and this day is now a public holiday called National Liberation Day. The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country. This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as \\"the Balkan Prussia\\". It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at Doiran and Monastir, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.

Given the question: Once upon a time,the animals decided that they must do something heroic to meet the problems of\\" a new world\\".So they organized a training school. They adopted an activity curriculum consisting of running,climbing,swimming and flying.To make it easier to manage the curriculum,all the animals took all the subjects. The duck was excellent in swimming,in fact,better than his instructor,but he made only passing grades in flying and was very poor in running.Since he was slow in running,he had to stay after school and also drop swimming in order to practice running.This was kept up until his webbed feet were badly worn and he was only average in swimming.But average was acceptable in school,so nobody worried about that except the duck. The rabbit started at the top of the class in running,but had a nervous breakdown because of so much make-up work in swimming. The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustration in the flying class where his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of from the treetop down.He also developed a \\"Charlie horse\\" and then got a C in climbing and a D in running. The eagle was a problem child and was disciplined severely.In the climbing class he beat all the others to the top of the tree,but insisted on using his own way to get there. At the end of the year,an abnormal eel that could swim very well,and also run,climb and fly a little,had the highest average and was the one who gave a good-bye speech. The prairie dogs stayed out of the school because the administration would not add digging to the curriculum. We can learn from the passage that _ . A) an abnormal eel's average score is the highest in all subjects B) the squirrel met frustration before practicing climbing C) the rabbit liked to make up in water so she failed at last D) in fact,the duck behaved better than any other animal in class The answer is:","completion":"A) an abnormal eel's average score is the highest in all subjects. The passage describes a school where animals are taught various subjects according to a standardized curriculum that includes running, climbing, swimming, and flying. Each animal faces challenges in the areas they are not naturally good at, leading to various struggles, such as the duck's webbed feet getting worn out from practicing running, the rabbit's nervous breakdown from too much make-up work in swimming, the squirrel's frustration in flying class, and the eagle's disciplinary issues. However, an abnormal eel, who can swim very well and also run, climb, and fly a little, achieves the highest average score in all subjects and is chosen to give the good-bye speech.

Article: A lot of management training each year for Circle K Corporation, a national chain of convenience stores. Among the topics we address in our course is the retention of quality employees-a real challenge to managers when you consider the pay scale in the service industry. During these discussions, I ask the participants , \\"What has caused you to stay long enough to become a manager?\\" Some time back a new manager took the question and slowly, with her voice almost breaking, said, \\"It was a 19 baseball glove.\\" Cynthia told the group that she originally took a Circle K clerk job as an interim position while she looked for something better. On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused. Patricia handed her a box. \\"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\\" she said, \\"and I know that it is hard to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jessie because he may not understand how important he is, even though you have to pay bills before you can buy gloves. You know we can't pay good people like you as much as we would like to; but we do care, and I want you to know you are important to us.\\" The thoughtfulness, empathy and love of this convenience store manager demonstrates vividly that people remember more how much an employer cares than how much the employer pays.

West Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale. It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents. Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised for being too focused on a hoax confessional tape that seemed to indicate a perpetrator with a Wearside background, and for ignoring advice from survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks, and several eminent specialists including the FBI, plus dialect analysts such as Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis, whom he had also consulted throughout the manhunt, that \\"Wearside Jack\\" was a blatant hoaxer. The investigation used it as a point of elimination rather than a line of enquiry and allowed Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny, as he did not fit the profile of the sender of the tape or letters. The \\"Wearside Jack\\" hoaxer was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as the Yorkshire Ripper had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. The hoaxer appeared to know details of the murders which had not been released to the press, but which in fact he had acquired from his local newspaper and pub gossip. The official response to the criticisms led to the implementation of the forerunner of the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System, the development of the Major Incident Computer Application (MICA), developed between West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services. In response to the police reaction to the murders, the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group organised a number of 'Reclaim the Night' marches. The group and other feminists had criticised the police for victim-blaming, especially the suggestion that women should remain indoors at night. Eleven marches in various towns across the United Kingdom took place on the night of 12 November 1977. They made the point that women should be able to walk anywhere without restriction and that they should not be blamed for men's violence. In 1988, the mother of Sutcliffe's last victim, Jacqueline Hill, during action for damages on behalf of her daughter's estate, argued in the High Court that the police had failed to use reasonable care in apprehending the murderer of her daughter in Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire. The House of Lords held that the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire did not owe a duty of care to the victim due to the lack of proximity and therefore failing on the second limb of the Caparo test. Answer this question \\"What does this mean for the police\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"This means that the police were not prepared for such a big investigation and had trouble managing and organizing all the information they had.

Q:What is the first name of the person that calls Laurence to brag? Answer the above question based on the context below: Fed up with her dead-end job with a Minneapolis car rental agency, Martha quits, cashes her final paycheck, and uses the money to purchase an airline ticket to the least expensive international destination she can find - London. At the airport, she meets Daniel, a successful music label executive, who covertly arranges for her to be upgraded to First Class and seated next to him on the flight. When she sells the ticket to another passenger and Daniel finds his seatmate is an obnoxiously loud woman instead of the girl of his dreams, he moves back to the Economy section and takes the vacant seat next to Martha. Before landing in London, he offers her the use of a deluxe suite in a luxury hotel at his company's expense in exchange for a lunch date the following day. Through a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, we learn Laurence, a former bridge champion who now teaches the game to wealthy women, went to the airport to pick up Daniel but missed him because the flight landed early. Instead, he literally runs into Martha, who hits him with a luggage cart while searching for the exit. She coerces him into taking her into the city and invites him to the suite for dinner. While she is in the bathroom, a bouquet of flowers from Daniel is delivered to the suite, and when Laurence sees the attached card, he departs without explanation. The following day, Martha meets struggling actor Frank, who has fled an audition in a panic and has gone to the park to console himself with a half-bottle of whiskey. Having heard about her from Daniel, he realizes who she is and calls Laurence to boast that he is about to make her his conquest. He takes her to a nearby art gallery. Martha slips away and heads for the exit, where she reunites with Laurence, who was looking for the pair. He invites her back to his flat and she accepts.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded? , can you please find it? Holst's absorption of folksong, not only in the melodic sense but in terms of its simplicity and economy of expression, helped to develop a style that many of his contemporaries, even admirers, found austere and cerebral. This is contrary to the popular identification of Holst with The Planets, which Matthews believes has masked his status as a composer of genuine originality. Against charges of coldness in the music, Imogen cites Holst's characteristic \\"sweeping modal tunes mov[ing] reassuringly above the steps of a descending bass\\", while Michael Kennedy points to the 12 Humbert Wolfe settings of 1929, and the 12 Welsh folksong settings for unaccompanied chorus of 1930–31, as works of true warmth.Many of the characteristics that Holst employed — unconventional time signatures, rising and falling scales, ostinato, bitonality and occasional polytonality — set him apart from other English composers. Vaughan Williams remarked that Holst always said in his music what he wished to say, directly and concisely; \\"He was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded, nor did he hesitate to be remote when remoteness expressed his purpose\\". Kennedy has surmised that Holst's economy of style was in part a product of the composer's poor health: \\"the effort of writing it down compelled an artistic economy which some felt was carried too far\\". However, as an experienced instrumentalist and orchestra member, Holst understood music from the standpoint of his players and made sure that, however challenging, their parts were always practicable. According to his pupil Jane Joseph, Holst fostered in performance \\"a spirit of practical comradeship ... none could know better than he the boredom possible to a professional player, and the music that rendered boredom impossible\\". A:","completion":"The last name of the person who was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded is Holst. The passage states that \\"Vaughan Williams remarked that Holst always said in his music what he wished to say, directly and concisely; 'He was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded, nor did he hesitate to be remote when remoteness expressed his purpose'.\\" This suggests that composer Gustav Holst was the individual not afraid of being obvious and straightforward in his musical compositions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

New innovations and curiosity helped spread interest in windmills and wind power.Middle Eastern citizens used them for food production by the 11th century.Merchants along trade routes returned to Europe and shared the idea.Windmills caught on,especially in Holland,and the Dutch improved their use.Here,windmills drained lakes and other bodies of water.In France,the windmill pumped irrigation water.Elsewhere in Europe,windmills were used to grind grain. By the 19th century,settlers in the United States realized the importance of the simple windmill.Pioneers pumped water for livestock and farming.As estimated six million windmills dotted America's landscape by the end of the 1880s.Charles Brush,the US inventor,invented a windmill capable of producing electricity in 1888.And now the machines are called wind turbines.As late as the 1920s,Americans used small windmills to provide electricity in rural areas without electric service.When power lines began to transport electricity to rural areas in the 1930s,local windmills were used less and less,though they can still be seen on some Western farms. In the 1970s,oil shortages pushed the development of alternative energy sources,paving the way for the re-entry of the windmill to produce electricity.In the early 1980s,wind energy really took off in California,partly because of State policies that encouraged renewable energy sources.In the 1990s,the push came from a renewed concern for the environment in response to scientific studies indicating potential changes to the global climate if the use of...

Onlookers gasped and murmured worriedly among themselves, wondering about the severity of the young woman's injury and how it might impact her future. A few individuals whipped out their smartphones, ready to call for medical help or capture the commotion unfolding before them. Within moments, a kind-hearted passer-by, with some basic first aid knowledge, made his way through the agitated crowd and approached the fallen girl. Kneeling beside her, he attempted to assess the damage, gingerly examining her foot and inquiring about the pain she was experiencing. The young woman, flushed with a mix of embarrassment, fear, and pain, managed to stutter out a few disjointed words, expressing her gratitude towards the efforts being made to help her. The crowd continued to grow, as more and more people found themselves drawn to the scene of the accident, either out of concern, curiosity, or the desire to lend a helping hand. The tension in the air was palpable, as the girl's broken heel served as a jarring reminder of our collective vulnerability and how quickly a seemingly ordinary day can be marred by misfortune. Shortly after, a woman emerged from the nearby store, carrying a first aid kit and a look of determination on her face. She had overheard the commotion while browsing the shop, and as a trained nurse, she instinctively knew she needed to help. Swiftly, and with practiced precision, she set about stabilizing the girl's injured foot, providing temporary relief before any further medical assistance could arrive. With emergency services on their way, the crowd began to disperse, each person processing what they had just witnessed in their own way. Some stood in shock, unable to pry their eyes away from the girl; others stirred with renewed empathy and compassion, inspired to help their fellow humans whenever possible. For the girl, the pain and shattered heel had become a symbol of human connection, as the strangers who had rushed to her aid proved that even in moments of hardship and pain, we are never truly alone. As the ambulance pulled up to the scene, the girl offered a gracious thanks to those who had shown her kindness in her time of need. The paramedics worked quickly and efficiently, transferring her onto a stretcher and examining her foot once more. With the echoes of reassurances, well-wishes, and words of encouragement, the girl disappeared into the sterile interior of the vehicle, her body shaking from relief and gratitude.

Answer the following question: Information: - Pinyin, or Hàny Pnyn, is the official romanization system for Standard Chinese in mainland China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. It is often used to teach Standard Chinese, which is normally written using Chinese characters. The system includes four diacritics denoting tones. Pinyin without tone marks is used to spell Chinese names and words in languages written with the Latin alphabet, and also in certain computer input methods to enter Chinese characters. - Korla, Kurla, or Kuerle ( lit. Krorain) is a mid-sized city in central Xinjiang, and is, administratively, a county-level city and the seat of the Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, which is larger than Great Britain and is the largest Chinese prefecture. Korla is known for its \\"fragrant\\" pears. - In geography, an oasis (plural: oases) is an isolated area of vegetation in a desert, typically surrounding a spring or similar water source, such as a pond or small lake. Oases also provide habitat for animals and even humans if the area is big enough. The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas; caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of Awjila, Ghadames, and Kufra, situated in modern-day Libya, have at various times been vital to both North-South and East-West trade in the Sahara Desert. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Lop Nur or Lop Nor (from a Mongolian name meaning \\"Lop Lake\\") is a former salt lake in China, now largely dried-up, located between the Taklamakan and Kumtag deserts in the southeastern portion of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the People's Republic of China. Administratively, the lake is in Lop Nur township (pinyin: Luóbùp zhèn, also known as Luozhong , pinyin: Lu zhng) of Ruoqiang County, which in its turn is part of the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture. - Libya (\\"\\") is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Egypt to the east, Sudan to the southeast, Chad and Niger to the south, and Algeria and Tunisia to the west. The three traditional parts of the country are Tripolitania, Fezzan and Cyrenaica. With an area of almost , Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa, and is the 16th largest country in the world. Libya has the 10th-largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world. - Loulan , also called Krorän or Kroraina ( simplified Chinese : ; traditional Chinese : ; pinyin : Lóulán ; Uyghur : , ULY : Kroran ) , and known to Russian archaeologists as Krorayina , was an ancient kingdom based around an important oasis city along the Silk Road already known in the 2nd century BCE on the north - eastern edge of the Lop Desert . The term Loulan is the Chinese transcription of the native name Krorän , and is used to refer to the city located near Lop Nur as well as the kingdom . The kingdom was renamed Shanshan ( ) after its king was assassinated by an envoy of the Han dynasty in 77 BCE ; however , the town at the northwestern corner of the brackish desert lake Lop Nur retained the name of Loulan . The kingdom included at various times settlements such as Niya , Charklik , Miran , and Qiemo . It was intermittently under Chinese control from the early Han dynasty until its abandonment centuries later . The ruins of Loulan are near the now desiccated Lop Nur in the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture , Xinjiang , and are now completely surrounded by desert . - The Silk Road or Silk Route was an ancient network of trade routes that were for centuries central to cultural interaction through regions of the Asian continent connecting the East and West from China to the Mediterranean Sea. - Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, often abbreviated to Bayingol (literally \\"rich river\\"), is an autonomous prefecture of the People's Republic of China, bordering Gansu to the east, Qinghai to the southeast, and the Tibet Autonomous Region to the south. It is the largest prefecture-level division nationally, with an area of , even larger than its neighbouring province of Gansu. The prefectural capital is Korla. - Trade, or commerce, involves the transfer of goods and/or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. A network that allows trade is called a market. - A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location. - Ruoqiang (Qarkilik) County (historically known as Charkliq, Chaqiliq, or Qakilik) is a county in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China under the administration of the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture.

Its northern boundary is the Tian Shan mountain range and its southern boundary is the Kunlun Mountains on the edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The Taklamakan Desert dominates much of the basin. The historical Uyghur name for the Tarim Basin is Altishahr (), which means \\"six cities\\" in Uyghur. - Geography (from Greek , \\"geographia\\", literally \\"earth description\\") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth. The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\". - The Lop Desert, or the Lop Depression, is a desert extending from Korla eastwards along the foot of the Kuruk-tagh (meaning Dry Mountain) to the formerly terminal Tarim Basin in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. It is an almost perfectly flat expanse with no topographic relief. Lake Bosten in the northwest lies at an altitude of 1,030 m to 1,040 m (3,380 to 3,410 ft), while the Lop Nur in the southeast is only 250 m lower. - Awjila (Berber: \\"Awilan\\", \\"Awjila\\", \\"Awgila\\" Latin: \\"Augila\\") is an oasis town in the Al Wahat District in the Cyrenaica region of northeastern Libya. Since classical times it has been known as a place where high quality dates are farmed. From the Arab conquest in the 7th century, Islam has played an important role in the community. The oasis is located on the east-west caravan route between Egypt and Tripoli, and on the north-south route between Benghazi and the Sahel between Lake Chad and Darfur, and in the past was an important trading center. It is the place after which the Awjila language, an Eastern Berber language, is named. The people cultivate small gardens using water from deep wells. Recently, the oil industry has become an increasingly important source of employment. - Ghadames or Ghadamis (Berber: \\"ademis\\"; \\"admis\\", Libyan vernacular: \\"dms\\", Latin: \\"Cidamus, Cydamus\\") is an oasis Berber town in the Nalut District of the Tripolitania region in northwestern Libya. - Kufra is a basin and oasis group in the Kufra District of southeastern Cyrenaica in Libya. At the end of nineteenth century Kufra became the center and holy place of the Senussi order. It also played a minor role in the Western Desert Campaign of World War II.

It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - Peter the Great, Peter I or Peter Alexeyevich ( ) ruled the Tsardom of Russia and later the Russian Empire from 7 May (O.S. 27 April) 1682 until his death, jointly ruling before 1696 with his elder half-brother, Ivan V. Through a number of successful wars he expanded the Tsardom into a much larger empire that became a major European power. He led a cultural revolution that replaced some of the traditionalist and medieval social and political systems with ones that were modern, scientific, westernized, and based on The Enlightenment. Peter's reforms made a lasting impact on Russia and many institutions of Russian government trace their origins to his reign. - Constantinople was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD. - Fyodor Isakovich Baykov ( Russian : , c. 1612 - c. 1663 ) was the first Russian envoy to China ( 1658 ) . For background see History of Sino - Russian relations . Like many later Russian ambassadors to China ( Nicolae Milescu , Sava Vladislavich ) he left a detailed account of his journey . In 1654 Tsar Alexis sent Baykov to the court of the Shunzhi Emperor to negotiate a treaty establishing regular trade between Moscow and Beijing . ( The first Russian to reach Peking was probably Ivan Petlin in 1618 , but he was not properly an ambassador . ) At this time the Manchu Qing Dynasty had just been established and Russian adventurers had just entered the Amur River valley from the north , but the Manchus apparently did not understand that these barbarians from beyond Mongolia were the same as those who were raiding their northern frontier . The Russians of course knew the connection , but gave Baykov no instructions for dealing with the Amur problem . He was , however , instructed to make obeisance to no one but the emperor himself . Before leaving Tobolsk , he sent Setkul Ablin ahead as messenger . Ablin reached Peking in late 1655 , sold his trade goods and returned in the spring of 1656 , passing , but not meeting , Baykov 's party . After a long stay at Tobolsk Baykov 's mission set out in June or autumn of 1654 . He traveled up the Irtysh River across Dzungaria and Gobi Desert . In 1655 they reached Kalgan on the Great Wall . Here he was stopped by the Chinese who did not know who he was ( They thought Ablin had been the real ambassador ) . After receiving permission , he reached the Forbidden City on 3 March 1656 . He refused to kowtow at the city gate , but was admitted anyway and was housed by the Li - Fan Yuan . He insisted that his presents and credentials be presented to the emperor himself and in general did not behave with proper submissiveness to the great Chinese emperor . After several months of isolation , he was expelled from China 's capital ( in 1657 or 4 September 1656 ) and reached Moscow... - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south. - Vladivostok (literally \\"ruler of the east\\") is a city and the administrative center of Primorsky Krai, Russia, located at the head of the Golden Horn Bay, not far from Russia's borders with China and North Korea. The population of the city as of 2016 is 606,653, up from 592,034 recorded in the 2010 Russian census. The city is the home port of the Russian Pacific Fleet and the largest Russian port on the Pacific Ocean. - Prior to the 1600s China and Russia were on opposite ends of Siberia, which was populated by independent nomads. By about 1640 Russian settlers had conquered most of Siberia and founded settlements in the Amur River basin. From 1652 to 1689, China's armies drove the Russian settlers out, but after 1689 China and Russia made peace and established trade agreements. By the mid-1800s China's economy and military lagged far behind the colonial powers, so it signed unequal treaties with Western countries such as Russia, through which Russia annexed the Amur basin and Vladivostok. The Russian Empire and other powers exacted many other concessions from China, among which were indemnities for anti-Western riots, control over China's tariffs, and extraterritorial agreements including legal immunity for foreigners and foreign businesses. Many Chinese people felt humiliated by China's submission to these foreign interests, and this contributed to widespread hostility towards the emperor of China. In 1911 public anger led to a revolution, which marked the beginning of the Republic of China. However, China's new regime (known as the Beiyang government) was forced to sign further unequal treaties with Western countries, including Russia. - The Beiyang government (), also sometimes spelled \\"Peiyang Government\\", refers to the government of the Republic of China, which was in place in the capital city Beijing from 1912 to 1928. It was internationally recognized as the legitimate Chinese government. The name derives from the Beiyang Army, which dominated its politics with the rise of Yuan Shikai, who was a general of the previous imperial Qing government. After his death the army fractured into competing factions. Although the government and the state were nominally under civilian control under a constitution, the Beiyang generals were effectively in charge of it, with various factions vying for power. The government however enjoyed legitimacy abroad along with diplomatic recognition, had access to the tax and customs revenue, and could apply for foreign financial loans. - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions. - East Asia is the eastern subregion of the Asian continent, which can be defined in either geographical or ethno-cultural terms. Geographically and geopolitically, it includes China, Hong Kong, and Macao; Mongolia and Taiwan; North and South Korea; and Japan; it covers about , or about 28% of the Asian continent, about twice the area of Europe. - The Communist Party of China (CPC) is the founding and ruling political party of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The CPC is the sole governing party of China, although it coexists alongside eight other legal parties that comprise the United Front; these parties, however, hold no real power or independence from the CPC. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 the CPC had driven the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government from mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, thus leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The CPC is currently the world's second largest political party with a membership of 88.76 million as of 2016 (while the Indian Bharatiya Janata Party appears to have remained the largest with a membership of 110 million as of the previous year, 2015). It also controls the world's largest armed force, the People's Liberation Army. - Jurisdiction (from the Latin \\"ius, \\" meaning \\"law\\" and \\"\\" meaning \\"to speak\\") is the practical authority granted to a legal body to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility, e.g., Michigan tax law. In the federations like USA, areas of jurisdiction apply to local, state, and federal levels; e.g. the court has jurisdiction to apply federal law. - The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman Beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror. - Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, is an autonomous territory on the Pearl River Delta of East Asia. Macau lies across the delta to the west, and the Chinese province of Guangdong borders the territory to the north. With a total land area of and a population of over 7.3 million of various nationalities, it ranks as the world's fourth most densely populated sovereign state or territory. - Chongqing, formerly transliterated as Chungking, is a major city in Southwest China and one of the Five national central cities in China. Administratively, it is one of China's four direct-controlled municipalities (the other three are Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), and the only such municipality in inland China. - Shenzhen is a major city in Guangdong Province, China. The city is located immediately north of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and holds sub-provincial administrative status, with powers slightly less than a province. - Guangzhou , traditionally romanised as Canton, is the capital and largest city of the Province of Guangdong in southeastern China. Located on the Pearl River about north-northwest of Hong Kong and north of Macau, Guangzhou was a major terminus of the maritime Silk Road and continues to serve as a major port and transportation hub. - Sava Lukich Vladislavich-Raguzinsky (\\"Sava Vladislavi Raguzinski\\"; 16 January 1669 17 June 1738) was a Serbian diplomat, count and merchant-adventurer in the employ of Peter the Great who conducted important diplomatic negotiations in Constantinople, Rome and Beijing. His most lasting achievement was the Treaty of Kiakhta, which regulated relations between the Russian Empire and the Qing Empire until the mid-19th century. Also, he was an author of a whole number of pamphlets, monographs, treaties and letters concerned with liberating the lands of the Slavs, then occupied by the Ottoman Empire and the forces of Leopold I. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbors include China (officially the People's Republic of China, abbreviated as PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy.

As the muggers check their seemingly unconscious victim for cash, The Man regains consciousness and brutally kills them. Around that time, Inspector Peter Neilson is investigating the apparent murder scene of the young Melissa and Nikki. In a flashback, the two girls are shown in a goth club looking to pick up men. Melissa spotted The Man and took him home. After spending the night with him, she began hallucinating about the people around turning to her with monstrous faces and voices. Melissa went to Nikki's house to seek help, then a creature burst out of Melissa's womb and attacked Nikki, killing both. Sophie and Emma break into a house in a burglary attempt. When Emma finds a box of money under a bed, a bony old man pops up from the bedcovers and attacks her. The girls stab and bludgeon the old man multiple times before he finally dies. Intending to keep the loot to herself and seeing Emma as a liability for revealing their plan to her sister, Sophie kills Emma and runs home. There, the re-animated bodies of Emma and the old man appear and stab Sophie to death. As the dead bodies are identified, Inspector Neilson links them to an earlier case he had solved in the past. The case involved a man named Kemper, former hypnotist and son of an infamous Satanist. Kemper had been using his skills to manipulate, abduct and kill children for over 25 years until he was apprehended by Neilson, tried and committed to a lunatic asylum.

Former shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn told activists they should \\"rise above the most vile abuse\\" being thrown at them by other members of the party. Mr Benn, whose sacking led to a wave of shadow cabinet resignations, said \\"now was the time for unity\\". And former leader Ed Miliband has said Labour should not be \\"written off\\". Speaking at the party conference in Liverpool, Mr Miliband urged MPs to get behind his successor. \\"The government is there for the taking. There is a real opportunity for us. All those who write off this party are wrong. They've written us off before and we always come back.\\" Several MPs have indicated they might return to serve under Mr Corbyn after his re-election although some have made the reinstatement of shadow cabinet elections a precondition of coming back into the fold after this summer's mass walkout in protest at Mr Corbyn's leadership. Amid calls for openly critical MPs to pledge their loyalty to Mr Corbyn following his re-election, Unite boss Len McCluskey urged MPs to let him lead \\"without having to pluck knives out of his back\\". \\"Bar from a small rump of right-wing Lab MPs who will continue to try and rock the boat, I think the vast majority will come back,\\" he said. \\"We'll have a front bench that will effectively be of all of the talents, all sections of our party, and it will be a pretty impressive shadow cabinet.\\" Mr Benn, who was dismissed by Mr Corbyn after telling him that he had lost confidence in him after the EU referendum, told a Labour First rally at the party conference in Liverpool that the party must now come together and \\"rise above\\" any abuse. \\"We have won Labour parliamentary representation from Keir Hardie onwards and we do that by working together and those values have not changed and are alive and well in every single one of us in the party. \\"We should celebrate the fact that so many new members have joined the party, every single one of us is a guardian of those values. \\"But we have to treat each other with respect, and I know that is difficult when there is the most vile abuse from people who say they are members of the Labour party directed at other members of the Labour party.\\" Mr Benn, who is planning to stand as the new chair of the Commons Brexit committee, has said he will not be returning to the shadow cabinet but others have indicated they may consider doing so. Former Northern Ireland spokesman Vernon Coaker said shadow cabinet elections were \\"an olive branch that [Mr Corbyn] could use to reach out to other parts of the party\\". \\"Shadow cabinet elections would be a sign that he means what he says when he talks about wiping the slate clean and in terms of reaching out to all parts of the party while we come together to do what we all want to do which is win power for Labour.\\" Asked whether he would join Mr Corbyn's top team, if invited to do so, Mr Miliband said: \\"I decided a year ago to be a backbencher. That is what I anticipate still happening. \\"Look this is a matter for Jeremy but I don't anticipate that changing.\\" Labour leaders have handpicked their top team since elections were scrapped in 2011 but many see their return as a prerequisite for soothing tensions in the party over Mr Corbyn's leadership and accommodating different views. Labour's ruling body has held initial discussions about the issue although no decision is likely to be taken for several weeks amid calls from those close to Mr Corbyn for party members to have a say, not just MPs. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell, a key ally of Mr Corbyn, said MPs who had quit the shadow cabinet would be welcome back because Labour was a \\"broad church\\" or could instead do \\"valuable work\\" from the backbenches. He said he was \\"open for discussion\\" as to who was able to vote in any future elections and confirmed the status quo would remain while discussions took place.

The inversion would result in the sentence sounding unnatural, So unnatural sentences will be considered changed. Label the instances as \\"Original\\" or \\"Changed\\" based on your judgment. Problem:We got in to the dim cave and immediately threw some flairs and sound judgments , I guess there are perks to being a government agent . Solution:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the task - In this task, we need to determine if a noun or verb has been replaced with another word with the same part of speech in the given sentence, causing it to sound unnatural. Step 2: Identify the guidelines - The guidelines state that we should label the instances as \\"Original\\" if no replacement occurred, and \\"Changed\\" if a replacement has taken place. Step 3: Analyze the sentence - Here is the given sentence: \\"We got in to the dim cave and immediately threw some flairs and sound judgments, I guess there are perks to being a government agent.\\" Step 4: Identify any unnatural words - There are some unnatural words within the sentence: - \\"flairs\\": This word seems to be out of place. In the context of entering a cave and needing light, the correct word would be \\"flares.\\" - \\"sound judgments\\": This phrase seems unusual in this specific context. Considering they are in a dark cave and may need to be cautious, the more suitable phrase might be \\"cautionary measures.\\" Step 5: Label the instances - Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that the sentence has been \\"Changed\\" due to the presence of unnatural words/phrase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The album was Slayer's ninth studio recording, and was released on August 8, 2006. During reviews \\"Jihad\\" received a mixed reception. Blabbermouth's Don Kaye gave the opinion that \\"a handful of songs\\" on Christ Illusion \\"are either too generic or the arrangements are too clumsy to work well\\", and specifically singled out the track: \\"I'm looking at you, 'Jihad' and 'Skeleton Christ'.\\" Ben Ratliff of New York Times remarked that the song is \\"predictably tough stuff, but let's put it on a scale. It is tougher, and less reasoned, than Martin Amis's recent short story 'The Last Days of Muhammad Atta.' It is no tougher than a taped message from Al Qaeda.\\" Peter Atkinson of KNAC.com was equally unimpressed, describing the group's choice of song climax as: ..the same sort of detached, matter-of-fact tactic Hanneman and Araya have employed for \\"difficult\\" subjects in the past—Josef Mengele's Nazi atrocities in \\"Angel of Death\\" or Jeffrey Dahmer/Ed Gein's ghoulish proclivities in \\"213\\" and \\"Dead Skin Mask\\"—with great effect.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- The most eagerly anticipated animated film this year hits big screens this weekend, as \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" opens worldwide. The Screening Room spoke to creator Matt Groening and writer Al Jean in London about everyone's favorite two-dimensional yellow family. Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \\"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive.\\" Its creators hope that \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, \\"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused.

Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What country were the people in who then contributed to making sure the Scottish hopes would not come to be? Context: In 1695, the Scottish Parliament granted a charter to the Company of Scotland, which established a settlement in 1698 on the isthmus of Panama. Besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of New Granada, and afflicted by malaria, the colony was abandoned two years later. The Darien scheme was a financial disaster for Scotland—a quarter of Scottish capital was lost in the enterprise—and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire. The episode also had major political consequences, persuading the governments of both England and Scotland of the merits of a union of countries, rather than just crowns. This occurred in 1707 with the Treaty of Union, establishing the Kingdom of Great Britain. Answer:","completion":"The country where the people were in who then contributed to making sure the Scottish hopes would not come to be is Spain. The context mentions that the Scottish settlement was besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of New Granada. This implies that the people from Spain, or specifically Spanish colonists, played a role in ensuring that the Scottish hopes would not come to be.

News article: Small Business - Entrepreneurs in Iraq Tangle in U.S. Red Tape - FORTUNE SMALL BUSINESS Iraq's economy probably won't grow on milk-and-cookie companies alone, but it's a start. That's the opinion of Sadik Hamra, whose 15-year-old Baghdad company, Hamra Cookies, employs 160 people. \\"Small companies like mine can do a lot for our country,\\" says Hamra. Until now he has sold only cookies, but he hopes to buy an adjacent dairy soon so that he can expand into the milk business (and hire another 100 Iraqis desperate for jobs). To make that happen, he says, he needs about 4 million. That amount would be hard to come by in any country, let alone Iraq. The few Baghdad banks now extending loans demand collateral of 200% to 800% of the amount requested. That is a deal breaker, even for relatively successful firms such as Hamra's. In short, he says, \\"My company needs America.\\" U.S. officials in charge of Iraq's reconstruction are realizing that they need Hamra tooand other entrepreneurs like him. Iraqi small businesses, they hope, could do for that country what small businesses have done in the U.S.: spur the economy and create jobs. \\"We can rebuild Iraq, one business at a time,\\" says Greg Wong, 43, the U.S. Department of Commerce's new senior commercial officer in Baghdad. Wong showed up in Baghdad this summer to coordinate the host of organizations now trying to help Iraqi companies get established and grow. The biggest is the U.S. Army's Operation Adam Smith, a multimillion-dollar plan to revitalize Baghdad's commercial districts and eventually build a business incubator at Baghdad University. The U.S. State and Commerce Departments are trying to establish U.S.-style chambers of commerce, first in Baghdad and later around the country. And more than a dozen nongovernment organizations, such as the Volunteers for Economic Growth Alliance and CHF International, are in Iraq, hoping to mentor entrepreneurs and distribute grants and loans. Funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, they are offering loans of 100 to 5 million. Unfortunately, for all the money and all the energetic, well-meaning Americans being thrown at the problem, their efforts so far have produced few success stories. Lessons in writing business plans aren't of much use to Iraqi entrepreneurs whose shops and customers are threatened by shellfire and snipers and only occasionally have electricity. The roads over which supplies and finished goods must travel are preyed upon by bandits and kidnappers. Even picking up the phone is a hassle. Land lines are virtually useless; most Iraqis rely on cellphones. But the country has three wireless phone systems: Iraqis use one service, U.S. officials such as Wong make calls on another, and Middle Easterners from outside Iraq use a third. And the three systems do not connect with each other reliably. Some enterprising business owners, both American and Iraqi, have found ways to navigate the hostile environment. Secure Global Engineering, a Middletown, R.I., construction firm with 45 employees, had never ventured overseas until this year. But in March, CEO Stephen Johanson, 53, set up an operation in Baghdad, quickly secured some 5 million in reconstruction contracts, and now has as many as 700 Iraqis on his books. Rather than go it alone or hire an American private-security firm, Johanson partnered with a small Iraqi contractor who had political connections. Before a single shovel was dug into the ground, Johanson and his Iraqi partner (who asked not to be named) got the blessing of 54 of the area's tribal sheikhs. Says Johanson: \\"Finding local partners and settling security concerns is essential to doing business in Iraq.\\" Similarly, some Iraqi entrepreneurs are doing just fine, but they tend to own businesses catering to men and women in the U.S. military. Inside Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, where the majority of Americans live, is an army-built pedestrian mall of 35 stores. Set up in January as a convenience for U.S. soldiers, government workers, and civilian contractors, the market gives entrepreneurial-minded Iraqis a chance to earn some badly needed U.S. dollars. Here you can get everything from a stale 7 carton of Marlboros to 5 bootleg DVDs and sequined belly-dancing outfits for 20. The strip's most popular shop is Big John's. \\"We are like Wal-Mart,\\" says Jamal \\"Big John\\" Tayem, a burly, barrel-chested 45-year-old Iraqi who was a Russian-studies professor during Saddam's reign. Unemployed after the war, he says he saw the arrival of American soldiers more as an opportunity than an occupation. With a wink, Tayem says, \\"I knew I could work with Americanskis.\\" His English may be accented with an unusual mixture of Arabic and Russian tones, but his business sense is decidedly American. \\"We pay attention to customer service,\\" says Tayem, who prides himself on being on a first-name basis with his clientele of American servicepeople. Nearly twice the size of the other stores on the strip, at 300 square feet, and the only one to offer air conditioning, Big John's also has outdoor speakers playing everything from George Michael to OutKast. Tayem does a brisk business, and although he is vague on how much he nets each week, he makes change for customers from a thick wad of 20s and 50s.

Then, I looked for the verb \\"é\\" which means \\"è\\" and the adverb \\"diametralmente\\" which remains the same in Italian. Next, I focused on the prepositional phrase \\"o contrario á forma\\" and translated it into \\"oppuesto al modo\\" in Italian, which means \\"opposto al modo\\". I continued by examining the rest of the sentence and identified the conjunctions \\"e\\" which means \\"e\\" in Italian. Finally, I tackled the most complex part of the sentence, which consists of the emotions (ira, medo, pánico) and the responses (fuxida, enfrontamento). I translated the emotions \\"ira\\" as \\"rabbia\\", \\"medo\\" as \\"paura\\", and \\"pánico\\" as \\"panico\\" - all of which have a very close corresponding word in Italian.

Summarize this article: German President Christian Wulff resigned amid the threat of a legal probe into corruption allegations, delivering a blow to Chancellor Angela Merkel that risks distracting her from the euro-region debt crisis. Wulff is the second German president to quit in less than two years, forcing Merkel to find a fresh candidate with cross- party support for the largely ceremonial post. Merkel canceled a planned trip to Rome today as Wulff’s intentions became clear, and instead held a conference call on the crisis with Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and Lucas Papademos of Greece. Wulff, 52, a former deputy leader of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, was picked by the chancellor to replace the previous incumbent, Horst Koehler, after Koehler’s surprise resignation in May 2010. Wulff was elected by a special national assembly on June 30 of that year. His decision to quit “is a huge setback for Merkel,” Gerd Langguth, a Merkel biographer and political scientist at the University of Bonn, said in a phone interview. “No one could have imagined the extent of this. No one could have imagined that this would take on such dimensions.” Merkel said that she will consult in the coming days with opposition political leaders to try and indentify a successor candidate to put to the assembly, which will meet within 30 days. She is due to discuss the presidential succession with her fellow coalition party leaders in Berlin tomorrow. Potential candidates mentioned in the German media include Labor Minister Ursula von der Leyen and Bundestag President Norbert Lammert. ‘Rule of Law’ Merkel said that she “deeply regrets” Wulff’s resignation, though respected the decision. The development shows “the strength of our rule of law that treats everybody equally, irrespective of position,” she told reporters. The resignation is a diversion for Merkel as she seeks to steer Europe’s response to the debt crisis that China has said threatens to trigger systemic risks to the global economy. With a second Greek bailout hanging in the balance, Merkel, Monti and Papademos expressed optimism after their call that an agreement on Greece can be reached at a Feb. 20 meeting of euro-area finance ministers, Monti’s office said in an e-mailed statement. The German president’s resignation is unlikely to affect the role of Europe’s biggest economy in the crisis, and might even result in “a small positive,” Christian Schulz of Berenberg Bank in London said in a note. ‘Additional Tools’ “The drive for a candidate supported by all major parties shows the current unity in German politics on major political questions,” Schulz said. “The centre-left opposition supports Merkel’s European crisis management and is even more open to additional tools including Eurobonds.” Wulff’s role was largely confined to representing Germany abroad until allegations relating to a private home loan during his time as state prime minister of Lower Saxony were aired in Germany’s best-selling Bild newspaper on Dec. 13, then followed up in Der Spiegel magazine. Within days, he was facing growing scrutiny of his financial affairs including vacations at the homes of business people, and calls from the opposition to quit. Prosecutors in Lower Saxony, which Wulff governed from 2003 to 2010, submitted a request to the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, to have the president’s immunity lifted. They want to open an official probe after finding “initial evidence to suppose” the acceptance of illicit favors, the prosecutor’s office in the state capital of Hanover said in a statement on its website today. “Developments in past days and weeks have shown that this confidence and my ability to act are lastingly damaged,” Wulff told reporters at the presidential palace in Berlin today, as he announced his resignation. ‘Legally Correct’ “As far as the upcoming legal procedures are concerned, I’m convinced that it will lead to a complete discharge. I’ve always been legally correct in my offices,” he said. “I have made mistakes but I have always been sincere.” Pending the Federal Assembly convening, Bavarian Premier Horst Seehofer, who holds the rotating chair of the upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat, will serve as interim president. Seehofer also leads Merkel’s Christian Social Union ally, one of three coalition parties together with her CDU and the Free Democratic Party, led by Economy Minister Philipp Roesler. Merkel is now forced to devote her attention to lobbying for support for a fresh candidate among the 1,240-member Federal Assembly of lawmakers and state delegates that elects the president, having lost ground after regional election defeats throughout 2011 that she and other party officials blamed on the crisis. Diminished Majority The chancellor may struggle to push through a favored candidate compared with June 2010, when it unexpectedly took three votes to elect Wulff. The chancellor’s majority in the assembly has since narrowed to as little as two seats from 21 seats at the last vote, according to electoral website wahlrecht.de. What’s more, the main opposition Social Democrats and Greens have indicated that they want to revive the candidacy of Joachim Gauck, a Protestant pastor and former East German dissident whom Wulff defeated for the presidency at the third ballot. Polls at the time showed Gauck to be the more popular candidate among the general public. “If she picks a recognized personality she will survive this without damage,” Langguth said. “The question is what possibilities she has to replace” Wulff. Island Vacation Prosecutors have been looking into whether they need to question Wulff over payments by businessman David Gronewold in connection with a vacation on the German island of Sylt in 2007. Last month, an office in the president’s Berlin residence was searched by prosecutors as part of a separate investigation of his former spokesman, Olaf Glaeseker. The workplace was raided because Glaeseker had left private material there that the president’s office couldn’t hand over. German financial regulator Bafin is meanwhile reviewing whether Wulff violated capital market rules in the wake of Porsche SE’s failed bid to take over Volkswagen AG (VOW), Der Spiegel reported today. Wulff may have learned in February 2008 that Porsche was planning the bid and Bafin is reviewing whether he may have had to disclose that fact to the markets, the magazine reported, without saying where it got the information. As the prime minister of Volkswagen’s home state of Lower Saxony, he was a member of the carmaker’s supervisory board at the time. Bafin spokeswoman Dominika Kula declined to comment, adding that the regulator has a rule not to comment on any of its investigative work. Wulff’s lawyer Gernot Lehr declined to comment when contacted by telephone today. The resignation calls into question Merkel’s judgment, leaving her “somewhat diminished,” Sony Kapoor, managing director at Re-Define, a firm that advises governments on economic policy, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Maryam Nemazee. Even so, Merkel is “still very much reigning as the queen of Europe for now,” Kapoor said. “There is no ready challenger to the German power play in the euro crisis today.” To contact the reporters on this story: Patrick Donahue in Berlin at at pdonahue1@bloomberg.net; Karin Matussek in Berlin at kmatussek@bloomberg.net. To contact the editors responsible for this story: James Hertling at jhertling@bloomberg.net; Anthony Aarons at aaarons@bloomberg.net ||||| Berlin (CNN) -- Germany's President Christian Wulff announced his resignation Friday following a series of scandals that prompted calls for him to step down. The German presidency is a largely ceremonial office, but Wulff's resignation is seen as a blow to Chancellor Angela Merkel, who supported his candidacy as president. However, it is unlikely to impact Germany's handling of the eurozone debt crisis, Carsten Brzeski, a senior economist at ING, told CNN. In a brief televised statement, Merkel said she accepted Wulff's resignation with the \\"utmost respect and deepest personal regret.\\" Wulff had put the interests of the general public to the fore in deciding to resign, Merkel said. In a separate televised statement, Wulff said Germany \\"needs a president who can devote himself completely to national and international challenges\\" -- and one who commands the trust of a wide majority of citizens. \\"The developments of the past days and weeks have shown that this trust and therefore confidence in my ability to serve have been adversely affected,\\" he said. \\"For this reason, it is no longer possible for me to continue in my role as president.\\" The scandal involves alleged political favors and financial impropriety while he was state premier of Lower Saxony. The Hanover prosecutor's office called Thursday for the government to waive the president's immunity from prosecution, in light of the evidence it had gathered. \\"Following extensive analyses of new documents and the evaluation of further media reports, the Hanover Public Prosecutor's Office now has sufficient factual evidence and therefore grounds for initial suspicion of receiving bribes or being granted advantages,\\" it said in a statement. \\"(The Office) therefore proposes to the president of the German Parliament that immunity for the federal president be waived.\\" The Hanover prosecutors are investigating David Groenewold, a German film producer, alongside Wulff. At the center of the issue is a story -- first reported on by the German tabloid BILD in mid-December last year -- that Wulff received a low interest, €500,000 (649,000) private loan from the wife of a wealthy friend while still governor of Lower Saxony. This was followed by intense criticism when it emerged that Wulff had attempted to prevent the paper from publishing the story. Trying to put a lid on any negative media coverage, Wulff left an angry message on the answering machine of BILD's editor-in-chief Kai Diekmann before it reported on the loan. Although Wulff eventually apologized to Diekmann, the former president has always maintained that he did nothing wrong throughout the course of the scandals -- something he reiterated during his resignation speech. \\"I have always behaved legally correctly in the offices I held,\\" he said. \\"I have made mistakes, but I was always honest.\\" Merkel said Wulff's presidency would be remembered for his efforts to promote a modern, tolerant Germany. She added: \\"With his resignation, President Wulff reiterated his conviction that he always behaved legally correctly in office and in service to the people of our country. I express my utmost respect for this position.\\" The members of her governing coalition would now discuss who should stand for election in his place, she said, in consultation with other political parties. Merkel had been due to meet Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti in Rome to discuss the eurozone crisis but canceled the trip amid the political storm over Wulff, who belongs to her party. However, Brzeski said that Wulff's resignation should not have any direct impact on Germany's handling of the eurozone crisis in the short term, given his almost entirely ceremonial role. \\"Even if it is the highest official office in Germany, he has no say at all in the government's policy toward the crisis,\\" Brzeski said. However, in the medium term the Wulff affair could weaken Merkel's position in domestic politics, he said, which could affect her ability to win parliamentary votes on the eurozone's bailout fund, the EFSF, and a second bailout package for Greece. Merkel has not had involvement in any of the scandals. But Wulff's departure comes within two years of the resignation of his predecessor, Horst Koehler, who was also backed by Merkel -- raises a question mark over her judgment, Brzeski added. Merkel's decision to liaise with the Social Democrats and the Greens on finding a replacement for Wulff is a break from her earlier stance in 2010, when she insisted on Wulff as successor to Koehler, who resigned following controversial comments in which he suggested military deployments were vital to Germany's economic success. The chairman of the Social Democrats (SPD), Sigmar Gabriel, said Wulff's decision had been long overdue. \\"Germany needs a new beginning,\\" he said. \\"I'm assuming that the leaders of the CDU and Federal Chancellor Merkel won't for the third time be selecting a new candidate with purely partisan motives. They have to include all political parties in their discussions to find a consensus candidate.\\" The Greens' parliamentary leaders, Renate Künast and Jürgen Trittin, said they were \\"relieved that Christian Wulff has finally unburdened the country from agonizing debate with his resignation.\\" Wulff, who was the state premier of Lower Saxony for seven years, was one of Merkel's biggest rivals within the Christian Democrats before being elected to the presidency in 2010. It took three rounds of voting in the Bundestag, or German parliament, before he won enough backing from lawmakers to assume the role. German presidents are elected by the Federal Convention, comprised of parliament members. Wulff was born in Osnabruck, Lower Saxony, in June 1959 and went on to become a lawyer, according to the official website of the presidency. He first entered local politics as a member of the CDU party in 1986 and was elected to Lower Saxony's parliament in 1994. He was chosen as state premiere by lawmakers in his party following elections in 2003. He was the 10th president to serve in the Federal Republic of Germany. He has been married twice and has two children of his own and a stepson.

Her almond-shaped brown eyes shine through her sunken face as a doctor lifts her sweater to reveal a tiny rib cage pushing against her skin. Little more than a year old, Israa al Masri wastes away at the National Hospital in the besieged Damascus suburbs just a few miles from the medical supplies needed to save her. Slowly, painfully, organs shut down one by one as her muscles atrophy until, barley breathing. On January 12, the toddler's heart stops. The cause of death: hunger. Starvation is the Syrian government's newest and cruelest weapon against opposition neighborhoods leaving infants with swollen heads and distended bodies, their mothers dry of breast milk, and their elders skeletal and dehydrated, according to activists and doctors. In one of the earliest cases, 1-year-old Farah Atout arrived at the Maliha medical center weak and whimpering as doctors struggled to find veins to feed her intravenously. \\"I remember this child very well she was about a year old and she weighed only 4 kilograms,\\" said Dr. Mazin Ramadan, who treated Atout last November. Her destitute family fled their village with just the clothes on their back, leaving them with little access to food, Ramadan said. \\"They arrived and put this child between my hands and imagined with a shot or some medicine her strength would come back and the ordeal would be over,\\" said Ramadan, one of the few pediatricians in the area. After just 48 hours, nothing remained of the baby but a skeletal frame with tubes bandaged to a yellowed face frozen in anguish. But what appeared at the time a unique horror, now repeats itself over and over in the Damascus suburbs, doctors and activists told CNN. Parents often risk death by sniper fire, simply to forage for nutrition. A nurse, who did not wish to be identified for fear of reprisal, in the besieged Yarmouk Palestinian Refugee Camp on the outskirts of Damascus told Amnesty International that around four people a day arrive with gunshot wounds from snipers targeting civilians as they pick plants and shrubs from nearby fields. Established in 1957, Yarmouk, an unofficial refugee camp, has been home for decades to thousands of Palestinians displaced by Arab-Israeli wars. At National Hospital South of Damascus, near Yarmouk, 43 people have died of starvation, 22 of them children, the youngest just 23 days old, with most of the deaths occurring this past month, a dramatic increase, according to hospital staff. \\"Sometimes I get a case due to malnutrition or lack of medicine and, I feel utter desperation because I cannot help the child. We have reached a state where this is normal -- that every two to three days a child dies. It just feels like there is no nutrition. What can we do?\\" said a doctor at the hospital who did not wish to be identified out of fear of Syrian forces. Parents sometimes crumble in the face of despair and very few options. \\"I had a 2-year-old patient just a few days ago, and she was diagnosed with a life threatening condition and when her father found out he said 'OK. I will take her home to die.' Just like that -- without hesitation. He said 'What am I to do? There is no food and no medicine,' \\" the doctor said. Infants are particularly vulnerable. \\"The first 1000 days of life, from conception to 2 years are absolutely critical as far as nutrition and the developmental foundations of life are concerned. If the child in the womb of a pregnant mother, and the mother isn't getting the food she needs and there is this obstacle in the way of getting access to this kind of vital nutrients they need to grow. They are not going to recover. That is a real tragedy,\\" said Greg Barrow a spokesman for the United Nations World Food Programme. In a video widely viewed on YouTube of a skeletal 10-year-old named Bashar Kaboush in the eastern Ghouta town of Jisreen, a distraught man who CNN has confirmed is a relative of the child shouts: \\"Is this acceptable to God? Look at this child. Is this acceptable to world? Does the look like a human body? Is this the arm of a child? He is just 10 years old.\\" Mohammed Abu al Rgaa an activist in Jisreen told CNN that residents fear Kaboush and dozens of others may soon die of hunger. Rgaa shared with CNN the case of 8-month-old Mohamad Faissal from the same town who recently died from lack of infant milk and proper medical care. Shocking online video of Faissal's lifeless body bore the hallmarks of starvation such as a swollen abdomen and protruding ribs, doctors said. The cause of crisis is clear. The once thriving agriculture belt to the east of the capital and the collection of towns and neighborhoods to the south wilted under a government siege blocking food staples from those areas. Opposition-controlled farmland lies desolate after nearly two years of warfare that has destroyed crops and livestock, leaving little more than stores of grain for thousands trapped behind government tanks. Many say the blockades are used by the Syrian government as collective punishment against opposition areas. Hostilities make it difficult to gain a clear view of the scope and scale of malnutrition in the area, but the WFP estimates at least 800,000 civilians remain under siege. \\"This underlines exactly why humanitarian agencies like the WFP have been calling for more access. To really see with their eyes: What is the scale of the problem? Who is most vulnerable? What kind of assistance do they need? And how can we get it in fast? That is absolutely critical,\\" Barrow said. Amnesty International has been more direct: \\"The Syrian government is cruelly punishing civilians living in opposition-held areas. Starving civilians as a method of warfare is a war crime. The blockades must be lifted immediately and access to humanitarian aid must never be used to score military or political gains,\\" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa director. Syrian officials failed to respond to CNN requests for comment on this story, but have said in general terms that \\"foreign-backed terrorists\\" catapulted the country into a spiral of violence that has triggered Syrian army efforts to expel opposition fighters from the Damascus suburbs. Perhaps most disturbingly, packed aid convoys ready and willing to deliver assistance to those in need are barred from doing so -- mainly by Syrian government troops. \\"The road to political stability and confidence building in Syria starts with an important step: ensuring no one dies because of a lack of food or medicine or from the cold when humanitarian workers are nearby but are not allowed in\\" said Ertharin Cousin, WFP's executive director. Geneva II peace talks secured an agreement for some aid to enter the Yarmouk Palestinian Refugee Camp this week, but several hundred food parcels and limited medical evacuations are simply not enough to stave off malnutrition. \\"To make any progress in addressing these needs, UNRWA's presence and humanitarian assistance work must be permitted to continue and expand over a period of months, not days,\\" Chris Gunness, Spokesman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees said in a statement. \\"If the siege does not end, I expect even I will be dead,\\" Assaf said over a crackly Skype connection. \\"If the siege is not broken these cases will increase and there will be mass death. To be honest this is what I would expect: mass death.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1. Starvation has become the Syrian government's newest and cruelest weapon against opposition-controlled areas, leading to widespread malnutrition among infants, mothers, and elders in besieged Damascus suburbs. 2.

In 1963, Roger J. Traynor of the Supreme Court of California threw away legal fictions based on warranties and imposed strict liability for defective products as a matter of public policy in the landmark case of Greenman v.

The area of the stripe to be painted is then (t/12) feet by (m*5280) feet. Area is width times length, so the area of the stripe in square feet is (t/12) * (m*5280).

The phrase \\"is worth seeing\\" generally indicates that the reviewer believes the film has value and watching it would not be a waste of time for the audience. The sentence does not provide specifics about the movie's aspects, such as acting, directing, plot, or visuals, but it does signal an overall positive sentiment toward the film. The reviewer likely found some redeeming qualities within the movie that made it enjoyable or engaging. When a reviewer states that a film is \\"worth seeing,\\" they could mean that the movie elicits an emotional response, provides entertainment, possesses thought-provoking content, or showcases impressive filmmaking skills. It also suggests that the reviewer believes the movie has merits that the audience would find interesting or valuable. However, it should be noted that the phrase \\"is worth seeing\\" typically does not convey an exceptionally strong positive sentiment. This means that, while the reviewer would recommend the movie, it might not be considered a five-star masterpiece or a must-watch classic. This phrase might be used to describe a film that is enjoyable to watch but might not appeal to everyone or prove groundbreaking in terms of content or production.

We see it, smell it, drink it and even hear it. Man has been polluting the earth. The more people, the more pollution. Many years ago, the problem was not so serious because there were not so many people. When the land was used up or the river was dirty in a place, men moved to another place. But this is no longer true. Man is now slowly polluting the whole world. Air pollution is still the most serious. It's bad to all living things in the world, but it is not only one kind of pollution. Water pollution kills fish and pollutes drinking water. Noise pollution makes us become angry more easily. Many countries are making rules to fight against pollution. They stop the people from burning coal in houses and factories in the city, and from blowing dirty smoke into the air. The pollution of SO2 is now the most dangerous problem of air pollution. It is mostly caused by heavy traffic. It is certain that if there are fewer people driving, there will be less air pollution. The earth is our home. We must take care of it.

News article: DETROIT -- Detroit defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh was ejected from the Lions' 27-15 loss to the unbeaten Green Bay Packers on Thursday after he stomped on an opposing offensive lineman. Suh was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct and ejected early in the third quarter after the Lions thought they'd stopped the Packers on third down near the Detroit goal line. A replay showed Suh and Green Bay's Evan Dietrich-Smith scuffling on the ground briefly before the All-Pro defensive tackle first pushed Dietrich-Smith's head into the turf a few times, then stomped on the player's upper right arm. \\"I want to apologize to my teammates, my coaches and my true fans for allowing the refs to have an opportunity to take me out of this game,\\" Suh said. \\"What I did was remove myself from the situation the best way I felt, with me being held down.\\" Suh was quick to defend himself, saying he was trying to keep his balance while freeing himself from the brief scuffle. \\"My intention was not to kick anybody, as I did not, removing myself,\\" he said. \\"I was on top of a guy, being pulled down, and trying to get up off the ground -- and why you see me pushing his helmet down, because I'm trying to remove myself from the situation, and as I'm getting up, I'm getting pushed, so I'm getting myself on balance.\\" Dietrich-Smith wouldn't say it was a dirty play. \\"Stuff happens,\\" he said. Green Bay defensive end Ryan Pickett was more outspoken. \\"There's no place for that,\\" Pickett said. Ndamukong Suh was ejected after stomping Packers offensive lineman Evan Dietrich-Smith. Andrew Weber/US Presswire In October 2006, then-Tennessee Titans defensive lineman Albert Haynesworth drew a five-game suspension for stomping on former Dallas Cowboys center Andre Gurode's head. Mike Pereira, the former vice president of officiating for the NFL who now works for Fox as a rules analyst, said Thursday he expects Suh to be suspended multiple games. \\"Stomping on a guy is way over the line. He's not a dirty player, he's a filthy player,\\" Pereira tweeted. Suh's third-quarter dismissal helped turn a close game into a rout. It came on third down when the Lions appeared to have forced Green Bay to settle for a short field goal. Instead, the Packers scored a touchdown moments later, taking a 14-0 lead on John Kuhn's 1-yard run. It was 24-0 at the start of the fourth, and although the Lions (7-4) scored a couple late touchdowns, they lost on Thanksgiving for the eighth straight time. For Suh, it was another data point in the growing discussion about whether the 6-foot-4, 307-pounder plays dirty. In less than two seasons as a pro, Suh has established himself as one of the game's strongest and most athletic defensive linemen, but he's also received his share of fines. Suh requested and received a meeting earlier this season with commissioner Roger Goodell to discuss his play. He said that dialogue was helpful, but now the league will have to decide whether more discipline -- be it a fine, a suspension or both -- is merited in this case. \\"I can't speak on that,\\" Suh said. \\"I don't have a decision in that.\\" In August, Suh was fined a third time for roughing up a quarterback after grabbing Cincinnati's Andy Dalton and throwing him to the turf after he had gotten rid of the ball in a preseason game. He was fined last season for hits on Chicago's Jay Cutler during the regular season and Cleveland's Jake Delhomme in the preseason. Suh disputed the notion that he'd stepped on another player intentionally Thursday. \\"Not by any means. I understand, in this world, because of the type of player and the type of person I am, all eyes are on me. So why would I do something to jeopardize myself and jeopardize my team, first and foremost?\\" Suh said. \\"I did push his helmet multiple times because he's holding on to me. He's grabbing me. That's the reason I'm on top of him and I'm not at the quarterback, because I'm being held down by him and so I'm pushing him off of me.\\" The Packers had a player ejected in the first half, when Pat Lee appeared to take a swing at a Detroit player while covering a punt. Late in the second quarter Thursday, Lee became entangled with a couple of Lions and appeared to take a swing at Detroit's Aaron Berry well after the play was over. It was part of a first half that included 12 penalties -- eight by the Lions. The 27-year-old Lee was drafted in 2008 out of Auburn. He's started only one game in his NFL career. Information from The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| Detroit Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh is sorry for his third-quarter ejection for kicking Packers offensive lineman Evan Dietrich-Smith in the chest -- well, he's kind of sorry. In an unrepentant and at times defiant postgame rant, Suh maintained that he did not intentionally kick the Packers' guard and declined to apologize to the offended party for his Thanksgiving Day tussle. \\"What I did was remove myself from the situation the best way that I felt in me being held down in the situation that I was in,\\" Suh explained following the Lions' 27-15 loss. \\"My intentions were not to kick anybody, as I did not. (I was) removing myself, as you see, I'm walking away from the situation. And with that I apologize to my teammates, and my fans and my coaches for putting myself to be in position to be misinterpreted and taken out of the game.\\" The altercation occurred after Suh was pulled to the ground by Dietrich-Smith following an Aaron Rodgers incompletion on third-and-goal. Suh could be seen on video repeatedly pushing Dietrich-Smith's head to the ground, and he then kicked the Packer as he was getting pulled from the pile. An official immediately threw a flag, and Suh was ejected for unsportsmanlike conduct. Suh said it was clear, from his perspective, that his actions were misinterpreted. \\"I was on top of a guy being pulled down and trying to get up off the ground, which is why you see me pushing his helmet down,\\" Suh said. \\"As I'm getting up, I'm getting pushed so I'm getting myself unbalanced. ... With that a lot of people are going to interpret it as or create their own storylines, ... but I know what I did, and the man upstairs knows what I did.\\" Suh added: \\"I understand in this world because of the type of player and type of person I am, all eyes are on me. So why would I do something to jeopardize myself, jeopardize my team, first and foremost? I don't do bad things. I have no intentions to hurt someone. If I want to hurt him, I'm going to hit his quarterback as I did throughout that game. \\" ... If I see a guy stepping on somebody I feel like they're going to lean into it and forcefully step on that person or stand over that person. I'm going in the opposite direction to where he's at.\\" Suh did not say if he expected to receive a suspension or fine from the NFL, and Lions coach Jim Schwartz just said, \\"We're worried about losing this game\\" when asked if he thought Suh might be suspended. In 2006, then-Titans defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth was suspended without pay for five games by the NFL for stomping on the face of Cowboys center Andre Gurode, who required 30 stitches following the incident. While Suh did not stomp on the exposed face of a player however, his fine and infraction history -- he has already been docked 42,000 this season -- likely won't be working in his favor when the NFL reviews the incident. This latest incident certainly will give fodder to those who claim Suh is a dirty player. Lions running back Kevin Smith dodged the subject when asked by NFL Network's Albert Breer about Suh's not exactly golden reputation. \\"The dirty player comment, I stay out of that,\\" Smith said, \\"But we need him on the field -- that's the bottom line.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Ndamukong Suh, a football player from the Detroit Lions team, got in trouble during a game against the Green Bay Packers. He pushed another player's head into the ground and stomped on his arm, which is not allowed. Suh was removed from the game due to his unsportsmanlike conduct. He apologized to his teammates, coaches, and fans, but he also said that he was trying to keep his balance and free himself from the scuffle. Some people think Suh plays too rough and might get punished by the league."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Allow the glue to dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions. 6. Create the fabric cover: Measure the height and circumference of the mug. Cut a piece of fabric that is slightly taller than the height of the mug and long enough to wrap around it with an overlap. 7. Sew or glue the fabric: Following the measurements, fold the top part of the fabric over by about an inch (this will become the casing for the drawstring) and sew or glue this hem in place. Next, wrap the fabric around the mug and either sew or glue the two edges together to form a tube. 8. Insert the drawstring: Thread the drawstring or ribbon through the casing at the top of the fabric cover. You can use a safety pin or a bodkin to help thread the drawstring through the casing. 9. Secure the cover to the mug: Place the fabric cover over the mug and tighten the drawstring to secure it in place. Tie a bow or knot with the drawstring to keep it snug around the mug. Your travel mug is now ready for use. When you want a drink, simply untie the drawstring, lift the fabric cover, open the flap or lid, and enjoy your beverage. Close the flap and replace the cover when you're finished. Option 2: Using a butter dish To make a travel mug using a butter dish, follow these steps: 1. Gather materials: Find a clean, empty butter dish with a plastic lid, a sharp knife, a drill, or a similar tool for making holes in plastic, adhesive or duct tape (optional), and a straw or reusable mouthpiece (optional). 2. Clean the dish: Ensure that the butter dish and the lid are thoroughly cleaned, and there's no residue inside them. 3. Make a hole in the lid: Carefully make a hole or opening in the center of the butter dish lid, large enough for drinking. You can use the knife, drill, or another appropriate tool to create the hole. 4. Smooth the edges: After creating the hole, make sure it has no sharp edges. If necessary, use a file or fine sandpaper to smoothen rough or sharp edges around the opening. 5. Reinforce the lid (optional): If you want, you may reinforce the edges of the hole with adhesive or duct tape to make it more secure and prevent leaks. 6. Attach a straw or mouthpiece (optional): To make it easier to drink, you can insert an (angled) straw or reusable mouthpiece into the hole in the lid. Make sure it fits tightly and doesn't leak. 7. Pour your drink: Fill the butter dish with your preferred beverage, taking care not to overfill, and then securely place the lid with the hole on top of the dish. Your makeshift travel mug is now ready for use. When you want a drink, simply lift the straw or mouthpiece and sip from the hole in the lid. Replace the straw or mouthpiece when you're finished to avoid spills."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

What is this text about?","completion":"The given text is about the scientific research and development of a novel device that aims to significantly enhance the quality of life for patients who undergo kidney dialysis treatments. Kidney dialysis, also known as hemodialysis, is a life-sustaining medical procedure commonly administered to patients suffering from chronic kidney disease or kidney failure. This treatment filters waste, salt, and excess fluid from the body by artificially replicating the functions of the kidneys in order to maintain the balance of chemicals within the blood. The process of kidney dialysis can be complex, time-consuming, and burdensome for patients due to the regular visits required to specialized clinics for treatment, which sometimes last for several hours at a time, multiple times per week. The physical and emotional toll of living with kidney disease and enduring the constraints of dialysis may also impact one's overall wellbeing, relationships and daily activities. Therefore, the development of a new device, with the potential to improve patients' lives, is of significant importance within the field of medical science. Innovations in technology and biomedical engineering can lead to groundbreaking advancements that directly benefit patients who undergo kidney dialysis. Such a device could potentially minimize the treatment duration or frequency, optimize the treatment's efficiency, reduce side effects, or address various complications associated with the procedure. For instance, it might take the form of a more efficient dialysis machine, a portable or wearable device, or an improvement in the filters and membranes used in the treatment process. In addition to the obvious benefits of faster, more effective and comfortable treatments, a new device could also offer enhanced accessibility, affordability, and convenience to patients who require regular dialysis. Furthermore, by improving patient outcomes and overall satisfaction, adherence to dialysis regimens might increase, which in turn could contribute to a reduced risk of complications and improved prognosis for patients with kidney disease. In conclusion, the text is about the ongoing efforts and scientific advancements in developing a device that could revolutionize the experience of kidney dialysis patients, ultimately improving their day-to-day lives and widening the prospects for better medical outcomes. The development of such a device would be a significant milestone for the medical community and patients alike, offering hope for a more manageable and fulfilling life for those affected by chronic kidney disease and kidney failure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this answer, we will discuss the significance of the campaign, its various achievements, and the role it played in popularizing Firefox as well as the broader implications for the open-source movement. 1. Historical context and motivation for Spread Firefox At the time when the SFX campaign was launched in the early 2000s, Microsoft Internet Explorer dominated the market with more than 90% share. There was a growing feeling among tech enthusiasts that Internet Explorer offered limited innovation, user privacy concerns, and poor security against malware attacks. Consequently, there was a desire among the tech community to support an alternative, open-source browser like Firefox that prioritized these concerns. 2. Strategy and goals of the Spread Firefox campaign The primary goal of the SFX campaign was to create awareness and generate momentum for Mozilla's Firefox browser. Adopting a grassroots approach, the campaign aimed to build a large community of volunteers who would become active promoters of the browser among their family, friends, and online networks. Through this collaborative effort, SFX sought to challenge the dominance of Internet Explorer and promote the ideals of open-source software. 3. Remarkable achievements of the Spread Firefox campaign In less than two months, SFX made notable accomplishments, which included: - A million downloads per day after Firefox went out of beta, starting a trend that would reach hundreds of millions of downloads in the coming years. - Attracting over 25,000 volunteer marketers to create and share promotional content for the browser. - Encouraging about 100,000 websites to display promotional buttons and banners, showcasing widespread support for the Firefox cause. - Generating extensive coverage in the blogosphere and mainstream media, leading to increased visibility and credibility for the Firefox browser. - Raising 250,000 through crowdfunding to sponsor a full-page ad in The New York Times, a significant achievement that highlighted community support for the project. 4. Lasting impact on the browser market and open-source movement The SFX campaign played an instrumental role in breaking Internet Explorer's market monopoly. As Firefox's popularity surged, it compelled Microsoft to innovate and improve the security and performance of its browser. Moreover, Firefox successfully established itself as a key player in the browser market, with its current market share of approximately 4% globally. The campaign also had broader ramifications for the open-source movement; it demonstrated the power of a united and passionate community in driving software adoption and challenging established commercial products. 5. Conclusion The Spread Firefox campaign served as a testament to the power of grassroots community mobilization and has become a defining moment in the history of interactive marketing. It not only led to the success of the Firefox browser but also left a lasting impact on internet browsing, competition among browsers, and the promotion of open-source software. As a result, the campaign continues to be seen as a seminal achievement, inspiring others to harness the collective strength of communities to effect significant change in various industries and fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Education: Instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called teachers, and they direct the education of students and might draw on many subjects like reading, writing, mathematics, science and history. Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called teachers, instructors, or professors, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studies from the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible. With the passing of NCLB in the United States (No Child Left Behind), teachers must be highly qualified.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\" or simply \\"the King\\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string... answer the following question: What is the full name of the person whose music career began in Memphis in 1954, recording at Sun Records?

I'm making a new Ghostbusters & writing it with @katiedippold & yes, it will star hilarious women. \\"That's who I'm gonna call.\\" There had been rumours about a third instalment to the movie franchise for a while. As Paul Feig confirmed his involvement he also revealed he is working with Parks And Recreation writer Katie Dippold on a script. The original Ghostbusters in 1984, directed and produced by Ivan Reitman, was a commercial success which earned nearly 300m (Â£385m) at the box office. The sequel movie, Ghostbusters 2 in 1989 wasn't quite as well received with mixed reviews and taking 215m (Â£132m). Paul Feig was the favourite to take-over directing the movie franchise since Ivan Reitman - who directed the first two Ghostbusters films - decided in March that he would not be involved. The first movie starred Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. They played three unemployed parapsychology professors who start a ghost removal service and end up having to save the world from an ancient god. Harold Ramis whose character was Dr Egon Spengler in the supernatural comedy, died in February at the age of 69. Dan Aykroyd, who starred as Dr Raymond Stantz is expected to be a producer on the new film. Whilst Murray, who played Dr Peter Venkman in the original, gave his backing to the idea of an all-female update to the series. He told the Toronto Star last month: \\"I'm fine with it. I would go to that movie, and they'd probably have better outfits too.\\" Murray tipped Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig - who worked with director Feig on Bridesmaids - The Amazing Spider-Man's Emma Stone and Linda Cardellini from Freaks And Geeks as possible stars. On Newsbeat's Facebook page, Andy Toogood said: \\"All female cast? Why?

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: There are various aspects that go into making a successful school, and success can be measured in various ways. Often, the teachers are praised for a school's success and blamed for its failure. Yet, in order for a school to be effective, it must be a place where teaching and learning can easily take place, and that requires the hard work of more than just educators. Students must take learning into their own hands and feel as if what they are doing is as important as it actually is. This can only be done with the cooperation of every adult that is involved in the students' life. Some of these individuals often go unnoticed, yet the role they play in the students' lives is immeasurable. In the school, administrative assistants greet students at the start of the day and answer a large quantity of questions. When an assistant remembers a student's name or even something special about that student, it communicates to him that he is cared for. The assistant can also give that extra encouragement for a student to make better choices, especially when they are visiting the principal's office. Meanwhile, though cafeteria workers have a short space of time to interact with students, they can make a big difference as well. Beyond meeting nutritional needs, cafeteria workers may also on occasion meet the emotional needs of the students they serve. Students benefit from positive interaction with adults, and cafeteria workers may give that extra bit of encouragement that a child needs. Custodians are usually underappreciated for what they offer to schools. They have to be knowledgeable about everything from cleaning to fixing the most intricate tools. They get to school early in the morning before teachers arrive and lock up late at night after the last student has left from the after-school event. They also make sure teachers are equipped with the necessary items and prepare the rooms so that they are ready for learning. A great custodian also gives that kind word or extra smile to that student who needs it most. Answer:","completion":"Question: Which of the following individuals play a crucial yet often underappreciated role in a student's life according to the article? A. Teachers B. Administrative assistants C. Parents D. Principals Correct answer: B.

Teachers, principals, and parents are relevant, but the article specifically highlights the unnoticed and underappreciated roles of administrative assistants and others in a successful school environment."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.\\"?

Q:Given the below context: When originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin. A manuscript from 1828 by Lucius Chapin, a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to \\"St. Mary\\", but that does not mean that he wrote it.\\"Amazing Grace\\", with the words written by Newton and joined with \\"New Britain\\", the melody most currently associated with it, appeared for the first time in Walker's shape note tunebook Southern Harmony in 1847. It was, according to author Steve Turner, a \\"marriage made in heaven ... The music behind 'amazing' had a sense of awe to it. The music behind 'grace' sounded graceful.

By including this information in every message, you ensure the other person won't have to look it up before calling you back. State your name and number at least two times in a message. If the person does not know you personally, spell your name, so you’re sure they know who’s called them. Some voicemails garble messages, and you don’t want to miss an opportunity to talk just because your message was misunderstood. Repeat any important information to ensure it is received by the person you’re contacting. If they don’t know how long a call will last, people start to dread returning a phone call. Include an estimated call time in your message. Most importantly, stick to it. Don’t ask for ten minutes and take an hour. Make sure your estimate is accurate. Consider saying something like, “I need 10 minutes of your time.” Ask for an amount of time, “When can we schedule 15 minutes to discuss our project?” Take the other person’s schedule into consideration, “Are you available to set aside thirty minutes to talk about this?” If there are specific questions or topics you need to answer on the call, email or text these to your coworker in advance. This allows her to feel better prepared for the conversation, and will keep the length of the call brief. Don’t assume your coworkers know your deadlines.

In which location the counter gas would be ionized, location B or location C? Answer:","completion":"The counter gas would be ionized in location B. Step 1: Understanding the Geiger Counter mechanism: A Geiger counter is an instrument used for detecting and measuring ionizing radiation. It works by filling a tube with a low-pressure gas. When ionizing radiation passes through the tube, it ionizes this gas. Step 2: Analyzing the information given: Keith tested the Geiger counter in three different locations: with high (A), low (B), and no radiation (C). Therefore, based on Geiger Counter's working principle, the gas in it will ionize in presence of any ionizing radiation. Step 3: Applying this information to the question: Between location B and location C, only location B has radiation (although low). Hence the Geiger counter's gas would ionize in the presence of this radiation at location B.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When does the author advise that adding super foods should occur after beginning clean eating? Options: - one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them - not enough information - when one is able to acquire produce in bulk - after reading \\"experts\\" advice on clean eating Answer:","completion":"one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mayor Bloomberg's team picked the NV200, a small van currently in operation in Europe and Asia, as winner of the Taxi of Tomorrow competition, notes the New York Times. The Japanese automaker trumped offerings from Ford (current builder of current staple, the Crown Victoria) and Turkey's Karsan. The vehicles will start appearing in late 2013 and be phased in over five years. One potential headache: It's not wheelchair accessible, which could lead to lawsuits. Expand this summary.","completion":"New York City has selected Nissan, the Japanese automaker, to manufacture the next generation of the city's 13,000 taxis as reported by the Wall Street Journal. The decision came after a competition known as the \\"Taxi of Tomorrow\\", spearheaded by the team of Mayor Bloomberg. The chosen model is the NV200, a small van that is currently in operation across Europe and Asia. Nissan's model was selected over offerings from Ford, the current provider of taxis in New York City with their popular Crown Victoria model, and Turkey's Karsan. With this selection, Nissan now boasts the prestigious opportunity of shaping the immediate future of New York City's taxi fleet. However, the NV200 is planned to become the new standard gradually. The vehicles are expected to start appearing on the city's streets in late 2013, and their implementation will be phased out over a time span of five years, indicating a calculated approach by the authorities to transition smoothly from the older models to Nissan's NV200s. While there is a note of victory for Nissan, a potential hiccup does exist with the selected model. The NV200 is not wheelchair accessible, a feature which may lead to legal action. Despite the innovative designs and enhanced comfort provided by the NV200, the lack of accommodation for citizens with physical disabilities could instigate lawsuits against the city or Nissan. This would add another layer of complexity to the integration process of the new taxis and could potentially slow down or even halt their introduction to New York City's streets. The choice of Nissan to build the next generation taxis of New York City is therefore an exciting development, albeit one laden with potential challenges. The choice reflects the global influence of the automotive industry, with a Japanese model replacing a traditional American one in one of the USA's most iconic cities. It will be interesting to see how this decision unfolds in the years ahead as the NV200 is phased in."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Select from the following. - worth trying - successful - useful - useless Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Every human being has a unique arrangement of the skin on his fingers and this arrangement is unchangeable. Scientists and experts have proved the uniqueness of finger-prints and discovered that no exactly similar pattern is passed on from parents to children, though nobody knows why this is the case. The ridge structure on a person's fingers does not change with growth and is not affected by surface injuries. Burns, cuts and other damage to the outer part of the skin will be replaced in time by new one which bears a reproduction of the original pattern. It is only when the inner skin is injured that the arrangement will be destroyed. Some criminals make use of this fact to remove their own finger-prints but this is a dangerous and rare step to take. Finger-prints can be made very easily with printer's ink. They can be recorded easily. With special methods, identification can be achieved successfully within a short time. Because of the simplicity and economy of this system, finger-prints have often been used as a method of solving criminal case. A suspected man may deny a charge but this may be in vain. His finger-prints can prove who he is even if his appearance has been changed by age or accident. When a suspect leaves finger-prints behind at the scene of a crime, they are difficult to detect with the naked eye. Special techniques are used to \\"develop\\" them. Some of the marks found are incomplete but identification is possible if a print of a quarter of an inch square can be obtained. Question: It is _ for a criminal to deny his crime when finger-prints are used to identify him. Answer: A:","completion":"worth trying B: successful C: useful D: useless Step 1: Read and understand the article. The article explains how fingerprints are unique to each individual and can be used as a method of solving criminal cases. Fingerprints remain consistent over time and can still be identified even with surface injuries. Furthermore, the article states that a suspect's fingerprints can prove who they are, even if they try to deny their crime or their appearance changes. Step 2: Analyze the answer options in the context of the question: A: Worth trying implies that it might be a good idea for the criminal to deny the crime, but the given information about fingerprints' reliability in determining identity suggests that it is futile. B: Successful contradicts the article, which explains how fingerprints are a reliable way to prove a person's identity and thus hold them accountable for their crimes. C: Useful hints that denying the crime might help the criminal in some way, but, again, the evidence about the effectiveness of fingerprints contradicts this. D: Useless aligns with the information provided in the article, as the use of fingerprints to identify someone makes denying the crime pointless, given the accuracy and reliability of this method. Step 3: Choose the best answer based on context and analysis: The correct answer is D: useless. This is because, given the effectiveness of fingerprints in identifying criminals, it is pointless for a criminal to deny their crime when fingerprints are used as evidence."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Q:For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don’t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Bacteria acquire resistance through several molecular mechanisms, such as mutations in their genetic material or by obtaining extra-chromosomal DNA.

Given the question: Information: - The Passaic - class ironclad monitors of the U.S. Navy saw service in the U.S. Civil War and the Spanish -- American War . The last such monitor was stricken from the Navy List in 1937 . This highly successful class was an improved version of the Monitor equipped with a XV - inch Dahlgren gun in place of one of the XI - inchers . - The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States fought from 1861 to 1865. The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America. The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history. - John Adolphus Bernard Dahlgren (November 13, 1809 July 12, 1870) was a United States Navy officer who founded his service's Ordnance Department and launched major advances in gunnery. - Dahlgren guns were muzzle-loading naval artillery designed by Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren USN (November 13, 1809 July 12, 1870), mostly used in the period of the American Civil War. Dahlgren's design philosophy evolved from an accidental explosion in 1849 of a 32-pounder being tested for accuracy, killing a gunner. He believed a safer, more powerful naval cannon could be designed using more scientific design criteria. Dahlgren guns were designed with a smooth curved shape, equalizing strain and concentrating more weight of metal in the gun breech where the greatest pressure of expanding propellant gases needed to be met to keep the gun from bursting. Because of their rounded contours, Dahlgren guns were nicknamed \\"soda bottles\\", a shape which became their most identifiable characteristic.

Please answer the following question: Q: Which direction from the source do pollutants in an aquifer spread? Choices: - southward - forward - inward - outward A: A:","completion":"The direction in which pollutants spread in an aquifer is not solely determined by any of the choices provided - southward, forward, inward, or outward. Rather, the movement of pollutants in an aquifer depends on various factors that influence the flow of groundwater, which include the characteristics of the aquifer, the properties of the pollutants, and external factors that affect the movement of water. An aquifer is a subsurface layer of permeable rock, sediment, or soil that holds and allows the movement of water. Groundwater in an aquifer generally moves in the direction of the hydraulic gradient, which is the slope of the water table or the pressure head. The hydraulic gradient is determined by factors such as the rate of recharge (infiltration of water into the aquifer), discharge (the extraction of water through wells), and the topography of the land surface. The groundwater flow velocity and direction are significantly influenced by aquifer permeability and porosity. Pollutant characteristics, like density and viscosity, can also affect their transport and spread in an aquifer. For instance, dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) are denser than water and tend to sink vertically through the aquifer and accumulate at the bottom. In contrast, light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) are less dense than water and tend to float on the water table, spreading laterally in the direction of groundwater flow. External factors like climate, human activity, and the presence of confining layers in the aquifer can affect the movement and distribution of pollutants. For example, seasonal changes in the water table may cause pollutants to migrate in different directions throughout the year. Pumping of groundwater from nearby wells can also influence the flow pathways and cause pollutants to spread in unintended directions. In conclusion, pollutants in an aquifer do not spread in a predefined direction such as southward, forward, inward, or outward. Instead, they disperse primarily in the direction of groundwater flow, which depends on the factors mentioned above. The specific direction of pollutant spread in an aquifer will vary depending on local geology and conditions, and can only be determined through a detailed hydrogeological investigation."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Happened to me while visiting Chicago a few weeks ago. A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations.

Speaking after a meeting of her cabinet, the first minister said details of the vote should be shaped by the Scottish Parliament. UK Prime Minister Theresa May is considering how to respond to the demand for a referendum. There has been speculation she will seek to delay the vote until after the Brexit process is complete. Speaking after the cabinet meeting in Edinburgh on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon said there should be no \\"blocking mechanisms\\". She said ministers had agreed that the referendum \\"must be for Scotland's national legislature to shape\\". She added: \\"It should be up to the Scottish Parliament to determine the referendum's timing, franchise and the question. \\"There should be no strings attached, no blocking mechanisms applied and no Downing Street diktat - Scotland's referendum must be made in Scotland. \\"That was the exact description the UK government themselves used ahead of the 2014 referendum, and the same principle should apply now.\\" Two important questions arise from Nicola Sturgeon's announcement that she will seek a second independence referendum. First, do voters in Scotland want a second referendum? And second, how might they vote if an independence referendum were to be held any time soon? During recent months a number of polls have asked people in a variety of different ways whether there should be a second independence referendum within the next couple of years. They have all obtained much the same answer. Around a half say there should not be, while between a third and two-fifths say there should. Read more from Prof Curtice Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Mrs May said the UK government had been \\"working closely with the devolved administrations, including the Scottish government\\" on Brexit. She said: \\"This is not a moment to play politics and create uncertainty - it's a moment to bring our country together, to honour the will of the British people and shape for them a better Britain.\\" Ms Sturgeon will seek Holyrood's backing for her independence referendum plan at the end of a two-day debate in the Scottish parliament next week. The Scottish government said it would allow MSPs to debate the issue on Tuesday and Wednesday before putting it to a vote. Ms Sturgeon wants parliament to give her the authority to ask Westminster for the power to hold another referendum. A spokesman for the first minister said the Liberal Democrats had pressed for the second day of discussion. The Scottish parliament's business bureau - which agrees Holyrood's agenda - is expected to approve the timetable. The first minister said on Monday that she wanted a referendum to be held between the autumn of 2018 and the spring of the following year. The indyref2 campaign is already under way. Did it ever stop? Will it ever stop? The arguments now are political and constitutional. But what about the economic part of the debate? It mattered a lot last time. It will matter a lot if there's to be a next time. The sound of battle will be familiar, but significant parts of the weaponry have changed. If the combatants have any sense - by no means guaranteed - they'll have learned what worked in 2014, what risks being overworked, and what to avoid next time round. Read more from Douglas The BBC's Scotland editor, Sarah Smith, said the prime minister could refuse to allow another vote on independence before Brexit is completed in two years' time. That would allow the UK government to avoid having to fight on two fronts by negotiating a deal with the EU in the midst of an intense independence referendum campaign. Formal negotiations over the timing of any referendum will not begin until after the vote in the Scottish Parliament on asking the UK government to grant a Section 30 order. The order is needed for the result of the referendum to be legally binding. The minority SNP government is expected to win the vote with the support of the pro-independence Scottish Greens. On Monday, SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson had earlier said that the prime minister should not try to block plans for a referendum. He told the BBC's Newsnight programme that he did not want to \\"sit in the back of the Tory Brexit bus... and see the prime minister drive us off a Brexit cliff\\". The UK Parliament passed the Brexit bill on Monday evening, paving the way for the government to trigger Article 50, which will begin the formal process of leaving the European Union.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Given the question: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy. Kwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Q:I have a new situation: Two friends had different diseases. Nigel was more prone to viral infections, so one day he got infected with the HIV virus. Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection. But I can use this background: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.

Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” Why didn't the patient get proper treatment?

Please answer the following question: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool.

Article: The expression \\"a thirst for knowledge\\" may soon have a new meaning for millions of people who have no way to get clean water. Researchers have developed a book with specially treated pages that can turn dirty water into clean and drinkable water. They say their invention could improve the lives of many in the developing world. About 700 million people around the world are at risk of disease or even death because their drinking water is not clean. The water is polluted by harmful bacteria. The book contains 25 pages. Each page is about one millimeter thick. The pages contain very small particles of silver. The pages can be used as filters to remove harmful microorganisms that can pollute drinking water. The filter kills the organisms that pass through it. Pictures on the pages show the dangers of dirty water and how to use the book for those unable to read. The pages are made of filter paper. They are designed to be torn from the book. Water can be poured through the paper to be cleaned. Ms. Dankovich, the inventor, says each page can treat up to 100 liters of water. She recently presented her invention at the meeting of the American Chemical Society in Boston, Massachusetts. She was asked whether she had considered adding classic literature on the book's pages. \\"The idea of classic texts--that's of interest maybe later. We have discussed a little bit more exciting text. But we really haven't had the time to go through _ \\" she says.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Lord Levy told BBC Newsnight he believed anti-Semitism existed across the political divide, but it seemed \\"more prominent\\" within Labour. It follows the party's decision to suspend MP Naz Shah from the party over comments about Israel on social media, pending an investigation. Ms Shah has made a \\"profound apology\\" in the Commons for her remarks. The MP for Bradford West has been widely criticised for Facebook posts she made before she became an MP, in which she suggested, among other things, that Israel should be moved to the United States. Lord Levy, who was Tony Blair's envoy and chief fundraiser, told the BBC her comments displayed \\"ignorance\\", and he was left \\"scratching his head with despair as to how people like this can enter our parliament with such a lack of knowledge, discretion and sensitivity\\". His comments were echoed by cross-bench peer Baroness Neuberger, who claimed Labour's problem of anti-Semitism was \\"attached to Jeremy Corbyn becoming leader\\", and added that it was \\"an issue with the hard left\\". Labour has faced claims of growing anti-Semitism in its ranks. Earlier this year a Labour Luton councillor was suspended from the party after claiming Hitler was the \\"greatest man in history\\". Jeremy Corbyn has insisted anti-Semitism will not be tolerated but some of his MPs say the party leadership is not doing enough to stamp it out. Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell, Ed Miliband's former chief of staff, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the party \\"had to do more\\" to tackle anti-Semitism and MP Lisa Nandy said it had to be more \\"pro-active\\". But Ken Livingstone - the former London Mayor who is a close ally of Mr Corbyn - said Ms Shah's remarks were not anti-Semitic and the suspension was unnecessary. He told LBC Radio: \\"What we have at the moment is a lot of people making a big issue about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. In 47 years I have never heard anyone say anything anti-Semitic. \\"We expelled a couple of people from the Labour Party early on for saying things that could clearly be interpreted as anti-Semitic. \\"This is not that; this is an over-the-top comment about the horrendous conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\\" Lord Levy told BBC London Mr Livingstone was \\"living on another planet\\" and \\"well past his sell-by date\\" if he believed Ms Shah's comments were not anti-Semitic. Ms Shah was also defended by George Galloway, the former Respect MP who she defeated at the general election, who said in an article that her comments were \\"half-witted\\" but not anti-Semitic, and claims to the contrary were \\"just another stick to beat Corbyn out of office with\\". The former Labour MP said Mr Corbyn and his closest ally shadow chancellor John McDonnell were \\"lifelong campaigners for Palestinians\\" but he claimed there was an \\"establishment\\" conspiracy to falsely paint them as anti-Semitic. Initially, Mr Corbyn warned Ms Shah about what he described as her \\"offensive and unacceptable\\" posts - but he came under pressure to go further by David Cameron, at Prime Minister's Questions. Ms Shah, who has quit on Tuesday as an aide to Mr McDonnell, then told the Commons: \\"Anti-Semitism is racism, full stop. As an MP I will do everything in my power to build relations between Muslims, Jews and people of different faiths and none.\\" Labour later issued a statement saying Mr Corbyn and Ms Shah had agreed that she was \\"administratively suspended from the Labour Party by the general secretary\\", pending an investigation. \\"She is unable to take part in any party activity and the whip is removed,\\" the statement added. In a 2014 Facebook post Ms Shah shared a graphic showing an image of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline \\"Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States\\", with the comment \\"problem solved\\". The post suggested the US has \\"plenty of land\\" to accommodate Israel as a 51st state, allowing Palestinians to \\"get their life and their land back\\". It added that Israeli people would be welcome and safe in the US, while the \\"transportation cost\\" would be less than three years' worth of Washington's support for Israeli defence spending. The post was brought to light by the Guido Fawkes political blogging website, which also highlighted a post in which she appeared to liken Israeli policies to those of Adolf Hitler. Naz Shah burst onto the political scene during the 2015 general election, where she ousted Respect MP George Galloway. Her selection as a candidate proved controversial, with divisions emerging in the local party. The candidate who was chosen first stood down four days later, before Ms Shah was imposed by the ruling National Executive Committee. A bitter campaign followed, with Mr Galloway sparking anger by questioning Ms Shah's account of her forced marriage. After her victory, she was celebrated locally and nationally for her unique background and life experiences. Growing up in poverty in Bradford, Ms Shah and her family were abandoned by her father who eloped with a neighbour's teenage daughter. She has spoken openly about her experience of surviving a forced marriage and domestic violence.

Question: Information: - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - Styracocephalus platyrhynchus ( ' spike head ' ) is an extinct species of tapinocephalian therapsid that lived during the Guadalupian epoch . Styracocephalus ' head ornament meant that it could be recognised from a distance . The most striking feature of Styracocephalus are the large backward - protruding tabular horns . The crest stuck upwards and backwards , but there is some variation in its shape , and this suggests that it changed throughout life and that it may be sexually dimorphic . Styracocephalus was a herbivore that may have been fully terrestrial or partly aquatic like the modern hippopotamus . It may have evolved from the estemmenosuchids . Its remains are known from South Africa but it probably had a wider distribution . It was around 1.8 metres ( 5 ft 11 in ) in length , with a 42 centimetres ( 17 in ) long , 29 centimetres ( 11 in ) wide skull . - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period. - Tapinocephalus (\\"humble head\\") is a genus of large herbivorous dinocephalian that lived during the Middle Permian Period. These stocky, barrel-bodied animals were characterised by a massive bony skull roof and short weak snout. It is thought that, like the rest of the members of its family, the animals engaged in head-butting intraspecific behavior, possibly for territory or mates. The fossil remains (skull and postcranial elements) of \\"Tapinocephalus\\" are known from the Lower, Middle, and Upper part of the \\"Tapinocephalus\\" Assemblage Zone (Capitanian age) of the Lower Beaufort Beds of the South African Karoo. Only the type species, \\"T. atherstonei\\" is now considered valid for this genus. - Tapinocephalia is one of the major groups of dinocephalian therapsids and the major herbivorous group. Tapinocephalia is thought to consist of three clades: Styracocephalidae, Titanosuchidae, and the very successful Tapinocephalidae. Notable tapinocephalians include \\"Moschops\\", \\"Tapinocephalus\\", and \\"Titanosuchus\\". - Therapsida is a group of synapsids that includes mammals and their ancestors. Many of the traits today seen as unique to mammals had their origin within early therapsids, including having their four limbs extend vertically beneath the body, as opposed to the sprawling posture of other reptiles. The earliest fossil attributed to Therapsida is \\"Tetraceratops insignis\\" from the Lower Permian. 'styracocephalus' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'taxon rank'?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. More than half of Americans say it should be legal for gays and lesbians to marry, a first in nearly a decade of polls by ABC News and The Washington Post. This milestone result caps a dramatic, long-term shift in public attitudes. From a low of 32 percent in a 2004 survey of registered voters, support for gay marriage has grown to 53 percent today. Forty-four percent are opposed, down 18 points from that 2004 survey. The issue remains divisive; as many adults \\"strongly\\" oppose gay marriage as strongly support it, and opposition rises to more than 2-1 among Republicans and conservatives and 3-1 among evangelical white Protestants, a core conservative group. But opposition to gay marriage has weakened in these groups from its levels a few years ago, and support has grown sharply among others – notably, among Catholics, political moderates, people in their 30s and 40s and men. The results reflect a changing albeit still polarized climate. Gay marriage has been legalized in five states and the District of Columbia, by court ruling or legislative action, since 2003, while many other states prohibit it. The Obama administration late last month said it would no longer defend the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law banning federal recognition of gay marriages. GROUPS – While younger adults and liberals remain at the forefront of support for gay marriage, the new results underscore its expansion. In an ABC/Post poll five and a half years ago, for example, under-30s were the sole age group to give majority support to gay marriage, at 57 percent. Today it's 68 percent in that group – but also 65 percent among people in their 30s, up a remarkable 23 points from the 2005 level; and 52 percent among those in their 40s, up 17 points. Adults 50 and older remain more skeptical, but even that's seen change. Most notably, 33 percent of seniors now say gay marriage should be legal, up from 18 percent five years ago. Trends among other groups are equally striking. Compared with five years ago support for gay marriage has grown by 10 points among women, but by 18 points among men; it's now at parity. Support has grown by 17 points among Democrats, but also by 13 points among independents, to a clear majority, 58 percent, in the crucial political center. And it's 63 percent among moderates, up 21 points. The poll has an insufficient sample size to evaluate individual racial minority groups reliably. However, support for gay marriage is essentially identical among whites, 53 percent, and nonwhites, 54 percent. That's up by 13 points among whites – and by 20 among nonwhites. Support is up by a striking 23 points among white Catholics, often a swing group and one that's been ready, in many cases, to disregard church positions on political or social issues. But they have company: Fifty-seven percent of non-evangelical white Protestants now also support gay marriage, up 16 points from its level five years ago. Evangelicals, as noted, remain very broadly opposed. But even in their ranks, support for gay marriage is up by a double-digit margin. METHODOLOGY – This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by telephone March 10-13, 2011, among a random national sample of 1,005 adults, including landline and cell-phone-only respondents. The results from the full survey have a 3.5-point error margin.

Implicit in his argument was an endorsement of monogamy, which, he wrote, \\"seems to redirect male motivations in ways that generate lower crime rates, greater GDP per capita, and better outcomes for children.\\" His interest isn't in the individual, emotional experience of sexual and romantic exclusivity so much as the evolution of cultural norms and how they impact society. One of the best arguments for monogamy is an argument against polygamy. That is, if you ask Joseph Henrich, whose expertise was called upon last year during a Canadian Supreme Court's reconsideration of a ban on plural marriage. Last week, I spoke with an expert who explained why monogamy makes biological sense. This time around, I spoke with Henrich about the evolutionary basis for monogamy. You've argued that there's a connection between monogamy and democracy. What's the link there? That's not a link I'd want to make too strongly, but it has been argued by historians that monogamy precedes, and then seems to go along with, the emergence of democratic ideals. In the Western tradition, the earliest we can trace laws about monogamy is actually to Athens when the first notions of democracy began to be instituted. The argument is that it's meant to create equality among citizens so that, essentially, there'll be wives available to all Athenian men, rather than having all the rich men take many wives. Although, men were still allowed to have slave concubines just so as long as they were non-Athenian women. You can think of it as a first kind of effort to level the playing field. By saying that both the king and the peasant can only have one wife each, it's the first step toward saying that all men were created equal. Open marriage has been on the cultural radar recently, but it isn't actually a new idea, right? In many small-scale societies, there's an institution that looks like marriage, where people \\"pair bond,\\" but there's philandering on the side by both men and women. They'll often just cycle to another pair bond. It's not uncommon for hunter gatherers to have three, four or five pair bonds in the course of their life, while getting children from each one. There are these groups in South America where people believe that the fetus is formed by ejaculations from multiple males, so the kids can have multiple fathers. You improve the survival of your child by getting him or her a second father. So when women first get pregnant, they'll seek out sexual liaisons with other men because then those men believe they have a fatherly responsibility to the child. Social norms in this case say that the husband, the primary father, cannot get upset about it, that it's perfectly OK for the woman to go out and seek these other mates -- but the ethnography suggests that these guys are really grumpy about it. You have an innate jealous reaction that's stamped down by local social norms. What's the argument in favor of outlawing polygamy? The core of the argument is that polygyny -- when men marry multiple wives -- takes up all the women and creates an underclass of men that have no access to partners, and those guys cause trouble. They commit crimes and engage in substance abuse. There is also less equality for women and more strife in the home. Women are in short supply, which increases male competition, and so men use violence against women to control the household. Also, if you have one male with lots of wives, there are all sorts of stepmothers and unrelated adults in the same household as children, and that increases the likelihood of violence. The biggest risk factor for spouses killing each other is a large age difference, and in polygamous households you inevitably end up with a large age difference between at least some of the spouses. We also have other natural experiments. The one-child policy in China creates the same kind of surplus of men because of the preference for sons [and the use of sex-selective abortion and infanticide.] You can see 18 years after you implement the one-child policy, you get extra men and that predicts extra crime. You can see the same thing in India as well. There's a Stanford economist who argues that when men can't invest in getting another wife, they then invest more in their own production. Rather than basically saving up in order to get a second wife or a third wife, they invest more in the children of the one wife they have, and in other types of economic production. So marriage functions as a social control. Right, and we even have some idea of the hormonal mechanisms. There's research that looks at men before and after they get married and before and after they have children. The early evidence suggests that males have two testosterone drops during those periods, and it's high testosterone levels that lead to a high level of mate-seeking and risk-taking. Interestingly, one study was done in a polygynous society that found males don't suffer the same testosterone drop. That makes good sense because if you get married in a polygynous society, you're still on the mating market. Think of testosterone as a mating hormone: It doesn't go down because you're still looking around -- or you're looking less than you would be otherwise, if for no other reason than people are watching and expecting you to not be looking. Which goes back to the element of social control. One of the keys to understanding marriage is third parties. Marriage is not only a contract between two people, because there are all these outside parties with expectations about how two married people are supposed to behave. Failure to live up to that has reputational consequences. It seems there are comparisons that can be made between, on the one hand, human marriage and infidelity and, on the other hand, socially monogamous, pair-bonding animals that sexually stray. Here's the crucial difference: There's no evidence, at least not that I know of, of animals policing each other. In voles, the uninvolved third parties don't get upset at the vole who strays. What do we know about mistresses and the impact affairs have in terms of diverting resources? There seems to be at least anecdotal evidence that wealthy, high-status males not only marry serially but also have mistresses that they divert large funds to. That would be an interesting question to investigate -- I don't actually know of empirical data on that. Clearly our system of monogamous marriage is supported by particular romantic ideals. How do concepts of romantic love differ in polygamous societies? The best anthropology can tell us is that there's romantic love everywhere. It's not some strange Western cultural notion; the idea that it should be linked to marriage is the more unusual part. Marriage is about building households and this involves linking up kinship groups, so lots of societies by cultural evolution have decided to take away the responsibility from the young couple in deciding who should mate because there are bigger things at play. In the smaller scale human societies, it still seems that pair bonds are created by romantic love, but these pair bonds aren't that durable. It seems that social norms are actually what make the pair bond more durable. ||||| A slim majority of Americans now support gay marriage, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. The results underscore the nation’s increasingly tolerant views about homosexuals, and parallel a string of recent legal and legislative victories for gay rights advocates. Five years ago, at 36 percent, support for gay marriage barely topped a third of all Americans. Now, 53 percent say gay marriage should be legal, marking the first time in Post-ABC polling that a majority has said so. “This is very consistent with a lot of other polling data we’ve seen and the general momentum we’ve seen over the past year and a half,” said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, a leading pro-gay-marriage group. “As people have come to understand this is about loving, committed families dealing, like everyone, with tough times, they understand how unfair it is to treat them differently.” Opponents of same-sex marriage took issue with the poll, which asks respondents: “Do you think it should be legal or illegal for gay and lesbian couples to get married?” Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, argued that the term “illegal” could be inferred to mean that violators could be imprisoned, which most Americans would consider harsh. Brown, whose group is a prominent anti-gay-marriage group, noted that all 31 states that have put same-sex marriage on the ballot voted to ban it. “The only poll that counts is a free and fair vote on the part of the people,” he said. “We’ve seen these biased polls time and time again — right before votes in which same-sex marriage is rejected. It’s absurd. The people of this country have not changed their opinion about marriage.” Post-ABC News polls have used the same “legal or illegal” wording in every poll about same-sex marriage since 2003. Other surveys by the Pew Research Center, the Associated Press and CNN show similar trends. In the new Post-ABC poll, the shift has been driven by several political and demographic groups whose support for such unions jumped sharply. Men, who previously were less supportive of same-sex marriage than women, now back it at the same rate. Support among college-educated whites, political independents and people who do not consider themselves religious also rose substantially. Republicans, conservatives and white evangelical Christians remain the groups most opposed to legalizing gay marriage. The survey also shows a shift in how intensely people feel on this issue. In the past, the number of Americans who felt strongly that gay marriage should be banned far outnumbered those who were passionate in their belief that it should be legal. That has balanced out, with 35 percent strongly against legal gay marriage and 36 percent strongly in favor. Passionate opposition to gay marriage last year in part led voters in Iowa to oust three state Supreme Court justices who had joined in the unanimous decision to legalize same-sex unions in the state. Minnesota, Indiana, Pennsylvania and North Carolina are considering steps that would ban same-sex marriage in their states. But those victories for opponents of same-sex marriage have lately been overshadowed by several defeats. Last March, the District joined five states in allowing same-sex couples to marry. Later in California, a federal judge struck down that state’s voter-approved ban on same-sex unions. The issue is now before an appeals court and is likely to end up at the Supreme Court. In the summer, a federal judge in Massachusetts struck down the federal government’s ban on recognition of same-sex marriages under the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act. This issue, too, will probably end up before the nation’s high court. In a major victory for supporters of gay marriage, the Obama administration announced earlier this month that it would no longer defend the statute in court. Congressional Republicans have vowed to defend the law themselves and criticized Obama for elevating such a divisive social issue at a time the focus ought to be on the economy and jobs. This week, Democrats introduced bills to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and noted how the tables have turned. “What do I say to the idea that this is a wedge issue? I say ‘Hallelujah,’ ” Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who is gay, told reporters, according to the liberal Web site Talking Points Memo. “The fact that we’ve now evolved to the point where the Republicans are complaining about the fact that we introduced this bill because it causes them political problems is a great sign of progress. It used to be the other way around.” The telephone poll was conducted March 10 to 13, among a random national sample of 1,005 adults. Results from the full poll have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The majority of Americans now support gay and lesbian marriage, with a significant shift in public opinion from 32% in a 2004 survey to 53% today.

Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop.

Although this program was not a direct copycat of Tsar Nicholas II's outright prohibition during World War I, Gorbachev faced the same adverse economic reaction as did the last Tsar. The disincentivization of alcohol consumption was a serious blow to the state budget according to Alexander Yakovlev, who noted annual collections of alcohol taxes decreased by 100 billion rubles. Alcohol production migrated to the black market, or through moonshining as some made \\"bathtub vodka\\" with homegrown potatoes. Poorer, less educated Russians resorted to drinking unhealthy substitutes such as nail polish, rubbing alcohol or men's cologne, which only served to be an additional burden on Russia's healthcare sector due to the subsequent poisoning cases. The purpose of these reforms, however, was to prop up the existing centrally planned economy, unlike later reforms, which tended toward market socialism.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Here is a news article: While some might say the digital age is making infidelity simpler, here's one reason why smartphones may be bad news for wandering spouses. A man from Côte d'Azur in the south of France claims a problem in the app meant that his wife received notifications on her phone whenever he took an Uber ride, and that she was able to see his pick up points, destinations and times. And he says it all began when he borrowed his wife's phone and logged in to Uber. Despite logging out of the app, notifications of his journeys continued to roll in to her phone, revealing what she suspected was evidence of his extra-marital encounters and leading to the couple's divorce. The man is now suing Uber for €45 million, reported Le Figaro newspaper. The technical fault is thought to be that after you log in to Uber on another device, it can keep information on you as a user and continues to give updates on that phone. So whoever was kind enough to lend you their phone could be privy to your future rides. Philanderous Android users should be safe however, as the problem seems to be limited to the iPhone iOS versions of the app updated after the 16th of December 2016. Uber’s spokesperson declined to speak to Le Figaro on the matter, saying “Uber doesn’t publicly comment on individual cases, and especially those which concern things such as a divorce procedure”. An initial hearing for the case is expected next month. And with its high-profile status, we could see more similar complaints coming from Uber’s 40 million monthly active users soon. This isn’t the first run-in Uber has had with the French either. In December Paris Uber driver’s blockaded French airports in protest over pay and in 2015 a French version of the app Le Taxi launched to rival Uber's dominance. Will this case be another blow for Uber's popularity in France? READ ALSO: Protesting Uber drivers blockade access to Paris airports By Rose Trigg ||||| A French businessman is suing Uber for 45 million after a bug in the ride-hailing app led to his divorce. A glitch in the Uber app allegedly allowed the man’s wife to keep tabs on his location, and determine he’d been cheating on her, according to the French newspaper Le Figaro. The man had previously used his wife’s iPhone to hail an Uber, but the device continued receiving notifications even after he logged out. Those notifications led his ex to believe he had been cheating on her. And the man now wants Uber to pay for it. He is suing for a hefty 45 million in damages, claiming the app (not the whole cheating thing) led to his divorce. Le Figaro was able to replicate the incident on iPhones (Android users, you’re probably safe), and says it is possible to obtain the information on an Uber passenger’s location without needing a password. Uber, understandably, doesn’t want anything to do with all this. The company told the newspaper, “Uber doesn’t publicly comment on individual cases, and especially those which concern things such as a divorce procedure.” Ouch. The case will have an initial hearing in late February. H/T the Next Web ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

It can also make a difference whether you go during peak time or not. For example, tickets always cost more during school holidays and weekends than they do during the weekdays. Theme parks always get very busy during the summer months, so if you don't like crowds, it's usually a good idea to go earlier or later in the year!

And every Senate Democrat, he said during his Nov. 11 remarks, voted against the GOP's attempt to block the regulation. Speaking at The Charleston Meeting, an influential monthly gathering of conservative movers and shakers, Paul said Senate Republicans tried in 2010 to block an Obamacare rule that only permitted Americans to keep their health insurance policies if nothing about them was changed from year to year.
