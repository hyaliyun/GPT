Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Please answer this question : Which cousin learned more about secondary consumers? A:","completion":"Liam Step 1: Understand the question and the given information. The question asks us to determine which cousin learned more about secondary consumers. We are given information about what each cousin focused on: Liam read about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores. We are also given a hint that explains the concept of apex predators and their role in the food chain. Step 2: Apply the given information to the question. The hint tells us that secondary consumers are often found on land and wolves are an example of that. Wolves prey on herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). Step 3: Determine the cousin that learned more about secondary consumers. Now that we know what secondary consumers are and their role in the food chain, we can see that Liam, who studied apex predators, would have learned more about secondary consumers since they prey upon large herbivores that are primary consumers. Fox, on the other hand, read about grazers and large herbivores, which are primary consumers and not secondary consumers.

Context: Voting is underway in the southern U.S. state of Alabama in a tightly contested Senate election between Democrat Doug Jones and Republican Roy Moore, a campaign roiled by charges from women who accused Moore of sexual misconduct four decades ago when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Tuesday's special election was being watched nationally, both as an indicator of how midterm congressional elections might play out next November and also as a barometer of President Donald Trump's political clout. Trump endorsed Moore, who has denied the women's allegations, and called for the defeat of Jones, whom he said would be a political \\"puppet\\" of liberal Democratic lawmakers in Washington. The election winner will serve the last three years of the seat left vacant by Jeff Sessions when he joined Trump's Cabinet as attorney general, the country's top law enforcement position. If Moore wins, Republicans will retain their 52-48 majority in the Senate, but a Jones victory would pare the margin to 51-49, possibly further complicating Trump's efforts to pass his legislative agenda. Pre-election polls at various times have shown both Moore, 70, and Jones, 63, in the lead, but the history of elections in deeply conservative Alabama runs against Jones. No Democrat has won a Senate election in the state since Richard Shelby did in 1992, and two years later he switched parties to become a Republican. Still a senator, Shelby said Sunday that he voted absentee for \\"a distinguished Republican\\" as a write-in choice, but could not bring himself to vote for Moore after one woman, now in her 50s, said Moore abused her when she was 14. Moore, twice deposed as a state Supreme Court justice for failing to follow federal court rulings, has accused journalists, Democrats and establishment Republicans in Washington of trying to undermine his campaign. Some Republican lawmakers, a number of whom said Moore should drop out of the contest after the women's allegations surfaced, said they would try to expel him from the Senate if he won.

A couple are celebrating the miraculous recovery of their 10 month old son after he and his twin brother were born extremely prematurely at 23 weeks. Deborah Jackson, 32 and partner Nick Filby, 28, from Harlow, Essex, find their happiness is tainted by heartache as they grieve the tragic death of their second son. Despite the best efforts of medical teams, baby Owen only survived an hour after his delivery, while his brother Ollie fought for his life in hospital for six months. Alongside Deborah and Nick's joy at Ollie's recovery and homecoming, they are still grieving the tragic lost of his twin brother Owen. When Deborah, a trained nanny and Nick, a plumber, were told that she was expecting twins eight weeks into her pregnancy they were thrilled. But at 23 weeks Deborah suffered a heavy bleed with stomach pains and a worried Nick rushed her to hospital where she was told she was in labour. She says: ‘I knew already it was one week before the abortion limit. Ollie (right) and Owen (left) were born at just 23 weeks weighing 1lb 10grams and 1lb respectively. ‘I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I pleaded with doctors to do everything they could for the twins as long as it wouldn’t be cruel.’ Their local hospital wasn’t specialist enough, and Deborah was transferred to a specialist premature baby unit at another hospital, an hour away. There, they told her that her twin boys had little chance of survival and that even if they did survive they’d be severally mentally and physically handicapped. She says: ‘They told us to prepare for the worst, it was the most terrifying moment of our lives.’ Deborah’s labour lasted four agonising hours. Little Owen arrived first, weighing 1lb but he was breach and badly damaged. His shoulders and back had been broken during his birth and his skin was bruised. Deborah with Ollie, who was critically ill at birth, requiring a total of 19 blood transfusions to keep him alive. The second twin Ollie was born a few minutes later, just 10g bigger. He cried, and was taken straight off to an incubator. Deborah says: ‘This should have been the happiest time of our lives - instead me and Nick never felt so afraid. ‘I sat up in bed holding little Owen. We sang Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to him and I held him close so he’d feel the warmth of my skin. The family held a small service for baby Owen. ‘When his body went cold after an hour and a half we knew he’d gone. ‘Afterwards I didn’t know how I could carry on. But like Nick I knew we needed to stay strong for Ollie.’ Ollie was critically ill, suffering a brain bleed hours after birth and doctors told the couple to prepare to say goodbye. However miraculously Ollie survived his first few days. Then the medical team discovered a hole in his heart and although the doctors managed to close it with medication, Ollie suffered a massive bleed on his lungs - nearly drowning him in his own blood. Again Deborah and Nick prepared to say goodbye but Ollie fought back, again and again as he suffered a further two major bleeds. Things looked their bleakest when he caught pneumonia and his lungs collapsed. Then he caught a stomach infection, which causes the intestines to die. Doctors pumped his tiny body with steroids and antibiotics. Then when his retinas started to detach he needed injections in his eyes to save his sight. Deborah says: ‘Doctors said they were running out of options. But we’d already lost one baby, we couldn’t bare the thought of losing Ollie too. We were living on a knife edge. ‘But despite needing 19 blood transfusions Ollie kept going. We spent every second we could by his incubator praying he’d pull through.’ In the meantime the couple had to bury their other son Owen. Ollie was in hospital for over 6 months, recovering from several potentially fatal conditions. Deborah says: ‘We held a small service with close family.

Their route varied from night to night, but the ultimate destination was never in question. \\"May I help you?\\" The worn-out speaker was crackly, but he still recognized the particularly twangy East Texas voice of Fontana Fry. Over his six years of vocal training, he had become acutely aware of accents. This is true of all classically trained singers. Great emphasis is placed on precise pronunciation and enunciation. It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French. So, by the time Greg finished his graduate degree, his accent had been all but eliminated. He sounded somewhat like a network news anchor instead of an East Texan. \\"I would like a large--\\" \\"--a large dipped cone, the usual.

Greg had met Fontana a few months earlier when she brought her 13-year-old brother to the studio to enroll for guitar lessons. The boy was holding a U.S. made, 1968 Harmony acoustic guitar his uncle gave him. The body and the frets were badly worn, but the instrument still played beautifully. It looked somewhat like a large violin, with arched top and f-holes. That shape produces a more mellow sound than flattops. And the guitar's age contributed additional warmth to the tone.

It seems to be especially popular with stayathome parents who would rather teach their children themselves in the privacy of their own homes. In order to homeschool your children,you will need to know the basics of how to do this,and like everything,there are steps you will need to follow. Homeschooling is legal in all fifty states. The first step is to check with your state's Board of Education to find out what the legal requirements are and what you will need to do in order to _ them. Next,you will need to determine whether or not you want your children to follow a structured curriculum. Most parents use this system to ensure that their children will study every subject that a child who goes to a private or public school would. Homeschooling can not only provide your children with the essential learning of the basic subjects of reading,writing,and arithmetic,but it can also help your children to master muchneeded life skills. These skills can range from learning how to do the cleaning to balancing his or her own checkbook. They are skills that your child will need to know so that he or she can take care of themselves later on in life. One last point about homeschooling:The question of interaction and socialization is most always brought up in the question on whether or not a child should be homeschooled. Public schooling is automatically thought to be a good place for a child to learn how to get along with his or her peers. While some social skills probably can be learned in this type of environment,peer pressure is always a constant concern for parents. Fortunately,parents who homeschool can teach their children moral values as well as the right way to get along with other people. Question: Homeschooling is very popular in America mainly because _ .

Please answer the following question: Process: - Acid rain is produced by chemicals that reach into the atmosphere - Falls onto the ground - The acid rain starts scouring rocks - Destroys vegetation - The lack of vegetation alters the surrounding environment. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less conservation occurs happens, how will it affect more scouring of rocks occurs. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you propose suggests that if less conservation occurs, it will lead to more scouring of rocks. To evaluate whether this perturbation has a direct or indirect effect on the process, we first need to look at the various steps involved in the formation of acid rain and analyze the consequences of reducing conservation efforts. 1. Formation of acidic chemicals in the atmosphere: Acid rain is produced when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. These chemicals react with moisture, sunlight, and other atmospheric gases to produce sulfuric and nitric acids. 2. Fall onto the ground: When acidified rain, snow, or fog falls to the ground, it increases the acidity of soil, water bodies, and affects the ecosystems that rely on them. 3. Scouring rocks: The increased acidity in precipitation erodes and weathers rocks and other terrestrial surfaces. This can eventually lead to exposed rock surfaces that are more susceptible to further erosion and degradation. 4. Destruction of vegetation: Acid rain can harm forests, crops, and other plant life, leading to decreased vegetation cover in affected areas. It can damage the leaves and roots of plants, inhibit growth, decrease nutrient availability, and impact the soil's structure and function. 5. Altered surrounding environment: The consequences of fewer plants, increased erosion, and altered soil composition can result in an array of ecological effects, from increased sedimentation and water pollution to destabilized ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity. Now let's consider the perturbation hypothesis, which states that less conservation would result in more scouring of rocks. To analyze the possible impact of this perturbation, we should examine how conservation efforts can influence the acid rain process: - Conservation efforts that target the reduction of SO2 and NOx emissions can play a crucial role in mitigating the formation of acid rain. For instance, implementing pollution control measures on vehicles and power plants or promoting clean energy sources can significantly reduce these emissions. If less conservation occurs, the emissions of these acidic chemicals and subsequent formation of acid rain will likely increase. - Other forms of conservation efforts, like reforestation programs, aim to restore the vegetation destroyed by acid rain. If such efforts decrease, it would lead to the more vulnerable land being exposed and susceptible to the erosive actions of acid rain. This could result in more scouring of rocks in the long run, as you suggest in your hypothesis. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis you propose, where less conservation causes more scouring of rocks, could hold merit. Reduced conservation would likely increase the emissions of harmful chemicals like SO2 and NOx, leading to more acid rain formation. This would have a direct impact on the scouring of rocks, as well as an indirect consequence due to the destruction of vegetation and alterations in the surrounding environment. Long-term implications of increased scouring of rocks may include significant changes or degradations to ecosystems and negative impacts on the environment and biodiversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: The eviction process begins with the provision of proper notice to the tenant that demands that the tenant vacate the leased premises within a specific period of time. Click here to access the different notice of eviction forms that have been approved by the Florida Supreme Court. The different types of notice required includes: 3-day notices are for nonpayment of rent. The amount due on the face of the 3-day notice cannot be greater than the total amount of past due rent. You must accept rent if submitted before the end of the 3-day notice period, and once accepted you can no longer pursue eviction. 7-day curative or non-curative notice is provided for evictions related to lease or law violations. 15-day prior notice is required for the termination of a month-to-month tenancy. Miami Beach has a special law requiring a 30-day notice if you have an oral month to month agreement or if the lease is written but does not contain a lease duration. Some lease terms contain instructions for the service of notice and other processes to the tenant. If the lease is silent, you can serve notice by handing a copy of the notice to an adult occupant of the leased premises. The notice can also be securely posted to the door of the premises. Service of notice via mail is also possible, and you should make sure to send the mail certified in order to have documentation of receipt that can be presented to the court. Notice begins to toll on the first full day following delivery of notice, and expires at midnight on the last number of days given for notice, excluding weekends and holidays. If the tenant has not paid rent during the notice period, or has not remedied the lease violation underlying the eviction, you can proceed with filing an eviction complaint. A completed eviction packet will contain your completed eviction complaint, five copies of the lease agreement and notice provided to the tenant, as well as a pre-stamped envelope that is addressed to all occupants/tenants. Have the complaint notarized and file it at the clerk's office, or swear to it in front of a clerk and pay the relevant complaint filing fee. In most counties the filing fee is 185. After filing your eviction complaint and paying the filing fees, you will be provided with a service of summons that must be provided to the tenant along with a copy of the eviction packet. Service can be conducted by a private process server or by a county sheriff, who will confirm in writing that the notice, was delivered. Tenants have 5 days to answer an eviction summons. If the tenant answers and pays the rent, the landlord must contact the court to schedule a hearing. File a motion with the clerk seeking a default judgment if the tenant fails to answer the summons. Attend court on the hearing date and make sure to take all notice receipts with you. Go to your courtroom and answer all questions presented by the judge, and then wait for the court to enter a judgment. If the judge sides with you, the court will order the sheriff to evict the tenant in 24 hours.

Write a summary based on this article: Image copyright Twitter/@rahimaxarsenal Doubt has been cast on a key document at the centre of a corruption inquiry in Pakistan because of the use of a particular typeface. And Twitter users are poking fun at Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz using the hashtag #FontGate. The social media campaign is just the latest twist in a story that has gripped Pakistanis. The ongoing corruption inquiry is part of the fallout from last year's Panama Paper leaks, which has consistently been one of the most discussed topics online in Pakistan. It could end with the disqualification of the prime minister, although he has claimed the allegations are politically motivated. Documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists last year revealed details about offshore companies connected to a number of high profile political figures - including Sharif. He wasn't actually named himself in the leaks - but a number of his children were linked to offshore firms that owned four luxury central London flats. Opposition figures in Pakistan allege the money used to buy the flats was earned through corruption and a team of investigators including members of the country's intelligence services and financial regulators have been looking into the allegations. One key line has been to establish who was the \\"beneficial owner\\" of the companies holding the central London flats - in other words, who they really belonged to. Documents from the Panama Papers suggested the beneficial owner was the Prime Minister's daughter Maryam Nawaz - who is widely seen as her father's political successor. However, she has claimed she was only a trustee - and that her brother was the beneficial owner. While Maryam Nawaz is considered a possible future Prime Minister, her brother is a businessman with no apparent political ambitions. To prove her point, she produced a trust deed signed by both her and her brother dated February 2006. But the team investigating the case say they have spoken to a British forensic expert who says the document was typed in the Calibri font - despite the fact that Calibri wasn't commercially available until 2007. As a result they allege the document is \\"fake\\" or \\"falsified\\" and submitting it was a \\"criminal offence\\" by Maryam Nawaz. Maryam Nawaz has denied any wrongdoing. But that, of course, didn't stop Pakistanis on Twitter from going on the offensive: Image copyright Twitter/ZarrarKhuhro Image copyright Twitter Image caption Memes like this were used to mock Maryam Nawaz Typography expert Thomas Phinney, who has testified in a number of cases relating to forged documents, told the BBC that while a beta version of Windows 2007 containing Calibri was technically publicly available from 2004, it was \\"highly unlikely\\" that it would be downloaded by ordinary computer users. It's unclear if Calibri was included as part of any pre-2007 beta releases of Microsoft Office which were more widely disseminated - but Phinney says that using \\"pre-released software is not the kind of thing your average person does\\". Lucas de Groot, the inventor of the Calibri font, agreed. He says over the years he has been asked for information about when the font was released in relation to more than a dozen cases of alleged fraud. He told the BBC that beta versions were generally only used by \\"tech geeks\\" rather than normal companies or government officials. Nevertheless, the claim that the font proves the document is false could well be contested by Maryam Nawaz. Adding to the mystery, Twitter users noticed that the Wikipedia entry for \\"Calibri\\" has apparently been repeatedly edited following the revelations. Image copyright Twitter/@omar_quraishi The Prime Minister, Maryam Nawaz, and her brothers have consistently denied the allegations against them. Maryam Nawaz tweeted: \\"report rejected. Every contradiction will not only be contested but decimated in SC [Supreme Court]\\".

All our stories are at bbc.com/trending. ||||| A typeface is at the heart of a Pakistani scandal after investigators accused Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's daughter of presenting forged documents to a corruption probe against the Sharif family. Microsoft's Calibri font was used to type certified papers naming Maryam Nawaz as a trustee of several high-end flats in central London. But the papers were dated a year before Calibri was in widespread commercial use. The properties, bought using offshore companies, are at the centre of a case against the Sharif family, with authorities and the opposition questioning the legitimacy of funds used to buy the apartments. Maryam Nawaz, Sharif's political heir, claimed she did not own the flats. In a report issued earlier this week, investigators tasked by Pakistan's Supreme Court to look into the allegations said the documents she submitted were \\"falsified\\" as they were dated February 2006 and the font in which they were typed in was not released until 2007. The controversy over the flats erupted last year with the Panama Papers leaks and could unseat Sharif.

The online encyclopaedia has since temporarily suspended edits to its page on Calibri. Typeface designer weighs in Supporters of Sharif's ruling PML-N party argued that Calibri has been publicly available since 2004. But the font's creator, a Dutch designer named Lucas De Groot, told the AFP news agency in a statement that it was \\"unlikely\\" Calibri had been used in any official documents in 2006. \\"[In] my opinion the document in question was produced much later,\\" he said. De Groot said he began designing Calibri in 2002 and sent the finalised version to Microsoft in 2004. After that, he said, it was used in beta versions that would have required \\"serious effort\\" to obtain.

Mariam Nawaz Sharif is under supreme court investigation after the 2016 Panama Papers leak tied her to a purchase of high-end London property acquired through offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands. Panama Papers: court rejects call to oust Pakistani PM over corruption claims Read more The unlikely source of this latest controversy, in a scandal that has gripped Pakistan for more than a year, is a font designed by Microsoft. Documents claiming that Mariam Nawaz Sharif was only a trustee of the companies that bought the London flats, are dated February 2006, and appear to be typed in Microsoft Calibri. But the font was only made commercially available in 2007, leading to suspicions that the documents are forged. Social media users have derided Sharif for this apparent misstep, coining the hashtag #fontgate. According to Wikipedia, the online encyclopaedia, the Calibri font was developed in 2004 but only reached the general public on 30 January 2007 with the launch of Microsoft Vista and Microsoft Office 2007. The Wikipedia Calibri page usually receives about 500 visits per day. On July 11 and 12 combined, it received about 150,000. After users seemingly tried to change the article’s content to say the font was available from 2004, Wikipedia suspended editing on its Calibri page “until July 18 2017, or until editing disputes have been resolved”. One supporter hailed the move, saying people seeking to edit the page “are trying to save a corrupt political party on corruption charges”. Others praised Wikipedia for its quick response and said it was proof of the company’s integrity. Opposition parties have urged prime minister Nawaz Sharif to step down after the investigation found a “significant disparity” between his family’s declared wealth and known sources of income. Opposition leader Imran Khan said Sharif had “lost all moral authority” and must resign immediately. Sharif has denied wrongdoing and said his family’s wealth was acquired legally. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his family have been embroiled in a scandal, dubbed #FontGate, involving the Calibri font. Documents that deny the PM's daughter, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, is the owner of high-end flats in London's Mayfair, which are at the heart of a corruption case against the Sharif family, were apparently typed in Calibri in February 2006. However, the typeface only came into use commercially in 2007. The inquiry, following the 2016 Panama Papers leak, is examining whether the Sharifs used illicit funds to buy the Mayfair properties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which rapid changes are caused by heat from inside Earth? OPTIONS: 1). landslides; 2). volcanoes; 3). avalanches; 4). floods;","completion":"Volcanoes are the primary rapid change caused by heat from inside the Earth. However, it is important to understand the processes and subsequent effects of each option before reaching a conclusion. 1. Landslides: Landslides occur when a mass of rock, earth, or debris moves down a slope under the influence of gravity. They can be triggered by various factors, including heavy rainfall, earthquakes, erosion, and human activities, such as mining or construction. While heat from inside the Earth can indirectly contribute to landslides, for example, by causing an earthquake that destabilizes a slope, landslides themselves are not directly driven by internal heat. 2. Volcanoes: Volcanic activity is directly linked to the heat that emanates from within the Earth. This heat results from the radioactive decay of isotopes, residual heat from planetary formation, and other processes occurring in Earth's mantle and core. Hot, molten rock, or magma, forms when the mantle's temperature and pressure conditions cause solid rock to partially melt. This magma accumulates in magma chambers beneath the Earth's crust, and when the pressure becomes too high, it rises through fractures, forming a volcanic eruption. Volcanic eruptions can cause the rapid formation or alteration of landforms, the release of ash and toxic gases into the atmosphere, and significant impacts on the environment and human populations. 3. Avalanches: Avalanches are rapid flows of snow down a slope, caused by a variety of factors such as heavy snowfall, wind, temperature fluctuations, and human-induced triggers. Although heat from the Earth can contribute to temperature fluctuations that might indirectly lead to an avalanche, avalanches themselves are primarily caused by atmospheric and surface conditions rather than the direct influence of internal heat. 4. Floods: Floods occur when an overflow of water submerges normally dry land, resulting from heavy rainfall, the rapid melting of snow and ice, or the sudden release of water from natural or human-made structures such as dams. Heat from inside the Earth can contribute to the formation of geothermal springs, which may lead to flooding in localized areas. However, floods are predominantly influenced by weather patterns and human activities, rather than a direct connection to internal heat. In conclusion, of the four rapid changes listed, volcanoes are the primary events caused by heat from inside the Earth. Volcanic eruptions are driven by the upwelling of magma from the mantle, fueled by Earth's internal heat, and result in significant transformative effects on landforms, environments, and human populations. While landslides, avalanches, and floods can occasionally be influenced indirectly by Earth's internal heat, their primary causes are separate from those responsible for volcanic activity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: With the growth of the Internet and the ease of publishing content, more and more creative minds are coming online to share videos, music, software, products, services, opinions, and more. While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself. My goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend ‘Dealing With Disrespect’ as something that can help put things in perspective.

Question: The rate of incarceration in the U.S. is the world’s highest, leading to what many lawmakers and policy analysts say is a nationwide imprisonment epidemic. But the beginning of the end of that epidemic started Tuesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told VOA. A bipartisan prison reform bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 360-59 vote “strikes an opening blow against the overcriminalization of the nation,” Jeffries, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said. U.S. President Donald Trump said “the strong bipartisan vote paces the way for action by the Senate.” Last week, Trump endorsed the bill at a White House summit on prison reform, saying, “Our whole nation benefits if former inmates are able to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.” If the bill reaches the president's desk for a signature, it would provide 50 million in funding for five years to provide job training, education and substance abuse treatment for prisoners as well as a number of quality-of-life measures aimed at reducing chronically high rates of recidivism among former inmates. But the contentious issue of criminal justice reform has split Democrats and Republicans within their own parties, possibly jeopardizing the bill’s chances of passage as it heads to the U.S. Senate. In a letter to colleagues last week, Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Dick Durbin and Cory Booker joined two House Democratic colleagues, Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee, in saying the bill could not be implemented effectively and could possibly lead to prison privatization. Jeffries told VOA many of the arguments against the First Step Act “were anchored in falsehoods.” He added the legislation passed today “is a first step towards eradicating the cancer of mass incarceration” a move also welcomed by many House Republicans. “Rather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation,” House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican...

Write a title for this article: NEW YORK (AP) -- While some families are struggling to pay their mortgages, others are in the enviable position of considering whether to make an extra payment this year. Experts say that while such a move can reduce interest payments over the life of the loan -- and speed up the date of a mortgage burning party -- it may not be the best use of consumers' money. \\"My concern is that you may accomplish paying off your mortgage early, but if you're not doing any other saving, you'll enter retirement broke,\\" said Ric Edelman, a financial adviser based in Fairfax, Virginia, and author of \\"The Truth About Money.\\" \\"I think it's more important for people to create wealth than to eliminate debt.\\" There are benefits, of course, to speeding up the payment of a mortgage by adding extra money to each month's payment check, shifting to biweekly payments or making a 13th \\"monthly\\" payment before year's end. Take the case of a family that takes out a 200,000 home loan with a fixed rate of 6 percent for 30 years. If that family makes an extra payment each year earmarked to reduce principal, it will save more than 47,000 in interest over the life of the loan and pay it off in less than 25 years, according to Bankrate.com, an online financial information service based in North Palm Beach, Florida. Still, speeding up the payment of a mortgage may not be as beneficial as dealing with other debt, said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst with Bankrate.com. He noted debts such as credit cards often carry considerably higher interest rates than mortgages, and interest payments on such consumer loans are not tax deductible like mortgage interest is. McBride also argued that a homeowner should never consider diverting more money to a mortgage until all other savings accounts are funded. \\"Tying up more money in an illiquid asset such as a home is ill-advised if the homeowner doesn't have an adequate emergency savings cushion,\\" McBride said. He added: \\"A much better use of the money would be to contribute to a 401(k) retirement account to maximize the employer match, or fund a Roth IRA that permits tax-free withdrawals in retirement.\\" Bob Walters, chief economist of Quicken Loans, an online mortgage lender based in Livonia, Michigan, said homeowners need to ask themselves what the very best use of a spare dollar could be. Look at your mortgage interest rate, say 6 percent, he said. Then look at your possible tax deduction. If you're in a 28 percent tax bracket, your after-tax cost of borrowing is about 4.5 percent. \\"The question is, from a purely financial standpoint, 'Can I do better than 4.5 percent after-tax somewhere else?\\"' he said. \\"The answer is generally 'yes.\\"' Walters suggests that consumers considering an extra mortgage payment review his checklist: If you don't have enough money squirreled away to cover at least six months of living expenses, create that \\"emergency fund\\" first, Walters said. Walters said that people need to worry about being \\"house poor,\\" meaning they have all their money tied up in their home. \\"I see people who don't have a nickel in savings but they're paying extra against their mortgages,\\" he said. \\"It's worrying.\\" Still, Walters and Bankrate.com's McBride say there are times when those extra mortgage payments should be considered. \\"Prepaying a mortgage can be a very good decision for someone with a low mortgage balance and approaching retirement,\\" McBride said. \\"In this situation, there is little if any tax benefit -- but the ability to eliminate a large monthly obligation in retirement is very appealing.\\" Walters said that others who might consider extra payments are those who find it impossible to save. But, beware of accelerated payment programs sponsored by mortgage lenders, which often add fees; you might be able to make extra payments on your own without penalty. \\"Some kind of biweekly payment program -- assuming there's no fee for it -- might be the only way you can possibly save,\\" he said. \\"It's maybe not the best economic solution, but it beats going out and spending the money on more shoes.\\" E-mail to a friend Copyright 2007 The Associated Press.

Instead, it discusses Freddie Mercury's birth name and his influence on the band Smile.

He passed away on November 24, 1991. Mercury's death was a consequence of bronchopneumonia as a complication of AIDS. His undeniable charisma and exceptional vocal range made him one of the most beloved and celebrated rock frontmen in history. Going back to the original statement about Freddie being a fan of Smile, it is important to mention that Smile was a band formed by Brian May and Roger Taylor, who later joined forces with Mercury in 1970 to create Queen. Freddie Mercury's vision and creative input were influential in propelling the group to worldwide fame, and his fascination with experimentation and elaborate stage and recording techniques played a significant role in shaping the band's unique sound."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hopefully we've shown Brazil what golf is about. I'm glad it was close. Not for my nerves, for golf.\\" While several other high-profile golfers had decided not to compete at the Olympics, Rose had relished the prospect of becoming an Olympian since the moment the sport's return to the Games was confirmed in 2009. Such was his eagerness to be part of the experience, he arrived the week before the Olympics officially started to ensure he was part of the opening ceremony. The Englishman made history by hitting Olympic golf's first hole-in-one in the opening round and started Sunday with a one-shot lead, before shooting four birdies and just one bogey on his outward nine. Stenson carded birdies in four of his first 10 holes and drew level with Rose when the leader dropped a shot on the 13th. It looked like a play-off would be needed to separate them but Rose held his nerve on the par-five last, chipping his approach to two feet from the hole, while Stenson's spun away to around 20 feet. The Swede then raced his birdie putt eight feet past the hole and missed the return to allow Rose the luxury of two putts for victory. He needed just the one.

Robert wanted carpeting on the floor and Eric didn't because Select from: (i). Robert knew that sweeping was cleaner than vacuuming.. (ii). Eric knew that sweeping was cleaner than vacuuming..","completion":"Eric knew that sweeping was cleaner than vacuuming. The disagreement between Robert and Eric over whether to have carpeting on the floor was rooted in their differing opinions on cleanliness and maintenance. Robert was an advocate for carpeting because it added a warm, cozy feeling to the room. He believed that a room with carpet would be a more inviting space for people to gather, and he appreciated the softness underfoot. Moreover, he felt that vacuuming was an efficient and effective way to keep the carpet clean, removing dirt, dust, and allergens that could accumulate over time. Eric, on the other hand, was opposed to carpeting for several reasons. One of his main concerns was the ease and effectiveness of cleaning the floor. He had done extensive research and discovered that sweeping hard floors, like wood or tile, was generally cleaner than vacuuming carpets. Sweepers had the advantage of easily accessing corners and edges, where dirt and dust might accumulate, and could be used more frequently without causing damage to the surface beneath. Moreover, Eric understood that the bristles of a broom were better able to dislodge particles from the floor's surface than the suction of a vacuum cleaner. He believed that vacuuming carpets only managed to pull up loose debris while leaving behind certain types of dirt, such as pet hair, which could become embedded in the carpet fibers over time. In addition to that, he argued that vacuum cleaners were more likely to release dust and allergens back into the air, which could then be breathed in by the home's inhabitants. Sweeping, on the other hand, trapped these particles more effectively, making it a cleaner option, especially for people with allergies or asthma. Furthermore, Eric was concerned about the environmental impact of using a vacuum cleaner, which required electricity and the constant purchasing of vacuum bags or filters. Sweeping was a more eco-friendly option, as it required only a broom and dustpan, both of which could be reused indefinitely. Despite their differences, both Robert and Eric made valid points about their preferred flooring options. It would ultimately come down to their individual priorities and how much weight they gave to factors such as comfort, cleanliness, and environmental impact. In the end, it would be important for them to find a solution that best met their needs, whether it was carpeting, hard flooring, or some combination of the two."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mobile businesses have become increasingly popular and essential, enabling companies to expand their reach and engage customers through mobile devices. The concept of a mobile business goes beyond just having a mobile app; it involves optimizing all aspects of a company's operations for mobility. In this article, we discuss three crucial steps for companies to succeed as mobile businesses: cultivating a mobile-first mindset, investing in app development, and leveraging mobile marketing strategies. Step 1: Cultivating a Mobile-First Mindset The first step in making a company succeed as a mobile business is embracing a mobile-first mindset across the entire organization. This involves understanding the significance of mobile channels in reaching customers, recognizing the benefits it brings, and fostering a culture that prioritizes mobile initiatives. Here are some ways to cultivate a mobile-first mindset: 1. Leadership buy-in: Ensure that the top management and key decision-makers are committed to prioritizing mobile strategies and investing in mobile technologies. 2. Employee engagement and training: Encourage employees to integrate mobile tools into their daily workflows and provide training on mobile technologies and practices to ensure they can confidently operate in a mobile-first environment. 3. Rethink business processes: Assess and redesign business processes to ensure they are flexible, efficient, and optimized for mobile environments. This may include utilizing cloud services, allowing remote working, and adopting mobile-friendly payment solutions. Step 2: Investing in App Development Developing a high-quality, user-friendly app is essential for businesses to thrive in the mobile landscape. A well-designed app can help companies reach their target audience more effectively, foster customer engagement, and deliver seamless and integrated user experiences. Here are some factors to consider when investing in app development: 1. Define app goals and objectives: Before initiating the app development process, it's essential to outline the app's primary goals and objectives, which could range from boosting customer engagement to streamlining business operations. 2. Choose the right platform: Companies need to decide whether to develop an iOS, Android, or cross-platform app. This decision should be based on factors such as target audience, desired capabilities, and resource constraints. 3. Focus on user experience: Ensure that the app offers an intuitive and seamless user experience by conducting thorough user testing, incorporating user feedback, and refining the app iteratively. An exceptional user experience can lead to higher engagement rates, positive reviews, and increased customer loyalty. 4. Consider app monetization: Determine the most suitable app monetization strategy, which may include in-app purchases, advertising, subscriptions, or a combination of these methods. Step 3: Leveraging Mobile Marketing Strategies Promoting a mobile business effectively and reaching the right audience is crucial for success. Companies need to leverage mobile marketing strategies that utilize various channels (including in-app, push notifications, social media, and email) to foster customer engagement and drive growth. Here are some mobile marketing tactics to consider: 1. Optimize app store presence: Boost visibility and discoverability by optimizing app store listings with strong titles, keywords, descriptions, and engaging visuals. Encourage existing users to leave positive reviews and ratings, which can boost search rankings and credibility. 2. Engage users through personalized messaging: Implement personalized messaging and engagement tools, such as push notifications, in-app messages, and email campaigns, to communicate with users about new features, offers, and updates. Personalized messaging can increase user retention and encourage long-term loyalty. 3. Leverage social media and influencer marketing: Promote mobile offerings on social media platforms to reach a broader audience, partner with influencers to boost credibility, and create engaging content that resonates with target users. 4. Monitor and analyze data: Regularly analyze user engagement and behavior data to understand what is working and what needs improvement. Optimize mobile marketing strategies based on actionable insights and continually refine tactics to drive business growth. Conclusion Embracing a mobile-first mindset, investing in a high-quality app, and leveraging mobile marketing strategies are three crucial steps for companies to succeed as mobile businesses. By focusing on these essential steps, businesses can ensure they are best-positioned to capitalize on the dynamic mobile environment and stay ahead of the competition."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon.

They sound like fairly obvious requirements for any employee, let alone an upholder of the law: Don’t turn up for work drunk; don’t have sex on duty; be honest. The police force, however, thinks otherwise. So much so, in fact, that those three instructions are to be issued to all officers in a new ten-point code. Other parts of the code tell police that they should ‘respect and obey the law’, act with integrity at all times and not abuse their positions. New code: Police officers will have to abide by the new ten-point plan. Ethics: Mrs May used the speech at The College of Policing Conference in Bramshill near Hook in Hampshire to set out a new code for all police officers. The code is to be introduced after a. series of scandals which have shaken public confidence in the force,. including the Plebgate row and the investigation into the Hillsborough. disaster. But critics said. telling officers not to break the law or be corrupt – and reminding them. to be courteous to the public – was a ‘statement of the blindingly. obvious’. The draft Code of Ethics was published yesterday by the. College of Policing, which was created up to set and maintain standards. for policing in England and Wales. It. was endorsed by Home Secretary Theresa May, who said it was. ‘astonishing’ that police had not had an explicit code of ethics before. The ten headings include honesty and integrity, courtesy towards the public, and equality and diversity. Under. the latter, officers are told to uphold the Human Rights Act, while. under ‘fitness for work’ officers are told to not make themselves ‘unfit. or impaired for duty as a result of drinking alcohol’ or using drugs. The. ‘work and responsibilities’ section includes an edict to ‘maintain. strictly professional behaviour when on duty, including not engaging in. sexual conduct’. Officers. are also told not to ‘use your professional position to establish or. pursue a sexual or improper emotional relationship’ with a ‘vulnerable’ person. The IPCC was given more powers in December 2012 for a probe into the Hillsborough Disaster. The code also. includes a new obligation on officers to report or challenge any of. their colleagues who fall below the standards of the code. Chief. Constable Alex Marshall, the head of the College of Policing, said:. ‘It’s right to spell out in plain language what’s expected of people and. also we have to learn lessons from the past.’ He. added: ‘We have a code of ethics for doctors, for lawyers for all the. serious professions and I don’t think they say they don’t need it. written down.’ He also accepted some individual officers had ‘let us. down’ in the past with their conduct. But. critics pointed to the oath which all police constables already have to. take. In it, they swear to serve the Queen with fairness, integrity,. diligence and to accord equal respect to ‘all people’. Gerard. Batten, of UKIP, said: ‘Aren’t these things that the police are. supposed to have been doing on duty since 1829 when the first police. force was set up? Do they know something we don’t that they feel the. need to re-state ten points of the blindingly obvious?’","completion":"This article is about a new ten-point code for police officers. The police force wants to make sure that all officers follow some important rules. These rules remind them to not come to work drunk, not have sex while on duty, and to always be honest. These rules are being introduced because there have been some problems with the police force that made people lose trust in them. The code of ethics also reminds police officers to be courteous and respectful to the public, treat everyone equally, and follow the law. Officers have to be careful about their relationships and must not take advantage of their position as a police officer. There is a section about being fit for work, which means police officers should not drink alcohol or use drugs while on duty. They are also told to avoid any kind of sexual conduct while on duty. The new code also asks police officers to report any of their coworkers who do not follow these rules. Some people think this is obvious and should already be a part of the police force's rules, but the head of the College of Policing, Chief Constable Alex Marshall, believes it is important to have these rules written down and to learn from past mistakes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To keep the drain clear and effectively drain the water from the stainless steel dishwasher, run your garbage disposal before you start cleaning it. Remove the bottom rack on your stainless steel dishwasher. Examine it for clumps of debris that might cause it to drain improperly. Remove anything that might be clogging the drain. Fill a dishwasher-safe cup on the top rack of the stainless steel dishwasher with vinegar. Slide the rack back in the stainless steel dishwasher and close the door. With only the cupful of vinegar inside, turn the stainless steel dishwasher on and run it on the highest water temperature setting. The vinegar will help loosen grease and grime, and remove any odor that the dishwasher might have acquired. Use distilled white vinegar or specialized cleaning vinegar. When the first wash cycle is done, sprinkle the bottom of the stainless steel dishwasher with baking soda. Run the dishwasher on a short cycle with water at the highest temperature. Baking soda will help you remove stains from your dishwasher. Check the area around the dishwasher door for debris and grime. Some dishwashers cannot adequately clean this area, which leads to an accumulation of yucky material. If you see anything, use a damp cloth to wipe the area down. Additionally, use a damp cotton swab to clean along the ridges of the seal. The stainless steel dishwasher’s filter collects prevents large debris from entering the drain. You’ll probably have to use a screwdriver to remove the screws that hold the grate in place. Some newer stainless steel dishwashers, however, have filters that simply pop out when turned.

Not every stainless steel dishwasher has a filter. The utensil rack is a small container attached to the dishwasher rack. You might have just one, or one on each rack. Remove it and rinse it in the sink beneath warm water. Use a sponge dampened with warm, soapy water to clean the inside and outside of the utensil rack.

But Swedish entrepreneur Oscar Dios thinks they can be persuaded otherwise and he has created a new kind of hostel to prove it. Dios says it is the world's first jumbo (unusually large) jet hostel, an actual jet-plane at Sweden's main airport outside Stockholm which has been changed into a 25- room guesthouse that sleeps as many as 72 people. \\"I learned about this plane that was standing deserted at Arlanda airport and I've been trying the concept of hostels in many different houses and buildings,\\" he told Reuters. \\"I thought, 'Why not a plane?'\\" Jumbo Hostels opened for business on Thursday, giving customers the chance to check in and sleep in a room that can best be described as comfortable.\\" \\"The most challenging part with this project is trying to build something inside a metal hull - it's just really, really tight.\\" The jet, which was originally produced for Singapore Airlines, was taken out of service in 2002. It is held on a concrete foundation with the landing gear secured in steel cradles. One feature of the hostel is its price - a room starts at 350 Swedish crowns (about 41), which is a lot less than hotel rooms outside of major airports. Another feature is that customers can get married on the wing of the plane and stay in the plane's more luxurious honeymoon suite . Instead of walking down the aisle in the church, lovebirds can take what Jumbo Hostels calls the \\"wing walk,\\" where they can be joined in great happiness at the wing tip. The hostel has someone ready to perform the ceremony. But in some respects this hostel remains a plane - most customers have to share the jet's nine bathrooms and the staff only wear air host and hostess outfits.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a review of movie. Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. Q: This film does not fail to engage and move, even in 2008 to an audience only familiar with modern over-produced sound and computer enhanced techniques.The experience of the movie goer in 1922 who could only see this in a cinema with others on their big screen must have been truly profound and a thoroughly satisfying experience.One has to ask could a film maker today make a two hour silent movie and make it interesting and achieve the same structure tempo and balance as this movie has. Silent film making was pure art, it had to hold the attention through its structure, direction and acting - there was no padding out with more words or computer generated distractions. A poorly made or uninteresting silent movie is unwatchable.This film needs to be put into context for those who might be disconcerted with the mention of Christian themes. This is not a 'Christiany' film, it is not selling anything. These themes along with reference to current moral standards often appear in this era - also church going on Sundays was a national past time, Christianity was a given in most households thus the film is only depicting normal life as it was then. The themes would have rung true and deep at the time.It is most odd given the strong support to good Christian thinking of this particular movie (and it is not preaching religion to anyone, only highlighting the difference between hypocrites and the honest)that in 1922 a Pastor in an open debate with a representative from the film industry with a large crowd denounced Pickford as an example of immorality, along with some other individuals he named. NY Times 1922.Maybe they should have watched this movie that also came out in 1922 and, learned some lessons.The Pastor complained that since the film industry had started church attendance had dropped 500,000. The film representative in the debate however made the following observations; that saloon attendance had also dropped, that there were far more pastors in prison than actors (fact) and that selecting a few examples from among the many was not representative of the whole.Thus there was an ongoing battle between church and the film industry during the early days of film.This is a wonderful film about being honest and true to family friends and to be willing to make sacrifices. Mary Pickford, naive, honest, feisty, full of happiness and joy, faithful, humorous and silently sacrificing - though poor and uneducated she represented the perfect character. This however is not thrust down our throat but revealed bit by bit through the film.This is reminiscent of some modern Chinese films where characters are slowly, languidly revealed over the course of a film and it is this tempo that creates a stronger connection with the character. It has a smooth even tempo for the first half that builds all the elements for the last section. The last 30 minutes are great film making and it has to be appreciated it was achieved without the benefit of sound, running dialog - it was achieved through deft acting and great directing. It is sometimes surprising to realize that at the end of the film you haven't hear a word spoken, but it feels like you have heard everything.The supporting cast put in great performances especially Gloria Hope, Jean Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes. The final few minutes are typical Pickford understated humor as she goes outside under the pretext of sweeping the snow, a near perfect balance and ending. This is a special type of touching humor that should not be underestimated. Chaplin used this device often and copied some of from Pickford.Another special observation to be made about Silent films and especially Pickford films is that the star often has to hold the camera for much of the movie without the audience becoming jaded or bored, with the actors over-exposure. That Pickford is usually thoroughly the center of attention through most of her movies but the people still couldn't get enough of her is a testament to her fine acting ability.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who precedes the new president in office? ? The film opens on 12 April 1945 with the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the succession of Harry Truman to the presidency. In Europe, the Germans are close to surrender, but in the Pacific the bloody battle for Okinawa is still underway and an invasion of the Japanese home islands is not foreseen until the autumn. American battle casualties have almost reached 900,000, with Japanese casualties at 1.1 million, and some 8 million Asian civilians have died in the war that began with Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931. The new president knows nothing about the nuclear weapons being developed at Los Alamos, and he must soon decide on whether to use them and how. The US Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, has doubts even about the wisdom of the American fire-bombing raids on Japan. \\"One of these Gadgets [bombs]\\", U.S. Secretary of State James F. Byrnes says, \\"could end the war in one blow.\\" When nuclear physicist Leo Szilard delivers a petition signed by 73 scientists urging the president not to deploy the bomb, Byrnes tells him: \\"You do not spend two billion dollars and then show them [American voters] nothing.\\" The film suggests that Byrnes never mentioned Szilard's visit to the president. Also urging deployment is Maj. Gen. Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project. \\"We've come this far\\", Groves says; \\"there's no going back.\\" A demonstration is ruled out because \\"it might be a dud.\\" In Japan, the strong man is Gen.

Real Madrid fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Dynamo Kiev in their Champions League match on Wednesday, leaving the Group B wide open with two rounds remaining.","completion":"This match report is about the UEFA Champions League group stage encounter between Real Madrid and Dynamo Kiev that took place on Wednesday. Real Madrid is a Spanish football club, and Dynamo Kiev is a Ukrainian football club. Both teams are part of Group B in the ongoing UEFA Champions League, one of the most prestigious club football competitions in the world. The group stage of the competition consists of 8 groups (A to H), each having four teams. The top two teams from each group at the end of six rounds of matches advance to the knockout stage, where they compete in a single-elimination format. In this particular match, Real Madrid and Dynamo Kiev played to a 2-2 draw. A draw means that both the teams scored an equal number of goals by the end of regulation playtime (90 minutes), and as a result, they share points in the group standings. In the Champions League group stage, a win earns 3 points, a draw equals 1 point, and a loss results in no points. During the course of the match, Dynamo Kiev took an early 2-0 lead, threatening to upset the more favored Real Madrid side. It is worth noting that coming from behind to secure a draw or win is a difficult task, especially in a big European competition like the Champions League. Nonetheless, Real Madrid showcased their resilience and fighting spirit by scoring two goals and drawing level to make it a 2-2 tie by the end of the match. This comeback is significant because it helped Real Madrid salvage a crucial point in their campaign and maintain their hope of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition. Moreover, this result has implications for the rest of Group B as well. With two rounds of games still left to play, the draw leaves the group wide open, meaning that no team has yet to secure a spot in the knockout rounds, and every team still theoretically has a chance to advance. This situation adds to the excitement and unpredictability of the UEFA Champions League, as the remaining matches in the group stage will be crucial in determining which clubs advance to the knockout rounds and which ones will be eliminated. In conclusion, the match report is about an important and exciting UEFA Champions League encounter between Real Madrid and Dynamo Kiev. The game ended in a 2-2 draw, giving both teams a point each in the Group B standings. The result has significant implications for the group, as it remains wide open with two rounds of fixtures left to be played, adding to the overall excitement of the competition as all four teams in Group B continue to vie for a spot in the knockout rounds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the full names of the people who the used very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies? from the following article ? After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed. The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship,...

There are 101 state representatives, each serving a two-year term, and 48 state senators, who serve four-year terms that are staggered so only half of the Oklahoma Senate districts are eligible in each election year. Legislators are elected directly by the people from single member districts of equal population. The Oklahoma Legislature meets annually in the Oklahoma State Capitol in Oklahoma City. - Oklahoma (Cherokee: \\"Asgaya gigageyi\\" / ; or transliterated from English as (\\"òàlàhoma\\"), Pawnee: \\"Uukuhuúwa\\", Cayuga: \\"Gahnawiyogeh\\") is a state located in the South Central United States. Oklahoma is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words \\"okla\\" and \\"humma\\", meaning \\"red people\\". It is also known informally by its nickname, \\"The Sooner State\\", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as \\"Oklahomans\\", or informally \\"Okies\\", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City. - As general terms, Indian Territory, the Indian Territories, or Indian country describe an evolving land area set aside by the United States Government for the relocation of Native Americans who held aboriginal title to their land. In general, the tribes ceded land they occupied in exchange for land grants in an area purchased by the United States federal government from Napoleonic France, the Louisiana Purchase. The concept of an Indian Territory was an outcome of the 18th- and 19th-century policy of Indian removal. After the Civil War, the policy of the government was one of assimilation. - The House of Lords of the United Kingdom, referred to ceremonially as the House of Peers, is the upper house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Like the House of Commons, it meets in the Palace of Westminster. Officially, the full name of the house is: \\"The Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled\\". - The Oklahoma House of Representatives is the lower house of the legislature of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. Its members introduce and vote on bills and resolutions, provide legislative oversight for state agencies, and help to craft the state's budget. The upper house of the Oklahoma Legislature is the Oklahoma Senate. - The Choctaw (In the Choctaw language, Chahta) are Native American people originally from the Southeastern United States (modern-day Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, and Louisiana). The Choctaw language belongs to the Muskogean language family group. The Choctaw are descendants of the peoples of the Hopewell and Mississippian cultures, who lived throughout the east of the Mississippi River valley and its tributaries. About 1,700 years ago, the Hopewell people built Nanih Waiya, a great earthwork mound, which is still considered sacred by the Choctaw. The early Spanish explorers of the mid-16th century encountered Mississippian-culture villages and chiefs. The anthropologist John Swanton suggested that the Choctaw derived their name from an early leader. Henry Halbert, a historian, suggests that their name is derived from the Choctaw phrase \\"Hacha hatak\\" (river people). - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress which, along with the House of Representatives, the lower chamber, composes the legislature of the United States. - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate. - An Okie is a resident, native, or cultural descendant of Oklahoma. Like most terms that disparage specific groups, it was first applied by the dominant cultural group. It is derived from the name of the state, similar to \\"Texan\\" or \\"Tex\\" for someone from Texas, or \\"Arkie\\" or \\"Arkansawyer\\" for a native of Arkansas. - A senate is a deliberative assembly, often the upper house or chamber of a bicameral legislature or parliament. The name comes from the ancient Roman Senate (Latin: \\"Senatus\\"), so-called as an assembly of the senior (Latin: \\"senex\\" meaning \\"the elder\\" or \\"the old one\\") and therefore allegedly wiser and more experienced members of the society or ruling class. - A lower house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature, the other chamber being the upper house. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016.

Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - The Indian sausage Act is the name of several acts passed by the United States Congress. A considerable number of acts were passed under the same name throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, but the most notable landmark acts consist of the 1851 Indian Appropriations Act and the 1871 Indian Appropriations Act. - The Oklahoma Senate is the upper house of the two houses of the Legislature of Oklahoma , the other being the Oklahoma House of Representatives .

Joseph Krauzenberg is a very wealthy Hungarian Jewish industrial tycoon whose fortune is mirrored in the great palaces he owns. However, by 1944 his important businesses are needed by the Nazis and Hitler's 'Final Solution' is sweeping through Europe. The Nazis are greedy to accumulate wealth as easily as possible, and under the terms of the Third Reich's \\"Europa Plan\\", Krauzenberg arranges with Nazi leaders to exchange his fortune, his business holdings (textile plants, steel mills, ownership of several banks) and a collection of rare art for safe passage to Switzerland for himself, his wife Rachel, and their family. As the night of transaction approaches, Krauzenberg visits his large family being held by the Gestapo, and reassures them that all will be safe. Such is Krauzenberg's wealth and power that when he agrees to sign over his property, it is two of the most powerful men in the Nazi regime who announce they will be coming to his house to handle the paperwork – Adolf Eichmann and Heinrich Himmler. However, as the Nazi leaders are ushered into Krauzenberg's home, they are struck by something unusual – his two most trusted servants, Hans Vassmann and his wife Ingrid are a married Aryan couple who, despite the law, are still working for Jews. As it happens, Eichmann and Himmler's suspicions are well-founded – despite appearing to be the perfect Aryan couple, Hans and Ingrid are actually Jews working deep undercover with the underground Resistance.

Movie plot title: The Campaign Movie plot: Democratic Congressman Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) of North Carolina's fictional 14th District is running for his fifth term unopposed. However his campaign is damaged by the revelation of his affair with one of his supporters, when Cam accidentally leaves a sexually explicit voice message on a local family's answering machine. The corrupt businessmen brothers Glenn and Wade Motch (Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow) use this opportunity to convince Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis), tourism director for the town of Hammond and son of one of their associates, Raymond Huggins, to run against Cam on the Republican ticket, as part of a plan to profit from dealings with a Chinese company. Cam at first underestimates Marty and humiliates him by playing a video biography highlighting potentially embarrassing aspects of Marty's life. The Motch brothers then hire Tim Wattley (Dylan McDermott) to be Marty's campaign manager. Tim reinvents Marty as a successful entrepreneur and family man. Marty's popularity rises due to his effective campaign while Cam's is further damaged when he accidentally punches a baby when intending to hit Marty.

(Associated Press) FILE - This undated photo provided by the family shows Aimee Copeland, the 24-year-old Georgia graduate student fighting to survive a flesh-eating bacterial infection. Copeland is refusing to take pain... (Associated Press) A Georgia woman fighting a flesh-eating disease is refusing to take pain medications during some procedures, partly because of her personal convictions, her father said. Aimee Copeland despises the use of morphine in her treatment, despite its effectiveness at blocking her pain, her father said in a Friday online update on his daughter's condition. Her graduate-school study of holistic pain management techniques leads her to feel she's a \\"traitor to her convictions\\" when she uses drugs to manage her pain, Andy Copeland said. He also said the morphine has been making his daughter groggy, confused and has given her unpleasant hallucinatory episodes. Aimee Copeland, 24, developed necrotizing fasciitis after cutting her leg in a fall May 1 from a homemade zip line over a west Georgia river. Her left leg, other foot and both hands have been amputated. On Tuesday, Copeland's condition was upgraded from critical to serious, \\"a major victory that cannot and should not be diminished,\\" Andy Copeland wrote Friday on his blog, where he has been providing regular updates on her progress. The development came shortly after Aimee Copeland had her first successful skin graft. \\"The area of her wound, which I saw for the first time on Sunday during a dressing change, is massive,\\" her father wrote in Friday's update. \\"The nurse who completed Aimee's dressing change was astonished at Aimee's insistence to avoid morphine during the procedure, as was her mother and I,\\" he wrote. \\"I know the pain was significant, but Aimee's courage is greater.\\" The bacteria that attacked Aimee Copeland's wound releases a toxin that destroys skin, muscle and a layer of tissue below the skin known as fascia, her father says. Despite the painful skin grafts, Aimee Copeland has crossed several milestones in recent weeks. She can breathe on her own, she no longer needs dialysis and she's now able to eat on her own, her father wrote. Although her major organs are all functioning well, Aimee Copeland still needs supplemental nutrition through a stomach tube. This weekend, thousands of people are expected at a long-planned fund-raising event outside Atlanta to help the family with medical expenses. The two-day benefit concert in Aimee Copeland's hometown of Snellville begins at 5 p.m. Friday and continues through Saturday night. ___ Online: http://aimeecopeland.com/ |||||Summary:","completion":"Aimee Copeland, a 24-year-old graduate student from Georgia, is battling a flesh-eating disease known as necrotizing fasciitis, which she contracted following a leg cut she sustained from a fall off a homemade zip line on May 1. Despite the severe pain associated with her treatment, which has necessitated the amputation of her left leg, other foot, and both hands, Copeland has been refusing to take morphine due to her personal beliefs. As she studied holistic pain management techniques during her graduate studies, she feels like she is betraying her convictions by using medicines to manage her pain, according to her father, Andy Copeland. He also mentioned that the use of morphine has been affecting Aimee negatively, causing her to be groggy, confused, and even hallucinatory. Meanwhile, the bacteria that has attacked Aimee's wound, turning flesh-eating, emits a toxin that destroys skin, muscle, and a layer of tissue beneath the skin commonly referred to as fascia. Despite her challenging circumstances, Copeland's condition was upgraded from critical to serious, symbolizing a significant victory in her health battle. This improvement occurred shortly after her first successful skin graft, a development that her father defined as \\"a major victory that cannot and should not be diminished.\\" However, the road to recovery seems still long as the wound area, which her father saw for the first time recently, is massive. Aimee has, nonetheless, reached several milestones in recent weeks, illustrating her strong will and determination in confrontation with her disease. She can now breathe independently, she no longer requires dialysis, and has regained the ability to eat on her own, although she still requires supplemental nutrition delivered through a stomach tube due to the functionality of all her major organs. To help cope with the medical expenses, a fund-raising event planned much ahead in her hometown, Snellville, outside Atlanta, is expected to attract thousands of participants this weekend. The two-day benefit concert is seen as a communal effort to provide support to the Copeland family in these challenging times.

When it comes to shopping for clothes online, it can be quite an overwhelming and frustrating experience, especially when one is uncertain about what they're looking for or how to navigate through the plethora of options available. It's not surprising that the thought of shopping can sometimes trigger a sense of anxiety or anger, particularly when the process feels less than enjoyable. The image that has caught your attention – the casual, cerulean-blue dress with cap sleeves – seems like a good starting point for delving into the world of online shopping, considering it appeals to your taste and doesn't appear to break the bank. To better understand what to do next, let's break down the process of shopping online: 1. Analyze the Product Listing: Begin by carefully examining the image and the information provided on the webpage. The picture usually gives you an idea of the dress' overall appearance, color, and design, while the description shares relevant details like the fabric, fit, or unique features. Take note of any customer reviews and ratings, as these can serve as indicators of the dress' quality and how well it meets the expectations of previous buyers. 2. Determine Your Size: Sizing is a crucial factor when purchasing clothes online, as it can greatly influence your satisfaction with the product. Be sure to consult the size chart, which is often included on the product page or accessible through a link nearby. Measure yourself with a tape measure, according to the guidelines provided, and compare the results with the sizing information. In case you're unsure, it's generally safer to opt for a slightly larger size, since you can always have it altered for a perfect fit. 3. Check the Return Policy: Before proceeding with the purchase, it's essential to familiarize yourself with the retailer's return policy. This information typically outlines the time window for product returns, the conditions under which returns are accepted, and if any additional charges or restocking fees apply. Knowing the return policy beforehand can save you unnecessary stress and complications, should you need to make a return. 4. Add to Cart and Checkout: If you are confident with your decision regarding the size and are aware of the return policy, click the \\"Add to Cart\\" button. This action typically takes you to your shopping cart, where you can review the items you are about to purchase. Ensure that the dress, its color, and the desired size are all accurate. 5. Complete the Purchase: After double-checking the details, proceed to checkout. This step usually requires you to enter your shipping address, billing information, and payment method. Take a moment to confirm the shipping fees and estimated delivery time, as these factors can impact your overall satisfaction with the entire process. While entering this information, keep an eye out for any promo codes or discount offers available to make the most of your budget. Once you are satisfied with all the information, submit your order. In conclusion, online shopping can be a daunting task, but breaking it down into manageable steps and gathering information before making a purchase can significantly improve the experience. By following these guidelines, you may find yourself enjoying the convenience and variety offered by online shopping platforms, making it easier and more enjoyable to find that perfect dress or any other clothing piece you desire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: The answer is:","completion":"The small holes found in bread, also known as the crumb structure, are formed by the carbon dioxide gas produced during the fermentation process. As the yeast consumes the sugars in the dough, it releases carbon dioxide gas, which gets trapped within the elastic gluten network created by the proteins in the flour. When the dough is mixed and kneaded, the gluten develops and strengthens, allowing it to stretch and hold the gas bubbles formed during fermentation. As the dough bakes in the oven, the heat causes the gas to expand and the dough to rise, which further solidifies the protein structure. This results in the signature spongy texture and small holes in the finished bread. In addition to yeast, chemical leaveners like baking soda and baking powder can also be used to create the small holes in bread. These leavening agents release carbon dioxide gas when they react with moisture and heat, contributing to the formation of the crumb structure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Information: - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors. - Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 185329 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty. - Theodorus \`\` Theo '' van Gogh ( Dutch pronunciation : ( teodors teo vn x ) ; 1 May 1857 -- 25 January 1891 ) was a Dutch art dealer .

It is a fictional town created as the main setting for the popular television series \\"Sons of Anarchy.\\" The show, which aired from 2008 to 2014, focused on the lives of members of a close-knit outlaw motorcycle club operating in the fictional town of Charming, California. The concept of Charming was developed by the show's creator, Kurt Sutter, who sought to create a small town atmosphere that felt familiar and relatable to viewers. Charming was designed to embody traditional American values and portray a sense of community spirit. In order to achieve this vision, the show's producers carefully selected filming locations in the California area, including neighborhoods in North Hollywood, Tujunga, and Sun Valley, among others. Several key elements are used to build the illusion of Charming as a real town. For example, the show's set designers created a variety of meticulously crafted storefronts, signage, and other fixtures to immerse the viewer in the show's setting. Furthermore, the series made use of local landmarks and scenery, including the recognizable shops and streets of Downtown Fillmore, California. While Charming itself may not be an actual town, its distinct personality and interconnected community dynamics drew many viewers to the show, making it seem more genuine. The show's ability to create such a believable setting speaks to its impressive storytelling and character development. In conclusion, although Charming from Sons of Anarchy may feel like a real place, it is in fact a fictional town created for the purpose of the television series. The show's creators made great efforts to develop a fully fleshed-out and believable setting for the motorcycle club's exploits, using a combination of location shooting, set dressing, and nuanced writing to make Charming seem like a genuine California community. While viewers may find themselves drawn to the town and its residents, it is essential to remember that Charming exists solely within the realm of fiction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The 4-year-old boy was mentally disabled, unable to speak in complete sentences and unable to play with other children because of his violent fits of hitting and biting. The decision facing one Brooklyn jury was how much a landlord should pay in damages to the boy -- named \\"G.M.M.\\" in court documents -- after an investigation showed he had been living in an apartment illegally coated with lead paint. Attorneys representing G.M.M. said 3.4 million was the right number, arguing that the boy would have had a bright career ahead of him; both of his parents had graduated from college and his mother received a master's degree. But the landlord's defense put the figure at less than half that -- 1.5 million. Attorney Roger Archibald noted that because the boy was Hispanic, G.M.M. was unlikely to attain the advanced education that would provide to such a large income. The 4-year-old's case is a rare public look at one corner of the American legal system that explicitly uses race and gender to determine how much victims or their families should receive in compensation when they are seriously injured or killed. As a result, white and male victims often receive larger awards than people of color and women in similar cases. These differences largely derive from _ of how much more money individuals would have earned over their lifetimes had they not been injured -- projections that take into account average earnings and employment levels by race and gender.

The question is about who invented the biological system of nomenclature for classifying plants and animals, not about the groups resulting from the classification process (taxa). The correct answer would be as follows: Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) is widely regarded as the founder of the modern system of binomial nomenclature for classifying plants and animals. Linnaeus devised a hierarchical system to categorize organisms based on the similarities and differences of their physical and structural characteristics. His classification system, formalized in his 10th edition of the book \\"Systema Naturae\\" in 1758, used a two-word naming system, where the first word represented the organism's genus, followed by a unique species name. This method is now referred to as binomial nomenclature and is still used today as the basis for classifying and naming organisms in biology.

Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in.

Given the question: Question: when can you use a defibulator I found the following answer on Google: Defibrillation is a common treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias , ventricular fibrillation , and pulseless ventricular tachycardia . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct. To provide a detailed and long explanation: A defibrillator is a medical device used to treat life-threatening heart conditions such as cardiac dysrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation, and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. These conditions involve abnormal heart rhythms that can be fatal if not treated promptly and effectively. The purpose of defibrillation is to restore normal heart rhythms, which can potentially save a life in critical situations. Cardiac dysrhythmias refer to irregular heartbeats or heart rates that are too fast or too slow. These abnormal heartbeats can occur in different chambers of the heart and can lead to various symptoms, including dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, or even cardiac arrest. Not all dysrhythmias require defibrillation, but some may progress to more severe and life-threatening conditions if left untreated. Ventricular fibrillation is a type of cardiac dysrhythmia that affects the heart's ventricles, which are the main pumping chambers. This condition causes the ventricles to quiver chaotically, leading to ineffective blood circulation throughout the body. Without immediate intervention, ventricular fibrillation can rapidly cause unconsciousness and death. Defibrillation is considered the primary treatment for this condition. By delivering an electrical current to the heart, the defibrillator aims to terminate the fibrillation and restore normal heart rhythm. Pulseless ventricular tachycardia is another life-threatening heart condition that requires urgent defibrillation. In this condition, the heart's ventricles beat extremely rapidly but ineffectively, leading to inadequate blood circulation. Like ventricular fibrillation, this condition can cause sudden cardiac arrest and death if not treated immediately. Defibrillating the heart can potentially stop the abnormal rhythm and allow the heart to regain normal function. Defibrillators can be either manual or automatic. Manual defibrillators are typically operated by trained healthcare professionals, while automated external defibrillators (AEDs) can be used by laypersons with minimal training. AEDs are designed to automatically analyze the heart rhythm and deliver a shock if needed, making them safe and easy to use in different settings, including public places. In summary, the answer you found on Google is correct. Defibrillation is a common and effective treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation, and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. The use of defibrillators in these cases can help restore a normal heart rhythm, potentially saving a person's life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Steve Boigon, 62, a florist from San Diego, wrote, “I walk with a new spring in my step and I look at life through physics-colored eyes.” Professor Lewin delivers his lectures with the panache of Julia Child bringing French cooking to amateurs and the zany theatricality of YouTube’s greatest hits. He is part of a new generation of academic stars who hold forth in cyberspace on their college Web sites and even, without charge, on iTunes U, which went up in May on Apple’s iTunes Store. In his lectures at ocw.mit.edu, Professor Lewin beats a student with cat fur to demonstrate electrostatics. Wearing shorts, sandals with socks and a pith helmet  nerd safari garb  he fires a cannon loaded with a golf ball at a stuffed monkey wearing a bulletproof vest to demonstrate the trajectories of objects in free fall. He rides a fire-extinguisher-propelled tricycle across his classroom to show how a rocket lifts off. He was No. 1 on the most downloaded list at iTunes U for a while, but that lineup constantly evolves. The stars this week included Hubert Dreyfus, a philosophy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and Leonard Susskind, a professor of quantum mechanics at Stanford. Last week, Yale put some of its most popular undergraduate courses and professors online free. The list includes Controversies in Astrophysics with Charles Bailyn, Modern Poetry with Langdon Hammer and Introduction to the Old Testament with Christine Hayes. M.I.T. recently expanded its online classes by opening a site aimed at high school students and teachers. Judging from his fan e-mail, Professor Lewin, who is among those featured on the new site, appeals to students of all ages. Some of his correspondents compare him to Richard Feynman, the free-spirited, bongo-playing Nobel laureate who popularized physics through his books, lectures and television appearances. With his wiry grayish-brown hair, his tortoiseshell glasses and his intensity, Professor Lewin is the iconic brilliant scientist. But like Julia Child, he is at once larger than life and totally accessible. “We have here the mother of all pendulums!” he declares, hoisting his 6-foot-2, 170-pound self on a 30-pound steel ball attached to a pendulum hanging from the ceiling. He swings across the stage, holding himself nearly horizontal as his hair blows in the breeze he created. The point: that a period of a pendulum is independent of the mass  the steel ball, plus one professor  hanging from it. “Physics works!” Professor Lewin shouts, as the classroom explodes in cheers. “Hi, Prof. Lewin!!” a fan who identified himself as a 17-year-old from China wrote. “I love your inspiring lectures and I love MIT!!!” A fan who said he was a physics teacher from Iraq gushed: “You are now my Scientific Father. In spite of the bad occupation and war against my lovely IRAQ, you made me love USA because you are there and MIT is there.” Professor Lewin revels in his fan mail and in the idea that he is spreading the love of physics. “Teaching is my life,” he said. The professor, who is from the Netherlands, said that teaching a required course in introductory physics to M.I.T. students made him realize “that what really counts is to make them love physics, to make them love science.” He said he spent 25 hours preparing each new lecture, choreographing every detail and stripping out every extra sentence. “Clarity is the word,” he said. Fun also matters. In another lecture on pendulums, he stands back against the wall, holding a steel ball at the end of a pendulum just beneath his chin. He has just demonstrated how potential energy turns into kinetic energy by sending the ball flying across the stage, shattering a pane of glass he had bolted to the wall. Now he will demonstrate the conservation of energy. “I am such a strong believer in the conservation of energy that I am willing to risk my life for it,” he says. “If I am wrong, then this will be my last lecture.” He closes his eyes, and releases the ball. It flies back and forth, stopping just short of his chin. “Physics works!” Professor Lewin shouts. “And I’m still alive!” Chasing rainbows hooked Mr. Boigon, the San Diego florist. He was vacationing in Hawaii when he noticed the rainbow outside his hotel every afternoon. Why were the colors always in the same order? When he returned home, Mr. Boigon said in a telephone interview, he Googled rainbows. Within moments, he was whisked to M.I.T. Lecture Hall No. 26-100. Professor Lewin was in front of a few hundred students. “All of you have looked at rainbows,” he begins. “But very few of you have ever seen one. Seeing is different than looking. Today we are going to see a rainbow.” For 50 minutes, he bounds across the stage, writing equations on the blackboard and rhapsodizing about the “amazing” and “beautiful” physics of rainbows. He explains how the colors always appear in the same order because of how light refracts and reflects in the water droplets. For the finale, he creates a rainbow by shining a bright light into a glass sphere containing a single drop of water. “There it is!” Professor Lewin cries. “Your life will never be the same,” he tells his students. “Because of your knowledge, you will be able to see way more than just the beauty of the bows that everyone else can see.” “Professor Lewin was correct,” Mr. Boigon wrote in an e-mail message to a reporter. “He made me SEE ... and it has changed my life for the better!!” “I had never taken a course in physics, or calculus, or differential equations,” he wrote to Professor Lewin. “Now I have done all that in order to be able to follow your lectures. I knew the name Isaac Newton, but nothing about Newtonian Mechanics. I had heard of the likes of Einstein, Galileo.” But, he added that he “didn’t have a clue on earth as to what they were all about.” “I walk down the street analyzing the force of a boy on skateboard or the recoil of a carpenter using a nail gun,” he wrote. “Thank you with all my heart.” ||||| Walter Lewin, a retired MIT physicist and professor whose dynamic classroom antics and dramatic teaching style are legendary on campus and online, sexually harassed at least one student who enrolled in an online course he taught, according to an MIT investigation that was revealed today. The university is removing Lewin’s teaching material hosted on MIT’s online education platforms, including those on MITx, edX and OpenCourseware. According to MIT, the decision caps off a probe by the physics department into Lewin’s relationship with at least one student who enrolled in one of Lewin’s MITx online courses. She registered a complaint claiming harassment and also told MIT about instances of inappropriate behavior with other women. In a release describing the decision, the institute announced that: “Based on its investigation, MIT has determined that Lewin’s behavior toward the complainant violated the Institute’s policy on sexual harassment. Following broad consultation among faculty, MIT is indefinitely removing Lewin’s online courses, in the interest of preventing any further inappropriate behavior.” MIT did not reveal the name of the student, and the initial announcement did not clarify if investigations into Lewin’s relationship with more than one student were conducted. One in six female undergraduates living on campus reported being assaulted at MIT, according to an anonymous survey published earlier this year. Following this report, and a personal story published by a student this spring, MIT pledged to better address incidents and complaints of harassment.

MIT’s action comes in response to a complaint it received in October from a woman, who is an online MITx learner, claiming online sexual harassment by Lewin. She provided information about Lewin’s interactions with her, which began when she was a learner in one of his MITx courses, as well as information about interactions between Lewin and other women online learners. MIT immediately began an investigation, and as a precaution instructed Lewin not to contact any MIT students or online learners, either current or former. The investigation followed MIT protocol for complaints of sexual harassment. The head of the physics department, Professor Peter Fisher, ensured an objective and timely review, which included a review of detailed materials provided by the complainant and interviews of her and Lewin. Based on its investigation, MIT has determined that Lewin’s behavior toward the complainant violated the Institute’s policy on sexual harassment. Following broad consultation among faculty, MIT is indefinitely removing Lewin’s online courses, in the interest of preventing any further inappropriate behavior. MIT President L. Rafael Reif says, “Students place tremendous trust in their teachers. Deserving that trust is among our most fundamental obligations. We must take the greatest care that everyone who comes to us for knowledge and instruction, whether in classrooms or online, can count on MIT as a safe and respectful place to learn.” At the time MIT received the complaint, Lewin was not teaching any courses, either on campus or interactively online. Lewin retired from MIT in July 2009 and last taught a course on campus in spring 2008. He last taught an online MITx course in fall 2013. Provost Martin Schmidt says, “Dr. Lewin had a long and distinguished career at MIT, and it is painful to learn of the behavior that necessitated this action. However, complaints of harassment must be met immediately and squarely in all cases. Today’s decision was made in consultation with faculty leadership both in the physics department and across MIT more broadly.” The following information describes resources available to those who wish to discuss or report sexual misconduct at MIT.

The woman was taking one of Lewin’s classes on edX, the online learning platform started by Harvard and MIT. MIT said Monday that it had launched an investigation immediately after she filed a complaint in October. MIT officials reviewed “detailed materials” provided by the complainant, who also presented “information about interactions between Lewin and other women online learners,” according to Monday’s announcement. The investigation also included interviews with the complainant and Lewin. MIT has revoked his title as professor emeritus, Provost Martin A. Schmidt PhD ’88 said. MIT is also removing Lewin’s lecture videos and other course materials from edX and MIT OpenCourseWare indefinitely, “in the interest of preventing any further inappropriate behavior.” Schmidt said that MIT’s actions were “part of a process of a complete separation from Walter,” though he also said those actions were “probably the extent of it” given that Lewin had retired. “Given Dr. Lewin’s long career on our campus and contributions as an educator, taking this step is painful,” Schmidt wrote to MIT’s faculty. “However, based on my careful review of the findings of the investigation and my conversations with the Physics Department leadership, School Deans, and other faculty leaders, I believe that harassment occurred, that our response is appropriate, and that explaining this matter publicly is necessary.” Schmidt declined to comment on whether MIT would also investigate Lewin’s past at MIT. Lewin joined MIT in 1966 and became a full professor in 1974. In the decades that followed he collected award after award for his undergraduate teaching. Through OpenCourseWare and YouTube, Lewin’s lectures and physics demonstrations have reached millions. “Professor Lewin delivers his lectures with the panache of Julia Child bringing French cooking to amateurs and the zany theatricality of YouTube’s greatest hits,” The New York Times wrote in 2007. “With his wiry grayish-brown hair, his tortoiseshell glasses and his intensity, Professor Lewin is the iconic brilliant scientist … he is at once larger than life and totally accessible.” Lewin went on to star in viral videos of him drawing dotted lines on blackboards and swinging on steel balls suspended from the ceiling. And then in 2013, Lewin helped launch online versions of his classes on edX. Among those who enrolled: the woman who would lodge the sexual harassment complaint this past October. By Monday evening, at least some of Lewin’s classes had been taken down from edX, MIT OpenCourseWare, and MIT OpenCourseWare’s Youtube channel. MIT is keeping some of Lewin’s lecture videos available on ocw2.mit.edu until the end of the semester. “We realize that some of you may have been using some materials from the OCW versions of the course as you prepare for your exams,” physics department administrators wrote in an email to students in an introductory physics class. “Students place tremendous trust in their teachers,” MIT President L. Rafael Reif said in a statement. “Deserving that trust is among our most fundamental obligations. We must take the greatest care that everyone who comes to us for knowledge and instruction, whether in classrooms or online, can count on MIT as a safe and respectful place to learn.” ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Walter H.

Auringonpimennys Translate to English English:","completion":"Solar Eclipse A solar eclipse is an astronomical phenomenon that occurs when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth, casting a shadow that either partially or fully blocks the sun's light from reaching Earth. This blocking of the sun's light can be observed from particular areas, creating a spectacular event for skywatchers. There are three main types of solar eclipses: total, partial, and annular. In a total solar eclipse, the moon completely covers the sun's disk, leaving only the outer bright ring, or the corona, visible. This type of eclipse is the most dramatic and provides awe-inspiring views to those in the direct path of its totality. A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon only partially covers the sun, and spectators can witness the moon taking a small \\"bite\\" out of the sun's disk. A partial solar eclipse can be observed from a much larger area than a total solar eclipse but is not as visually impressive. An annular solar eclipse happens when the moon is at its farthest point from the Earth in its orbit, making it appear smaller in the sky. In this case, the moon does not entirely cover the sun's disk, and as a result, an outer ring of the sun's light remains visible, creating a \\"ring of fire\\" effect. This phenomenon is just as rare as a total solar eclipse and can be considered an exciting event for astronomy enthusiasts. Solar eclipses are not only fascinating events, enjoyed by skywatchers and photographers, but they are also essential for scientific research. They provide a unique opportunity to study the sun's corona and the effect of solar radiation on Earth's atmosphere. Furthermore, solar eclipses have historically represented significant cultural, religious, and mythological significance for various civilizations. To safely observe a solar eclipse, special precautions must be taken, as looking directly at the sun without proper eye protection can cause severe and permanent eye damage. Using solar filters or eclipse glasses that meet international safety standards is essential for direct observation of the sun during a solar eclipse. In conclusion, a solar eclipse is an astronomical phenomenon that captivates and intrigues people around the world, sparking curiosity and interest in the amazing workings of our solar system. With proper preparation and safety measures, witnessing this spectacular event can be an unforgettable experience that brings communities together in awe and appreciation of the universe's wonders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A man can have an experience of what it's like to be a woman.\\" During the experiment, a \\"female\\" approached and hit the face of the character another man was playing. \\"Their reaction was immediate,\\" said Slate. \\"They would take in a quick breath and maybeflinch . The more people reported being in the girl's body, the stronger physical reaction they had.\\" But in all cases, the feeling was temporary and lasted only as long as the study.

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

Solve this problem.","completion":"This problem involves isolating 'm' on one side of the equation in order to solve for it. Here are the steps to do this: 1. First simplify the equation on the left hand side by subtracting 637 from -3749. -3749 - 637 = -4386 The equation now is: -4386 = -175m - 186 2. Now, I will eliminate '-186' from the right side by adding '186' to both sides of the equation. Adding a number to both sides of an equation does not change solution of the equation, it just simplifies it: -4386 + 186 = -4200 The equation now is: -4200 = -175m 3. The last step is to isolate the 'm', so we need to divide both sides of the equation by -175. When dividing by a number on both sides of an equation, it will not change the solution but it allows us to solve for the variable: -4200 / -175 = 24 So after completing above steps, solution of the equation for 'm' is: m = 24"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was a cold, dreary Monday morning when she first picked up the new cream - SoluFix - from her local pharmacy. The packaging was sleek, and the tagline read, \\"Maximum hold for minimum hassle.\\" With high hopes, she waited for the opportune moment to test out the new adhesive. Once she got home, she went straight to the bathroom, eager to give SoluFix a try. The instructions on the package claimed that it was a simple three-step process. First, apply a small amount of cream to the dentures. Second, spread it evenly across the surface. And finally, hold dentures in place for five seconds, and voila! A secure fit that would supposedly last all day. She carefully squeezed a bead of cream onto her dentures, admiring the product's silky texture. Using her denture brush, she spread it across the surface, making sure to cover every nook and cranny. With a deep breath, she held the top denture in place, counting silently to five. To her delight, it felt secure. She repeated the process for her bottom denture, and was soon admiring her smile in the mirror. Everything felt great – it was time for the real test. Later that day, she joined her friends for their weekly book club discussion. Sarah, Beatrice, and Evelyn, dear friends for decades, greeted her warmly as she entered Sarah's cozy living room. Buttery rays of sunlight escaping the heavy clouds cast a soft glow across the plump cushions and comfortable armchairs. As they discussed the latest novel they'd read, she found herself laughing and chattering with a newfound confidence. There were no slips, no awkward adjustments, and best of all, no lingering unease about that unpleasant taste from the old tablets. Post-discussion, they decided to indulge in their traditional afternoon tea—a kettle filled with Sarah's unique blend of citrus and black tea, delicate sandwiches with thinly sliced cucumber and savory ham, and mouthwatering scones with clotted cream and raspberry jam. With each bite, she remained astounded by how comfortable and secure her dentures felt. And the flavors! Oh, how she relished not having that constant interference from the tablets. It was as if she had been granted a new lease on life. The hours passed, filled with laughter, gossip, and lively conversation. As she prepared to leave, she couldn't help but mention her new discovery to her friends. Soon enough, they were all crowded around her, excitedly asking about SoluFix - where could they get it, and would it work for them too? She was more than happy to share her newfound wisdom and pass on the tips she'd learned. As she walked back to her home that evening, a satisfied smile graced her lips. Not only was she leaving her friends with a precious recommendation, but she herself had gained something quite meaningful: a renewed confidence and a rekindled love for the simple pleasures in life. From then on, she vowed to embrace new experiences with open arms, for there was always a chance for unexpected happiness, as she had so clearly discovered today.

There are several reasons that support this interpretation. Firstly, the use of the word \\"deserves\\" indicates that there is a level of appreciation and recognition of the subject's merit. This term suggests that the subject possesses qualities that warrant acknowledgment or praise, exhibiting a positive assessment of its value or performance. As a result, the person who utters this phrase believes that the subject has earned or justified the recommendation. Secondly, the word \\"recommendation\\" itself implies that the subject has qualities that make it worthy of being suggested to others. A recommendation generally carries an endorsement or approval and is intended to offer guidance. When something or someone is recommended, it usually means they have met or surpassed certain expectations or standards that are acknowledged as positive. Recommending something to others is usually an act of sharing something valuable, useful, or enjoyable, further underlining the positive sentiment. Lastly, it's important to consider the context in which this phrase is used. It might be a recommendation of a book, movie, product, service, or just about anything else where a person's opinion has value. The very fact that someone is expressing a desire to recommend the subject affirms its worth, usefulness, or appeal. This positive assessment is a statement of confidence and affirmation, reiterating the overall positive sentiment of the sentence. In summary, the sentiment of the sentence \\"that deserves recommendation\\" would generally be perceived as positive, given the recognition of merit, the endorsement implied by the act of recommending, and the context in which the phrase is used. This positive evaluation reflects the speaker's or writer's belief that the subject is worthy of sharing with others and should be acknowledged for its qualities and/or performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Domestic violence survivors in Jackson, Vicksburg, Hattiesburg, Oxford and Pascagoula can all get help. Julia Crockett, deputy director of Central Southwest Mississippi Legal Services Corp., said the program expects to help nearly 1,000 domestic violence victims. Crockett said legal help gives domestic abuse survivors a way to rebuild their lives. \\"They have been made to feel by the abuser that no one is going to help them do anything, so when they come to us they are desperate,\\" she said. \\"Those who need legal help and don't get it feel totally lost. Because then they feel like they are forced to stay in that situation.\\" Crockett said the program, funded by a 300,000 grant from the U.S. Justice Department, has no economic restrictions on who can get help. Legal services typically helps the poor. Gladys Bunzy, who said she was in an abusive relationship with a boyfriend for eight years, said such a program is long overdue and could be a lifeline for those escaping violent relationships. \\"When I finally made up my mind to leave, I had a restraining order put against him and that was 50 but that was 50 well spent to me,\\" said Bunzy, 40. \\"For people who can't afford it, this will be a godsend ... If a woman knows she is going to get some help that will be a burden off her mind, if the law will help her keep that person away from her.\\" Gwen Bouie-Haynes, project director of the Domestic Violence Services Center for Catholic Charities Inc., said often domestic violence survivors do not have the money to seek legal representation. \\"Legal assistance is a major issue for women fleeing a domestic violence situation,\\" she said. \\"Often times women are in need of immediate legal assistance services for the protection of the mother and the child. To get a protective order you need to be represented by an attorney.\\" Crockett said the pilot program was launched in 1998 at the Haven House Family Shelter Inc., a domestic violence shelter for women and children in Vicksburg.

What is the answer?","completion":"In UK TV's 'Noel Edmonds' House Party', the 'house' was situated near the village of Crinkley Bottom. Noel Edmonds' House Party was a popular British light entertainment television programme which aired on BBC1 from 1991 to 1998. The show was hosted by Noel Edmonds, a versatile and famous television presenter in the United Kingdom. The program was set in a large fictional house called \\"The Great House\\", which was supposedly located in the equally fictitious village of Crinkley Bottom. The house and village were supposedly based on the real-life village of Bishops Tawton in Devon, England. Edmonds would welcome and entertain various celebrity guests during the show, and the setting allowed for a variety of games, comedy sketches, and surprising events. One of the most recognizable elements of the show was the character \\"Mr. Blobby\\", who became a popular figure in British pop culture. In addition to serving as the location for the television show, the fictional village of Crinkley Bottom also lent its name to several related ventures, including a series of theme parks that opened in the 1990s – \\"Crinkley Bottom Parks\\". These parks were developed in partnership with Noel Edmonds and featured attractions inspired by the TV show, such as Mr. Blobby's house and other interactive experiences. Unfortunately, the theme parks did not fare well and closed down due to various financial and operational issues. Overall, the village of Crinkley Bottom and its associations with Noel Edmonds' House Party serve as an iconic part of British television history and a unique example of how a TV show's setting can have a lasting impact on public imagination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

How to open a bar Know that being in the bar business entails stiff competition. You'll be competing with other bars in the area, as well as other entertainment and retail options. It used to be that when people wanted a drink, they had to go to a bar to get it.","completion":"Step 1: Conduct a Market Research The first thing you need to do before opening a bar is to conduct a comprehensive market research. This step is crucial because it will provide you with more insight about your potential customers and competitors. Through market research, you can identify the types of bars that already exist in your intended area, the kind of services they offer, their prices, opening hours, and even their target audience. Justification: By understanding the market, you can identify gaps that your bar might fill, thus giving you a competitive advantage. For example, you can be more creative and invent a new \\"bar concept\\" that doesn't exist yet in your area. Step 2: Create a Business Plan After conducting your market research, the next step is to create a business plan. This document will outline your bar's vision, mission, marketing strategy, financing options, and staffing requirements, among other things. Justification: A business plan can act as a roadmap for your business. It helps you to anticipate potential challenges and come up with strategies to overcome them. Additionally, if you intend to seek financial support from investors or banks, they will definitely want to see a solid business plan. Step 3: Secure Necessary Licenses and Permits In order to operate a bar, you need to secure the necessary licenses and permits. This can include liquor licenses, health permits, building permits, and others, depending on your local government's regulations. Justification: Licenses and permits ensure that your bar operates within the law. Not having the necessary permits could lead to closures, hefty fines, or legal issues. Step 4: Choose a Suitable Location Choose the location for your bar carefully. Consider factors like accessibility, visibility, foot traffic, and proximity to competitors. Justification: The location of your bar could significantly affect its success. A bar that's conveniently located and easily accessible is more likely to attract customers than one that's situated in a hard-to-reach area. Step 5: Design Your Bar After deciding on the location, the next step is to design your bar to suit the atmosphere and clientele you want to attract. Justification: The design of the bar not only contributes to its overall aesthetic but it can also affect the functionality of the space, so it’s important to put some thought into this step. Step 6: Hire Staff Hire an efficient and friendly staff who will serve and interact with your customers. Justification: Staff are incredibly important in the bar industry. They represent your business to the customers. Their skills, attitude, and efficiency can greatly affect the overall experience of your customers. Step 7: Create an Attractive Menu Create an attractive and competitive menu. This can be a combination of drinks, cocktails, and possibly food items, depending on your chosen bar concept. Justification: The menu is one of the main attractions of your bar. A well-crafted menu can intrigue and entice customers into trying out your offerings. Step 8: Market Your Bar Marketing your bar through various media channels can help increase visibility and attract more customers. Justification: Even if you have a well-designed bar, good service, and an interesting menu, it's useless if people don't know about your bar. Effective marketing can significantly increase your customer base. Step 9: Grand Opening Finally, plan for a grand opening event. This event should be designed to create a buzz and attract as many people as possible to your bar. Justification: A grand opening event can help you attract a large number of customers in a short period of time. Additionally, it creates a sense of excitement and anticipation about your new bar. Each of these steps is important in its own way and contributes to the success of your bar venture. It's a lot of work, but with proper planning and execution, opening a bar can be a highly rewarding experience."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Q:I have a new situation: Tree city and Leaf city were the two biggest cities in Boulderland. Tree city burned lots of gas and other fossil fuels, while Leaf city was very protective towards its environment. But I can use this background: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment. What is an answer for this question: Which city exposed fewer people to asthma? A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, Leaf City exposed fewer people to asthma. Step 1: Understand the context – Tree City burned a lot of fossil fuels, while Leaf City was protective of its environment. Air pollution is harmful and increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma. Step 2: Connection between pollution and asthma - Air pollution is a primary factor in developing and exacerbating asthma-related issues. Tree city burns gas and other fossil fuels, resulting in increased air pollution, while Leaf City is environmentally conscious, presumably reducing pollution.

It's like eating plain toast with no butter or jam, not yummy! The story was really slow, just like a sleepy snail taking a nap. The characters were not interesting, and it was hard to like them or care about what they do. They didn't make us laugh, smile or feel any excitement. The movie was also way too long, like having to play the same game for days without changing. The colors and drawings in the movie weren't pretty or fun either. It looked like a super cloudy day with no rainbow at the end. Honestly, my little friends, this movie is not worth our playtime. Let's skip it and watch something more fun. II.

When teaching a dog a command you need to come up with a verbal trigger. This should be a word or sound that indicates to the dog what you would like it to do.","completion":"Based on the text provided, the sentence \\"to get your dog to pee on command say a different word every time\\" is false. According to the text, when teaching a dog a command, you should choose a specific trigger word or phrase to use consistently. Consistency is crucial when training a dog to follow a command, as it helps them understand the desired action through repetition and reinforcement. The text advises using a word or sound that indicates to the dog what you want it to do, and using the same trigger consistently so that the dog can better associate the word or sound with the desired action. If you were to use a different word every time, your dog would likely become confused and have difficulty learning the command. Effective dog training relies on clear communication and consistency in order to establish a strong association between the command and the desired action.

How do you do this: DIY lotion bars with cocoa butters and waxes using molds after melting","completion":"Making DIY lotion bars with cocoa butters and waxes is a fun, creative, and budget-friendly way to pamper your skin. By using molds for shaping the lotion bars, you can add a personal touch to your creation. These bars are great for gifting to friends and family or simply as an indulgence for yourself. Here's a detailed and long step-by-step guide to making DIY lotion bars with cocoa butter, waxes, and using molds after melting: Materials and Ingredients: - 1 cup cocoa butter - 1 cup beeswax or any natural wax (like soy or candelilla wax for a vegan option) - 1 cup coconut oil or another carrier oil of your choice (such as almond, olive, or apricot kernel oil) - Essential oils or fragrance oils for scent (optional) - Molds (silicone or plastic, in the shape of your preference) - Double boiler or microwave-safe bowl - Spoon or spatula for stirring - Measuring cups and spoons - Wax or parchment paper - Storage container or baggies Step 1: Prepare the Molds Before melting the ingredients, prepare your molds by placing them on a flat surface lined with wax or parchment paper. This will help catch any spillage and make it easier to unmold your lotion bars. Step 2: Measure the Ingredients Using measuring cups and spoons, measure out your cocoa butter, natural wax, and coconut or other carrier oil. It's important to use equal parts of the ingredients to ensure a solid yet moisturizing final product. Step 3: Melt the Ingredients There are two ways to melt the ingredients: using a double boiler or the microwave. A. Double boiler method: Add the cocoa butter, wax, and carrier oil to the upper part of a double boiler or a heat-safe bowl that sits on top of a pot filled with water. Heat the water in the pot to a gentle simmer and let the ingredients melt together. Stir occasionally with a spoon or a spatula to combine the ingredients. B. Microwave method: In a microwave-safe bowl, add the cocoa butter, wax, and carrier oil. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval until everything is melted and combined. Step 4: Add the Essential Oils or Fragrance Oils (Optional) If you wish to add scent to your lotion bars, carefully mix in a few drops of your chosen essential oils or fragrance oils into the melted mixture. Be sure to start with just a few drops, testing the scent intensity before adding more, as essential oils can be potent. Step 5: Pour Mixture into Molds Slowly pour the melted lotion bar mixture into the molds. Be cautious, as the mixture may be hot. If your mold has intricate designs, make sure to pour the mixture carefully to ensure it reaches all crevices. Step 6: Allow Bars to Solidify Let the lotion bars cool and solidify at room temperature for several hours or overnight. To speed up the process, you can place the molds in the refrigerator. However, do not use the freezer, as it may cause the bars to crack. Step 7: Unmold and Store Lotion Bars Once the bars are solid, gently pop them out of the molds. If you used silicone molds, it should be easy to remove. If necessary, use a knife to carefully loosen the edges. Store the lotion bars in an airtight container or a resealable baggie at room temperature. To use your DIY lotion bars, simply rub them between your hands or directly onto your skin. The natural warmth of your skin will melt the bars, providing a soothing and moisturizing experience. Enjoy your handmade skincare creations!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of john cooper godbold . The answer to this question is:","completion":"John Cooper Godbold was born on March 4, 1920, in Coy, Alabama. He was a prominent legal figure during his life, earning an impressive education and working in several high-ranking positions within the United States judiciary. Godbold's educational background included a Bachelor of Science degree from Auburn University and a Juris Doctor degree from the prestigious Harvard Law School. Godbold's career as a judge was remarkable and marked with significant milestones. His journey began when he was appointed as a Judge at the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit by Lyndon B. Johnson on July 22, 1966. The Fifth Circuit had jurisdiction over several states, including Alabama, where Godbold held his position for many years. During his tenure, Godbold's role evolved as the United States judicial system underwent changes. On October 1, 1981, when the Eleventh Circuit was established pursuant to an operation of law, Godbold was reassigned from the Fifth Circuit by President Lyndon B. Johnson. This change marked a new chapter in his career, as he became the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Notably, Godbold was a trailblazer in the field, holding the prestigious title of Chief Judge in both the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits - an impressive accomplishment that speaks to his legal expertise and leadership abilities. As his long career progressed, John Cooper Godbold took on two additional positions. On October 23, 1987, he began his role as a Senior Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Subsequent to this, in 1986, Godbold was appointed as the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals under the term end of December 1981, where he served until September 30, 1981, before dedicating his later years as a Senior Judge in the Eleventh Circuit until his retirement in 2009. John Cooper Godbold's impressive career demonstrates his immense dedication to the American legal system and his unwavering commitment to justice. Unfortunately, Godbold passed away on December 22, 2009, in Montgomery, Alabama. However, his legacy as an accomplished judge and a trailblazer in the American judiciary system continues to serve as a source of inspiration for present and future legal professionals."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Summarize this article: People adopt different diets or eating styles for a variety of reasons. Your ultimate, long-term goal will help you choose which diet plan is the best for you. Some goals may include: Weight Loss Managing high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol Supporting increased fitness levels Becoming more environmentally conscious Improving your general health or wellness If you've tried other diets or eating patterns, try to remember how they worked for you, what you liked or didn't like about them and whether you felt they were a good fit for your lifestyle. For example, if you tried following a vegetarian diet, but missed eating meat. Or if you tried a low carb diet, but it made you feel foggy and tired throughout the day. If a diet didn't work well in the past, you may want to consider other options. Sticking to a diet plan takes more than willpower. It truly has to be a plan you can stick with long-term. Each diet or eating plan may come with a cost. You might need to pay for pre-made foods, protein shakes or vitamin and mineral supplements. But there are also many diets that require little to no extra costs. Choose a diet plan that will fit easily within your budget so that you don't have to discontinue your new eating pattern due to high costs. Take advantage of \\"sign-up offers\\" or promotional rates when you can. This may help you save a little money on some of the more popular dieting programs. Some diet plans require you to prep all your meals and snacks from scratch, some may be completely web and internet-based and others may require in person group or individual meetings. Will these types of activities fit with your current lifestyle? Think about how that may change or need to change for you to be successful on your new dieting plan. If you have to change your lifestyle too drastically, the diet plan may be difficult to stick to long-term. Some diet plans require time spent cooking while others do the meal prep for you. If cooking is something you don't typically enjoy doing, think about a diet plan that involves meal replacements like protein shakes, bars or pre-made meals. Make sure to consider your social life as well. If you love going out to eat or going to the occasional happy hour, you'll want a plan that gives you flexibility to enjoy those activities. Also consider things like food allergies or sensitivities and cultural or religious diet restrictions. Many diets are very general and may not account for things like these. Physical activity is an important part to any healthy lifestyle. Plan on including both cardio and strength training exercises each week. These types of physical activity can help boost your weight loss and help you maintain your goal weight long-term. In addition, exercise may help improve your mood, improve your sleeping habits, manage high blood pressure or diabetes and improve cardiovascular fitness. If you're new to fitness, try speaking with a personal trainer at your local gym or meeting with an exercise specialist. These professionals will be able to guide you to a fitness program that's appropriate for you. See if there are any group classes for beginners at your local gym. This is a great way to get started and get support from people starting out just like you. Speak to your doctor about your current health, any medical conditions you may have and what medications you're currently taking. They may be able to give you insight on what type of diet or eating pattern is the most appropriate for you and your health. They may also advise you on what diets to avoid. Many doctors also provide an in-house diet and nutrition program for patients. It generally will include direct follow up with your physician along with regular weight monitoring. Doctors can provide you with a referral to a registered dietitian that can educate you and help design your own personalized diet plan. In addition, doctors will be able to guide you through medical weight loss. This is where a physician would prescribe a medication to help suppress your appetite, making it easier for you to follow a diet plan. Not all weight loss medications are appropriate for all people. Check with your doctor for more information. Summary:","completion":"The article highlights the importance of choosing the right diet or eating plan based on one's individual goals, budget, lifestyle and preferences. Goals may include weight loss, managing health conditions, improving fitness levels, being environmentally conscious or enhancing general health and wellness.

Physical activity, including a combination of cardio and strength training exercises, can support weight loss goals and improve overall health. It is advisable to consult a personal trainer, exercise specialist or join group classes for beginners to develop a suitable fitness program. Additionally, it is vital to involve a physician or dietitian to assess one's current health, medical conditions, and medications, potentially receiving guidance on suitable diets or even medically assisted weight loss. Ultimately, it is crucial to consider various factors when choosing a diet plan, and consulting professionals can help ensure that the chosen plan is both effective and sustainable in the long-term."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Where could you find a jellyfish? - hand - mediterranean sea - see - supermarket - store The best answer is The answer to this question is:","completion":"Jellyfish can be found in various locations, depending on the type of jellyfish and the context in which you want to find them. Here is a detailed explanation of each option mentioned: 1. Hand: This is an unlikely place to find a jellyfish, as they are marine creatures and do not typically come into contact with human hands, unless someone has picked one up or accidentally been stung by one at the beach. However, it is important to note that handling jellyfish can be dangerous, as some species possess venomous stinging cells that can cause painful reactions or even serious injuries. 2. Mediterranean Sea: This is a common place to find jellyfish, as they are widespread in this region, particularly during the summer months. There are several jellyfish species native to the Mediterranean Sea, including the mauve stinger (Pelagia noctiluca), the fried egg jellyfish (Cotylorhiza tuberculata), and the barrel jellyfish (Rhizostoma pulmo). As a popular tourist destination, the Mediterranean coastline sees many incidents of jellyfish stings each year. 3. See: This term is unclear in the context of the question, as \\"see\\" may be a typographical error or refer to the act of visually observing jellyfish. If the term was intended as \\"sea,\\" then naturally, the sea is a common place to find jellyfish in their natural habitat. These creatures have a global distribution and can be found in every ocean, from warm tropical waters to the colder polar regions. 4. Supermarket: This is an unconventional location to find a jellyfish, but it is possible in certain situations. In some Asian countries, like Japan and China, jellyfish are considered a delicacy and can be found for sale in supermarkets or specialty food stores. They are typically sold dried or preserved in salt and require rehydration and preparation before being consumed. 5. Store: If you are referring to a store that sells marine life or aquarium supplies, it is possible to find jellyfish, particularly the non-stinging moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita), available for purchase as pets for home aquariums. Some specialized pet stores or online retailers offer live jellyfish, as well as special tanks and equipment designed for keeping these delicate creatures in captivity. In summary, the best answer for finding a jellyfish can vary depending on what you seek. If you are looking for jellyfish in their natural habitat, the Mediterranean Sea is an accurate choice, considering that jellyfish are abundant in this region. If you are interested in observing or purchasing jellyfish for culinary purposes or as pets, supermarkets and specialty stores respectively may be appropriate options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an email with the subject line \\"Letters of Credit; Preference; Swap Transactions\\".","completion":"Subject: Letters of Credit; Preference; Swap Transactions Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss with you some important financial instruments that are crucial in international trade and financing, namely Letters of Credit (LCs), Preference Shares, and Swap Transactions. These tools, when utilized properly, can provide significant benefits to businesses and individuals involved in international transactions and investments. Firstly, let us discuss Letters of Credit (LCs). LCs are essential financial instruments used in international trade, providing security to the buyer and the seller. The buyer's bank issues an LC, guaranteeing payment to the seller upon presenting specified documents proving the fulfillment of the sales contract. This provides an additional layer of comfort to both parties, and mitigates the risks associated with exchanging goods and services with unfamiliar parties from different legal jurisdictions. Key advantages of using LCs include: 1. Reduced risk of non-payment: The buyer's bank provides a guarantee that the seller will receive payment as long as all specified conditions are met. 2. Improved cash flow: Sellers can obtain financing from their bank against the LC, which helps maintain a steady cash flow. 3. Enhanced credibility: LCs demonstrate the creditworthiness of the buyer, making it more appealing to potential suppliers. Preference Shares, on the other hand, are a type of hybrid capital security that combines elements of both debt and equity financing. Investors holding preference shares receive dividends before common shareholders, making these shares more appealing as an investment option. Additionally, preference shares typically have a fixed dividend rate, which provides a sense of stability for investors. Some benefits of Preference Shares include: 1. Stability in income: Preference shareholders receive fixed, regular dividend payments, offering a consistent income stream. 2. Priority in payment: Preference shareholders receive dividend payments before common shareholders, providing an additional layer of protection. 3. Opportunity for capital appreciation: The market value of preference shares may increase over time, offering the potential for capital gains. Lastly, Swap Transactions are contractual agreements between two parties to exchange cash flows or other financial variables over a specified period. Interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and commodity swaps are common types of Swap Transactions. These agreements help businesses hedge against fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices. Key benefits of Swap Transactions include: 1. Risk management: Swap Transactions can effectively manage exposures to fluctuating market variables, securing more stable cash flows. 2. Potential cost savings: Companies can potentially obtain more favorable interest rates or exchange rates through Swap Transactions. 3. Customization: Swap Transactions can be tailored to meet the unique needs and risk appetite of the parties involved. I hope this overview of Letters of Credit, Preference Shares, and Swap Transactions proves useful as you continue to navigate the complexities of international trade and financing. Should you have any questions or require further clarification on these or other financial instruments, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Sandler is so genuinely funny and likeable, and his chemistry with Aniston is so charming that it's a terrible shame he doesn't put more thought into these movies. 3. Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston's romantic comedy, idiotic even by their usually low big-screen standards, is stuffed with unpleasant narcissists saying and doing the stupidest, often cruelest things in hope of cheap laughs. 4. Dugan has trouble keeping all of the film's plates in the air, and he seems not to have noticed Decker is the opposite of funny. 5. Frank Capra would puke. 6. Adam Sandler is back in the game! 7.

What is the consensus?","completion":"The provided statements primarily offer negative criticism about the film in question. Most of the reviewers critique the humor as either non-existent or in poor taste, stating that it relies on cruel and stupid behavior for cheap laughs. The overall narrative and premise of the movie was also called into question as fundamentally flawed or unappealing. That being said, there are some positive remarks regarding the chemistry between Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston, with one reviewer even suggesting that Sandler is \\"back in the game.\\" Nonetheless, these compliments are accompanied by disappointment towards the lack of thought put into the movie or overshadowed by negative comments on the rest of the cast. Considering all this information, the consensus is largely negative. The movie seems to have been received poorly by the commentators due to its perceived lack of quality content, humor, and plot coherence, despite some appreciated performances by its main actors."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Where can a talking bee be found?

Sentence 2: After nearly 300 years, political power returned to Edinburgh. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Yes, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is also true. Both sentences communicate the same essential information: that political power has returned to Edinburgh after a period of nearly 300 years. The difference lies in their phrasing and structure. Sentence 1 begins by emphasizing the result first, which is the return of political power to Edinburgh. \\"Political power thus returned to Edinburgh after nearly 300 years\\" highlights the causal relationship between a certain sequence of events and their outcome, which is the return of political power to Edinburgh. The use of \\"thus\\" implies a connection with prior information that may have explained how this development came to be. On the other hand, sentence 2 offers a more direct statement of the same information. \\"After nearly 300 years, political power returned to Edinburgh\\" shifts the focus to the time it took for political power to return to Edinburgh. This arrangement emphasizes the duration of time that has passed before political power was restored. In conclusion, if the information contained in the first sentence is true, then the second sentence, which conveys the same message with a different structure, will also be considered true. Both sentences essentially state that political power has returned to Edinburgh after an absence of nearly 300 years, which allows us to confirm the consistency of the facts represented in both sentences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Rocker Ted Nugent has reportedly apologized for calling President Barack Obama a \\"subhuman mongrel,\\" according to the Ben Ferguson Show and CNN. During an interview on the Ben Ferguson Show Friday, Nugent apologized for the comments, which he made in January 2014. A post on the show's Facebook page announced the apology: Nugent did not apologize to Obama, but did apologize for using the term. He said he apologized on behalf of Texas attorney general Greg Abbott -- who is campaigning for governor, with his \\"blood brother\\" Nugent at his side -- and politicians like Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas.), who criticized the rocker for the statement. \\"I do apologize -- not necessarily to the President -- but on behalf of much better men than myself,\\" Nugent said, calling the comments \\"streetfighter terminology.\\" \\"I apologize for using the term,\\" Nugent said. \\"I will try to elevate my vernacular to the level of those great men that I'm learning from in the world of politics.\\" ||||| Ted Nugent‘s comments about President Obama being a “subhuman mongrel” have inspired a whirlwind of controversy this week (especially on CNN), and Republicans have given varying degrees of reactions to those remarks, including the GOP congressman whose connection to Nugent kicked this all off to begin with. But earlier tonight Rand Paul made it clear that he found the comment “offensive” and wants Nugent to apologize. And Paul didn’t hedge or pad his thoughts at all, he just came right out on Twitter and said that Nugent’s “derogatory description” of Obama is just beneath anyone. Ted Nugent's derogatory description of President Obama is offensive and has no place in politics. He should apologize. — Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) February 21, 2014 Nugent, for what it’s worth, has so far shown no indication he plans on apologizing, lashing out at CNN for calling him out in the first place. [photo via screengrab] — — Follow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| To some Republican activists, he’s a celebrity defender of the Second Amendment who rallies the base like the rock star he once was. To Democrats and mainstream Republicans, he’s a sexual “predator,” an affront to families and a flamethrower with an appalling record of incendiary comments. Text Size - + reset When it comes to Ted Nugent, his conservative fans and liberal detractors are living on different planets. Nugent catapulted into the spotlight this week when he appeared at two campaign events with Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, the presumptive GOP nominee for governor. Democrats, in Texas and nationally, bracketed the events with email blasts and tweets highlighting elements of Nugent’s unsavory past and record of inflammatory remarks. They plan to continue making hay of those Texas appearances, and relish the possibility of his campaigning with other Republicans. (Also on POLITICO: Perry has 'problems' with Nugent) But in the deep-red Lone Star State, registration for Abbott’s events tripled when Nugent’s appearances were announced. Democrats and Republicans alike see Nugent as a turn-out catalyst, in Texas and perhaps beyond. He outrages Democrats and mainstream Republicans — but he fires up a segment of the GOP base, which is so enamored of Nugent’s fiery anti-Barack Obama rhetoric and defense of gun rights that it can overlook the singer’s tawdry history. A case in point: Sarah Palin wrote on her Facebook page that if Greg Abbott “is good enough for Ted Nugent, he’s good enough for me!” Nugent, 65, is a board member of the National Rifle Association, and is perhaps one of the country’s most colorful champions of the Second Amendment. He’s a lifelong gun enthusiast, a crusader against drugs and a die-hard Republican. But as Democrats have been eager to point out this week, he’s not exactly a buttoned-up cultural conservative. (Also on POLITICO: Rand Paul: Nugent should apologize) In an interview for a VH1 “Behind the Music” documentary about him, Nugent, who hit the peak of his career in the 1970s, acknowledged that when he was young — and even not-so-young — he was “addicted to girls.” “I was a wang-dang addict, I was addicted to girls. Addicted. It was hopeless,” he said in the video. “It was beautiful.” By age 21, he had two children from two different women. By 30, after being married, having more kids and getting divorced, he was involved with a 17-year-old, for whom he assumed the mantle — with her parents’ permission — of legal guardian. “It just really wasn’t a terribly appropriate situation in most people’s eyes,” said Pele Massa in the documentary, who said in the film that at 17 she became romantically involved with Nugent and was with him for nine years, though he wasn’t faithful to her during that period, she said. “And now, it would be criminal.” (Also on POLITICO: Greg Abbott sings Nugent's praises) The documentary said he acknowledged several relationships with young women, and that he won parental approval. There were never criminal charges leveled against him for indiscretions with underage women, the film said, but the incidents have served as fodder for Democrats, who have repeatedly blasted him as a “predator” this week. “I find Ted Nugent disgusting. And I find it disgusting that Greg Abbott is sharing a stage with him,” wrote Wendy Davis, the Texas Democratic candidate for governor, in a Wednesday fundraising missive. “But this isn’t just about my feelings. Every Texan should be offended by Greg Abbott’s decision to make a predator the new face of his campaign.” Yet in recent years Nugent has painted himself as a family man. He has always eschewed drugs and alcohol and has been an advocate for keeping kids substance-free. His current wife, Shemane Nugent, writes on her website that, “Recently, we have discovered four more adult children Ted had from previous relationships. I look forward to getting to know them, and hopefully they will welcome me into their lives.” They have been married since 1989 and have one child together. “[Like] other marriages, I don’t always agree with everything my husband says or does,” she wrote. A representative for both Nugents didn’t return a call and emails seeking comment. ||||| Rand Paul continues to win my admiration, I have to say. There are people who come into the Senate with a kind of celebrity status and get lots of good press—one Barack Obama comes to mind—but I can't think of anyone who has gotten so much good press through their own initiative, coming up with one clever way after another to get people to pay attention to them in ways that are almost always positive. His latest move required a subtle ideological tightrope-walk, one that Paul played perfectly. And all it took was a tweet. This has to do, you'll be happy to know, with Ted Nugent. Republican politicians have a soft spot for Nugent, partly because they're blinded by the celebrity of a guy who 37 years ago had a song that rocketed all the way to #30 on the charts, and partly because Nugent is kind of an expression of the conservative id. I'm sure there are more than a few people on the right who would like to hold up a pair of assault rifles and say, \\"I was in Chicago and said, 'Hey, Obama you might want to suck on one of these you punk.' Obama, he's a piece of shit, and I told him to suck on my machine gun. Let's hear it for him. And then I was in New York. I said, 'Hey, Hillary, you might want to ride one of these into the sunset, you worthless bitch. Since I'm in California, how about Barbara Boxer, she might want to suck on my machine gun. And Dianne Feinstein, ride one of these you worthless whore. Any questions? Freedom!\\" (Oh and also, he brags about having sex with underage girls, but hey, rock 'n roll, right?) Nugent is in the news because Greg Abbott, the Attorney General of Texas and likely the state's next governor, decided to campaign with him, whereupon people were reminded of a rather nasty, racist thing Nugent said about President Obama last month, and that's causing Abbott to have to deal with some uncomfortable questions. Questions like, \\"Why would you want to campaign with this hateful jackass?\\" Since most of the stories about this don't actually include Nugent's full comments, here's what they were: I have obviously failed to galvanize and prod, if not shame enough Americans to be ever vigilant not to let a Chicago communist raised communist educated communist nurtured subhuman mongrel like the ACORN community organizer gangster Barack Hussein Obama to weasel his way into the top office of authority in the United States of America. I am heartbroken but I am not giving up. I think America will be America again when Barack Obama, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton, Dick Durbin, Michael Bloomberg and all of the liberal Democrats are in jail facing the just due punishment that their treasonous acts are clearly apparent. At this point, some conservatives are surely asking themselves whether hanging around with Nugent is worth the trouble, or worth anything at all for that matter. For her part, Sarah Palin hurried to Facebook to say about Abbott, \\"If he is good enough for Ted Nugent, he is good enough for me!\\" But the more common response is the kind we got from Ted Cruz, a rather lengthy \\"Hamana hamana hamana,\\" leading eventually to \\"Those sentiments there, of course I don't agree with them.\\" You can see exactly what's going on in Cruz's head: It's obviously way, way uncool to call our biracial president a \\"subhuman mongrel,\\" but on the other hand, I don't want to give Tea Partiers any reason to suspect even for a moment that I'm not one of them or that I hate Obama any less than they do. Those nuts will turn on you in an instant! Just look what happened to Rubio. The result is some very pained equivocation. But Rand Paul is much smarter. He knows he isn't going to get the gold medal in the GOP Hate Olympics. Whatever coalition he assembles if and when he runs for president in 2016, it's going to be a relatively diverse one. He won't have complete control of any one constituency. There'll be some libertarians here, some moderates there, some fiscal conservatives here, some isolationists there. And without anyone standing out, at this point the best thing for him may be to raise his profile as high as he can, and get mainstream reporters on his side. So we get this: Genius. Paul obviously understands that nothing gets attention like criticizing someone on your own side, even if it's someone on the fringe. So what's his reward? Fulsome praise from people on all sides of the aisle! Oodles of good press! Even liberals will write blog posts lauding him! Like the very one you're reading. All of a sudden he looks like the reasonable one, and just look at the results. Here's a piece about him in the Washington Post. Here's an article on Politico. Here's the Huffington Post. Here's the Washington Times. You get the idea. Rand Paul has never given anyone much reason to believe that he's a sophisticated policy thinker, or that he would be good at running the government. And it's way too early to tell how he'll hold up in the day-in, day-out slog of a presidential campaign, particularly since he has run for office a total of one time in his life. But at the moment, he's shown himself to be smarter about getting media attention than any of the other potential 2016 Republican candidates. By a mile. ||||| While Republican Greg Abbott is fleeing reporter questions about Ted Nugent, Democratic opponent Wendy Davis is invoking the ‘70s guitarist and gun-rights advocate – to raise money. In a new fundraising appeal, Davis says Abbott’s decision to invite Nugent to campaign with him was an insult to “every father, every mother, every family in Texas.” The outspoken rock musician shared the stage with Abbott on Tuesday, the first day of early voting in the Texas primary elections. Abbott praised Nugent as “a fire for freedom” because of his support of 2nd Amendment rights. Nugent is also an outspoken critic of Democrats with a history of making crude, offensive remarks. He called President Obama a” subhuman mongrel” and has described feminists and female politicians as “varmints” and “fat pigs. He has acknowledged having sex with underage girls — something that runs counter to Abbott’s public promise as attorney general to fight child predators. Reporters in Tyler tried to ask Abbott on Wednesday about his decision to invite Nugent to campaign with him. But the attorney general fled to a waiting car after a brief round of questions in which he blamed Davis of insufficiently supporting gun-rights. In her fundraising pitch, Davis said she and her Republican opponent have different values. “His values allow him to embrace an admitted predator who takes advantage of young girls, calls successful women vulgar and disgusting names, and demeans and degrades not just the women of Texas, but anyone who disagrees with his narrow-minded, disrespectful point of view. If this is Greg Abbott’s idea of good Texas values, it’s simply repulsive. Campaigning with a vile character like Ted Nugent is a window into Greg Abbott’s character. And we need to show him that we won’t tolerate it. She asks supporters to send money to help her campaign. Davis faces an uphill battle against the better-funded Abbott in a state that hasn’t elected a Democrat governor since Ann Richards in 1990. But it wasn’t all bad news for Abbott. Tea Party favorite Sarah Palin offered her endorsement. “If he is good enough for Ted Nugent, he is good enough for me!” Palin wrote in a Facebook post.

After his former mentor's death, however, he decides to resume his crime-fighting days as Robin. Remarkably, Grayson does not take up the Nightwing identity. The filmmakers said they chose this because many people outside the comic book community are unfamiliar with Nightwing and they wanted to appeal to a wider audience.Commissioner Gordon is aware of Grayson's secret identity and assists him by supplying official documents. In addition, Gordon provides the voiceover narration at the beginning of the trailer. The head of the investigation into Batman's death is indicated to be Chief O'Hara, a character from the 1960's Batman TV series, who apparently also knows Grayson's identity (noting that Grayson's \\"crimefighting days are over\\") His role is suspicious since he strongly wants Grayson to not become involved, even to the point of aligning with Selina Kyle/Catwoman to eliminate Robin and shouting at reporter Clark Kent that he wants \\"him [presumably Grayson] out of the equation!\\" O'Hara is also seen rolling up his sleeves, preparing to assault an angry captive Gordon.

Context: Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging.

Antarctica, the Earth's southernmost continent, is situated in the Antarctic region of the southern hemisphere and is almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle. It is surrounded by the Southern Ocean and covers an area of approximately 14 million square kilometers, making it the fifth-largest continent. The continent is known for its massive ice cap which is not only the world's largest, but is also the largest single mass of ice on Earth. Antarctica's ice cap contains about 70% of the planet's fresh water and 90% of its ice. An important feature of this ice cap is the Antarctic ice sheet, a thick mass of ice that covers around 98% of the continent's landmass. The ice sheet plays a vital role in regulating the Earth's climate, as it reflects sunlight back into space, which helps keep the Earth cool.

To provide a valid answer to the question, it is necessary to discuss some of the critiques that have been made against other streaming services. Some of these criticisms may relate to issues such as artist compensation, sound quality, user experience, and business practices. Here is a more detailed response that addresses these concerns. One primary criticism of some music streaming services is their compensation model for artists, particularly when it comes to smaller, independent musicians. Many have argued that the royalties these platforms pay to artists are insufficient, making it difficult for independent musicians to earn a sustainable living. Some services use a pro-rata model, where the total revenue is divided among all artists based on the proportion of total streams they receive. This model tends to favor more popular artists, leaving newer, lesser-known musicians at a disadvantage. Another criticism lies in the sound quality offered by some streaming services. While many users find the audio quality perfectly acceptable for casual listening, audiophiles can be critical, claiming that the compressed formats used by these platforms do not deliver the level of sound quality found in other formats (e.g., vinyl, CDs, or lossless digital files). Tidal addresses this concern, as it offers a high-fidelity streaming option that provides lossless, CD-quality audio for subscribers with compatible equipment. User experience is another area where streaming services may receive criticism. Some argue that many platforms have limited options for creating and editing playlists or lack advanced search and discovery features. In addition, ads on free tiers can be intrusive and disruptive to the user experience. Some users may feel that the algorithm-driven approach to music discovery can lead to homogenized playlists and make it difficult to find new, diverse artists. Lastly, the business practices and the monopolization of the streaming industry by some major players might not always be viewed positively. Some critics argue that certain companies might not be genuine in their support for independent artists or interested in providing fair compensation, which could result in an environment where only major labels and well-established artists truly benefit from the system. In conclusion, while the sentence provided does not directly address the question about the criticism of other streaming services, it can be a starting point to explore the concerns mentioned above and the aspects where Tidal may position itself differently or better within the industry. Beyoncé's involvement as a co-owner of Tidal signifies that the service might be more artist-oriented and could be addressing some of the critiques currently faced by other streaming platforms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: So long as teachers fail to distinguish between teaching and learning, they will continue to undertake to do for children what only children can do for themselves. Teaching children to read is not passing reading on to them. It is certainly not endless hours spent in activities about reading. Douglas insists that \\"reading cannot be taught directly and schools should stop trying to do the impossible.\\" Teaching and learning are two entirely different processes. They differ in kind and function. The function of teaching is to create the conditions and the climate that will make it possible for children to devise the most efficient system for teaching themselves to read. Teaching is also a public activity. It can be seen and observed. Learning to read involves all that each individual does to make sense of the world of printed language. Almost all of it is private, for learning is an occupation of the mind, and that process is not open to public scrutiny. If teacher and learner roles are not interchangeable, what then can be done through teaching that will aid the child in the quest for knowledge? Smith has one principal rule for all teaching instructions. \\"Make learning to read easy, which means making reading a meaningful, enjoyable and frequent experience for children.\\" When the roles of teacher and learner are seen for what they are, and when both teachers and learners fulfill them appropriately, then much of the pressure and feeling of failure for both is eliminated. Learning to read is made easier when teachers create an environment where children are given the opportunity to solve the problem of leaning to read by reading Question: According to the passage, learning to read will no longer be a difficult task when _ .

Church patriarch in Iraq blames U.S. for Christians’ misery Archbishop Louis Sako is the patriarch of the Iraq-based Chaldean Church, one of the world's most ancient Christian communities. (Haidar Hamdani/AFP/Getty Images) The most senior Christian cleric in Iraq said the United States was \\"indirectly responsible\\" for the current chaos in Iraq, where the advances of Islamic State jihadists over the past few months have led to thousands of deaths and raised charges of ethnic cleansing. In August alone, some 600,000 people were displaced by the violence. \\"[The U.S.] said it would ensure democracy and the well-being of the people. But 10 years have passed, and, on the contrary, we have gone backward,\\" said Chaldean Catholic Patriarch Louis Sako, during a visit to Beirut last week. He added: \\"There were about 1 million Christians in Iraq and more than half of them have been displaced. Only 400,000 are left while displacement is still rising.\\" Sako's denomination is one of the world's most ancient Christian communities. Most are ethnic Assyrians, a group that existed for centuries in what's now modern-day Iraq, Syria and Turkey and preserved their faith and language -- a version of Aramaic -- through the various upheavals and conquests that have shaped and reshaped the Middle East. But their place within the Iraqi state changed radically after the U.S. invasion in 2003. After the toppling of Saddam Hussein, a nominally secular dictator, there was a security vacuum that imperiled Iraq's religious minorities. The new government in Baghdad, dominated by Shiites long repressed by Hussein's regime, failed to build a truly inclusive democracy. Tens of thousands of Chaldeans left the country following attacks on churches and monasteries. Check out a quick snapshot of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in #Iraq Up to 1.8 Million ppl now displaced pic.twitter.com/zuB2w4MmFg In 2008, Sako's predecessor, Mar Emmanuel III Delly, was very clear about what was to blame for his congregation's troubles. \\"The absolute worst time that I’ve seen in my life has been the last five years, “ he told the Detroit Free Press (there's a considerable Assyrian diaspora in Michigan). \\"The occupation has not been good for the Christians and for all of Iraq.\\" Sako has been outspoken about the horrors visited upon Iraq this summer by the Islamic State, whose puritanical brand of Islam has driven it to systematically butcher Christians, Yazidis and others belonging to Iraq's mosaic of minority sects. The jihadists have set about destroying cultural monuments -- tombs and shrines -- that it considers the work of apostates. After the loss of the historic city of Mosul to the Islamic State fighters, Sako offered an apocalyptic lament during a July sermon in Bagdhad, which WorldViews covered: \\"How in the 21st century could people be forced from their houses just because they are Christian, or Shi'ite or Sunni or Yazidi?\\" he asked. \\"Christian families have been expelled from their houses and their valuables were stolen and ...their houses and property expropriated in the name of the Islamic State.\\" [Sako] went on to make a chilling, grand historic proclamation: \\"This has never happened in Christian or Islamic history. Even Genghis Khan or Hulagu didn't do this,\\" he said. Hulagu Khan was the Mongol warlord whose horde swept through Mosul en route to sacking Baghdad in 1258, a bloody slaughter that snuffed out the proud Abbasid caliphate that had flourished there since the 8th century. Baghdad would take hundreds of years to reemerge as a political center. Some 200 Muslims also attended that particular service, according to Reuters, and held up signs in solidarity reading \\"I am Iraqi, I am Christian.\\" But that support belies the larger alienation that Sako says his flock has endured, even as the United States and other allies step up aerial strikes on Islamic State positions in Iraq. \\"Our Muslim neighbors did not help us,\\" he told reporters last month. \\"The West watched us, and it seemed they have ignored our suffering. But we will not leave our land, whatever the sacrifices.\\" Ishaan Tharoor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post.

Production de la déclaration de renseignements NR4 Les sociétés de placement à capital variable sont tenues de produire la déclaration NR4 d'ici le 31 mars 2007, pour les distributions déterminées payées aux non-résidents en 2006. Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"\\"Production of NR4 Information Return. Mutual Investment Corporations are required to produce the NR4 information return by March 31, 2007, for determined distributions paid to non-residents in 2006.\\" This French sentence pertains to a specific tax document Canadian corporations dealing with non-residents must fill out. Called the NR4 Information Return, this document pertains to taxes withheld from income amounts that are paid or credited to non-residents of Canada. Firstly, let's break down what an NR4 Information Return is. According to Canadian laws, it is a statement regarding any amount that a corporation might have paid or credited to people who are not residents of Canada. This can include any type of income such as retirements benefits, dividends, royalties, commissions, or other types of payments. The NR4 Information Return shows the gross amount of the payment or credit, its net amount, and the tax withheld. Now, from the French sentence, we come to understand that Mutual Investment Corporations are required to fill and file this document. This term may refer to a specific type of investment corporation or company, that pools money from many investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities. The mutual part of the name refers to the fact that all the profits and losses are shared among the investors. The deadline mentioned in the sentence is March 31, 2007. This means that corporations had to provide this information about payments made during the year 2006 by this date. So, if a Mutual Investment Corporation had paid any sort of income to a non-resident in 2006, the corporation had until March 31, 2007, to submit their NR4 Information Document. Thus, to put simply, this sentence mandates that these companies report all payments made to non-residents (like dividends paid to foreign shareholders) for the fiscal year 2006 by March of the following year. The NR4 would include details of the amount paid and the taxes that were withheld at the source."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They took a lot of liberties in rearranging events, excluding people, and using sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the 30's. There were more than just Bonnie, Clyde, and W.D. in the gang at various times, and those people had as much to do with the facts as those included. Buck and Blanche went to convince Clyde to go straight much earlier than the one shootout, and in fact got drawn back into crime. Some of the events that were portrayed in daylight actually took place at night. Bonnie's wound was much more severe and never healed right. It was so bad she had to be carried around by someone until it healed up, and even then it stiffened up so she walked stiffly. Clyde also walked with a limp because while in prison he cut off a big toe.

UPDATED:. 11:50 EST, 13 December 2012. A jeweller fought off a gang of masked raiders who attacked him with a sledgehammer, by hurling gold watches at them. Dramatic CCTV stills show the moment four balaclava-wearing robbers smashed their way into David Nicholl's jewellery shop in Smethwick, West Midlands, at 4.40pm on Saturday. The thieves then smashed glass counters before loading 17 trays of gold jewellery, worth tens of thousands of pounds, into a bag. Scroll down for video. Four balaclava-clad raiders burst into David Nicholls' Smethwick jewellers shop in West Midlands on Saturday armed with sledgehammers. Glass smashes everywhere as robbers help themselves to the trays of jewellery. In the top right of the screen one robber can be seen striking Mr Nicholls with a sledgehammer. Mr Nicholls begins to fight back and despite the grainy footage, you can just make out one robber putting his arms up to defend himself as Mr Nicholls throws heavy gold watches and broken jewellery trays. The armed gang of four decide enough is enough and flee Mr Nicholls' shop, carrying with them a total of 17 trays of jewellery worth tens of thousands of pounds. Shop owner David Nicholls was twice hit over the head with a sledgehammer but incredibly the 52-yeat-old fought back by hitting the raiders with the broken display cases. He then grabbed a handful of gold watches and threw them at the yobs who fled. Mr Nicholls, who suffered a head injury and needed hospital treatment, said today: 'I just thank God that I didn't get shot or killed or maimed in any way. 'We will recover, it will take a while. 'The bad thing for us is that we didn't have insurance, we were between insurance companies and the loss we will have to take ourselves. 'I was trying to protect my wife when they came in and then I just reacted and thought I'd try and stop them. 'The only thing I could grab was the display cabinets which they had smashed and I just tried to hit them with it. Loss: Mr Nicholls was between insurers at the time of Saturday's robbery and is not covered for the theft. He is considering closing down. 'I grabbed whatever I could and the next thing I knew I was lobbing gold watches at them. 'They were pretty heavy and were hitting the robbers who obviously just had enough and they ran off. 'A few trays of jewellery dropped to the floor, I think they were shocked at being attacked back. 'I didn't think about myself even though my head was bleeding badly.' The four offenders got away with tens of thousands of pounds worth of stock, and Mr Nicholls admitted he was unsure whether to continue running the business. Detective Constable Steve Goddard, from West Midlands Police, said: 'The victim was lucky to have got away with relatively minor injuries following what was an extremely nasty attack, there was no need for the level of violence used. 'I'm keen to hear from anyone who witnessed any of what happened or anyone who has any information about who may be responsible.' New rules: Mr Nicholls no longer takes any chances and now asks. customers to ring a bell and wait outside his shop, Davand Jewellery, in. Smethwick, West Midlands, before he lets them in. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"On Saturday, a gang of four masked raiders attacked a jewelry shop owned by David Nicholls in Smethwick, West Midlands, using sledgehammers to break into the store and steal 17 trays of gold jewelry worth tens of thousands of pounds.

Britain: The British Parliament passed the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833, which abolished slavery throughout most of the British Empire by 1834. The Act freed more than 800,000 enslaved Africans in the British colonies. 2. United States: Slavery was abolished in the United States by the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which was passed by Congress on January 31, 1865, and ratified by the states on December 6, 1865. The 13th Amendment declared that \\"neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\\" 3. Brazil: Brazil was the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery. The Lei Áurea (Golden Law) was signed on May 13, 1888, by Princess Isabel, which ended slavery in Brazil. 4. France: Slavery was first abolished in French colonies during the French Revolution in 1794, but it was later reinstated by Napoleon in 1802. It was finally abolished for good in the French colonies in 1848.

My reading was limited to stories by English-speaking authors. So, at the start of 2012, I set myself the challenge of trying to read a book from every country in a year to find out what I was missing. With no idea where to get those books, I was unlikely to find publications from nearly 200 nations on the shelves of my local bookshop, so I decided to ask the readers all over the world for help. I created a blog called A Year of Reading the World and put out an appeal for suggestions of titles that I could read in English. The response was amazing. People all over the world were getting in touch with me, offering ideas and book lists. Some posted me books from their home countries.

Most transmitters use the heterodyne principle so that they also have frequency conversion units . OPTIONS: [i] no. [ii] yes.","completion":"[i] no. These two sentences do not mean exactly the same thing, despite having similarities. This distinction lies in the phrasing and implications of each sentence. I will elaborate on the subtle differences between the two statements: 1. \\"Most transmitters have the heterodyne principle, so they also use frequency conversion units.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the fact that most transmitters operate based on the heterodyne principle. This principle primarily involves mixing two frequencies to generate two new frequencies: the sum and difference of the original frequencies. As a result of this principle, these transmitters also use frequency conversion units in their operation. The implication here is that the utilization of frequency conversion units is a consequence or a byproduct of the transmitters having the heterodyne principle. 2. \\"Most transmitters use the heterodyne principle so that they also have frequency conversion units.\\" This sentence suggests that most transmitters employ the heterodyne principle specifically for the purpose of having frequency conversion units. In other words, the motivation behind using the heterodyne principle in these transmitters is to possess frequency conversion units as a part of their system. The sentence highlights the intentionality behind including frequency conversion units in the transmitters' design. In summary, the first sentence emphasizes that transmitters operating on the heterodyne principle consequently utilize frequency conversion units, while the second sentence establishes that transmitters deliberately employ the heterodyne principle in order to include frequency conversion units in their design. The difference, albeit subtle, lies in the implications of why and how frequency conversion units are used within the transmitters' systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed. The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship,... Answer:","completion":"Frank"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer:","completion":"Pakhomy Andreyushkin was born on 15th May 1865 in Russia. Though not much is known about his early life and upbringing, one can presume that he grew up during a time of significant social and political changes in the country. Like many of his countrymen, Andreyushkin might have experienced the challenges and struggles of the late 19th-century Russian society. As he matured, he likely witnessed advancements in science, technology, and art that characterized the era. As a Russian national, Andreyushkin would be deeply acquainted with the cultural and historical legacy of his homeland. Unfortunately, his life took a dark turn, and he met his end at an unusually young age of 21, as he passed away on 8th May 1887. The Schlisselburg Fortress, where he drew his last breath, held a grim reputation for imprisoning political prisoners and served as a place of execution in Imperial Russia. This leads us to believe that Andreyushkin may have been imprisoned there for reasons related to dissent or opposing views. While no photograph or image can fully capture the essence of a person's life, the only known image of Andreyushkin, andreushkin2.jpg, provides a glimpse into his physical appearance and perhaps an insight into the hardships he faced during his brief life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Max Cady (Robert De Niro) is a former client whom Bowden defended 14 years earlier when he was working as a public defender in Atlanta. Cady was tried for the violent rape and battery of a young woman. Bowden, appalled by Cady's crime, buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. After his release from prison, Cady tracks down Bowden. He studied law in prison and assumed his own defense, unsuccessfully appealing his conviction several times. Cady hints he has learned about Bowden burying the report. Several incidents involving Cady impact the Bowden family, which consists of Bowden's wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and their teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). The family dog is poisoned. Cady lurks near their property. Bowden attempts to have Cady arrested, but police lieutenant Elgart (Robert Mitchum), says there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady meets Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), a colleague of Bowden with whom she might be having a love affair. At her house, Cady cuffs her hands behind her back, breaks her arm and rapes her. Lori refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Bowden hires private investigator Claude Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to follow Cady. Cady next approaches Danielle at her school by impersonating her new drama teacher and kisses her. Bowden warns him to leave his family and him alone or suffer the consequences. Cady secretly tapes the conversation with a hidden recorder. Kersek persuades Bowden to hire three men to beat Cady and intimidate him, but as Bowden watches from a hiding place, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them. Cady uses the recording of Bowden's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Bowden.

Afonso de Albuquerque was born in 1453 in Alhandra, near Lisbon. He was the second son of Goncalo de Albuquerque, Lord of Vila Verde dos Francos, and Dona Leonor de Menezes. His father held an important position at court and was connected by remote illegitimate descent with the Portuguese monarchy. He was educated in mathematics and Latin at the court of Afonso V of Portugal, where he befriended Prince John, the future King John II of Portugal. The fleet left Lisbon on 6 April 1506. Afonso piloted his ship himself, having lost his appointed pilot on departure. In Mozambique Channel, they rescued Captain Joao da Nova, who had encountered difficulties on his return from India; da Nova and his ship, the Frol de la mar, joined da Cunha's fleet. From Malindi, da Cunha sent envoys to Ethiopia, which at the time was thought to be closer than it actually is. Those included the priest Joao Gomes, Joao Sanches and Tunisian Sid Mohammed who, having failed to cross the region, headed for Socotra; from there, Afonso managed to land them in Filuk. After successful attacks on Arab cities on the east Africa coast, they conquered Socotra and built a fortress at Suq, hoping to establish a base to stop the Red Sea commerce to the Indian Ocean. However, Socotra was abandoned four years later, as it was not advantageous as a base. At Socotra, they parted ways: Tristao da Cunha sailed for India, where he would relieve the Portuguese besieged at Cannanore, while Afonso took seven ships and 500 men to Ormuz in the Persian Gulf, one of the chief eastern centers of commerce. On his way, he conquered the cities of Curiati (Kuryat), Muscat in July 1507, and Khor Fakkan, accepting the submission of the cities of Kalhat and Sohar. He arrived at Ormuz on 25 September and soon captured the city, which agreed to become a tributary state of the Portuguese king. Hormuz was then a tributary state of Shah Ismail of Persia. In a famous episode, shortly after it's conquest Albuquerque was confronted by Persian envoys, who demanded the payment of the due tribute from him instead. He ordered them be given a stock of cannonballs, arrows and weapons, retorting that \\"such was the currency struck in Portugal to pay the tribute demanded from the dominions of King Manuel\\" According to Bras de Albuquerque, it was Shah Ismael who coined the term \\"Lion of the seas\\", addressing Albuquerque as such. Afonso began building the Fort of Our Lady of Victory (later renamed Fort of Our Lady of the Conception), engaging his men of all ranks in the work. However, some of his officers revolted against the heavy work and climate and, claiming that Afonso was exceeding his orders, departed for India. With the fleet reduced to two ships and left without supplies, he was unable to maintain this position for long. Forced to abandon Ormuz in January 1508, he raided coastal villages to resupply the settlement of Socotra, returned to Ormuz, and then headed to India. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he lose any men on his conquest?","completion":"The article does not specifically mention losing any men during Afonso de Albuquerque's conquests. However, it does mention that some of his officers revolted against the heavy work and climate, and they claimed that Afonso was exceeding his orders. This led to them departing for India, leaving the fleet reduced to two ships and without supplies. This indicates that while there might not be a direct mention of losing men, there was a reduction in his forces during the conquest due to the officers' revolt."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here are possible answers to this question: - pillars - mountains - bridge - mountain range - surface of earth I believe the correct choice is \\"bridge\\", here's why: A:","completion":"A foundation of rock is ideal for supporting structures that require a strong, solid base to distribute weight and forces evenly. Among the possible answers, a \\"bridge\\" is the most suitable option for being built on a rock foundation. Here's why: 1. Pillars: While pillars can be built on a foundation of rock, they are not standalone structures, and usually serve to support other structures such as buildings and bridges. 2. Mountains and Mountain Ranges: These are natural land formations and not human-built structures, meaning they don't require a foundation of rock to be built on. They do often consist of rock, but they are not intentionally built on a rock foundation. 3. Surface of Earth: Like mountains, the surface of the Earth is a natural formation that does not require a foundation of rock to be built on. Therefore, a bridge is the correct choice because it is a man-made structure that requires a strong and stable foundation, which can be provided by a rock base.

Write an article with the title: \\"‘It Was Very Painful’ for Herman Cain\\"","completion":"Title: ‘It Was Very Painful’ for Herman Cain Introduction Herman Cain, the late American entrepreneur and former presidential candidate, has left an indelible mark on the US political landscape. Despite facing numerous challenges, he demonstrated unwavering resolve, ambition, and a penchant for paving his way through adversity. In this article, we explore Herman Cain's pain and struggle, both political and personal. We unravel the various controversies that he braved and how his resilience cemented him as a towering figure within the Republican Party. A Self-Made Man: The Early Years Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Herman Cain's early life was anything but devoid of struggle. As the son of a cleaner and a janitor, he witnessed his parents' tireless work ethic and instilled a strong determination within him. Cain attended the prestigious Morehouse College on a scholarship and earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics. He then went on to attain a master's degree in computer science from Purdue University. Armed with his knowledge and determination, Cain quickly rose through the ranks of corporate America, joining various companies such as The Coca-Cola Company and Pillsbury. He later embarked on a successful career as the CEO of Godfather's Pizza, garnering admiration and respect from industry peers. A Foray into Politics: The Struggle Continues Cain's political journey began in earnest when he was appointed to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's board of directors. His deep understanding of economic principles and business acumen proved invaluable in addressing pivotal economic issues. In 2000, Cain decided to test the political waters in earnest by vying for the Republican presidential nomination. His first foray into politics was short-lived, as he withdrew his candidacy due to insufficient campaign funding. Despite this initial setback, Herman Cain's taste of politics revealed his interest in public service and set the stage for his subsequent expeditions. In 2012, Herman Cain returned to the political arena, armed with considerably more recognition and support. His trademark \\"9-9-9\\" tax plan, charismatic persona, and enthusiasm for politics quickly made him a formidable contender in the Republican presidential race. However, Cain's journey was laden with obstacles and controversy, culminating in painful yet persistent struggles. Mounting Controversies: A Painful Legacy Relentless controversy plagued Cain's presidential campaign in 2011. Sexual harassment allegations from his tenure as CEO of the National Restaurant Association emerged, casting a dark shadow over his campaign. Amid vehement denial, Cain's polls began to plummet, and his popularity waned. The painful revelation of an alleged extramarital affair dealt a final blow to his candidacy, effectively ending his bid for the presidency. It was undeniably painful for Herman Cain to step away from the race after months of feverish campaigning and hard work. Yet, he chose to walk away with dignity and grace, rather than prolong a political spectacle that would inevitably hurt him and his family further. Standing Tall: Cain's Resilience and Legacy Despite the heartache that accompanied the end of his 2012 presidential bid, Herman Cain continued to play a vital role in American politics. He established himself as an influential media figure by hosting \\"The Herman Cain Show,\\" advocating for conservative values, and launching a successful website and radio program. His innate ability to bounce back from adversity, remain steadfast in his beliefs, and work passionately for America speaks volumes about his character. Conclusion As we reflect on the life of the late Herman Cain, one cannot deny the myriad of painful struggles he endured throughout his career. By overcoming adversity, Cain displayed immense strength and fortitude—qualities that endeared him to many of his supporters. As he fought the battle against stage four colon cancer, Cain's resilience remained unwavering, and his pursuit of improving America's trajectory continued to guide his actions. Though an article cannot fully capture the essence of Herman Cain's journey, it is crucial to acknowledge and appreciate his courage and persistence in the face of numerous hardships. Cain's life story remains an inspiration to those who find themselves surrounded by adversity and reveals the power of resilience that lies within the human spirit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Kay Hagan's campaign said late Wednesday the North Carolina Democrat missed a classified hearing last winter on the threat from the terrorist group ISIS to go to New York to raise money for her re-election. Hagan admitted earlier this week she didn't attend a hearing because she went to the fundraiser but didn't disclose which hearing she missed. Her decision to skip the Armed Services Committee session -- at which high-level administration intelligence officials filled in senators on top secret details about the group -- is drawing fire from her Republican opponent, North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis, who is narrowly trailing her in recent polls. But one of the dirty little truths about the way","completion":"the Senate operates is that many senators often miss classified hearings or committee meetings due to conflicting priorities, such as raising campaign funds, attending to constituent needs, or participating in other Senate-related responsibilities. While it can be criticized as neglecting their duties, it is an unfortunate reality of the political process. Many senators face these hard decisions when balancing their time between committee work and running a successful re-election campaign. The pressure to raise funds can be immense, as it is often seen as a key predictor of electoral success. However, missing important hearings, especially those related to national security, can negatively impact a senator's public image and give their opponents easy ammunition to attack their credibility. In the case of Sen. Hagan, her choice to attend a fundraiser instead of the classified ISIS hearing has provided her Republican opponent, Thom Tillis, with a talking point to question her commitment to national security and the well-being of her constituents. As the race remains close in the polls, both candidates must weigh their priorities carefully, as any perceived misstep could significantly sway voters. To avoid similar situations in the future, senators should strive to find a better balance between fulfilling their Senate duties and engaging in fundraising activities, or even explore alternative methods of campaign financing. However, as long as the current system emphasizes the importance of fundraising, senators are likely to continue facing these difficult choices and prioritizing their political survival over committee attendance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At the conference room table was White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten. Bolten watched the exchanges and, after what he called \\"a quiet moment,\\"suggested that the Vice President get in touch with the President and confirm the engage order. Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft.

The mother had placed a water bottle filled with VODKA in the refrigerator. The grandmother used that VODKA to fill the bottle with the powder added. At some point after the baby wouldn’t drink the bottle (because of the taste I imagine) but had drank some the Grandmother realized it was Vodka instead of WATER. She gave the baby Powdered Charcoal and the baby vomited the milk mix up. The baby was Ok and no harm done. She was lucky to have the powdered charcoal around. It is hard to find now in the stores. When I was a child (50’s-60) it was common for All medicine chests to be supplied with Charcoal. I still keep some of that in My medicine chest. I live in a rural area.

A: Choose your answer from: [i] Pond; [ii] Lake; [iii] Lagoon; [iv] resevoirs; Answer:","completion":"A man-made lake is commonly referred to as a reservoir. So, the answer is [iv] reservoirs. Reservoirs serve multiple purposes and can significantly contribute to water resources management, flood control, power generation, recreation, and environmental protection. They are typically created by constructing a dam across a river or stream, which in turn causes the water to back up behind the structure and form a lake. These lakes can vary in size, depending on the intended use of the reservoir and the surrounding landscape. Functionally, reservoirs can be classified into various types, such as storage reservoirs, balancing reservoirs, and service reservoirs. Storage reservoirs primarily manage water supply and maintain water level over a period of time to ensure the availability of water during dry seasons or droughts. Balancing reservoirs are created to manage fluctuations in water flow and demand, such as the daily or seasonal variations in water supply and consumption. Service reservoirs, on the other hand, are smaller reservoirs located near the point of water consumption, often within urban areas, and help maintain water pressure in distribution systems and allow for regular maintenance of the water supply infrastructure. Reservoirs can also be categorized by their method of water impoundment, such as embankment dams, gravity dams, or arch dams. Each type has specific design and structural characteristics, depending on factors such as the volume of water to be stored, the underlying geology of the area, and the surrounding environment. Man-made lakes can also serve as recreational areas, offering opportunities for boating, fishing, and swimming, as well as providing habitat for a diverse range of flora and fauna. Wildlife conservation and ecological enhancement are important aspects to consider during the planning and management of reservoirs. However, it's essential to acknowledge that the construction of reservoirs can have both positive and negative consequences. While they provide valuable resources and services, such as water and power supply or flood control, they can also lead to the displacement of communities and the loss of cultural, historical, or archaeological sites, as well as changes in habitat and biodiversity. Therefore, a multi-disciplinary approach should be adopted when planning and constructing reservoirs to ensure a balance between human needs and environmental sustainability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: ISIS battle deserters could soon be flooding to Britain, it's feared And security bosses left asking 'what can we possibly do with the child soldiers?' BRIT security services are preparing for a flood of fleeing home-grown jihadists as ISIS continues to be pounded by air strikes from the US-led coalition and Russia. Although the Islamist group has suffered increasingly from desertion in recent months, up until now very few of the foreign fighters have returned to Europe from Syria and Iraq. The numbers coming to Britain for instance, The Independent has learned, have been in no more than single figures for the last eight months. But that trickle could soon turn into a flood if ISIS continues to lose territory and suffer more heavy losses in Syria. These radicalised warriors will present a severe threat in the near future, “a ticking time bomb” as they try to break out of the region, say security officials. And they insist a coordinated policy is needed to confront the impending crisis. The problem has been compounded by a dramatic and sickening increase in the use of children, including those of Western parentage, by ISIS to carry out executions of prisoners. A photo appeared last week of a young boy, said to be British, in the act of shooting Kurdish fighters captured by Isis. The 11-year-old, it has been claimed, was the son of Sally Jones, a British woman who had converted to Islam and joined ISIS in Syria. The terror group is believed to have around 1,500 child fighters in its ranks. The vast majority are Syrian and Iraqi, with Yemen and Morocco supplying most from Arab countries. There are also around 50 children from Britain are currently in the self-declared “Islamic State”, along with smaller numbers from France and Australia, among Western countries. “What one does with these children need to be considered,” said a senior British security official. “Some of them have who have been used to carry out these criminal acts are below the age of criminal responsibility in many countries in Europe. “We know of children from the West who had been taken to Syria, but there are also children who have been born there to European parents. As we know Daesh (ISIS) are now bringing five-year-olds into their jihad. “But the real problem would be with the thousands of adults. A number of states are liaising on this, but the policies will depend to an extent on political and legal considerations in individual states.” Around 27,000 foreign fighters are believed to have joined Isis since the start of Syria’s civil war five years ago, with between 5,000 and 7,000 of them arriving from Europe to join the group and other hardline rebel organisations such as Jabhat al-Nusra, an al-Qaeda affiliate. Just under 800 have travelled from the UK. Jihadists have been using the Turkish border to get in and out of Syria, sometimes with the connivance, it has been claimed, of the Erdogan government. But the Turks are now carrying out military operations against Isis, and its militants have now lost control of points they had occupied in the area. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The news article discusses the fear that Britain may soon face an influx of home-grown jihadists and child soldiers returning from ISIS-controlled territories in Syria and Iraq. Security services are concerned about the potential threats these radicalized warriors pose, describing them as a \\"ticking time bomb.\\" ISIS has notably increased its use of child soldiers, with around 1,500 in its ranks, including approximately 50 from Britain. The article highlights some key points: 1. As ISIS continues to lose territory due to airstrikes from the US-led coalition and Russia, security officials fear an increased flow of foreign fighters returning to Europe, primarily Britain. 2. There has been a rise in the use of child soldiers, including those of Western parentage, by ISIS for carrying out executions. 3. It is believed that there are around 1,500 child fighters within ISIS, with a majority being Syrian and Iraqi, while children from Britain, France, and Australia are also present. 4. Deciding how to manage the return of these child soldiers is a complicated issue, as some are below the age of criminal responsibility in multiple European countries. 5. Approximately 27,000 foreign fighters are believed to have joined ISIS since the start of Syria's civil war, with around 5,000 to 7,000 coming from Europe, and just under 800 from the UK. Understanding and responding to these critical issues in the article is essential for security officials and policymakers to develop appropriate strategies to manage the potential influx of returning jihadists and child soldiers in a way that balances legal, political, and safety concerns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Five-year-old Raghat loved singing, nail polish, teasing her toddler sister, the alphabet she was starting to learn at nursery, and goofing for the camera. In the last photos of her, taken barely 10 minutes before the Russian bombs landed, she shows off a new bracelet and freshly painted nails with glee, then squeezes a kiss from her squirming baby sister. “I only took my children back to Syria for six days,” says her mother, Suheer, her eyes welling up as she plays a video on her smartphone, bringing a shadow of her daughter momentarily back to life. Her son Hossein, only four himself, leans in to smooth away her tears. Too young to really understand why his sister has vanished, he comforts his mother with a soft patter of “mummy, no, mummy”. Related: Ministers say it could take two years to destroy Isis Raghat now lies miles away, across the Turkish border in Syria, buried in the town of Habeet, near Idlib, where she died in October alongside her grandfather and her cousin Ahmad. When the attack finished she was found wrapped in Ahmad’s arms. A 28-year-old maths teacher, he had tried to race her to shelter when the first bomb fell. They made it to a small dugout in the garden, but a bomb landed just beside the entrance, and Ahmad’s body was not a strong enough shield. Raghat survived the first blast, but died on the back of a motorbike as her family raced her to hospital. “We were supposed to be going home the next day,” Suheer says. “My husband never saw his daughter again.” The family are one of hundreds ripped apart by more than two months of intense Russian bombing raids on opponents of President Bashar al-Assad, which victims and fighters say have strayed far behind frontlines. Coalition airstrikes led by the US have also killed civilians, but have stricter rules of engagement. There have been no reports of civilian casualties from the airstrikes launched on the al-Omar oilfield by British Tornado jets this week. Syrians say Russians are not only reckless about choosing targets, but also appear to be intentionally bombing some civilian areas. Survivors, doctors treating the injured, and local commanders believe the Sukhoi jets, flying from a new airbase in the coastal Latakia province, are hitting homes in a deliberate campaign to break fighters’ morale and depopulate swaths of the countryside. “They are targeting the civilians at night, and mostly frontlines during the day,” says Abu Hussain, a Turkmen rebel commander, a high-rank defector from the Syrian army. “It’s because they don’t want anyone to film the jets bombing at night, so you can’t prove their identity.” That matches images and accounts of the airstrike on Raghat’s house, which her uncle Ali says began moments after 9pm on 1 October. In one of her last photographs, she holds a lit torch, and video her uncle says was shot soon after the bombing shows flames raging through the house against a dark sky. Russian airstrikes killed at least 295 Syrian civilians in October alone, according to monitoring group Airwars, which keeps an extensive database of images, videos, reports and biographies of the dead. “Based on all field reporting, the number of alleged civilian casualties attributed to Russia is many times what we see being claimed against the US-led coalition,” says Chris Woods, who runs the Airwars project. “We think the primary reason here that the casualties are so high is the type of munitions that Russia is using, mostly ‘dumb bombs’ which almost always mean more civilian deaths. That is closely followed by where and how Russia is bombing. There is no doubt that Russia is bombing civilian neighbourhoods.” Airwars’ assessment of the strike on Habeet matches Raghat’s family’s account, and ties in with Russian reports of bombing raids in the area, it says. A Syrian monitoring group also confirmed details of the attack, and a prominent human rights activist still working inside Syria videotaped the aftermath and photographed the little girl’s body. The family, who asked for their surname to be withheld to protect relatives still in Syria, did not expect a bombing raid even though Russian planes had been buzzing around the area for four days, apparently doing surveillance. President Vladimir Putin had said his fighters would be targeting “terrorist groups”, and the family’s home was more than 60 miles (97km) from the nearest Isis forces. Related: At least 18 people killed in Russian airstrike on town in Syria – reports Even as it became clear that Russian planes were more focused on tackling Assad’s opponents than Isis, the frontline was still several miles away. It would take days for civilians to realise they were firmly in the bombers’ sights, because of confusion about targets and the slow and unreliable trickle of news out of Syria. Many working in overwhelmed hospitals, providing relief or ferrying the worst injured across the border into Turkey, fear the deaths have barely registered in western capitals obsessed with tackling Isis and almost oblivious to the civilian deaths caused by Russian bombing. “Its been 48 days with no one talking about it,” says Abu Hamza Suleiyman, a doctor at a Syrian field hospital near the town of Jisr al-Shughur, another area targeted by Russian bombers. “There are almost no civilians left in their homes because they bombed almost every single village. “I could understand the frontline, but the civilians? One landed just outside a maternity hospital. This is the worst experience in the last four years. I’m from a small village in these mountains, and for ages no one has bombed this village, but when the Russians started bombing they hit every single village.” The killings already appear to be entrenching the war and fuelling radicalisation. Anti-Assad fighters seeking revenge and disturbed by the flagging strength of their own groups, seek to ally with opposition forces that are well-supplied and confident in Syria – among them Isis. “Isis are not very good, but a lot of people think they are doing the correct thing against the regime,” says Raghat’s uncle Ali, a fighter with the Free Syrian Army whose two younger brothers now want to join him on the frontlines to avenge their family. Ali, who was not at home when the strike hit, fears other families may look for even more radical solutions. “There is no Isis in our area at all, but there is going to be soon,” he says. Ali’s father, 56-year-old Abdul Razzaq, was one of the first civilian victims of the Russian raids, hit in the Habeet strike as he tried to race down from the top storey of the house. Most of the family were already downstairs and managed to dash to safety, leaving only Raghat, her cousin and 49-year-old grandmother, Zahra, who had been in another part of the house and decided to head for the dugout in the yard. As they fled, a shell landed just behind Zahra, knocking her to the ground, destroying her hearing and peppering her with shrapnel. It nearly killed her, but probably also saved her life, because just as Ahmad and Raghat thought they had reached safety, another blast hit the shelter directly. Zahra’s search for treatment took a long, painful night of racing across northern Syria, on roads so bad she broke an arm, because some hospitals have been targeted in airstrikes and others are overwhelmed by casualties of the bombings. Related: 'More than 90%' of Russian airstrikes in Syria have not targeted Isis, US says Ali rushed her 15 miles to the nearest medical station, but doctors there could do little more than stabilise her for a three-hour drive to the Turkish border, in an ambulance that was more like a truck. A drive in darkness, haste and confusion was followed by three hours waiting at the border for Zahra, moaning in pain and terrified she was dying. They were finally escorted across the border to begin treatment, but two months later she still has no movement in one arm, and can barely walk because the sores and burns on her legs are yet to heal. They were only in the path of the bombs because the war has dragged on so long. The whole extended family fled to Turkey in 2012, but two years ago pension payments to Abdul Razzaq, a retired officer in the Syrian military, were stopped by the government. They could no longer afford rent. But, anxious to avoid the grim refugee camps and reassured that their home was under firm rebel control and had never been bombed or taken by the regime, they decided to risk returning.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In 1665, Bremen refused to pledge allegiance to Charles X Gustav's successor, Charles XI of Sweden. In March, the Swedish riksråd decided to wage war. Thereupon, 12,000 Swedish troops were transferred to the Duchy of Bremen by the end of the year. In January 1666, Carl Gustaf Wrangel departed from Swedish Pomerania to command the Swedish army, which in early 1666 numbered 14,000 troops. By summer, all of the city of Bremen's territory was occupied, except the city itself. The Swedish chancellor of Bremen-Verden, Esaias von Pufendorf, went to the court in Paris to build an alliance with France. The Swedish position was that France had to intervene on the Swedish side, since Bremen was Swedish according to the Peace of Westphalia, of which France was a guarantor. Pufendorf was however told by Hugues de Lionne that France would not hesitate to declare openly that she read the treaty as Bremen being an Imperial city, rather than provoke a new great war with the Holy Roman Empire and the Dutch Republic with an assault Sweden and France could hardly win. Lionne said Sweden would be better off waiting for a situation when the Dutch and the neighboring German principalities were weak, and then take the city of Bremen by surprise.

The European Economic Community, also known as the Common Market, was created with the intention of fostering economic cooperation among its member nations. It was established by the Treaty of Rome on March 25, 1957, and comprised six founding member states: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany. Luxembourg, a small landlocked country in western Europe, has played a crucial role in European economics and politics since the inception of the EEC. It boasts a strong and diversified economy, with key sectors including finance, steel, chemicals, and information technology. Luxembourg has developed a reputation as an essential hub for international financial services and investment funds. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is home to the European Court of Justice, the European Investment Bank, and other essential EU institutions. The EEC aimed to encourage trade, eliminate tariff barriers, create a common market, and enhance economic integration among its member countries. This goal was accomplished through various policies, such as harmonization of legislation, economic policies, and the establishment of institutions like the European Commission and the Council of Ministers. The EEC transitioned into the European Union (EU) with the signing of the Maastricht Treaty (also known as the Treaty on European Union) on November 1, 1993. This marked the beginning of increased political and social integration, culminating in the adoption of a single currency, the Euro, and the implementation of additional freedoms and rights for EU citizens. Luxembourg remains an integral part of the European Union today, maintaining its role as a key financial center and continuing to contribute to the evolution and development of the political and economic landscape of the union."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This leak happened on April 25, 2011. In Build 7955, a few new features and changes were introduced compared to the previous milestone release, Build 7850. Among these updates, the traditional Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) was replaced with a new Black Screen, which was later removed. Furthermore, this build also introduced a new ribbon interface in Windows Explorer, making it a notable version in the Windows 8 development process.

And I liked the stories behind them, which made me forget all other things. McDonald's, Apple, Mercedes Benz and Adidas own great logos as well, and they are among my favorites. Nike In the Greek myth, Nike is the goddess of victory and the source of inspiration for soldiers. This logo represents the wing in the famous statue of the Greek goddess. Nike's logo was designed by Carolyn Davidson in 1971 for 35, and was registered as a trademark in 1995. McDonald's The logo was designed in 1962 by Jim Schindler to resemble the archshaped signs on the side of the company's then walk-up hamburger stand. Later on, the two golden arches were combined together to form the M. The McDonald's name was added to the logo in 1968. Apple There are different stories behind Apple's logo. The first logo was a reference to the religious story of Adam and Eve, in which the apple represented the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. One year later, the second logo was designed in 1977 by Steven Jobs and Ronald Wayne, and it described Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. This logo didn't stay long. One year later it was replaced almost immediately by graphic designer Rob Janoff's \\" rainbow apple\\", a rainbow- colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. And then the rainbow- colored apple was replaced by the one- colored logo in 1998. It has not been changed so far. Mercedes Benz The Mercedes Benz logo, which was originally created by Gottlieb Daimler in 1909, consists of a simple description of a three- pointed star that represents its rule of the land, the sea and the air. The company was founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. Marcedes is the name of Maybach's elder daughter, while Benz came as a result of a combination with Benz, Cie.and DMG in 1926. Adidas The Adidas logo, which was created by the founder of the company Adi Dassler, represents mountains,... Question: What does the author think of the stories of the great logos?

The bride wore Fendi, the vows were exchanged in a garden overlooking Lake Como and the lunch was five courses of pure heaven. But the thing I remember most about my friend's perfect wedding last summer is just how hot I was. It's not that the temperatures were particularly scorching - in the pleasant mid-20s at most - but I still spent the celebration sweating like a pig on a spit, and looking about as attractive as one. By the end of the day I was so hot and bothered I was ready to pass out.

In this case, Marianne Power experimented with two different 'seasonal' Spanx to see if they would offer better comfort and support when attending such events, especially in warmer conditions. It is important to choose the right level of support when it comes to shapewear. Spanx, for example, is known for their different levels of support, ranging from light to medium to strong. In Marianne Power's test, she found out that Spanx only offered the medium support in the selected product. This means that they are lightweight in more ways than one, meaning they may not have provided enough support for your needs. It might have been beneficial for you to consider a product like Skinny Britches, which also offers medium support but might be more lightweight and breathable in warmer climates. The choice of shapewear for an event like a summer wedding should take into consideration the expected temperature, humidity, and the material of your clothing. When attending a summer event or a wedding in a picturesque location such as Lake Como, comfort and breathability should be prioritized. You may want to research different brands and products specifically designed for warmer climates. Look for materials that are moisture-wicking, lightweight, and breathable, which can help regulate body temperature and avoid discomfort caused by excessive sweating. In the future, when attending similar events, it would be advisable to consider investing in shapewear specifically designed for warmer weather or try opting for light support options that offer more breathability to avoid feeling too hot and bothered. Some additional tips for staying comfortable in warm weather include wearing light-colored clothing, staying hydrated, and using cooling accessories, such as handheld fans or cooling scarves. By following these suggestions, you should be able to enjoy outdoor weddings or events without worrying about heat-induced discomfort, allowing you to focus on the celebration at hand."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Roy Hodgson has hit back at Brendan Rodgers' claims that he ignored advice from Liverpool over Daniel Sturridge's recovery time. Rodgers was furious when Sturridge injured his thigh during the last England get together and he hasn't played since the 1-0 victory over Norway early last month. The Liverpool manager insisted that Sturridge needs 48 hours to recover after a match, but Hodgson ignored the advice and forced the striker to train. Daniel Sturridge was injured in training for England in September resulting in him missing the opening European Championship qualifier against Switzerland and a number of Liverpool matches. Hodgson said: 'We have only a shortage of time. We have two games and two training sessions, we wanted to play him and Rooney together against Switzerland. 'The injury was unfortunate but if I am going to be under pressure to give players two days off every time they play then we won't train. They can't have two days off. 'He has not played for Liverpool since picking up the injury. If he was to get fitter during the international week then he will still have a lot of work to do to bring him up to speed for Liverpool anyway. There was no question of him being selected. Hodgson denied that there is any problem between him and Brendan Rodgers after the Liverpool manager warned him not to play Daniel Sturridge. The England boss has not selected the striker for his squad to face San Marino and Estonia in their Euro 2016 qualifiers. Rodgers said that he had told Hodgson that Sturridge was not available for the national team, even though he could play some part of Liverpool's match against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday before the England squad meet up. Talking at Melwood, the Liverpool boss said: 'I've not spoken to Daniel (about the situation). My focus is on Liverpool, it is not on England. 'I spoke to him about being available for Liverpool but I can't think about England when he is not ready to play for Liverpool. England boss Roy Hodgson has insisted players can not have two days off due to the proximity of matches. 'He's had a grade one injury for four weeks, which is a long time, and my focus is now getting him to play for Liverpool. 'I've had good communication with Roy. It was amicable. There is no issue. 'We spoke at length yesterday on the situation and I said to him 'Every individual player is different'. 'I respect he had work to do internationally but my thoughts are with Liverpool players and what their needs are. 'We agreed it was probably too soon for Daniel to meet up with England, irrespective of whether he was involved this weekend or not. He hasn't trained with the team at all since the injury with them and it was probably not the right time to go with them.' While there is no issue between himself and Hodgson, Rodgers wouldn't dismiss questions surrounding the two pairs of medical staff being at loggerheads. 'It is not something to be discussed now,' he said. 'I don't think the same thing will happen again. From the conversations with Roy they will obviously look at that. 'I understand his position where he has only a few days to work with the players and he will probably take away that intensity on that second day but you can still work players, we work players here on the second day, but it needs to be tapered to the individual player.' Liverpool striker Sturridge has only managed to appear in half of his side's Premier League matches. Brendan Rodgers told Hodgson that Sturridge would not be available for England but could play some part in Liverpool's match against West Brom before the national team meet up. Hodgson added: 'The last thing you want is injuries in training. You feel a responsibility to the clubs when you have their players and I can only think of three injuries with the national team in two and a half years I have been in charge. 'I haven't been told he can't play for us. We have a right to pick players and we have a right to check on their fitness and assess them ourselves. It's never happened in my two-and-a-half years and hope it never will. The way forward is to have dialogue with managers and players. 'If he took some part at the weekend it'll be very much at the beginning of his recovery. Us going forward in December and March, a fully fit Sturridge is what I need. 'I don't seek ways in which I can assert my authority. I'm happy with the way I use my authority.'

Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Was the honoree of the Earl Haig memorial a junior or senior officer of the British Army? Answer:","completion":"The honoree of the Earl Haig Memorial, Field Marshal Douglas Haig, was a senior officer of the British Army who ascended through the ranks and held significant positions during his military career. Although he started as a junior officer like any other military personnel, he eventually held some of the most critical posts in the British Army during his tenure, making him an influential figure in modern British military history. Field Marshal Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig, was born on June 19, 1861, in Edinburgh, Scotland. He joined the British Army as a junior officer after graduating from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He was initially commissioned as a lieutenant in the 7th (Queen's Own) Hussars in 1885. Throughout his career, Haig served in various capacities in multiple countries, including India, Egypt, Sudan, and South Africa. As Haig progressed through various ranks, his roles and responsibilities grew, marking his transition from a junior officer to a senior one. He furthered his military education at the Staff College, Camberley, which would enable him to assume more senior positions within the British Army. In 1906, Haig was promoted to the rank of Major-General and appointed the Director of Military Training at the War Office. This responsibility marked a pivotal point in Haig’s career, further solidifying his status as a senior officer. During World War I, Haig's notable senior positions within the British Army included the following: 1. Commander of the British I Corps - Haig was appointed to this position in August 1914 at the start of the war, responsible for the leadership of a significant segment of British troops on the Western Front. 2. Commander of the British First Army - In December 1914, Haig was promoted to the rank of General and was placed in charge of the British First Army. 3. Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) - From 1915 until the end of World War I, Haig served as the Commander-in-Chief of the BEF. He led British forces in various crucial battles, including the Battle of the Somme (1916), the Third Battle of Ypres (1917), and the Hundred Days Offensive (1918), which led to victory and the end of the war. Following his contributions during World War I, Haig was promoted to Field Marshal in 1917 and created Earl Haig and the Viscount Dawick in 1919. He continued to serve the British Army until his retirement in 1921. In summary, although Field Marshal Douglas Haig began his career as a junior officer, he ascended through the ranks and became one of the most senior officers of the British Army. His contributions to the British military, both in times of war and peace, earned him prominent positions in the armed forces, including that of the commander-in-chief of the British Expeditionary Force during World War I. Thus, the honoree of the Earl Haig memorial can be accurately described as a senior officer of the British Army."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Specimens include simple filament structures similar to the earliest feathers of non-flying dinosaurs _ a form unknown in modern birds _ and more complicated bird feathers \\"displaying pigmentation and adaptations for flight and diving,\\" the researchers reported. Indications of feathers have been found on much older fossils, and the new discoveries indicate feathers continued to develop into modern form before the extinction of dinosaurs, explained Norell, who was not part of the research team. A separate report by Roy A. Wogelius of the University of Manchester, England, published online June 30 by Science, reports the finding of trace metals in feather fossils, suggesting their colors included black, brown and a reddish-brown. \\"Despite many reports over the past decade of feathered dinosaurs and new birds from China, only now are we beginning to understand just how diverse feather types were\\" millions of years ago, Norell said. ___ http://www.sciencemag.org ||||| A trove of ancient feathers both primitive and complex is providing scientists with an unprecedented snapshot of what some dinosaurs and birds looked like during the Cretaceous period. An account published online Thursday in the journal Science describes a host of feathers and feather-like filaments found in western Canada. The structures were ensconced in 70-million-year-old amber. Taken together, the feathers and filaments point to the diversity of this prehistoric plumed menagerie, said study coauthor Alexander Wolfe, a paleoecologist at the University of Alberta in Canada. \\"The simplest feathers are of greatest interest because these protofeathers have been inferred to be the evolutionary precedent to evolved feathers,\\" Wolfe said in an interview with The Times. Scientists have posited that feathers developed first as single, hair-like protrusions meant for insulation, then began to grow in clumps, and then as increasingly complex structures. At some point, they were probably used for other purposes (such as attracting mates), and later for flight. Many of the samples described in the study accurately match one of those stages. Some feathers even had coiled barbules, similar to those that have evolved on modern birds such as sandgrouses, which allow the animals to transport water to the nest to cool their incubating eggs. \\"We never thought we'd have fossils to show all these feathers, from primitive stage-one [protofeathers] to feathers of modern aspect,\\" Mark Norell, chairman of the division of paleontology at the American Museum of the Natural History, said in an interview with The Times. He was not involved in the study.

Credit: Science ||||| By Hans Villarica Protofeather fossils discovered entombed in amber from the Late Cretaceous era support theories of dinosaur and avian evolution -- and make for one beautiful gallery Dinosaur and bird feathers preserved in amber from a Late Cretaceous site in Canada reveal new insights into the structure, function, and color of animals that date back to about 78 million years ago. Researchers led by University of Alberta paleontologist Ryan McKellar say these specimens represent distinct stages of feather evolution, from early-stage, single filament protofeathers to much more complex structures associated with modern diving birds. After analyzing the preserved pigment cells, the authors add that these feathered creatures may have also had a range of transparent, mottled, and diffused colors, similar to birds today. They can't determine which feathers belonged to birds or dinosaurs yet, but they did observe filament structures that are similar to those seen in other non-avian dinosaur fossils. Their findings appear in the current issue of the journal Science. In the gallery below, with captions from McKellar, marvel at the beauty of these amber-preserved feathers. Then, in the Q&A that follows, learn more about how amber preservation works, the science of feather evolution, and the possibility of Jurassic Park-type experiments down the line. How significant is this discovery? This discovery is a pretty significant find. It supports a model for the evolution of feathers that has previously relied on compression fossils that are difficult to interpret and have been hotly debated. Also, the amber-entombed feathers show that some of the most primitive feather types, also known as protofeathers, were still around just before the dinosaurs went extinct. They existed alongside feathers that are nearly identical to those of modern birds. Given what we know about the animals that were alive in the area at the time, it is reasonable to suggest that the protofeather-like specimens are attributable to dinosaurs and are the first specimens of this type of feather to be recovered from amber. How does amber preservation work exactly? Preservation in amber can vary quite a bit among deposits. Amber tends to preserve specimens in great detail because tree resin has antibacterial and drying properties that partially mummify inclusions and slow the initial onslaught of decay. Over many years, the resin polymerizes, turning into a plastic-like substance that is quite resilient, but burial usually results in heating that can have a profound effect on the inclusions over the span of millions of years. The Canadian amber insect inclusions are largely preserved as hollow voids in the amber, with a thin film of carbonized, coal-like material, where the outside of the insect once was. The feathers appear to have fared much better, because they are fine and are not composed of material that decay easily. That said, many of the specimens show signs of partial decay, and there is no indication of how much, if any, original material remains intact. What's the backstory of these specimens? What originally got me interested in this project was a single feather fragment trapped in a spider web that had been given to Dr. Brian Chatterton. For my Ph.D. project, I worked on tiny, less than three millimeter, parasitic wasps trapped within amber from the same deposit. As part of this project I was able to go through the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology collection of 3,000 or so inclusions in great detail. After finding a lot of feather fragments in this collection, I had the good fortune of meeting the Leuck family, amateur collectors in southern Alberta, who donated a pair of additional specimens to the University of Alberta. Later, we learned that Dr. Philip Currie was also examining a trio of specimens from the deposit. We pooled the material, creating a surprisingly rich snapshot of feathers in the Late Cretaceous. This project underlines the importance of maintaining museum collections as well as the role that interested amateurs can play in palaeontology. Without these, there is no way that we would have been able to observe these important specimens. According to your paper, these feathers represent several distinct stages of feather evolution. Could you explain each stage briefly? The evolutionary-developmental model is an attempt to explain how the transition from small hair-like feathers to modern feathers with multiple tiers of branching occurred. A quick account of modern feather anatomy would go like this: Feathers have a central shaft called the rachis. Off of this shaft branch the tufts, which in turn branch off into small structures called barbules that are segmented like bamboo shoots. Stage 1 consists of individual filaments that are comparable to hair in terms of overall appearance. Stage 2 consists of multiple filaments that arise from a single base, forming barbs. Stage 3 is where feathers become branched structures, either by forming segmented barbules on their barbs or by forming barbs on their central shaft, the rachis, and then combining these features to make two tiers of branching. Stage 4 is where the barbules on each side of the barb were altered to connect barbs together and form a sheet or vaned feather. Stage 5 encompasses a wide range of finer alterations that actually permit powered flight and a wide range of additional uses for feathers. The notion of dinosaur specimens preserved in amber reminds me of Jurassic Park. Would what happened in that movie be plausible? What can we look forward to learning? Put simply, no. The specimens that we examined are extremely small and would not be expected to contain any DNA material. To put this into context, the only genetic material that has been recovered from amber is from lumps of mummified insect muscle tissue in much younger Dominican amber that are approximately 17 million years old and well after the age of dinosaurs. If we are able to obtain more material, we would really like to examine the chemical makeup of the protofeather-like specimens, as well as the pigments found within these specimens and other feathers. It would then be possible to investigate how much of the original feather material remains intact and gain a better understanding of the feathers' colors. Unfortunately, these investigations rely on being able to create small breaks within some of the specimens and examine them under very high magnifications, such as scanning electron microscopy, so they are not possible with the limited number of specimens that are currently available. A larger collection may also allow us to verify some of the other stages in feather evolution. ||||| Photo Color is coming to the formerly black-and-white Mesozoic world of dinosaurs and early birds. Not exactly high-definition color, and some formidable characters may show up in the same old drab and scaly wardrobes; they are dinosaurs, after all, with a reputation for resistance to change. But in time, you can look for splashes of color in museum dioramas of feathered figures from the age of dinosaurs. For more than a decade, hardly a season has passed without more discoveries of dinosaur and bird fossils in China bearing impressions of feathers and traces of chemical coloring agents. Now, in Canada, paleontologists have found 70-million-year-old amber preserving 11 specimens showing a wide diversity of feather types at that time. One specimen of so-called proto-feathers had a single bristlelike filament and some simple clusters. Others were complex structures with hooklike barbules that act like Velcro; in modern birds, this keeps feathers in place during dives. Still other specimens revealed feather patterns for flight and underwater diving. Preserved pigment cells encased in the amber, along with other evidence, suggested that the feathered animals had an array of mottled patterns and diffuse colors like modern birds, scientists at the University of Alberta, led by Ryan C. McKellar, said in a report published Thursday in the journal Science. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. McKellar’s team said the amber pieces, though small, “provide novel insights regarding feather formation.” The preserved filaments “display a wide range of pigmentation from nearly transparent to dark,” but “no larger-scale patterns are apparent.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"Amber, hardened tree resin, has allowed researchers to study ancient feathers from 70 million years ago, providing them with a new perspective on what some dinosaurs may have looked like. The preserved specimens offer various types of feathers, from simple to complex structures, which give insight into the evolution of these creatures. These discoveries reveal that dinosaurs had a more diverse array of feathers than initially believed. Researchers from the University of Alberta have analyzed the amber specimens found in western Canada, which contain simple filament structures similar to the earliest non-flying dinosaurs and more complicated bird feathers with pigmentation and adaptations for flight and diving. These findings, along with a separate report by Roy A. Wogelius of the University of Manchester, suggest that the colors of these ancient feathers included black, brown, and reddish-brown. The preserved pigment cells further indicate the possibility of mottled patterns and diffuse colors similar to modern birds. The specimens found entombed in 70-million-year-old amber represent distinct stages of feather evolution, from elementary protofeathers to more complex structures. These discoveries support the evolutionary model of feather development, shedding light on how the transition from simple hairs to modern feathers with multiple tiers of branching occurred."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formally apologized Wednesday for a shameful episode in Canada’s history, when this country turned away more than 900 German Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi terror and persecution. Canada’s 1939 refusal to grant asylum to the refugees on the MS St. Louis ocean liner and its callous attitude to what was unfolding in Europe was not only a dereliction of moral duty but helped embolden Adolf Hitler as he set about murdering millions of Jewish people, Mr. Trudeau said. “[Hitler] watched ... as we refused their visas, ignored their letters and denied them entry,” the Prime Minister told the House of Commons. Story continues below advertisement “There is little doubt that our silence permitted the Nazis to come up with their own final solution,\\" he said of the indifference and apathy shown by many countries toward the Jewish people at the time. In May, 1939, the St. Louis left Germany with passengers, including more than 900 Jewish German citizens seeking sanctuary. These refugees were barred from disembarking at the ship’s first destination in Cuba and then denied entry into the United States and finally Canada because of the government’s discriminatory “none is too many” immigration policy toward Jewish people, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a summary of the events. The U.S. State Department made its own apology in 2012. The Jewish passengers returned to Europe where many were later condemned to concentration camps, with 254 killed during the Holocaust. “To harbour such hatred and indifference towards the refugees was to share in the moral responsibility for their deaths,” Mr. Trudeau said. “We apologize to the 907 German Jews aboard the MS St. Louis, as well as their families,” the Prime Minister told the Commons. “We also apologize to others who paid the price of our inaction – whom we doomed to the ultimate horror of the death camps.” Jan Blumenstein, a survivor of Nazi concentration camps including Auschwitz, had a grandmother on the St. Louis – Regina Blumenstein – who ultimately died in the Holocaust. He was present for the apology. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement “Finally, somebody came to their senses and realized this is [still] going on all the time,\\" he said of the speech, saying it was important in that it acknowledged anti-Semitism remains strong. Canada’s refusal to accept the St. Louis passengers took place more than six months after the infamous Kristallnacht in November, 1938, when storm troopers and members of the Hitler Youth burned hundreds of synagogues, smashed thousands of shop windows and killed dozens of Jews. About 30,000 people were sent to concentration camps, the first large cohort of the millions who would be murdered. Mr. Trudeau warned of an “alarming rate” of discrimination and violence against Jewish people today. “According to the most recent figures, 17 per cent of all hate crimes in Canada target Jewish people – far higher per capita than any other group,” the Prime Minister said. “Holocaust deniers still exist. Anti-Semitism is still far too present. Jewish institutions and neighbourhoods are still being vandalized with swastikas,” he said. He cited the recent killing of 11 people and wounding of six others at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Story continues below advertisement “We must guard our communities and institutions against the kinds of evils that took hold in the hearts of so many, more than 70 years ago, for they did not end with the war,\\" Mr. Trudeau said. The Prime Minister also raised intimidation of Jewish students on some Canadian college and university campuses by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions [BDS] campaign against Israel that he said makes them feel “unwelcomed and uncomfortable.” The Prime Minister said the “long overdue” apology to the passengers of the St. Louis cannot erase the pain suffered by these refugees or those murdered in the Holocaust or their descendants. He said, however, he hopes it helps those hearing the apology to heal. “More than 70 years ago, Canada turned its back on you,” he said to Jewish people. “But today, Canadians pledge, now and forever: never again.\\" Andrew Scheer, the Conservative Leader of the Official Opposition, echoed this apology and warned of “a disturbing resurgence and even normalization of anti-Semitic rhetoric.\\" This hatred “was not eradicated with the defeat of the Nazis. It is, unfortunately and sadly, very much alive today,\\" he said. Story continues below advertisement Nimrod Barkan, Israel’s Ambassador to Canada, was on hand for Mr. Trudeau’s address and said he was grateful to the Prime Minister. “We are all encouraged not only by the apology but more so by the comments about the need to fight anti-Semitism today, to fight BDS and to make sure there is no hate for Jews allowed anywhere around the world, and certainly not in Canada.” With a report from Richard Blackwell ||||| Mr. Trudeau’s apology came less than two weeks after a gunman opened fire in a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11 worshipers, and at a time when anti-Semitism is rising across North America. It was not lost on many that it was delivered the day after an American election campaign marked by refugee-bashing. “The rhetoric we are hearing across the border is very similar to the rhetoric we heard in the 1930s — the vilification of the other, the vilification of the press. It’s really scary,” said Danny Gruner, who attended Wednesday’s apology with his mother, Ana Maria Gordon, the sole survivor of the St. Louis living in Canada today. Ms. Gordon, who met with Mr. Trudeau privately, was surrounded by many of her great-grandchildren and grandchildren. Last week, Mr. Trudeau apologized to a British Columbia First Nation for the government’s treachery in inviting six Tsilhqot’in chiefs to peace talks 150 years ago. Instead of talking, the government arrested them, put them on trial and hanged them. He has also apologized to Omar Khadr, the only Canadian who was held at the United States military base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. He emotionally apologized to gay members of the army, the police and in public service who were persecuted — some even imprisoned — because of their sexual orientation. And he tearfully said sorry to indigenous people in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, where for much of the 20th century indigenous children were torn from their families and compelled to attend boarding schools, where many were abused. “You will not remove the guilt from the perpetrators of the horror,” Mr. Gruner said. “But at least you can come to terms with what the country was at the time, and try to understand where we are at this particular time and where we want to be.” ||||| The Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler tested the limits of Canada's humanity in the lead up to the Second World War and Canada's government failed that test \\"miserably,\\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said today. The prime minister made the remarks as part of the apology delivered in the House of Commons for the 1939 decision by the Canadian government to turn away a boatload of German Jews seeking refuge from the Nazis. \\"In the years leading up to the war, Hitler tested the world's resolve. He noted carefully as country after country proved itself indifferent to the plight of Jewish refugees,\\" Trudeau said. Your country failed you. And for that, we are sorry. - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \\"He watched on as we refused their visas, ignored their letters and denied them entry. With every decree, he challenged the political courage of our leaders and the empathy of those who elected them. \\"With every pogrom, he tested the bounds of our humanity and the limits of our solidarity ... Adolf Hitler's test was one the Canadian government failed miserably.\\" In 1939, the MS St. Louis left Germany carrying 907 Jewish passengers fleeing persecution by the Nazi regime. The ship was turned away from Cuba and the United States before a group of Canadians tried to convince Prime Minister King's government to let it dock in Halifax. The Canadian government heeded the anti-Semitic sentiment abroad at the time by severely restricting Jewish immigration. From 1933 to 1945, only about 5,000 Jewish refugees were accepted because of Canada's discriminatory 'none is too many' immigration policy. When Ottawa refused to let the MS St. Louis passengers disembark, the ship returned to Europe. About half the passengers were taken in by the U.K., the Netherlands, France and Belgium. About 500 of them ended up back in Germany, where 254 were killed in concentration and internment camps. 'Their cries for help were left unanswered' \\"The story of the St. Louis and its passengers is no isolated incident,\\" Trudeau added. \\"The Government of Canada was indifferent to the suffering of Jews long before the St. Louis ever set sail for Halifax, and sadly, long after it had returned to Europe.\\" The prime minister went on to say the passengers of the MS St. Louis would have made Canada stronger but \\"their cries for help were left unanswered, for Canada deemed them unworthy of a home, and undeserving of our help.\\" Trudeau said that Hitler, alone, did not seal the fate of the passengers of the MS St. Louis or the Jewish populations of Europe because for Canada \\"To harbour such hatred and indifference towards the refugees was to share in the moral responsibility for their deaths.\\" The prime minister said that while decades have passed since the decision to turn away the MS St. Louis, the guilt or shame of rejecting the asylum seekers on that ship remains. 'Aliens in their own land' \\"Today, I rise in this House of Commons to issue a long overdue apology to the Jewish refugees Canada turned away,\\" Trudeau said. \\"We apologize to the 907 German Jews aboard the MS. St-Louis, as well as their families. We also apologize to others who paid the price of our inaction, whom we doomed to the ultimate horror of the death camps. \\"We used our laws to mask our anti-Semitism, our antipathy, our resentment. We are sorry for the callousness of Canada's response. And we are sorry for not apologizing sooner.\\" Trudeau also apologized for letting anti-Semitism take root in Canada and for the way Canadians Jews were \\"meant to feel like strangers in their own homes, aliens in their own land. \\"Your country failed you. And for that, we are sorry.\\" A persistent problem Trudeau went on to note that anti-Semitism continues to be a problem today in Canada. He said 17 per cent of all hate crimes target Canadian Jews — meaning the Jewish community experiences a far higher per-capita rate of hate crimes than any other group in Canada. \\"Discrimination and violence against Jewish people in Canada and around the world continues at an alarming rate,\\" he said. \\"Less than two weeks ago, not too far from here, a gunman opened fire on worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, killing eleven people and wounding six others.\\" Jewish passengers of the MS St. Louis, a refugee ship turned away from Canada in 1939, returned to Europe to face Nazi persecution and the Holocaust.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this question: what became the standard german term for the art song??","completion":"The standard German term for the art song is \\"Lied\\" (plural: Lieder). The Lied is a musical genre that emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in what is now considered the Romantic era of classical music. Its development was inspired by the convergence of poetry and music, as well as a blossoming interest in the expression of individual emotions, personal experiences, and introspection. As a musical form, the Lied typically consists of a German poem set to music for solo voice, usually accompanied by a piano. In some cases, other instrumental accompaniments or small ensembles can be utilized. One of the key features of the Lied is its focus on the narrative or emotional content of the poem, with the music composed to reflect, enhance, and sometimes even transcend the textual meaning. The emergence of the Lied as a popular genre can be attributed to composers such as Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann, who were among the first to delve into this expressive musical form. Schubert, in particular, is considered the pioneer of the Lied, having composed over 600 songs in this style throughout his career. His most famous works in this genre include the song cycles \\"Die schöne Müllerin\\" and \\"Winterreise.\\" Subsequent composers, such as Johannes Brahms, Hugo Wolf, and Richard Strauss, continued to develop and elevate the Lied to new artistic heights. These composers, along with their predecessors, skillfully explored the depth of human emotions, the beauty of nature, and the intricacies of personal relationships through their Lieder. Furthermore, they integrated diverse musical elements, such as advanced harmony, melody, rhythm, and form, to better serve the expressive requirements of the text. As the genre evolved, composers began to experiment with the thematic content and musical structure of the Lied to create more sophisticated and multi-layered pieces. Some Lieder became highly complex, with intricate piano accompaniments and virtuosic vocal lines, while others remained simple and intimate. This diversity and adaptability of the Lied as a genre allowed it to maintain its relevance throughout the Romantic period and beyond, as it continued to be explored by composers of various nationalities and stylistic tendencies. In conclusion, the standard German term for the art song is \\"Lied,\\" a genre that emerged in the Romantic era as a result of the blending of poetry and music. It has played a significant role in the evolution of classical music and continues to be an essential part of the solo vocal repertoire, thanks to the groundbreaking works by composers like Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Hugo Wolf, and Richard Strauss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no' Input: CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : Many years ago I was a drug addict. I ended up homeless, penniless and majorly depressed. My older sister, Jane, told me to figure my life out and hung up on me. My oldest sister, Ann, drove down to pick me up and she gave me a place to stay. I think she saved my life that day. I ended up staying with her rent free for 2 years. During that time she also helped me in my personal life, kept me away from my abusive ex and addicted friends, found me a full time job and straightened out my life. I owe her so much. I'm thankful for all she did for me and that she didn't give up on me that day. It's been a few years since I moved out but we're still very close now. ​ When Ann got married I threw myself into the wedding planning. I wanted to repay her kindness for me. I bought and decorated her wedding shoes, sewed her daughter's dress for the wedding, baked her wedding cake, cupcakes and eclairs for her guests. I also DIYed her centerpieces for the tables. I was very involved in her wedding. Now Jane is getting married and she expected me to be as involved in her wedding as I was with Ann, but I'm not. I'm tired from working and I just don't want to bake a cake and other desserts for 70+ guests again. I told her she could reuse the centerpieces for her wedding but she wants completely new ones even though I kept them in really good condition. When Jane found out that I'm not keen on baking or crafting new center pieces for her wedding she complained that I was being unfair and showing favoritism. She tried begging but I continued to decline and said the reason I helped Ann with her wedding so much was to repay her kindness during the time I was homeless. Now Jane thinks I'm punishing her because she didn't help me out when I was homeless. That's not true. We buried the hatchet and forgave each other a long time ago.

London (AFP) - British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen and his wife are donating 1 million (900,000 euros) to help Syrian refugees, the charities receiving the money announced Sunday. The \\"Borat\\" star and actress wife Isla Fisher are giving 500,000 to Save the Children to pay for measles vaccinations for children in northern Syria. They are also donating the same amount to the International Rescue Committee (IRC) to help refugees in Syria and neighbouring countries, particularly women and children, with health care, shelter and sanitation. More than four million refugees have fled conflict in Syria for the relative safety of the neighbouring countries, according to the United Nations. Millions more have been forced to leave their homes for other parts of the country. Justin Forsyth, chief executive of Save the Children, said the money would \\"save many thousands of lives and protect some of the most vulnerable children\\". \\"By allowing us to make their generous donation to Syrian children public, Sacha and Isla are helping highlight the tragedy of the issue today,\\" he added. David Miliband, the ex-British foreign secretary who is president of the IRC, called their gift a \\"great expression of humanity.\\" ||||| Today Sacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher have made a 1 million donation split equally between Save the Children and the International Rescue Committee to support victims of the conflict in Syria. Donate now to help us provide food, water, medicine and education to Syrian children. Today Sacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher have made a 1 million donation split equally between Save the Children and the International Rescue Committee to support victims of the conflict in Syria. 500,000 Dollars will be used to fund a programme vaccinating more than 250,000 children against a potential measles outbreak in Northern Syria. The other half of the donation will be used to help fund the work to support families, with a special concern for women and children, both inside Syria and in neighbouring countries who are suffering as a result of the ongoing conflict. The money will go towards education, health care, shelter and sanitation. There are currently four million refugees in neighbouring states and over seven million displaced inside Syria. It has been estimated that around 12,000 children have been killed in the conflict and the real number may be much higher. Some sources have indicated that thousands of children have been killed by barrel bombs alone. Justin Forsyth, Save the Children CEO, said: “The Syrian conflict is now approaching its fifth year and children are the first victims. There is no safe place left in Syria, with shelling and violence omnipresent. Food and medicines have become scarce and basic necessities unaffordable. Syria’s health system has collapsed and deadly childhood diseases – like measles - which had previously been all but eradicated have now returned, threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of children. By allowing us to make their generous donation to Syrian children public, Sacha and Isla are helping highlight the tragedy of the issue today. These are desperate times for Syrian families facing bombs, bullets and torture in Syria. The couple’s donation will save many thousands of lives and protect some of the most vulnerable children.” David Miliband, president and CEO of the international rescue committee (IRC) said: \\"Now is the time for all of us to double down on commitments to civilians caught up in the Syria conflict. These people are the victims of terror. As hope for the end of conflict recedes, it is all the more important to meet the most basic human needs. Sacha and Isla's donation is a great expression of humanity, and a challenge to do more for the most vulnerable.

Question: What is the setting of this story? Movie title: The Talented Mr. Ripley Movie plot: Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s New York City. While playing piano at a cocktail party in New York City, he is approached by wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley went to Princeton University with his son, Dickie, because Ripley is wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley 1,000 (equivalent to 8,834 in 2015). Ripley accepts the proposal, even though he did not attend Princeton and has never met Dickie. Upon arriving by ship in Europe, Ripley meets a wealthy textile heiress named Meredith Logue. During their brief conversation, he impulsively pretends to be Dickie, later commenting in voice-over that \\"it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley fakes a chance encounter on the beach with Dickie and his fiancÃ©e, Marge Sherwood. Ripley later discloses to Dickie and Marge that Mr. Greenleaf paid him to travel to Europe and persuade Dickie to return home. This revelation infuriates Dickie; he declines the invitation and suggests Ripley go back to America and inform his father that he has no intention of ever returning. Ripley instead ingratiates himself into Dickie's life under the pretext of being a fellow jazz lover. The two concoct a scheme for Ripley to wring additional funds from Greenleaf by regularly mailing letters suggesting Dickie is wavering and will likely return to America if Ripley can remain in Italy and continue applying pressure. On a jaunt to Rome, Ripley meets Dickie's friend Freddie Miles, who treats Ripley with barely concealed contempt. A local girl, pregnant by Dickie, drowns herself after he refuses to help her financially; this sends Dickie into a downward spiral. He begins tiring of Ripley, resenting his constant presence and suffocating dependence. Ripley's own feelings are complicated by his desire to maintain the opulent lifestyle Dickie has...

We were there June 6, and around 830PM, we decided to walk in the Verona Restaurant, since we wanted a nice dinner for my husband's birthday. The hostess that sat us promptly was gracious, and said someone would be there shortly with water. We waited about 5 minutes for water. Our waiter Peter must of been having an off night, or support staff wasn't there. I cannot think of too many reasons for how were treated during our meal there. First of all, the ambiance of the restaurant is nice, the booths just a bit nicer with the nice leather seating. The ceiling has a nice alabaster light, but it seemed to be right on our table. Perhaps at a later hour they dim the lights? Before we were even acknowledged by Peter, our waiter, or anyone with a glass a water was probably a good 5-6 minutes after we sat down. At least get a person a glass of water. When Peter came over, we had plenty of time to review the menus, as the hostess had given those when we first sat down. Peter ran through the menu, offered to get drinks. My husband decided on water, and I requested a cup of coffee with cream. We placed our order, hubby had the NY steak with the Potatoes Rustica, and I had the 8oz Ribeye with Baby Vegetables(broccalini). The redeeming quality of this place WAS the food. I had to ask for my coffee again, I was just about done with dinner. We were NEVER EVEN ASKED ONCE HOW OUR FOOD WAS. NOT ONCE. I am so disappointed in this place. I thought we might of found a nice, dress up nice and have a celebration dinner, as my husband wanted a casino night for his birthday. It seemed our bread came late... while the rolls are good, you get a couple, I hesitated to even think of asking for any more. Our water glasses were never refilled(glasses completely OUT of water), wait-staff never asked how things went with us.... ANYTHING to acknowledge that we were even there. I believe it was the manager that refilled our glasses about 5 minutes before we left. Perhaps we weren't high-rollers? I don't know the answer to that one. I do know that the party next to us, had a wonderful waitress, and she communicated with them. We never asked for anything out of the ordinary, we were dressed appropriately for a nice restaurant, and we have dined in nice places before, and never been treated so poorly. We never demanded anything, didn't order something not on the menu, we weren't demanding in any way shape or form. WAIT! We asked for bread after the salad arrived, maybe that was it?? We had been there around 30-35 minutes when we requested bread..We almost had consumed the salad and from experience, you usually will get a selection of bread. Although, once the bread arrived, Stephen did an awesome job preparing the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It was good. I think that perhaps they realized that things were basically not salvageable, as Peter said when he dropped off the dinner check, and hurried off, \\"the coffee is free\\" said as he passed by the table. Weird. I wouldn't go back to the restaurant. I had hoped for a place where you are treated well, and the food good. I have to say that the prices, I thought we reasonable, my 8OZ Ribeye was 17, with one side included. We ordered an In Casa Ensalta(sp) - 8- which was pretty good. The food isn't the problem, at least not on June 6, 2009, it was either the staffing wasn't sufficent - it should've of been... It was Saturday night. They should expect more diners on a weekend night, and staff accordingly. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?","completion":"This review can be described as having mixed sentiment. The reviewer gives the restaurant two stars and expresses a mostly negative sentiment towards the service they experienced from their waiter, Peter, and the overall dining experience. They mention long waiting times for water and bread, insufficient attention from the staff, and lack of communication on how their meal was. Additionally, they express disappointment in not being treated well, possibly due to not being perceived as high-rollers. However, the sentiment shifts to positive when discussing the food, which the reviewer considers as the redeeming quality of the restaurant, and they find the prices reasonable. They compliment the dishes they ordered, namely the NY steak, Potatoes Rustica, Ribeye, Baby Vegetables, and In Casa Ensalata. In summary, the sentiment of the review is mixed, with positive sentiment about the food, ambiance, and pricing, but negative sentiment about the service and overall experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He offers D 500,000 as a down payment, and offers him 10mil if he carries out the job. D has Elbourne double the payment, and agrees to search for Charlotte. At the same time, Charlotte's older brother hires another group of vampire hunters, the notorious Marcus brothers, composed of the leader Borgoff, a hulking man named Nolt, a blade master named Kyle, a physically disabled psychic named Grove and a woman named Leila who hunts vampires because of a personal grudge rather than for monetary gain. The two parties (D and the Marcus brothers) race inexorably after Meier Link. However, Meier Link hires the mutant Barbarois; a group of lethal mercenary body guards. They consist of Caroline, a shape shifter; Benge, a shadow manipulator; and Machira, a werewolf.

I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies.

Further visits by other English explorers followed, and, once Saint Helena’s location was more widely known, English ships of war began to lie in wait in the area to attack Portuguese India carracks on their way home. In developing their Far East trade, the Dutch also began to frequent the island.

Barron initially accused Lohan of 'masterminding the alleged attack' Paris' brother is now said to be planning to sue both Lohan and LeMoine. LeMoine is now said to be 'on the run from authorities... and is attempting to seek refuge in Cuba'","completion":"Title: The Imminent Disturbance: How LeMoine's Arrest is Churning Waves in Celebrity Circles Introduction Law enforcement sources have recently stated that the arrest of Ray LeMoine is 'imminent,' following allegations made by Barron Hilton - brother of Paris Hilton - that actress Lindsay Lohan had 'masterminded the alleged attack' on him. The situation is further complicated by reports that LeMoine, now considered a fugitive, is attempting to evade the authorities by seeking refuge in Cuba. With Barron planning to sue both Lohan and LeMoine, the case continues to gain prominence amidst the ongoing turbulence in Hollywood's elite circles. The Mastermind Controversy The alleged incident involving Barron Hilton and Lindsay Lohan has been one of the most controversial episodes within the Hollywood community in recent times. According to numerous reports, Barron, who is Paris Hilton's younger brother, has accused the Mean Girls actress of orchestrating an attack on him in Miami late last year. It was claimed that Lohan had instructed her close acquaintance, Ray LeMoine, to assault Barron in an altercation that left the young Hilton sibling with several bruises and cuts. Despite initial denials from Lohan and her representatives, several witnesses have come forward claiming to have seen the actress egging LeMoine on during the attack. This has understandably increased the pressure on law enforcement agencies to arrest those involved and bring them to justice. Imminent Arrest and Legal Battle With mounting evidence against both Lohan and LeMoine, the authorities have declared that the arrest of LeMoine is now imminent, with several law enforcement sources stating that they are closing in on the perpetrator. The arrest is expected to have a significant impact on Lohan's career, who has been making strides toward revitalizing her public image in recent years. Meanwhile, Paris Hilton's brother is reportedly preparing to take legal action against both Lohan and LeMoine. If found guilty, the two celebrities could face substantial financial penalties as well as further damage to their already tarnished reputations. The Fugitive: LeMoine's Escape to Cuba As the net slowly tightens around him, reports suggest that Ray LeMoine is currently 'on the run from authorities' and is attempting to seek refuge in Cuba. Cuba has a complex legal relationship with the United States, making it a potential safe haven for fugitives looking to escape the arm of the law. While the details of LeMoine's potential escape plan are still murky, it is clear that both law enforcement agencies and the Hilton family will be keeping a close eye on developments in the case. If LeMoine is apprehended, it could act as a new chapter in the legal battle against Lindsay Lohan and her alleged involvement in the attack. Conclusion: While facts surrounding the case continue to emerge, the imminent arrest of Ray LeMoine and the potential lawsuit against both him and Lohan by Barron Hilton has the potential to significantly reshape the careers, lives, and reputations of all parties involved. As LeMoine allegedly plans his escape to Cuba, the implications of such developments are sure to send shockwaves throughout Hollywood's elite circles and add yet another complex layer to an already complicated set of circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Most people think that the older you get, the harder it is to learn a new language. That is, they believe that children learn more easily and efficiently than adults. Thus, at some point in our lives, maybe around age 12 or 13, we lose the ability to learn languages well. Is this idea a fact or myth ? Is it true that children learn a foreign language more efficiently than adults? On the contrary, research studies suggest that the opposite may be true. One report, on 2,000 Danish children studying Swedish, concluded that the teenagers learned more, in less time, than the younger children. Another report, on Americans learning Russian, showed a direct improvement of ability over the age range tested; that is, the ability to learn increased as the age increased, from childhood to adulthood. There are several possible explanations for these findings. For one thing, adults know more about the world and therefore are able to understand meanings more easily than children. Moreover, adults can use logical thinking to help themselves see patterns in the language. Finally, adults have more self-discipline (self-control) than children.

She has no time for toys, and refuses to be treated as a child. During a blizzard on Christmas Eve, Lisa is transported to Toyland. She arrives just before Mary Contrary (Jill Schoelen) is to be wedded to the unpleasant Barnaby Barnacle (Richard Mulligan), although Mary loves Barnaby's nephew, Jack Nimble (Keanu Reeves). Lisa stops the wedding and, with her new friends, finds out that Barnaby plans to take over Toyland. Lisa, Mary, Jack, and Georgie Porgie (Googy Gress) go to the kindly Toymaster (Pat Morita) for help, but he can only help them if Lisa really believes in toys. Barnaby confronts them and the Toymaster, finally showing his true colors, and steals a flask containing distilled evil that the Toymaster had been collecting, before leaving Lisa and company to be eaten by Trollog, a vulture-like monster with a single enchanted eye that Barnaby uses to spy on his enemies. They escape by blinding Trollog with paint and locking him in a chest, but are captured and imprisoned one by one in Barnaby's hidden fortress. Barnaby reveals that he had been creating an army of trolls to take over Toyland, and then attempts to corrupt his captives into being his servants with the contents of the flask, stating he would replace Trollog with Lisa and make Mary his Troll Princess. Lisa, however, proves to be immune to the evil, and manages to reverse the effects on her friends. After escaping from Barnaby's stronghold, they return to the Toymaster. When Barnaby unleashes his army of trolls upon Toyland, Lisa's newfound belief animates an army of life-sized toy soldiers that the Toymaster had created, and they drive Barnaby into the Forest of the Night.

In both sentences, the word \\"bear\\" is used as a verb; however, the context and meaning of the word are different in each sentence. Let's examine these uses further: 1. Bear a resemblance: In this sentence, \\"bear\\" is used to mean \\"to have or exhibit a similar appearance or quality.\\" The phrase \\"bear a resemblance\\" is often used to describe similarities between people, objects, or features. In this case, \\"bear\\" implies the act of possessing or presenting similar characteristics with someone or something else. 2. The unidentified plant bore gorgeous flowers: In this sentence, \\"bear\\" is used in the context of producing or yielding something, in this case, flowers. The word \\"bore\\" is the past tense of \\"bear\\" here, and the meaning is to generate, give rise to, or grow, specifically referring to the flowers on the unidentified plant. This usage is common in describing plants or trees that produce fruit, flowers, or leaves. In conclusion, while both sentences use the same base word, \\"bear,\\" the definitions and context in which they are used are different. The first sentence employs the word to convey similarities in appearance, while the second sentence uses \\"bear\\" to describe the act of producing or yielding physical growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Megan's memory is a lot sharper than Rebecca's is due to","completion":"several factors that contribute to the differences in their cognitive abilities. These factors can be broadly categorized into genetic, environmental, lifestyle, and cognitive factors that interact in various ways to shape an individual's memory and cognitive proficiency. 1. Genetic factors: Genetics play a significant role in determining a person's memory capacity and cognitive skills. Megan may have inherited strong genetic traits from her parents that contribute to a superior memory. On the other hand, Rebecca's genetic makeup may not be as strongly inclined toward an enhanced memory, making a difference in their cognitive abilities. 2. Environmental factors: The environment in which Megan and Rebecca were raised can be another crucial factor for the difference in their memory. If Megan was exposed to a stimulating and engaging environment from an early age, her brain would have developed stronger neural connections necessary for better memory retention. In contrast, Rebecca might not have had the same level of exposure to fruitful environmental stimuli, leading to her weaker memory compared to Megan's. 3. Lifestyle factors: The impact of lifestyle on memory and cognitive skills cannot be overemphasized. Factors like proper nutrition, regular exercise, and quality sleep contribute significantly to brain health and cognitive prowess. Megan might have maintained a healthy lifestyle, allowing her brain to function optimally and, in turn, enhancing her memory. On the contrary, Rebecca could have neglected essential lifestyle practices, putting her at a disadvantage when it comes to memory and cognitive skills. 4. Cognitive training: Megan's superior memory could also be attributed to her proactive approach to cognitive training. She may have consistently engaged in activities like puzzles, memory games, and other mental exercises aimed at improving memory retention and cognitive flexibility. These practices eventually strengthened Megan's memory over time. At the same time, Rebecca might not have partaken in such activities, leading to the disparity in their cognitive capabilities. 5. Emotional wellbeing: Emotional health can have a considerable impact on memory and overall cognitive function. High levels of stress and anxiety can impair memory retention and recall. Megan might have an effective coping mechanism to deal with stress, ensuring her emotional wellbeing and, in turn, positively impacting her memory. On the other hand, Rebecca might struggle with emotional management, leading to a diminished memory capacity. 6. Interest and motivation: Lastly, the level of interest and motivation in acquiring new information can influence memory retention. If Megan is more motivated to learn and invests more effort into encoding and retaining information, her memory will naturally be sharper than Rebecca's. If Rebecca lacks the same enthusiasm or eagerness, her memory performance will suffer in comparison. In conclusion, Megan's sharper memory compared to Rebecca's can be attributed to a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, lifestyle, cognitive, emotional, and motivational factors. By understanding these factors and working on self-improvement in these areas, Rebecca might be able to enhance her memory and attune her cognitive skills to match Megan's level. However, it is important to remember that everyone's memory capacity and cognitive abilities are unique, and the focus should be on developing to one's full potential."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Attorney General Biden submitted the following letter to the editor to the Wilmington News Journal on April 2, 2014. Letter to the Editor John Sweeney The News Journal 950 W. Basin Road New Castle, DE 19720 Child sexual abuse cases are among the most serious cases a prosecutor handles. The harm to the victim is profound. A child is vulnerable, and never more so than when the perpetrator is a parent. Juxtaposed against the severity of the crime is the difficulty proving it in a court of law. When a child reports sexual abuse, it is often that child’s word against the word of the alleged perpetrator. Authorities who receive reports of abuse ensure that children are interviewed by the Children’s Advocacy Center, where an expert questions the child. Often, however, the child has made previous statements to members of his or her family, and frequently those statements differ in some respects. This is particularly true with very young children, who are on the cusp of being capable of relating an event in detail. The younger the child, the less detailed the account is likely to be. Authorities look for corroborating evidence to support the report of abuse. They search for forensic evidence, such as DNA. They look for medical evidence of abuse. When the abuse occurs on a date prior to the report and investigation, there is rarely forensic evidence available. Moreover, unless the abuse alleged is an act likely to inflict physical injury, evidence of medical trauma is likewise rare. Therefore, in child sexual abuse cases, the sum total of the evidence is often the word of the child against the word of the alleged perpetrator. The State bears the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the highest standard in our justice system. For the State to meet that burden, the child must testify because a defendant has a Sixth Amendment constitutional right to confront witnesses against him. This means that the child must testify in a sterile courtroom before a room full of strangers. Before the child can even testify, the court must be satisfied that the child is competent, that is, whether the child knows the difference between right and wrong. This determination is made after the court questions the child. Assuming the child is deemed competent, the child faces additional trauma by having to recount the abuse in front of the very person who committed it. Trials generally occur several months to a year after the event. All memories fade with time, a child’s in particular. For these reasons, a prosecutor’s decision about whether to take a child sexual abuse case to trial or to resolve it through a negotiated plea requires the striking of a difficult balance. If the case proceeds to trial, and the jury returns a not guilty verdict, this means that the alleged perpetrator will walk away free, with no conditions attached. There will be no punishment. The defendant will not be required to register as a sex offender, will not be supervised by probation and parole, and will not receive sexual offense counseling. Indeed, he is free to resume his life, free to contact the child and to reenter the residence and resume his former life, absent a separate Family Court order to the contrary. All of these considerations were in the mind of the prosecutor assigned to this case. This was not a strong case, and a loss at trial was a distinct possibility. The only eyewitness to the crime was the four year old victim. There was no medical or forensic evidence of any kind. The defendant did not make a statement to the police, although he made an ambiguous apology to the victim’s mother. A conviction would have required twelve jurors to find unanimously, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the crime had occurred. In recognition of the weakness of the case, the assigned prosecutor offered a plea and sentence recommendation that guaranteed the defendant would be required to register as a sex offender, participate in court-ordered sex offender rehabilitation therapy and to have no contact with the victim and any other child under the age of sixteen. A loss at trial would have rendered any of these restrictions impossible. The judge who considered the appropriate sentence in this case did so after careful deliberation with due regard for all of the circumstances. The Truth in Sentencing Guidelines, which judges use to inform their exercise of discretion, called for a sentence of 0 to 22 months in jail. The Defendant had already entered treatment. The Defendant accepted responsibility. These factors are listed in the Guidelines as mitigators that the Court must take into account. Moreover, the parties had agreed upon the recommendation to the Court. The judge acted properly by imposing a sentence that placed the Defendant under supervision for a lengthy period of time, required him to complete counseling, placed him on the sex offender registry and prevented him from contacting the victim and any other child. Judge Jurden is an outstanding jurist. She carefully considers the salient factors in all criminal cases without any regard for wealth or social status. In this case, Judge Jurden exercised sound discretion based solely on the merits of the case before her. Nothing is more important than protecting children from harm. That is why I ran for office in the first place. One of my first acts in office was to create the Child Predator Task Force which, for the first time in Delaware, puts police and prosecutors side by side to identify and bring to justice the worst predators in society – those who seek to hurt Delaware’s children. This work has led to the convictions of more than 180 predators and the rescue of more than 120 children who were being abused or groomed for future abuse. This past year, with the help of the legislature, we created the Child Victims Unit to provide more effective investigation and prosecution of child death and injury cases. We have fought successfully for new laws that impose tough mandatory sentences on child pornographers, and this year, I am working with legislators to give kids targeted by predators even stronger protections. I commend the hard working, dedicated prosecutors who strive to achieve justice in each and every case. We will continue to fight for children. Sincerely, Joseph R. Biden, III Attorney General ||||| Buy Photo Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden (Photo: JENNIFER CORBETT/THE NEWS JOURNAL)Buy Photo Story Highlights Online petition seeking Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden's ouster has received more than 25,400 signatures. But allies in the legal community, defense lawyers as well as prosecutors, have rallied to her defense. Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden's decision to order probation instead of prison for a du Pont family heir who raped his young daughter has led to threats against her and calls for her removal from the bench. But allies in the legal community have rallied to her defense. Much of the outrage over Jurden's 2009 sentencing of Robert H. Richards IV for fourth-degree rape was over her notation that he would not \\"fare well'' in prison, a mitigating factor that she identified in her order. Delaware prosecutors and defense attorneys have said it is unusual for a judge to list someone's fitness for prison as a mitigator in a sentencing order, even though it is often argued that a frail or sickly defendant might get abused or suffer unduly in prison. Richards is the great-grandson of du Pont family patriarch Irenee du Pont and the son of Robert H. Richards III, a retired partner in the Richards Layton & Finger law firm. Story: Beau Biden defends handling of du Pont heir sex case Commentary: Beau Biden's letter on du Pont heir case Commentary: Take into account entire sentencing process Our view: Real questions about the Richards case Earlier story: Police investigated du Pont sex abuse claim Earlier story: Du Pont heir faces child sex lawsuit His case gained publicity last month when his ex-wife, Tracy, filed a lawsuit seeking damages for the rape of his daughter when she was three years old, and also claimed he sexually abused his toddler son. Police investigated claims about the son in 2010, but they said no charges were filed. Authorities said they will investigate the allegations in the lawsuit. The controversy surrounding Jurden erupted after a Sunday News Journal article about her sentence. She sentenced Richards to eight years in prison, but suspended the time behind bars for probation. Among other provisions, she ordered him to get sex offender's evaluation and treatment, and not to have contact with children under 16. Attorney General Beau Biden's office, which had originally charged him with two counts of second-degree rape punishable by a minimum prison term of 20 years, had given Richards the plea deal to fourth-degree rape and recommended probation. The story gained international attention, leading to at least three online petitions for Jurden's ouster. Emily Logan, director of activism and retention for www.Care2.com, said the site allows people across the globe to post petitions on a range of issues. One seeking Jurden's ouster has received more than 25,400 online signatures through Wednesday afternoon. \\"It's pretty crazy. It's our hottest petition right now,'' said Logan, who added that her group supports the petition. \\"Sexual assault and child abuse is something people are very passionate about,'' Logan said. \\"This petition focuses on the fact that this was a du Pont heir and it's a sort of 'money talks' situation where they were like, 'Oh, he has a bunch of money and we'll let him sit in his house.' The initial outrage is that suspending the sentence and that treatment should come first rather than prison wasn't proper punishment.'' While some want Jurden off the bench, others have threatened her, leading the state to provide her with security, said Patricia W. Griffin, state court administrator. \\"It's an ongoing investigation. We are taking the threats seriously, and making sure the judge is secured,'' Griffin said. Robert H. Richards IV, a du Pont family heir who raped his 3-year-old daughter nearly a decade ago but received no prison time now faces a lawsuit from his former wife that accuses him of sexually abusing his toddler son. (3/18/14) Jurden, who was appointed to a 12-year-term in 2001 and reappointed by Gov. Jack Markell last year, also applied to become a Supreme Court justice. Markell gave the seat to former Court of Chancery chief judge Leo E. Strine Jr. last month. Markell will have another appointment following the recent retirement announcement by Justice Jack Jacobs. Some in Delaware's legal community rushed to Jurden's defense. Bartholomew J. Dalton, former chief deputy attorney general and head of the sex crimes unit, reiterated a point others have made about the difficulty in proving child sex abuse cases involving relatives. Those cases can lead to plea bargains and probation for defendants, he said. Such deals don't make prosecutors happy, but can result in a felony conviction and listing the criminal on the state sex offenders registry, he said. \\"As someone who has prosecuted sexual abuse and continues to represent child sexual abuse victims, I can tell you there are few, if any, judges who I think would do as good a job as Jan Jurden on an everyday basis,'' Dalton said. \\"Now she's getting death threats because of her administration of justice when she was absolutely within sentencing guidelines and was following the recommendation of the the prosecutor. It's just incredibly unfair.'' Biden's office has not said why the deal was cut, and a redacted version of the court file does not offer details. But top aides to Biden have said it's extremely difficult to put a young child on the witness stand, where they would face cross-examination and further victimization. Richards' attorney, Eguene J. Maurer Jr., said Wednesday the state had no physical evidence to corroborate the claims of the child, and offered a deal that did not include mandatory prison time. While he argued at sentencing that Richards should receive probation and inpatient treatment, Maurer said he was concerned that Jurden might send his client to prison. \\"I can think of one case of vehicular homicide involving a young girl. I thought we were going to get three years and she gave nine years. She is tough on our side and tough on their side. She is intelligent, reasonable. You are not going to get a better judge.'' Former Superior Court Judge Peggy Ableman said prosecutors were likely hamstrung in the Richards case because the victim was so young . \\"A child is going to be absolutely the worst witness,'' Ableman said. \\"You have no idea what they are going to say or not say.'' Ableman said she did not know why Jurden noted the factor in her order that Richards would not \\"fare well'' in prison, but said her decision to sentence him to probation makes sense. While judges have the authority to levy sentences within statutory guidelines, they are urged to follow more lenient guidelines published by the Delaware Sentencing Accountability Commission, a group of judges and top state criminal justice officials. For the crime of fourth-degree rape, the recommended sentence is zero to 30 months in prison. \\"If you are routinely not following what the state recommends, then the defense attorney cannot say to their client, 'I think you should take this deal because the judge will probably do what the state recommends.' If the judge is going to be a loose cannon, you are not going to get pleas.'' Regardless of Jurden's decision in the Richards' case, Ableman said she is a credit to the bench. \\"She doesn't deserve to be painted in such an awful way. She is a very caring person and she is very concerned about children and children's rights.\\" Contact senior reporter Cris Barrish at (302) 324-2785, cbarrish@delawareonline.com or on Facebook.

Biden and his team had prosecuted. The case involved a young child who had been sexually abused by a parent, and the office had faced the difficult task of deciding whether to take the case to trial or resolve it through a negotiated plea. The decision was complicated by the fact that the only evidence in the case was the child's word against that of the alleged perpetrator, and the difficulties that can arise when trying to put a young child on the witness stand. In the end, the assigned prosecutor offered a plea agreement that guaranteed the defendant would be required to register as a sex offender, participate in court-ordered rehabilitation therapy, and have no contact with the victim and any other child under the age of 16. The judge who sentenced the defendant took into account the Truth in Sentencing Guidelines and various mitigating factors, such as the defendant's acceptance of responsibility and his agreement to the recommended sentence. The judge ultimately imposed a sentence that placed the defendant under supervision for a lengthy period of time, required him to complete counseling, placed him on the sex offender registry, and prevented him from contacting the victim and any other child. Biden highlighted the challenges involved in prosecuting child sexual abuse cases, including the lack of medical or forensic evidence, and the need for the child to testify in open court. He also discussed measures his office had taken to better protect and serve children, such as the creation of the Child Predator Task Force and the Child Victims Unit, as well as the passage of new laws imposing mandatory sentences on child pornographers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ok , so the panic hit me I yelled out I am going to drown if you do n't get over here . Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: What might happen if no one helps the writer and child ?","completion":"In the passage, the writer explicitly states their struggle and fear while swimming with the extra weight of their three-year-old son. They are experiencing fatigue and the desperate need for help. If no one comes to their aid, the following scenarios are highly probable: 1. Drowning: The writer repeatedly emphasizes their fear of drowning if they don't receive assistance. They state, \\"if you don't get over here, I am going to drown.\\" Moreover, they mention the panic setting in, making the situation even more perilous. Therefore, it is deducible that not getting help could lead to the tragic outcome of both the writer and their child drowning. 2. Exhaustion: The writer alludes to their weariness and the strain that comes with struggling to swim while carrying a child. An inability to find help will likely exacerbate the writer's exhaustion, putting both of them in a vulnerable situation and increasing the risk of drowning. 3. Emotional distress: Since the writer is yelling for help with increasing strength and passion, it is evident that they feel desperate and emotionally distressed. The absence of timely help will further amplify and prolong this emotional turmoil, which could have lasting effects on both the writer and the child. 4. Hypothermia: The passage doesn't provide specific details about the temperature and location; however, if this ordeal occurs in cold water, the writer and the child might be at risk of developing hypothermia. The longer they remain in the water without aid, the greater the likelihood of experiencing the dangerous effects of cold exposure. In conclusion, without help, the writer and child face possible drowning, exhaustion, emotional distress, and even hypothermia. This highlights the urgency in the writer's plea for assistance and the potential dire consequences should they not receive it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Feeling a mix of excitement and anxiousness, the woman carefully sits up and slides her legs off of the table. She takes a deep breath, gathering her composure, and stands up to face the mirror on the wall. As she observes her new belly button piercing in the mirror, she can't help but smile. The glint of the earring against her skin leaves her satisfied and proud of taking this step. She feels an added sense of confidence and self-expression that the piercing brings. She delicately touches the area around the piercing, feeling the soft, cool metal, and marvels at how it accentuates her body. The woman's eyes meet her own in the mirror, and she experiences a rush of emotions – joy, empowerment, and even a sense of newfound identity. The piercing not only serves as a reflection of her individuality but also as a symbol of her bravery in embracing it. Taking a moment to silently cherish the experience, she inhales deeply and decides to thank the piercer for their exceptional work. Then, as she leaves the piercing studio, she promises herself to hold onto and remember the feeling of bravery and self-assurance she gained today. This seemingly small yet meaningful act of body modification serves as a reminder to the woman that she has the power and courage within herself to make her own decisions, express her true essence, and embrace her authentic self with confidence and pride."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

LONDON, England -- Graffiti artist Banksy, famed for infiltrating museum collections without their knowledge and spray-painting public buildings around the world, is holding his first major exhibition in years. A Banksy painting of the British House of Commons at England's Bristol museum. This time, however, the anonymous artist worked in tandem with the director of Bristol museum in the UK. CNN's Max Foster got a preview of his largest project to date. The artist's anonymity gained him notoriety and he became one of the art world's biggest names with his works selling at auction for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The exhibition's range, while very varied, remained true to Banksy form with his usual unconventional take on art.

I can use this background: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. Now, I have a new situation: People from two villages ate lots of salt. People from Salt village used regular salt, while people from Sand village people used iodized salt in their diets, after talking to specialists. Answer this question please: Which village had fewer people experience developmental difficulties? Answer:","completion":"The Sand village had fewer people experience developmental difficulties. Step 1: Understand the background information. In the given background, it is mentioned that before iodized salt was developed, people experienced developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. Adding iodide anion to the diet helped treat these conditions. Step 2: Analyze the new situation. In the new situation, people from Salt village used regular salt, while people from Sand village used iodized salt in their diets after talking to specialists. Step 3: Apply the background information to the new situation. Since iodized salt contains iodide anion, which is beneficial in preventing developmental difficulties, people consuming iodized salt, i.e., the residents of Sand village, are more likely to have fewer developmental issues when compared to the residents of Salt village, who used regular salt that lacks the iodide anion. Conclusion: The Sand village, where people used iodized salt, had fewer people experience developmental difficulties compared to the Salt village."},{"prompt":"Definition: You are given an original reference as well as a system reference.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What kingdom maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity with Makuria? ? Alodia, also known as Alwa (Greek: Aρουα, Aroua; Arabic: علوة‎, ʿAlwa), was a medieval Nubian kingdom in what is now central and southern Sudan. Its capital was the city of Soba, located near modern-day Khartoum at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers. Founded sometime after the ancient kingdom of Kush fell, in around 350 AD, Alodia is first mentioned in historical records in 569. It was the last of the three Nubian kingdoms to convert to Christianity in 580 following Nobadia and Makuria. It possibly reached its peak during the 9th–12th centuries when records show that it exceeded its northern neighbor, Makuria, with which it maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power and economic prosperity. Being a large, multicultural state, Alodia was administered by a powerful king and provincial governors appointed by him. The capital Soba, described as a town of \\"extensive dwellings and churches full of gold and gardens\\", prospered as a trading hub. Goods arrived from Makuria, the Middle East, western Africa, India and even China. Literacy in both Nubian and Greek flourished. From the 12th, and especially the 13th century, Alodia was declining, possibly because of invasions from the south, droughts and a shift of trade routes. In the 14th century, the country might have been ravaged by the plague, while Arab tribes began to migrate into the Upper Nile valley. By around 1500 Soba had fallen to either Arabs or the Funj. This likely marked the end of Alodia, although some Sudanese oral traditions claimed that it survived in the form of the kingdom of Fazughli within the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands. After the destruction of Soba, the Funj established the Sultanate of Sennar, ushering in a period of Islamization and Arabization. Answer:","completion":"The kingdom that maintained close dynastic ties, in size, military power, and economic prosperity with Makuria was Alodia, also known as Alwa.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said.

Luckily I was not the target or victim of this road rage, but I was a first hand witness. Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

Back at their house by the cemetery, Paul and Chloe found Bee in her room, what Paul referred to as her sanctum sanctorum - although no one else ever got the joke, and he refused to explain the comic book reference. As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice.

The text was written by German poet Ludwig Uhland in 1809 . Its immediate inspiration was the deployment of Badener troops against the Tyrolean Rebellion . In 1825 , the composer Friedrich Silcher set it to music , based on the tune of a Swiss folk song . The song is about the immediate experience of a soldier losing a comrade in battle , detached from all political or national ideology ; as a result , its use was never limited to one particular faction and was sung or cited by representatives of all political backgrounds throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , and was translated for use in numerous fighting forces , French , Dutch , Spanish , Japanese and others . \`\` The Good Comrade '' still plays an important ceremonial role in the German Armed Forces and is an integral part of a military funeral , continuing a tradition started at some point around 1871 . The song has also become traditional in obsequies of the Military of Austria , the Austrian firebrigades and the highly prussianized Chilean Army . It is also used to some degree in the French Army , particularly in the Foreign Legion . When the song is played , soldiers are to salute , an honour otherwise reserved for national anthems only . Occasionally the song is played at civil ceremonies , most often when the deceased had been affiliated with the military . It is also commonly sung at the funerals of members of a Studentenverbindung . Finally , the song is often played on Volkstrauertag , the German Remembrance Day , at memorials for the fallen . The above text is Uhland 's original version . Various variants have been recorded over the years .

Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, \\"bereavement\\" refers to the state of loss, and \\"grief\\" is the reaction to that loss. - Mourning is, in the simplest sense, grief over someone's death. The word is also used to describe a cultural complex of behaviours in which the bereaved participate or are expected to participate. Customs vary between cultures and evolve over time, though many core behaviors remain constant. - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience. - Crying is the shedding of tears in response to an emotional state. The act of crying has been defined as \\"a complex secretomotor phenomenon characterized by the shedding of tears from the lacrimal apparatus, without any irritation of the ocular structures\\". A related medical term is lacrimation, which also refers to non-emotional shedding of tears. Crying is also known as \\"weeping\\", \\"wailing\\", \\"whimpering\\", and \\"bawling\\". - A lament or lamentation is a passionate expression of grief, often in music, poetry, or song form. The grief is most often born of regret, or mourning. Laments can also be expressed in a verbal manner, where the participant would lament about something they regret or someone they've lost, usually accompanied by wailing, moaning and/or crying. Laments constitute some of the oldest forms of writing and examples are present across human cultures. - Johann Ludwig Uhland (26 April 1787 13 November 1862), was a German poet, philologist and literary historian. - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning. What is the relationship between 'ich hatt' einen kameraden' and 'poem'? A:","completion":"\\"Ich hatt' einen Kameraden\\" is a traditional lament of the German Armed Forces, also known as \\"The good Comrade.\\" The text of this lament was written by German poet Ludwig Uhland in 1809, making it a poem. Thus, the relationship between \\"Ich hatt' einen Kameraden\\" and \\"poem\\" is that \\"Ich hatt' einen Kameraden\\" is a poem written by Ludwig Uhland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

He says that \\"cross-pollination increases genetic diversity\\" and \\"evolution requires genetic diversity\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","completion":"The question in the quiz states, \\"Cross-pollination increases something required by what?\\" Based on the hints provided by the teacher, we can deduce the best possible answer to the question. The first hint given is that \\"cross-pollination increases genetic diversity.\\" Cross-pollination is the process whereby pollen from one plant is transferred to the stigma of another plant, which subsequently promotes the fertilization process, leading to seed production in flowering plants. This interchange of genes between different plants increases the genetic diversity among the offspring. Genetic diversity is important because it enables a species to adapt and evolve in response to changing environmental conditions. The second hint provided suggests that \\"evolution requires genetic diversity.\\" Evolution refers to the gradual change in species over time due to genetic variations and natural selection. Genetic diversity serves as the foundation for evolution, as it introduces new traits and characteristics to a species. Including a larger variety of genes enhances a species' ability to survive, adapt, and evolve in response to its environment. Higher genetic diversity results in a higher likelihood of advantageous traits emerging in a population, which has a higher chance of being passed down to future generations. Considering the two hints, one can infer that cross-pollination increases the genetic diversity in plant populations, which is a prerequisite for evolution. Therefore, the best answer to the question \\"Cross-pollination increases something required by what?\\" is \\"evolution.\\" In summary, cross-pollination enhances genetic diversity, which is vital for the process of evolution to occur."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Merseyside Police said David Ungi is the son of David Ungi Senior, who was killed in a notorious gangland shooting in the Toxteth area of Liverpool in 1995. The killing prompted a spate of other shootings in the city. Also on the list of suspects, drawn up by the National Crime Agency and Crimestoppers, is alleged murderer Shane O'Brien, 28. He is accused of killing Josh Hanson in front of his girlfriend in the RE Bar in Hillingdon, west London, in October 2015. A Â£10,000 reward is on offer for information leading to his arrest and conviction. Officers are also looking for Shazad Ghafoor, 29, who allegedly stole a car from a Land Rover dealership in Manchester in August 2013 using a false name, sparking a high-speed police chase with his wife and children in the car. The pursuit ended with him rolling the car in Halifax, West Yorkshire, before police found up to Â£100,000 in cash in the vehicle. He is accused of a string of offences for the chase, and supplying cannabis. David Walley, 40, is alleged to have smuggled MDMA and cocaine into the UK in parcels delivered to Manchester. Ahmed Dervish Omer, 45, from Nottingham, is wanted after fleeing in the middle of his trial for drugs offences in November last year. He was found guilty in his absence and sentenced to 10 years. The remaining suspects are Michael Moogan and Robert Gerrard, both 52 and from Liverpool, who are accused of being part of an international drug trafficking ring; and Mark Liscott, 55, from Birmingham, who is wanted for allegedly dealing drugs while out on licence for a jail term for dealing cannabis. Convicted rapist Rezgar Zengana, 33, is also on the list for posing as a minicab driver in Glasgow in 2006, and picking up a 25-year-old woman who he attacked.

Merseyside Police stated that David Ungi is the son of David Ungi Senior, who was killed in a notorious gangland shooting in the Toxteth area of Liverpool in 1995. This event prompted a series of other shootings in the city. On the list of suspects, compiled by the National Crime Agency and Crimestoppers, is alleged murderer Shane O'Brien, 28. He is accused of killing Josh Hanson in front of his girlfriend in the RE Bar in Hillingdon, west London, in October 2015. A £10,000 reward is being offered for information leading to his arrest and conviction. Officers are also looking for Shazad Ghafoor, 29, accused of stealing a car from a Land Rover dealership in Manchester in August 2013 using a false name, leading to a high-speed police chase with his wife and children in the car. The chase ended with Ghafoor rolling the car in Halifax, West Yorkshire, before police found around £100,000 in cash inside. He is accused of various offenses related to the chase, as well as for supplying cannabis. David Walley, 40, is alleged to have smuggled MDMA and cocaine into the UK in parcels delivered to Manchester. Ahmed Dervish Omer, 45, from Nottingham, fled during his trial for drug offenses in November last year and was found guilty in his absence, receiving a 10-year sentence. The remaining suspects are Michael Moogan and Robert Gerrard, both 52 and from Liverpool, accused of being part of an international drug trafficking ring, and Mark Liscott, 55, from Birmingham, who is wanted for allegedly dealing drugs while out on license for a jail term for dealing cannabis. Convicted rapist Rezgar Zengana, 33, is also on the list for posing as a minicab driver in Glasgow in 2006 and picking up a 25-year-old woman whom he attacked. He was convicted for rape but has not yet been sentenced. From 2009 to 2015, there were 904 arrests under the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), with data from the National Crime Agency revealing that Spain accounted for the most arrests overall in that period, totaling 245, with 49 occurring in 2014-15. The Netherlands saw 129 arrests of people wanted by the UK since 2009, with the most common reason for arrest being drug trafficking (154 offenses).

However, his party plans fail miserably as parents and local authorities crack down, fueled by their shared experience of having dealt with his brother Steve's antics in the past. Determined to take a new path and create his own legacy, Matt decides to pursue his passion for music. He joins East Great Falls High School's struggling band, much to the chagrin of the school's popular kids and his fellow band members, who aren't thrilled about having a Stifler in their midst. Matt's initial goal is to use the band to win the heart of his crush, Allison, the school's talented and enigmatic band lead vocalist. As the band practices for the prestigious National High School Band Competition, they face numerous obstacles. Matt's partying lifestyle clashes with the discipline needed for their rigorous rehearsals, and his past antics haunt the band’s reputation. A rival school band, led by the snobbish and intimidating Brandon, is hellbent on crushing them in the upcoming competition. The band not only have to face external challenges but also have to navigate their own internal issues, such as jealousy, clashing egos, and creative differences. Throughout the movie, a series of flashbacks and anecdotes reveal that Steve, unbeknown to his younger brother, was a talented musician in high school who opted for a wild lifestyle instead of pursuing this passion. This revelation adds depth to Matt's resolve and determination to make it as a musician. As the plot thickens, Matt begins to evolve as a character, gradually becoming more responsible, dedicated, and supportive. His fellow band members notice this transformation and begin to accept him, giving the band a newfound sense of unity. Allison ultimately becomes attracted to Matt not just for his looks or charm but for his passion for music and his genuine growth as a person. The climax of the movie takes place at the National High School Band Competition. The East Great Falls High School band gives a phenomenal performance, showcasing their hard work and the unlikely combination of personalities that make up the group. In an exhilarating finale, the band clinches victory over their rivals, and Matt and Allison share a celebratory, intimate moment. In the closing scenes of the film, Steve, who has been absent for most of the movie, surprisingly reappears to show his support, demonstrating his pride in Matt for overcoming the \\"Stifler curse\\" and forging his own path. The two brothers reconcile, with Steve reminiscing about his lost musical potential and Matt looking forward to a bright future filled with love, music, and a legacy of his own making. \\"Stifled Dreams\\" is a feel-good comedy-drama that not only offers a good laugh at the adventures of the Stifler family but also delivers a heartwarming message about self-discovery, growth, and the power of following one's dreams."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

DOS is a family of disk operating systems primarily consisting of MS-DOS and a rebranded version under the name IBM PC DOS which were introduced in 1981, as well as some later compatible systems from other manufacturers: DR-DOS (1988), ROM-DOS (1989), PTS-DOS (1993), and FreeDOS (1998). MS-DOS dominated the x86-based IBM PC compatible market between 1981 and 1995. Dozens of other operating systems also use the acronym \\"DOS\\", including the mainframe DOS/360 from 1966. Others are Apple DOS, Apple ProDOS, Atari DOS, Commodore DOS, TRSDOS, and AmigaDOS. IBM PC DOS (and the separately sold MS-DOS) and its predecessor, 86-DOS, resembled Digital Research's CP/M—the dominant disk operating system for 8-bit Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80 based microcomputers. DOS instead ran on Intel 8086 16-bit processors. Starting with MS-DOS 1.28 and PC DOS 2.0 the operating system incorporated various features inspired by Xenix, Microsoft's variant of Unix. When IBM introduced the IBM PC, built with the Intel 8088 microprocessor, they needed an operating system. Seeking an 8088-compatible build of CP/M, IBM initially approached Microsoft CEO Bill Gates (possibly believing that Microsoft owned CP/M due to the Microsoft Z-80 SoftCard, which allowed CP/M to run on an Apple II). IBM was sent to Digital Research, and a meeting was set up.

Familiar faces: Some are predicting Hilary Clinton to be the","completion":"Democratic candidate once again Indeed, the very mention of familiar, influential names like Bush and Clinton throws the political landscape into absolute anticipatory intrigue. Former President George W. Bush has clearly stated his viewpoint on whom he would prefer to see vying for the highest office in the country. In an unexpected reveal, he voiced his support for his brother, Jeb Bush. Jeb, having previously served as the Governor of Florida, has a political background that is well-regarded by many in the Republican party. With this backing, he stands as a potentially strong contender for the 2016 candidacy. This support, together with his reputation and popularity among Hispanic voters, is likely to significantly swing the minority vote in the Republicans' favour, potentially shifting the election to the conservatives' advantage. However, Jeb Bush's participation in the 2016 race is yet to be confirmed. Despite the eager support from his brother and numerous other Republicans, the former Governor has refrained from announcing a firm decision. The suspense adds another layer to the political intrigue building around the prospective 2016 race. And as the Republicans rally around Jeb Bush, murmurs across the aisle suggest that the Democrats may rely on a tried-and-tested candidate. Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State and First Lady, is considered by many to be the Democrats' most potent weapon. Her experience, tenacity, and extensive network within the party and beyond make her a likely frontrunner for the Democratic candidacy. However, just like Jeb Bush, Clinton is yet to declare her intentions for 2016. Her potential candidacy has Democrats excited and hopeful, as a Clinton vs. Bush match could result in a gripping battle reminiscent of past elections. The political forecast for 2016 thus paints an uncertain, yet highly intriguing, picture. The atmospheres in both parties indicate a mix of anticipation and suspense. The world is watching, waiting eagerly for contenders to step up and champions to be declared. The upcoming 2016 Presidential race promises to be a true political tour de force. The contest of Bush Vs. Clinton AGAIN could make this election a historic battle, reflecting the cyclical nature of politics and power.

Given the question: Information: - The clavichord is a European stringed keyboard instrument known from the late Medieval, through the Renaissance, Baroque and Classical eras. Historically, it was mostly used as a practice instrument and as an aid to composition, not being loud enough for larger performances. The clavichord produces sound by striking brass or iron strings with small metal blades called tangents. Vibrations are transmitted through the bridge(s) to the soundboard. - The Goldberg Variations, BWV 988, is a work written for harpsichord by Johann Sebastian Bach, consisting of an aria and a set of 30 variations. First published in 1741, the work is considered to be one of the most important examples of variation form. The \\"Variations\\" are named after Johann Gottlieb Goldberg, who may have been the first performer. - Prelude in C Minor , BWV 999 ) , also termed The \`\` Little '' Prelude in C Minor , is a piece written by Johann Sebastian Bach sometime between 1717 and 1723 . Though originally composed for Lute - Harpsichord , it has since been adapted for various instruments , including lute , piano and guitar . It is a pedagogical work much in the spirit of The Well - Tempered Clavier , with which it shares musical characteristics . The piece 's true authorship fell into question for decades before being proven to be Bach 's by publication of Hans Neemann 's J. S. Bach Lautenkompositionen ( 1931 ) . - A harpsichord is a musical instrument played by means of a keyboard. It produces sound by plucking a string when a key is pressed. - A cantata (literally \\"sung\\", past participle feminine singular of the Italian verb \\"cantare\\", \\"to sing\\") is a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment, typically in several movements, often involving a choir. - Johann Sebastian Bach (28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He enriched established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the \\"Brandenburg Concertos\\", the \\"Goldberg Variations\\", the Mass in B minor, two Passions, and over three hundred cantatas of which around two hundred survive. His music is revered for its technical command, artistic beauty, and intellectual depth. - A keyboard instrument is a musical instrument played using a keyboard. The most common of these are the piano, organ, and various electronic keyboards, including synthesizers and digital pianos. Other keyboard instruments include celestas, which are struck idiophones operated by a keyboard, and carillons, which are usually housed in bell towers or belfries of churches or municipal buildings. - The Well-Tempered Clavier, BWV 846893, is a collection of two series of Preludes and Fugues in all 24 major and minor keys, composed for solo keyboard by Johann Sebastian Bach. In the German of Bach's time \\"Clavier\\" (keyboard) was a generic name indicating a variety of keyboard instruments, most typically a harpsichord or clavichord but not excluding an organ either.

The answer is:","completion":"The \\"Prelude in C Minor, BWV 999\\" by Johann Sebastian Bach has the relation 'instrumentation' with the Lute-Harpsichord. Although the piece was originally composed for Lute-Harpsichord, it has been adapted for various instruments over time, including the lute, piano, and guitar. The Lute-Harpsichord is a keyboard instrument that resembles the harpsichord, but it imitates the sound and playing style of a lute due to its unique string arrangement and plucking mechanism. The versatility and adaptability of the \\"Prelude in C Minor, BWV 999\\" have allowed it to be played on multiple types of keyboard instruments and other stringed instruments, showcasing the depth and variety of Bach's compositional skills."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Although both questions are centered around the objective of impressing a girl and are related to dating, they do not inquire about the same information. The first question focuses on actions to take after the first date, while the second question emphasizes how to impress a girl during the first date itself. To address both questions, I will provide detailed answers. 1. How do I impress a girl after the first date? After the first date, there are several things you can do to impress a girl: A) Maintain communication: After the first date, make sure to keep in touch with her. Let her know that you enjoyed the date, and if you feel it went well, express your interest in having a follow-up date. B) Be thoughtful: If she mentioned something on the date that she likes or is interested in, consider sending her a related text, article, or meme that aligns with her interests. This shows that you were paying attention and are thoughtful. C) Plan a second date: If the first date was a success and you'd like to see her again, plan a memorable second date that takes her preferences into account. This might include trying a new activity together, visiting a unique location, or attending an event that you know she will enjoy. D) Be genuine: It's essential to be yourself and not try too hard to impress. People can sense when someone is being inauthentic. Express your true feelings and emotions to create a real connection. E) Give her space: Avoid overwhelming her with too many messages or constantly checking in. Strike a balance in your communication, showing genuine interest without being overbearing. 2. How do I impress a girl on the first date? To impress a girl on the first date, consider the following tips: A) Plan: Make an effort to plan the date thoughtfully, taking her likes and dislikes into consideration. Coordinate the location, time, and type of date that will set a comfortable atmosphere and allow for meaningful connection. B) Dress appropriately: Dress up for the date to show that you respect the occasion and her company. First impressions matter, and dressing well will give her a positive idea of who you are. C) Be punctual: Arriving on time shows respect for her time and signals that the date is important to you. If something unexpected happens and you might be late, make sure to inform her beforehand. D) Confidence and body language: Project confidence through your body language, such as maintaining eye contact, standing tall, and putting your phone away. This can make her feel more comfortable and help the conversation to flow naturally. E) Be interested: Focus your attention on getting to know her instead of merely talking about yourself. Show genuine interest in her life, work, hobbies, and experiences. Ask open-ended questions that encourage conversation. F) Be a gentleman: Treat her with respect, show common courtesy, and engage in polite conversation. Open doors, pull out her chair, and offer to pay for the date. G) Be present: Pay attention to the conversation, maintain eye contact, and listen actively to what she has to say. Avoid distractions such as checking your phone or other interruptions. H) Be authentic: Be genuine and express your true feelings, opinions, and beliefs. Authenticity is key to impressing a girl and forming a real connection. While these are two separate questions, both of them focus on impressing a girl in the context of dating. Approaching each situation with thoughtfulness, confidence, and attentiveness will increase the likelihood of achieving a positive outcome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy in 1916 and continued there until his death? from the following article ? Carl August Nielsen (Danish: [kɑːl ˈnelsn̩]; 9 June 1865 – 3 October 1931) was a Danish musician, conductor and violinist, widely recognized as his country's most prominent composer. Brought up by poor yet musically talented parents on the island of Funen, he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. He premiered his Op. 1, Suite for Strings, in 1888, at the age of 23. The following year, Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the Royal Danish Orchestra under the conductor Johan Svendsen, during which he played in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy and continued to work there until his death. Although his symphonies, concertos and choral music are now internationally acclaimed, Nielsen's career and personal life were marked by many difficulties, often reflected in his music. The works he composed between 1897 and 1904 are sometimes ascribed to his \\"psychological\\" period, resulting mainly from a turbulent marriage with the sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen. Nielsen is especially noted for his six symphonies, his Wind Quintet and his concertos for violin, flute and clarinet. In Denmark, his opera Maskarade and many of his songs have become an integral part of the national heritage. His early music was inspired by composers such as Brahms and Grieg, but he soon developed his own style, first experimenting with progressive tonality and later diverging even more radically from the standards of composition still common at the time. Nielsen's sixth and final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, was written in 1924–25. He died from a heart attack six years later, and is buried in Vestre Cemetery, Copenhagen. Nielsen maintained the reputation of a musical outsider during his lifetime, both in his own country and internationally. It was only later that his works firmly entered the...

A young boy with psychiatric problems is locked in a cage every day to stop him destroying things and beating up his sister while his father goes out to work. Xiao Wang, 12 years old, was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Cortical Dysplasia - a congenital abnormality which causes seizures. His single father, Zhong Kefu, 45, began locking him up after becoming worried by his violent behaviour,following complaints from neighbours. Xiao Wang, 12, is locked in a 2 square metre (21 square feet) cage every day to protect his neighbours and sister from his violent outbursts. His father, Zhong Kefu, 45 (centre) says he has to keep his son in the cage so he can go out to work to pay for food, and for medical treatment. Xiao has destroyed neighbours' property before, including smashing up an old lady's cooking pot, and is violent towards his six-year-old sister (left) In the past his son has taken neighbours' cloths, shoes and cell phones and thrown them in the village paddy fields, and smashed an old lady's cooking pot, That's magazine reports. For months now, Xiao has been made to sit in the metal cage measuring 2 square meters (21 square feet) with nothing but a wooden stool, a urinal and some sponges inside. Mr Zhong says he must keep his son in a cage so he can go out to work and earn enough money to pay for his treatment. Mr Zhong said: 'When he was younger he ate anything he picked up, whether it was edible or not. 'Then he started destroying things, smashing them to pieces. 'Neighbours started getting angry because he was destroying their property and being violent with other children. 'He was also breaking things at home.' Mr Zhong' s wife, who was mentally disabled, gave birth to Xiao in 2002. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. It can occur in people of any intellectual ability but many people with ADHD also have learning difficulties. Symptoms of ADHD tend to be first noticed at an early age, and may become more noticeable as a child grows up. Many children with ADHD also must have conduct disorder – involving a tendency towards highly antisocial behaviour, such as stealing, fighting, vandalism and harming people or animals. In half of children, there is also a tendency towards oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) – which is defined by negative and disruptive behaviour, particularly towards authority figures, such as parents and teachers. Studies have shown children with ADHD have 25 times the risk of being institutionalised for delinquency and nine times the risk of being sent to prison. His parents noticed he behaved different from other children of the same age, and his only words were 'dad' or 'baba', and as he grew his behaviour became increasingly challenging. He became violent with other children, including his sister, who is now six years old. Mr Zhong and his wife were only allowed to have a second child – something normally forbidden under the Chinese government's one-child policy – because of Xiao's condition. At first, Mr Zhong tied his son up and left him while he went to work in the village of Taoshu in Xiushui county in southern China's Jiangxi province. But when he got home he always found Xiao's wrists were red raw from struggling to get free. He tried locking him in his bedroom, but Xiao smashed the window one night and escaped, causing damage in the local neighborhood. Mr Zhong said: 'I would like him to be able to go to school, to get an education and play with other children. 'But no school will accept him. He has a six-year-old sister, but is always violent with her as well. 'I need to make money to support my family and to get him treatment. 'But the only thing I can do at the moment is keep him in the cage until I have raised enough.' For months now Xiao has been made to sit in the metal cage measuring 2 square meters (21 square feet) with nothing but a wooden stool, a urinal and some sponges inside. Mr Zhong is far from proud of his solution, according to That's magazine. 'I can't bear to treat him this way but the schools won't take him, and if I don't go out and work we'll starve,' it reported. A spokesman from the Jiangxi Children's Hospital where Xiao was diagnosed said: 'Unless he gets proper therapy soon he will stay this way for life.'

The 76-year-old comedian is slated to play the patriarch of a multigenerational family, NBC told CNN on Wednesday. Bill Cosby to return to NBC in new sitcom. A network representative did not elaborate on anything else involving the show. No doubt, NBC is hoping this version of Cos brings back memories of his eight-year run as the gruff but warmhearted Dr. Cliff Huxtable on \\"The Cosby Show\\" -- and not the failed gumshoe of \\"The Cosby Mysteries,\\" which lasted one season in 1994-95, or the cranky retiree of \\"Cosby\\" (1996-2000), which started out strong but sank quickly in the ratings. The return of Cosby coincides with other figures from the '80s and early '90s making their return to prime time in one way or another. Michael J. Fox has been heading a clan on \\"The Michael J. Fox Show\\" since September, and Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos are reuniting for a yogurt commercial to air during the Super Bowl. (No word on whether the Olsen twins will be in tow.) \\"Full House\\" stars reunite for Super Bowl. But nostalgia and Q scores -- those popularity measuring sticks marketers love so much -- only go so far. Sure, Cosby is a popular guy. People still have warm feelings about the comedian, even if it's been ages since he was TV's most popular pitchman. (Don't laugh -- the man's in the Advertising Hall of Fame.) And \\"The Cosby Show\\" was a landmark in TV sitcoms, not only showcasing a bright African-American family but leading the ratings for five straight years in the 1980s. NBC began more than a decade of dominance thanks to \\"Cosby's\\" success. \\"Bill Cosby is always going to be welcomed into people's homes because of nostalgia for the Huxtables,\\" says Amanda McClain, a communications professor at Holy Family University in Philadelphia. The trick, however, is the show he'll be placed in. \\"A famous name is itself no guarantee,\\" wrote Time's James Poniewozik, observing that Fox's show has suffered because it's depended too heavily on memories of the lead instead of making his show interesting. \\"Bill Cosby, like the Jell-O he once pitched, remains a beloved brand. But if his show makes it to air, the proof will be not in the brand but in the pudding.\\" 'Television isn't very reflective of reality' So what might a new Cosby sitcom look like? Probably something like America -- whatever that is these days. After all, TV families have always reflected our culture, even if they've sometimes been a year or two behind the times. In the 1950s, \\"Father Knows Best\\" showed off a happy nuclear family in Springfield, USA. In the 1960s, \\"The Dick Van Dyke Show\\" offered a Kennedyesque household in suburban New York. The 1970s included \\"The Brady Bunch,\\" about a blended clan for a time in which divorce and second marriages were becoming commonplace. (However, divorce was still stigmatized enough that it was never revealed whether Carol Brady was a widow or a divorcee.) In the wake of \\"All in the Family\\" and producer Norman Lear's other edgy shows, 1970s TV families took on the broader appearance of society. \\"Good Times\\" was set in a Chicago housing project; \\"One Day at a Time\\" featured a single-mother household in Indianapolis. But TV is also nothing if not aspirational, says McClain, and Lear's unflinching sitcoms -- exceptional even in their time -- were swept aside in the 1980s. \\"Television isn't very reflective of reality,\\" she says. \\"There's underrepresentation of people of color, underrepresentation of many different types of people. Still today, there are very few Asian-American or Latino people on television.\\" Even \\"The Cosby Show,\\" with its upper-class doctor and lawyer living in Brooklyn Heights, was often more aspirational than realistic, she says. Viewers, however, apparently like aspirational. Since the '80s, the dominant family shows have been \\"The Cosby Show\\" and \\"Family Ties,\\" \\"Home Improvement\\" and \\"Everybody Loves Raymond,\\" \\"Two and a Half Men\\" and \\"Modern Family.\\" Some have unusual family structures -- \\"Modern Family,\\" famously, includes a gay couple, an old-young husband-wife combination and several stepchildren -- but they generally feature white clans and take place in well-off circumstances. Though there have been several sitcoms featuring people of color or folks in working-class circumstances, about the only breakout exception has been \\"Roseanne,\\" Roseanne Barr's early '90s hit, which regularly reflected genuine working-class circumstances. \\"Compared to like the '70s, where you had true diversity -- 'Sanford & Son' and 'Good Times,' people of all walks of life, jobs and bank accounts -- today it's as if we've regressed in some ways,\\" says John Griffiths, president of the Gay and Lesbian Entertainment Critics Association and TV critic for Us Weekly. He suggests one reason might be because Hollywood is somewhat insular. \\"The networks try really hard at having diverse sitcom writing staffs, but there's still an issue with a lot of white guys who maybe went to Harvard and live on the west side of L.A. who write these shows,\\" he says. Next step: Senior citizens? There have been some attempts to change the view on broadcast television, he points out, though new styles have struggled to catch on. \\"The New Normal,\\" which featured a same-sex couple and their relationship with a surrogate and her family, was canceled after one season; \\"The Middle,\\" about a middle-class family in Indiana, has plodded along, \\"underrated,\\" in Griffiths' opinion. Cable television, which has the luxury of targeting its \\"reality\\" shows -- many of which are simply sitcoms in different guise -- at specific demographics, has opted for upscale families (\\"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\\"), heartland groups (\\"Duck Dynasty\\") or a mix of flavors (\\"Here Comes Honey Boo Boo\\"). Families come in many forms on television, of course -- what was \\"Friends\\" if not about a family of sorts? -- and the next wave may include more senior citizens. With baby boomers starting to take care of aging parents and being called \\"the sandwich generation,\\" a Cosby show truly reflecting issues across generations could be a hit, says McClain, the communications professor. Or perhaps a new Cosby show could simply focus on the elderly, Griffiths says. \\"The aged are very underrepresented,\\" he says. He observes that his group's pick for unsung TV show of the year, HBO's \\"Getting On,\\" is set in an extended-care unit and includes a closeted homosexual, an African-American nurse and a variety of senior citizens. (HBO is a unit of Time Warner, as is CNN.) \\"It's almost like a Norman Lear show,\\" Griffiths says. A Cosby show need not go that far -- it'll be on NBC, not HBO, after all -- but the lead could make of it what he wants. \\"The great thing is that Cosby is at an age where he'll be playing a grandfather,\\" Griffiths says. All you need is one successful show to start a trend, and if a wider range of ages is shown on a TV show, it could lead to others. After all, the ultimate family show -- even in these days of DVRs and second screens -- is watching TV, McClain says. \\"Television is a family event,\\" she says. \\"Families watch television together.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The article discusses the announcement of Bill Cosby starring in a new sitcom on NBC, playing the patriarch of a multigenerational family. The network hopes that the return of Cosby will bring back memories of his successful run on \\"The Cosby Show\\" rather than his less successful ventures in the 1990s. The article also examines the changing landscape of family sitcoms in television history, from \\"Father Knows Best\\" in the 1950s to \\"Modern Family\\" today.

If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment. It is how plants work together. In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well. This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area. When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.Rice (Oryza sativa) is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India. Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied... Please answer this question : Which farm has more plants displaying a decreased capacity to take up water? A:","completion":"Brick farm has more plants displaying a decreased capacity to take up water. The reason for this is that Brick farm has a lot of plant problems and experiences abiotic stress. One of the primary responses to abiotic stress, such as high salinity, is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the plant cell's cytoplasm. High concentrations of Na+ can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Since Boulder farm had good production and their plants presented almost no signs of abiotic stress, it is less likely that their plants face issues in taking up water compared to Brick farm."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Their profits were high. Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: In the mid 1990s, people started doing business on the Internet. At that time, there were two kinds of companies. First, there were traditional companies which sold things in stores. Then, there were Internet companies which didn't have stores, they sold things only over the Net. Traditional companies didn't want to lose any business. Quickly, they created their own websites and began selling things over the Net. These are the so-called \\"brick and click\\" companies. Many stores are made of brick, and you click on your mouse to buy things with your computer. That's where the name \\"brick and click\\" comes from. By the late 1990s, e-businesses like Amazon.com, Buy.com, and eToys.com were in trouble. Their profits were not very high, and there was a lot of competition. Many of these businesses lost a lot of money, and in 2000, many e-businesses were out of business. In the world of e-commerce , companies are fighting for every dollar and every customer. Will brick and click companies win the war? Only time will tell. Question: Why were Internet companies in a lot of trouble in the late 1990s? Answer: A:","completion":"(1). Competition was heavy. In the late 1990s, Internet companies found themselves in a lot of trouble mainly due to the heavy competition they faced. As traditional companies, which already had established customer bases, started to create their own websites and sell their products online, they became \\"brick and click\\" companies. These new competitors had the advantage of already being well-known, with established brands and a physical presence. This meant that the Internet companies had to fight harder to gain market share and make a name for themselves, as they were competing against established businesses that were quickly adapting to the online world. With so many companies entering the e-commerce space, there was significant pressure on the Internet companies to differentiate themselves and attract more customers. On top of the competition from brick and click companies, Internet companies also faced competition amongst themselves, as many new e-businesses were emerging on the scene. This led to an oversaturated market, making it difficult for individual companies to stand out and prosper. Low profits further exacerbated the situation for Internet companies, as they struggled to generate sustainable revenue. This financial instability made it challenging for many of these companies to continue operating, and by 2000, several e-businesses found themselves out of business. Thus, the main reason why Internet companies were in a lot of trouble in the late 1990s was the heavy competition they encountered, both from traditional businesses adapting to the online world and from the numerous other e-businesses trying to make a name for themselves in an increasingly crowded market."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Listening to the soundtrack at the moment, the images come back with a vividness that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong (in order to be able to type this). I've seen it twice thus far, and I should be ashamed for having seen it *only* twice. I've seen all Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli films, and they are invariably nothing less than masterpieces (except maybe for Nausicaa which was, even in the non-cut up version too premature compared to the nec-plus-ultra manga). Still, their strength sometimes becomes their weakness, as they tend to get too naive/positive (Chihiro), or, with more nuance, a bit too explicit/moralist (Mononoke). At least, compared to for example the other Ghibli master Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies / Only Yesterday / Raccoon Wars). But not this one. In Laputa, Miyazaki pours all the brilliant storytelling that tellers of tales have gathered and perfected over the ages, combined with a bit of morale, but nicely interwoven with not only a completely transcendental atmosphere, but also with the humor and amusement of for example Totoro. Every single main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties. The pacing is so perfect that I know of nothing except a black hole that would be able to exert such a gravitational pull on your whole being. The story sets out as an action flic with mysteries hinted at, but when the girl falls from the sky, unconscious, floating with the stone, and the main theme kicks in, you get a glimpse of the grand mystery you're about to uncover, but the story then settles and gradually, over a number of carefully selected scenes of action and serene beauty, builds to an unforgettable climax of melancholy, hope, beauty - like, following days of sombre gloom, finally seeing the horizon on a clear morning, knowing the path walked, seeing the distance ahead, but smiling at the mere fact of being able to catch a glimpse of it. It is so like an exploding white light in your skull that if by the time the credits start rolling you have kept your eyes dry and your mind numb, you should see a therapist. Despite the fact that technically-image-wise some more recent Miyazakis might be more overwhelming, this to me remains his undisputed masterpiece. If you take a fraction of a second to realise that this was made back in 1986, you can only come to the conclusion that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years. This of course has been suggested before, but to me this is his only film that can, on its own, fully illustrate that simple fact. If you miss this during your lifetime, you'll die with a huge gap - which would be a pity, as the coffin costs the same.

He stumbles onto the set of a World War I movie and isn't sure if he has accidentally caused the death of one of the film's stunt men. The eccentric and autocratic director, Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole), agrees to hide Cameron from the police if he will take the dead man's place. Cameron soon begins to suspect that Cross is putting him in excessive danger. At a bar one night, another member of the production gets drunk and tells Cameron that Eli almost killed the helicopter pilot during the fatal accident Cameron caused, because he insisted he keep flying in order to get the shot. Cameron falls in love with Nina Franklin (Barbara Hershey), the film's star, and is devastated to find out that she and Eli slept together before he met her. The boundaries between reality and fiction become increasingly blurred as Cross exercises godlike control over the production. During a screening of some footage for Nina's parents who are visiting the production, a nude sex scene with Nina is shown. Eli appears to be mortified, but allows the footage to play anyway. He waits until Nina is just about to shoot a traumatic scene the next day to tell her that her parents have seen the footage of her naked. It causes her to cry with humiliation, which seems to be the exact emotion Eli needs from her in the scene.

Write a text based on \\"in law school obama entered political arena\\" Text:","completion":"Title: From Law School to the Political Arena: Barack Obama's Journey Barack Obama's entry into politics can be traced back to his days in law school. Graduating from Harvard Law School in 1991, it was here that he began to display signs of his impressive leadership qualities, eventually forging a successful career in the political arena. In this text, we will explore Obama's formative years, his accomplishments in law school, and how this experience laid the groundwork for his political ascent. Step 1: Establishing Obama's law school background Before Barack Obama entered law school, he had already demonstrated a passion for social justice and helping others. Having worked as a community organizer in Chicago, Obama decided to pursue a legal education at Harvard Law School, one of the most prestigious in the United States. Step 2: Leadership in the Law School It was during his time at Harvard Law School that Obama's political potential began to emerge. As a promising student, he quickly gained the respect of his fellow classmates and professors. In 1990, he was elected as the first African-American president of the prestigious Harvard Law Review. Under his tenure, Obama took on the overwhelming task of overseeing the publication, managing a student staff of 80 people and negotiating contentious debates on various legal issues. Step 3: Commitment to social justice Throughout his time at law school, Obama remained committed to social justice and public service. His approach to legal education went beyond the classroom, as he continued his involvement in community organizing. He also volunteered at legal clinics, helping underprivileged communities gain access to legal representation and understand their rights. Step 4: Laying the groundwork for his political career Obama's time at law school provided him with crucial skills that would later help him excel in the political arena. Developing his negotiation and consensus-building abilities while managing the Harvard Law Review, he proved himself as a leader who could bridge gaps between different parties. This experience would later translate into his campaigning style and his approach to governing once he entered the world of politics. Step 5: Transitioning to politics Following his graduation from law school, Barack Obama returned to Chicago to begin his political career. In 1996, he was elected to the Illinois State Senate, where he continued to focus on social justice and community empowerment. This early political success laid the foundation for his subsequent rise to the United States Senate and, ultimately, the presidency in 2008. In conclusion, Barack Obama's experience in law school marked a pivotal point in his life, setting the stage for his entrance into the political arena. It was during these formative years that he honed his leadership skills, commitment to social justice, and ability to navigate complex debates. As such, Obama's time at Harvard Law School not only prepared him for a successful legal career but also played a significant role in shaping the future leader of the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Devolution in Northern Ireland has been on hold since the collapse of the executive in January. Talks are due to continue over the summer months after parties failed to reach a power-sharing agreement before the parliamentary recess. \\"We're sitting in a situation where the can has been kicked down the road to the autumn,\\" said Ms Mallon. The North Belfast representative said MLAs were not fulfilling their duties as elected officials, and so their pay should be altered accordingly. \\"We are doing our constituency work but we are not performing our legislative role - we're not in our committees scrutinising legislation or taking evidence. A former member of the Independent Financial Review Panel which sets MLAs' salaries has called for their pay to be stopped entirely until a deal was reached - as it was wasting £1m of taxpayers' money each month. \\"Let's get real about it - they are not even going to go back to talks until September, October,\\" said former PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Alan McQuillan. \\"We've basically got a blank cheque for the next six months and this is at a time when people in the public sector, third sector will be losing their jobs,\\" Mr McQuillan told the Nolan Show. Northern Ireland's civil servants have been in control of finances for several months as a result of the ongoing deadlock. As uncertainty over future finances continues, the government programme Sure Start has announced that 50 jobs in its South Belfast branch were in \\"jeopardy due to a lack of decisions on the Northern Ireland budget\\". Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire suggested this week he was considering passing a budget from Westminster. To date, civil servants have only had 75% of the block grant allocation, but a budget bill would give them access to all £10bn of Northern Ireland's annual day-to-day spending funds. This would also split the cash among individual departments like health and education, says BBC News NI Business Correspondent Julian O'Neill. But it would still leave the question of who decides what polices or projects to spend it on, which are political decisions for ministers, not civil servants, adds our correspondent. On Tuesday DUP leader Arlene Foster said the question of pay for MLAs \\"would be relevant if we weren't doing any work\\". \\"I've indicated very clearly that we intend to continue the negotiations... over the coming months,\\" said the former first minister. \\"People will be off on holidays from time to time, but I think what you're hearing from myself and the DUP is a commitment to continue to do the work as we want to find an accommodation everyone can buy in to.\\" The most significant sticking points between the DUP and Northern Ireland's second largest party, Sinn Féin, remain an Irish language act, same-sex marriage, a Bill of Rights and measures to deal with the legacy of Northern Ireland's Troubles. In January, the late Martin McGuinness, of Sinn Féin, resigned in protest over the DUP's handling of an inquiry into a botched green energy scheme. His party had demanded that DUP leader Arlene Foster step aside temporarily to allow an investigation into the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme - which she set up - but Mrs Foster refused. Over the past six months, and during two elections at Stormont and Westminster, the two parties have remained deadlocked over a number of issues. What was that article about?","completion":"The article discusses the issue of salaries for Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) in Northern Ireland amid the lack of progress in forming a new power-sharing government.

Devolution in Northern Ireland has been placed on hold since January, when the power-sharing executive collapsed.

Paragraph: As his car slid downtown on Tuesday morning the mind of Arnold Thorndike was occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad, the Japanese loan, the new wing to his art gallery, and an attack that morning, in his own newspaper, upon his pet trust. But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease.

Input: Passage: To differentiate Nintendo's new home platform from the early 1980s' common perception of a troubled and shallow video game market, the company freshened its product nomenclature and positioning, and it established a strict product approval and licensing policy. The overall system was referred to as an \\"Entertainment System\\" instead of a \\"video game system\\", which was centered upon a machine called a \\"Control Deck\\" instead of a \\"console\\", and which featured software cartridges called \\"Game Paks\\" instead of \\"video games\\". The 10NES lockout chip system acted as a lock-and-key coupling of each Game Pak and Control Deck, deterring the copying or production of NES games which had not first achieved Nintendo's licensed approval. The packaging of the launch lineup of NES games bore pictures of a very close representation of the actual onscreen graphics of the game, which were of sufficiently recognizable quality on their own. Symbols on the launch games' packaging clearly indicated the genre of the game, in order to reduce consumer confusion. A 'seal of quality' was printed on all appropriately licensed game and accessory packaging. The initial seal stated, \\"This seal is your assurance that Nintendo has approved and guaranteed the quality of this product\\". This text was later changed to \\"Official Nintendo Seal of Quality\\".

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. Paragraph: Uncle Tom and uncle Sam both have high cholesterol. Uncle Tom is on statin drugs and uncle Sam is not. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which uncle doesn't take a drug that works slightly differently in many people? Answer:","completion":"Uncle Sam is the uncle who does not take a drug that works slightly differently in many people. According to the provided information, Uncle Tom is on statin drugs, which are known to have varying effects on individuals depending on their genetic background and single nucleotide polymorphisms. These statin drugs help lower cholesterol levels in the blood and can work differently based on each person's genetic makeup. Uncle Sam, on the other hand, is not taking any statin drugs, and therefore, he is not experiencing the variations in drug response caused by genetic factors. Pharmacogenomics is a field that studies the relationship between an individual's genetics and the effectiveness of pharmaceutical drugs, and it may help further understand why some people, like Uncle Tom, might experience more or less significant reductions in cholesterol levels when taking statin drugs compared to others."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: It's football training, but not as we know it. German champions Borussia Dortmund are boldly going where no club has gone before with the \\"Footbonaut\\", a soccer training machine powered by a smart phone. Winners of the Bundesliga title in each of the last two seasons, Dortmund has unveiled the 14-meter cage which is the brainchild of Berlin-based designer Christian Guttler. Once inside the \\"Footbonaut\\", a player is fed balls by eight different machines, having to find one of the 72 panels - - lit by a flashing green light -- which make up the space-age contraption before receiving another ball. Dortmund hope the device, which can also be operated using a tablet, will improve a player's technique, spatial awareness and peripheral vision. Intensity. Not that Dortmund requires much improvement. Jurgen Klopp's team sits fourth in the German top flight and is being heavily tipped for European success after excelling in a Champions League group containing Real Madrid, Manchester City and Ajax, with the Spanish club's manager Jose Mourinho viewing them as candidates to win the tournament. Klopp has instilled in Dortmund a non-stop adventurous style of football and the \\"Footbonaut\\" is the next step in their pursuit of excellence. \\"It´s as if you are surrounded by 10 colleagues who are there only to serve you balls,\\" said Dortmund's Australian youngster Mustafa Amini after a session inside the cage. \\"In the course of normal training that level of intensity just is not possible. The ´Footbonaut´ allows you to work on any weaknesses and ensures that you play at pace but with precision.\\" Guttler claims that after 15 minutes in the cage a player \\"will have received and passed on as many balls as he would in a normal week of training. \\"Repetition and intensity are crucial if you want to conquer a particular skill, whether that be playing football, tennis or learning the piano.\\" Perfect tool. Dortmund's success in recent years and the performances of players like striker Robert Lewandowski and midfielder Mario Gotze have attracted admiring glances from a host of top clubs. Japan's Shinji Kagawa and Nurin Sahin of Turkey have both been developed by Dortmund in recent years before being sold on to Manchester United and Real Madrid respectively. Sahin is currently on loan at Liverpool. And former Mainz coach Klopp hopes the \\"Footbonaut\\" can help Dortmund maintain their stellar standards. \\"It is the perfect tool to improve ball-handling skills,\\" said the 45-year-old. \\"It demands precise skills used at speed in a physically tough environment. It´s quite a package!\\" Echoing Klopp's excitement, Dortmund's chief scout Sven Mislintat is interested by the cage's potential to analyze player development. \\"We can closely monitor a player´s development with data gleaned from the machine,\\" said Mislintat. \\"There is no reason why a player cannot translate the actions practised in this environment onto the actual playing field.\\" Caution. But Belgian coach Michel Bruyninckx, who works with the Aspire Academy in Qatar -- the gulf kingdom which will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup -- struck a note of caution. \\"One of the major features of high performance is focused attention and that can be trained through this device,\\" Bruyninckx told CNN. \\"Brain research tells us that optimal learning requires that skill training must be embedded in the natural environment of an activity. This is not the case (with 'Footbonaut'). \\"The fact the player must react to a sound is not matching the reality of a game when a player reacts to visual information.\\" And Bruyninckx questioned the position of the player in the cage. \\"The fact the performing player always stays in the central position is also a disadvantage. In a game he has to move and search for the best position to receive the ball. \\"I am also curious to know how one-footed or technically less skilled players are going to react tn the 'Footbonaut'. For me you need to prepare a player for this kind of resource.\\" Bruyninckx also raised concerns over the grueling physical workout which the cage gives a player. \\"Using sweating as a parameter is not a good approach,\\" he said. \\"Too often coaches think that high intensity delivers high performance. Brain research tells us that if energy is low, learning will go down.\\" So, while the \\"Footbonaut\\" is one small step for Dortmund, it could take a giant leap for the device to become a fixture at training grounds across the world. Highlights:","completion":"1. Borussia Dortmund introduces the \\"Footbonaut,\\" a smartphone-powered soccer training machine designed by Berlin-based Christian Guttler. 2.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of warm air rising from the ocean can have a direct and indirect effect on the process of snow formation, potentially leading to less snow. Direct effect: When warm air rises from the ocean, it meets colder air in the atmosphere. If the temperature difference between the warm air and the cold air is not significant enough for the water vapor to condense and form ice crystals, snow formation will be hindered. The water vapor may instead condense into water droplets, leading to rain or other forms of precipitation, but not snow. Indirect effect: The increase in warm air can contribute to a general rise in temperatures, which might lead to less snowfall over time. Warmer air, in turn, could have an impact on weather patterns, influencing the distribution and frequency of snowfall in various regions.

Incumbency provides a huge election advantage . 7. Politicians almost always win reelection . 8. Term limits actually increase voter choice by making elections more competitive and encouraging more candidates to run . 9. In areas where term limits have been instituted there is far higher turnover amongst legislators , giving voters far more choice in who should represent them . 10. Legislators are reelected because they have better name recognition both with the electorate and with lobby groups .","completion":"The main point of these sentences is about how power should change over time and how term limits can be good. When people get to be in charge for a long time, they might stop doing what's best for everyone. In places like California, they made rules so leaders can only stay for some time. This made more people want to be leaders and they had different backgrounds. It's hard for new people to become leaders when the old ones stay for too long. Term limits make elections better and help people have more choices for their leaders.

Choices: * Gas powered fireplaces. * traditional fireplaces. Who is they referring to?","completion":"In the given statement, \\"they\\" refers to the traditional fireplaces. The statement is comparing gas powered fireplaces to traditional fireplaces in terms of their environmental friendliness. Traditional fireplaces require wood for combustion, whereas gas powered fireplaces use natural gas or propane as a fuel source. The reason why the statement suggests that gas powered fireplaces are more environmentally friendly than traditional fireplaces lies in the nature of the fuel sources and the combustion process. When wood is burned in a traditional fireplace, it releases a variety of pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). These pollutants can contribute to air pollution, health issues, and the greenhouse effect, causing harm to the environment and human health. Moreover, burning wood also produces creosote, a highly flammable byproduct that can accumulate in chimneys and cause dangerous chimney fires if not regularly cleaned. On the other hand, gas powered fireplaces use natural gas or propane as their fuel source. The combustion of these cleaner fuels produces fewer pollutants as compared to wood burning. While gas fireplaces still emit some pollutants like nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, the levels are significantly lower than those produced in wood burning fireplaces. Additionally, gas powered fireplaces do not produce creosote and have a lesser risk of causing chimney fires. Furthermore, gas fireplaces are more energy-efficient than traditional ones, as they utilize almost all the fuel for heating and have lower heat loss through the chimney. This increased efficiency can also be seen as an environmentally friendly feature. It is important to mention that though gas powered fireplaces might be considered more environmentally friendly when compared to traditional wood burning fireplaces, they are not completely free of environmental impact. The extraction, production, and transportation of natural gas or propane are associated with their own environmental challenges, like methane leaks and greenhouse gas emissions during the production process. However, in terms of their combustion process and emissions during usage, gas powered fireplaces have a lower environmental impact than traditional fireplaces that burn wood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Final preparations are underway for Friday’s historic third summit between the leaders of North and South Korea. In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War. Moon and Kim will hold direct talks in the Peace House conference hall, both in the morning and the afternoon, but the North Korean delegation will...

For example, before 2005, DST in Israel varied each year and was skipped some years. Windows 95 used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In Windows 98, Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year. The 2005 Israeli Daylight Saving Law established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way. Partial workarounds, which mishandled older time stamps, included manually switching zone files every year and a Microsoft tool that switches zones automatically.

Kate studied statins, while Carol studied anti-depressants. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student learned less about rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis? Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

(August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1955, William Smith (Jeremy Irons), a widower, lives with his nine-year-old son, Danny (Samuel Irons), in a vardo behind the filling station and garage where he works in the English countryside. The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest. He then spots two gamekeepers and hides from them, but then he hears them talking to someone in a deep hole in the ground; when they walk off to tell Hazell, Danny goes over and finds that the man in the hole is William,...

As a result, it is expected that most people in Group A would have a BMI within the healthy range of 18.5 to 24.9. On the other hand, Group B consumed an extra 1000 calories per day for two years. This additional caloric intake would have likely caused substantial weight gain for the individuals in this group. As their calorie consumption was consistently higher than what their bodies required, this excess energy would be stored as fat, leading to increased body weight. A BMI greater than 30.0 is classified as obese, and since individuals in Group B experienced significant weight gain, it can be inferred that more people in Group B had a BMI greater than 30.0. This increased BMI may also be associated with a higher risk of developing obesity-related health problems, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. It is important to note that while BMI can be a useful indicator of body composition and health risks, it should not be the sole determinant of a person's overall health status. Other factors, such as muscle mass, bone density, and lifestyle habits, should also be considered when assessing a person's well-being."},{"prompt":"Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which country would attract businesses requiring higher labor supply, Germany or France? After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries. Hint: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. A:","completion":"Germany would attract businesses requiring higher labor supply, as it has implemented a tax rate below the critical rate, leading to an increase in labor supply."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Available choices: A. negative; B. positive; TEXT:This is a very engrossing BBC-TV mini-series which is loosely based upon a mysterious disappearance of a young mother, but the series is really more of a study of the assorted characters in the story, which lasts for five hours. It is thus very much an ensemble piece, where the wide variety of brilliant British actors and actresses can show off their talents. The actual characters portrayed are really 'the kind of people one does not normally meet', people so boring and nondescript that it is difficult to admire them. For instance, the lead character is a young husband (the one whose wife disappears) who has no job and no apparent interest in finding any. He lives off handouts from his parents-in-law. He was once in the Army but does not appear to have the slightest flicker of any ambition or any interests in life apart from doting on his small family. He is played by David Oyelowo, who is brilliant at the part, coming across as a totally sympathetic person, although his only activities for five hours are loving and grieving, which he does superbly, so that one wants to comfort him, as he is so obviously a nice guy. The standout performance of the whole series is unquestionably Penelope Wilton, who acts circles round everyone else in the story. She is simply incredible. She portrays a very unsympathetic woman, indeed the only character in the story who is all too familiar to everyone, namely an irrational, hysterical, self-centred, dense, querulous, blindly loving and blindly hating, elderly idiot-woman. Alas, alas, we know them too well. Wilton is one of Britain's finest actresses (see my review of her in 'Half Broken Things'). She takes a character who could have been two-dimensional and makes her four-dimensional. She is wonderfully supported by old pro Patrick Malahide, who plays her exasperated husband, and the pair of them set a high standard indeed for all the younger players. Janet McTeer, a spectacular actress when younger, has become a much less sympathetic type of person now that she is older, has coarsened in some way, and puts one off, but she redeems herself in the latter stages of the story by showing how brilliant an actress she can be when she has a chance by pulling off one of the most convincing and original drunk scenes I have ever seen on film. The big surprise is the enigmatic character Sarah, played with great depth and originality by actress Sarah Smart. She takes a character who could have been insufferably tedious and by sheer acting magic turns her into a deeply mysterious and intriguing person, about whom we wonder tirelessly for the entire five hours. She is so good at it that we end up wondering about Sarah Smart, frankly. I guess that's what happens when you really do your job properly, that people wonder where the character ends and the actress begins, if she knows herself, that is, and many do not. She has some deeply unnerving tricks with her eyes, which wobble and let us know she is unhinged, but we are not sure how or why, though we eventually learn that she had an extremely violent and traumatic childhood. Her mastery of ambiguous facial expressions is extraordinary. Rory Kinnear is amazingly convincing as an apparently hopeless fellow who lives with his mum and isn't up to much, but who turns out to have hidden depths. (I suppose most people have hidden depths, but do we want to plumb them, that is the question.) His mum is played very well indeed by Margot Leicester. A superb performance is given by Lucinda Dryzek, who plays a snotty, revolting teenage girl of the sort we all dread to meet, but who at crucial moments collapses in helpless tears and turns out to be pathetic, with all her arrogance just a pose. Three other children are also very good, Lucinda's friend, and her younger half-brother and half-sister. The younger siblings may be very dim indeed as characters in the story (they seem unable to say anything particularly articulate, being hopeless witnesses to the disappearance), with little to recommend them but their sweet natures, but that is conveyed to wonderful effect by Lee Massey as the boy and Tyler Anthony as the girl. Harriet Walter has a small role, but we do not get to see much of her, which is a shame, as she is such a fine actress that she was wasted here. One could go on, but one must draw a line somewhere. The series manages to be strangely fascinating because of the depth of portrayal of all these essentially uninteresting people caught up in a web of intense anxiety and suspense.","completion":"B. positive Explanation: The text contains a detailed analysis of a TV mini-series, focusing on the excellent acting and depth of the characters.

The streets of... (Associated Press) At the annual fiesta in Bunol on Wednesday, trucks dumped 125 tons of ripe tomatoes for some 22,000 participants —many from abroad — to throw during the hour-long morning festivities. This was the second year non-resident participants were charged — 10 euros (13) — to take part. The town of about 20,000 people began charging to help pay off debts of some 5.5 million euros. The event was sold out weeks ahead. The event was inspired by a food fight between local children in 1945 in the tomato-producing region. ||||| Published: 27 Aug 2014 08:56 GMT+02:00 Thousands of half-naked revellers will pelt each other with squishy tomatoes on Wednesday in Spain's Tomatina, a world-renowned fiesta stained this year by a row over its privatization. Popular with visitors from Britain, Australia, the United States and Japan, the Tomatina brings the small eastern town of Buñol to world attention once a year for an orgy of goo dubbed \\"the world's biggest food fight\\". Mindful of safety and finances, the indebted local authorities last year began charging revellers an entry fee and hiring a private company, Spaintastic, to sell tickets. The town hall vowed to improve safety at the wild festival, in which participants drink sangria and splash around in the red juice and pulp. Before the privatization around 40,000 revellers would cram into the town, quadrupling its population. Places are now limited to 22,000. Check out the best photos from Spain's La Tomatina festival 2013 \\"In the past few years the essence of the Tomatina had been lost. There was no space and it was quite dangerous,\\" Buñol's deputy mayor and top Tomatina official Rafael Perez told news agency AFP. \\"Now it is much more enjoyable and Buñol locals who had stopped attending are coming back to it.\\" The entry fee \\"has enabled us to finance the fiesta and make it safer\\". 'Corruption' slur This year organizers have offered 5,000 tickets free to locals, while a further 17,000 have been sold -- most via tour companies that bus revellers to Buñol and fill them with sangria and paella. They have also launched a music festival to keep revellers in town after the one-hour tomato-pelting ritual ends at noon (1000 GMT) on Wednesday. The privatization of the popular and lucrative event has sparked squabbling among politicians in the town. Spain's governing conservative Popular Party — in opposition in Buñol — has demanded an investigation into whether it is carried out legally by the town hall, led by the United Left party. \\"We cannot look the other way when there has been a suspected case of corruption in an illegal privatization of the festival,\\" the PP's local spokesman Marcial Diaz told AFP. He said his party supported privatizing the Tomatina but alleged that Spaintastic \\"was awarded this business arbitrarily without any kind of public contract or bidding process\\". The deputy mayor Perez denied the allegations, branding the PP's lawsuit \\"a purely political move\\". \\"People in Buñol don't understand it. There is great anger about this,\\" he said. \\"They are soiling the image of Buñol and of the Tomatina. But we are not worried. We have most of the people of Buñol on our side.\\" Spaintastic, the company that sells the tickets refused to comment on the controversy when contacted by The Local earlier this year. Perez said that so far this year the Tomatina had brought in €170,000 (224,000) in ticket sales for the town hall and a further 10,000 euros in sponsorship. Like many Spanish towns, Buñol is deep in debt after Spain's financial crisis. SEE ALSO: Spain's top craziest festivals: The Local gallery According to a survey by financial newspaper Cinco Dias based on figures from the Spanish treasury, Buñol was €5.5 million in the red in 2013. The Tomatina started in the 1940s when locals brawling in the street at a folk festival seized tomatoes from a greengrocer's stall and hurled them at each other. This year participants will throw 125,000 tonnes of tomatoes produced specially for the Tomatina despite complaints that it is a shameful a waste of food. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"The Tomatina Festival is an annual event held in the town of Buñol, Spain, where thousands of participants from around the world gather to engage in a massive tomato fight.

Her boyfriend, Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) proposes to her before leaving for Sicily to attend to his dying mother; she accepts, but is insistent that they carefully follow tradition as she believes her first marriage was cursed by her failure to do so, resulting in her husband's death when he was hit by a bus. They plan to marry one month later, and Johnny asks Loretta to invite his estranged younger brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage) to the wedding. Loretta returns home and informs her parents of the engagement. Cosmo dislikes Johnny and is reluctant to commit to paying for the \\"real\\" wedding Loretta insists on, while Rose is pleased that Loretta likes Johnny but does not love him; she believes that one can easily be driven crazy by a partner whom one loves. The next day, Loretta goes to see Ronny at his bakery after he refuses to speak to her on the phone. He reveals that he has a wooden prosthetic hand, and he explains that he blames Johnny for the loss of his hand and his own fiancÃ©e; Ronny became distracted while talking to Johnny as he cut bread for him, his hand was mangled in the slicer, and his fiancÃ©e left him. Loretta insists that they discuss the matter upstairs in his apartment, where she cooks for him and then tells him that she believes he is a \\"wolf\\" who cut off his own hand to escape the trap of a bad relationship. Ronny reacts furiously and passionately, kissing Loretta (who responds to his kiss) and then sweeping her up in his arms and carrying her to his bed where they make love.

To achieve that, choose a reflowable layout instead of a fixed layout. - Use appropriate headers and subheaders: Organize your content using headings (H1, H2, H3) to make it easy for the reader to follow and navigate through the document. - Use readable font size and style: Choose fonts that are easy to read on-screen, such as sans-serif font types like Arial, Helvetica, or Calibri. Ensure that the font size is large enough for most screens. - Optimize line spacing and margins: Make sure to use a comfortable line spacing (1.5 or double-spaced) and have adequate margins for seamless reading. - Utilize bullet points and numbered lists: Use these to break down complex information and keep the content organized. 3. Table of Contents and Navigation: A dynamic table of contents will make it easier for readers to access specific topics and discussions throughout the e-book. Ensure that each section has its heading and is hyperlinked to the relevant pages in the e-book. You can also add a back-to-contents link on each page so that readers can easily return to the table of contents. 4. Including Visuals: Visuals, such as images, charts, graphs, and illustrations, can help break up the text and enhance understanding. Make sure visuals are high-resolution and appropriately sized for the screen. Don't forget to add descriptive alt-text to images for better accessibility. 5. Search Functionality: Incorporate a search tool within your e-book that allows readers to search for specific keywords or phrases. This functionality helps users find the information they need quickly and effortlessly. 6. Exporting and File Formats: To ensure compatibility with multiple e-book reading devices and software, export your e-book in popular file formats like EPUB, MOBI, and PDF. 7.

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What do Logan and Jessica notice are no longer operational once outside? Life-clocks Answer:","completion":"Title: Timeless Horizon Genre: Action, Adventure, Sci-fi, Drama Plot: In the year 2145, the world has been introduced to the life-clock – a revolutionary piece of technology designed by the enigmatic corporation, \\"Optimal Solutions.\\" The life-clock is implanted into every human at birth, measuring and displaying the remaining time a person has left to live. Once their time runs out, they quietly pass away. This global movement has led to a society with no crime, no violence, and no poverty – as everyone is motivated to make the best of their remaining time. Logan (an accomplished scientist working for Optimal Solutions) and Jessica (a journalist looking into the corporation's activities) are both lifelong friends, growing up in a city encased in Optimal Solutions's sophisticated megastructure. This swath of technology runs the entire city under a tightly controlled grid, connected to the life-clocks of all individuals residing within the city. The grid, however, also detects people who have a few moments left before their time expires, urging them to exit the city and head to a mysterious \\"transition zone\\" beyond the city walls. Suspicion begins to grow in Logan about what goes on in the city. Furthermore, Jessicas closely follows the increasing number of suicides, all of which appear to be related to people realizing that they may have a finite time still remaining. Logan and Jessica decide to explore the transition zone in question, only to find that once they step beyond the city walls, their life-clocks no longer seem to be functioning. Outside the city, they stumble upon a hidden utopian society called \\"Elysium,\\" where no one ages, everyone is healthy, and life-clocks are useless. The people of Elysium warmly greet them and share their profound secret – they have discovered a way to disable and nullify the life-clocks, enabling them to live free of Optimal Solutions's control and restrictions. Amazed by this revelation, Logan and Jessica learn about the ancient technology that Elysium uses to counteract the life-clocks. As it turns out, the life-clock system was designed by the corporation, not to promote peace, but to ultimately exert control over humanity and keep the population in check. Realizing the immorality of the life-clock system and driven by their desire to liberate the city from Optimal Solutions's dominance, Logan and Jessica lead the Elysium people on a daring mission to infiltrate the city. Their objective: to destroy the megastructure supporting the life-clock grid and free everyone from the bondage of limited, controlled lives. As they return to the city, they face numerous challenges, including a formidable city defense system activated by Optimal Solutions to protect their grip on the populace. Logan, Jessica, and the Elysium resistance must contend with a variety of technical and military obstacles. Their friendships and motivations are put to the test, and they must stay true to themselves and to each other throughout the journey. In the thrilling climax, Logan and Jessica face off against the sinister figurehead of Optimal Solutions, who tries to persuade them that the world would descend into chaos without the life-clock system. Despite this attempt to sway them, the duo infiltrates the company headquarters, disables the life-clock grid, and releases the information about the life-clocks' true purpose to the world. As the disgraced Optimal Solutions faces global consequences, the citizens of the city, now aware they are no longer controlled by their life-clocks, swarm outside, curious about the utopia beyond their borders. As they bask in their newfound freedom, Logan and Jessica look towards a new horizon, hoping to usher in an era where humanity can determine its own destiny. Timeless Horizon is a heart-pounding adventure of self-discovery, sacrifice, and the struggle against a seemingly insurmountable system, with our protagonists choosing whether to accept their deterministic lives or risk everything to live on their own terms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If \\"Several people sit on a train.\\", can we conclude \\"The people are sitting in a car.\\"?","completion":"The direct answer to your question is no, we cannot conclude that \\"The people are sitting in a car.\\" based on the information you've provided, \\"Several people sit on a train.\\" Understanding the context is vital. Trains and cars are different means of transportation. A train refers to a series of connected vehicles traveling on a railroad track and serves to transport people or goods long distances. On the other hand, a car usually refers to an automobile, which is usually a smaller, more individualized and flexible mode of transportation for relatively shorter distances. The people are specifically identified as on a train in your statement. It indicates that they are traveling or seated inside the train. Using \\"on,\\" you're describing people being in a train for a journey, not inside an individual car (as in an automobile). However, it should be noted that in some contexts, especially in relation to trains, the word \\"car\\" can be used to describe the individual sections of a train. So, if by \\"car\\" you are referring to a carriage or compartment within the train, then it could be understood as the people are sitting in a car of the train. But that would require further clarification of the context. Without further context or information, we couldn't make that assumption based solely on the original statement. Remember that clear and precise communication is crucial for avoiding misunderstandings. The terms we use and the context in which we use them are key to ensuring our messages are interpreted as we mean them to be. You might want to consider these nuances the next time you're crafting a sentence about trains or cars or any other context-dependent topics."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This forthcoming deal is expected to address critical concerns from both sides and promote economic growth and cooperation. The issue of softwood lumber exports has persisted between the neighboring countries for decades, causing considerable trade disputes in the past. Both nations have vehemently defended their respective lumber industries, resulting in increased tensions and a series of lawsuits. The necessity to come to an understanding has become more evident as each country's economy is considerably impacted by the timber industry. The conclusion of this matter would restore balance in tariffs and quotas, allowing for a more equitable distribution of softwood across the borders. In forging this new agreement, Canada and the United States are demonstrating a commitment to settle disputes amicably, ensuring that both countries benefit from the arrangement. The deal is expected to support the growth and development of each nation's lumber industry while maintaining healthy competition and fair trade practices.

But rather than going to the airport as planned, Jack decides to drive the family to Miami to meet the Fockers in his new RV. Once they arrive, they are greeted by Greg's eccentric but fun-loving and amiable father, Bernie (Hoffman), and mother, Roz (Streisand), who is a sex therapist for elderly couples. Worried that Jack may be put off by the Fockers' lifestyle, Greg convinces Roz to pretend that she is a yoga instructor for the weekend. Though Jack and Bernie get off to a good start, small cracks begin to form between Jack and the Fockers, due to their contrasting personalities. Things are made worse when a chase between the Fockers' dog, Moses, and the Byrnes' cat, Jinx, culminates with Jinx flushing Moses down the RV's toilet, forcing Bernie to destroy it to save Moses.

Please answer the following question: \\"That's Glenn Miller,\\" my father said. \\"But it can't be.\\" He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44.

When did the narrator bring the record to his father? - not enough information - After dancing with his mother - After winning eBay auction - After going to Glen Island Casino A:","completion":"The narrator brought the record to his father after winning the eBay auction. The passage explains that the narrator acquired a spool of recording wire with a date written on it, as part of a lot purchased on eBay. This lot also included a wire recorder and a stack of 78s by French pop stars like Charles Trenent and Edith Piaf. Intrigued by the mysterious date on the recording wire, which indicated that Glenn Miller should have already died when the recording was presumably made, the narrator decided to share this rare find with their father, who had a deep emotional connection to Glenn Miller. The father's attachment to Glenn Miller originates from the memories of dancing with the narrator's mother at Glen Island Casino in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. During those early days of World War II, the unique sound of Glenn Miller's music became intertwined with the sentiments of first love and idealism, which resonated deeply with their father. Bringing the mysterious recording to their father not only stirred up lively discussions about Miller's music but also evoked a sense of nostalgia and fondness for the past. However, both the father and older sister Ann reacted with skepticism and disapproval when the narrator played the recording. Their father noted that Glenn Miller would not have played with such a chaotic and seemingly inebriated band, even though the trombone solo had the same muffed notes as in the original Victor version of \\"King Porter Stomp.\\" Consequently, the narrator's attempt to share this peculiar find only brought about questions and doubts, rather than a shared appreciation for the music. In conclusion, the narrator brought the record to their father after winning the eBay auction, hoping to uncover more information about this puzzling recording and perhaps share a meaningful connection to Glenn Miller's music with their father. Though they were unsuccessful in doing so, the encounter sheds light on family dynamics, the significance of music in shaping one's personal history, and the endless mysteries that can arise from unexpected discoveries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The museum is leasing the locomotive. 2. The museum is being operated through its subsidiary (The North Shore Scenic Railroad # 2719). In this case, the focus of the operations is shifted from the locomotive to the museum itself. The action specified in this sentence indicates that the museum is being operated by its subsidiary, which is now explicitly identified as the North Shore Scenic Railroad # 2719.

Image caption The eastern city of Deir al-Zour has seen fierce fighting since the uprising began Rebels have attacked a village in eastern Syria, killing dozens of Shia Muslim residents, most of them pro-government fighters, activists say. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said at least 60 people died in Hatla on Tuesday. The attack appeared to be retaliation for a raid on a rebel position by people from the village, it added. Meanwhile, a government helicopter has reportedly fired three missiles at the northern Lebanese border town of Arsal. Lebanese officials said one of the missiles had struck the town centre, and that a woman and her daughter were slightly hurt. Arsal is a predominantly Sunni town about 15km (9 miles) from the Syrian border that is home to some 27,000 Syrian refugees. It was used as a staging-post by Syrian rebels during the recent battle for the strategically important town of Qusair. Qusair was recaptured by the army last week with help from the Lebanese Shia Islamist movement, Hezbollah. The situation in the village is quiet and the [rebel] Free Syrian Army is in full control Thaer al-Deiry, Activist in Deir al-Zour province 'Apostate rejectionists' According to activists, the fighting in Hatla, a predominantly Shia village just to the east of the city of Deir al-Zour, started after pro-government Shia militiamen mounted an attack on a nearby rebel position on Monday, killing at least two opposition fighters. The rebels then massed for an attack and overran Hatla the next day. The SOHR reported that 60 Shia residents were killed, most of them fighters who had been armed by the government a few weeks earlier. At least 10 rebels were killed in the fighting on Tuesday, and surviving Shia residents of Hatla were forced to flee to nearby Jafra, it added. The London-based Syrian Network of Human Rights also said 60 people had been killed, while an activist in Deir al-Zour province, Thaer al-Deiry, confirmed the rebel attack had been in retaliation for an earlier raid. \\"The situation in the village is quiet and the [rebel] Free Syrian Army is in full control,\\" he told the Associated Press. Image caption A video posted online on Tuesday purportedly showed jihadist rebel fighters in Hatla A video posted online on Tuesday, entitled The Storming And Cleansing of Hatla, showed dozens of gunmen carrying the black flags associated with jihadist groups, celebrating and firing weapons in the streets of a small town. \\"We have raised the banner [saying] 'There is no God but God' above the houses of the apostate rejectionists, the Shia, and the holy warriors are celebrating,\\" the cameraman says, according to the Reuters news agency. \\"This is a Sunni area. It does not belong to other groups,\\" one fighter shouts in the video. A government official in Damascus said the rebels had \\"carried out a massacre against villagers in which older people and children were killed\\". Hezbollah said Shia clerics, their wives and children had been among those killed in what it called an act of sectarian cleansing, inspired by prominent Sunni clerics in the region who have issued calls for Sunnis to go to Syria to join the battle against President Bashar al-Assad. The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says the incident has underlined the deepening sectarian nature of the struggle in Syria. The two-year-old conflict pits rebels who are mostly from the majority Sunni community against government forces led by Mr Assad's Alawite sect, a heterodox offshoot of Shia Islam. Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague is to travel to Washington on Wednesday for talks with his US counterpart John Kerry to discuss the West's response to the continued bloodshed, including whether to begin supplying the rebels with weapons. On Tuesday, French foreign ministry spokesman Philippe Lalliot said the conflict in Syria was \\"at a turning point\\". \\"What should we do under these conditions to reinforce the opposition armed forces? We have had these discussions with our partners, with the Americans, the Saudis, the Turks, many others.\\" \\"We cannot leave the opposition in the current state,\\" he added. More than 80,000 people have been killed and 1.6 million have fled to neighbouring countries since the uprising against Mr Assad began in March 2011, according to the UN. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

The attack was another sign of how a revolt that began more than two years ago with peaceful protests against four decades of Assad family rule is descending into sectarian bloodshed. A video posted online by rebels on Tuesday, entitled \\"The storming and cleansing of Hatla\\" showed dozens of gunmen carrying black Islamist flags celebrating and firing guns in the streets of a small town as smoke curled above several buildings. \\"We have raised the banner 'There is no God but God' above the houses of the apostate rejectionists, the Shi'ites, and the holy warriors are celebrating,\\" the voice of the cameraman says. In the Damascus area, rebels reported that 27 of their comrades had been killed in an ambush near the town of al-Maraj. Video uploaded by activists showed victims shot in the face or head. The camera scanned over several bloodied and dirt-coated corpses as men called out for help washing the bodies. Musaab Abu Qutada, an opposition activist, said the men had been trying to break through a military blockade to bring supplies into rebel strongholds in suburbs of the capital. Assad's forces, backed by the Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah, won a significant victory by seizing the border town of Qusair last week and are now believed to be preparing offensives on rebel-held areas near Damascus and Aleppo. Many of the fighters involved in the Hatla attack were said to be from the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Hardline Sunni groups often refer to Shi'ites as rejectionists because they deny the legitimacy of the Prophet Mohammad's first successors. \\"This is a Sunni area, it does not belong to other groups,\\" one fighter shouted in the video purportedly filmed in the town of Hatla in the eastern province of Deir al-Zor. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a pro-opposition monitoring group that has reported abuses on both sides of the conflict, put the death toll in Tuesday's attack at 60, saying most victims were pro-Assad Shi'ite militiamen. Assad's minority Alawite sect is rooted in Shi'ite Islam. Most rebels are Sunnis. The Observatory said many Shi'ite civilians, a minority in the mixed town of Hatla, had fled elsewhere in the province. ANTI-HEZBOLLAH PROTESTS The conflict in Syria has stoked Sunni-Shi'ite tensions in the region, with Iran and Hezbollah supporting Assad, and Sunni-ruled nations such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar backing the rebels. Sunni militants have also poured in to help the rebels. Dozens of Kuwaitis gathered outside the Lebanese Embassy in Kuwait late on Tuesday to protest against Hezbollah's role in Syria. Protesters burned a picture of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a photo published in local media showed. \\"The mujahideen in Lebanon are preparing ... for the battle which you started, Hezbollah,\\" a Kuwaiti cleric named Shafi al-Ajami said in a video of the demonstration posted on YouTube. \\"We are arming the mujahideen from here (Kuwait), and from the Arabian Peninsula, the Gulf states, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey,\\" he said. He said funds for the effort were coming from \\"honorable people\\", not governments. Kuwaiti Islamists have started a Twitter campaign named \\"Kuwaitis prepare 12,000 mujahideen\\" as well as an online fundraising drive to help arm Syrian rebels. Ajami said Syria would become \\"the graveyard for the party of Satan\\" - a common slur used by rebels against Hezbollah, whose name means \\"party of God\\" in Arabic. In Hatla, some opposition activists said the attack included summary killings and the burning of Shi'ite places of worship. Activist Karam Badran, who spoke to Reuters from Deir al-Zor, said only 20 people had been confirmed killed in Hatla but that another 20 had been taken hostage by the rebels. He said the attackers' main motive was not sectarian, but what he and the Observatory said were government attempts to recruit militiamen of all faiths in an area rebels had held for a year. Shi'ites had not previously been harmed there, he said. Badran said the Hatla killings had also followed an attack on Monday by pro-Assad militiamen on a rebel checkpoint outside the provincial capital Deir al-Zor, in which several opposition fighters had been killed and dozens wounded. \\"Three of the men killed were three Shi'ite clerics. They were executed and hung on the gates of the town,\\" Badran said. \\"But among the dead were also Sunnis (who had joined pro-Assad militia). This is really about betrayal.\\" (Additional reporting by Sylvia Westall in Kuwait; Editing by Alistair Lyon) ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Rebels attacked a village in eastern Syria, killing dozens of Shia Muslim residents who were mainly pro-government fighters.

A University of Wisconsin senior official resigned after making unwanted sexual advances to a male student employee of the school's athletic department, according to a report released this week. John Chadima resigned his post as senior associate athletic director at UW-Madison earlier in January after the allegations surfaced. The allegations were investigated by an independent panel and the report was released Tuesday night. The report alleges that Chadima made the advance in late December at a Rose Bowl party that he was throwing at a hotel in Los Angeles. There was beer and mixed drinks at that party and about 25 to 30 people attended, including employees that were under the age of 21, the report said. As the party was ending, Chadima asked one student to stay behind and have a drink with him. The two each had three rum drinks. The report called the student, who is over the age of 21, John Doe. \\"Chadima told John Doe that he thought that Doe might be gay,\\" the report says. \\"Chadima reached over and removed Doe's pants belt and then inserted his hand inside Doe's pants on his genitals.\\" The student slapped Chadima's hand away and swore at him, the report says. \\"What are you going to do about it?

Sentence from a movie review: desperate miscalculation Select your answer: was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review? Select from the following. i. negative. ii. positive.","completion":"Based on the sentence \\"desperate miscalculation\\" from a movie review, it can be inferred that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer. The term \\"desperate\\" has a negative connotation, and when combined with \\"miscalculation,\\" it suggests that the person critiquing the film feels that there was a significant error or poor judgment made in some aspect of the movie. This could be in the plot, dialogue, acting, or other features that contribute to a film's overall quality and appeal. Moreover, when analyzing the language used in movie reviews, it is essential to pay attention to the emotional tone or sentiment expressed by the reviewer. The use of words with negative connotations can signal a disapproval of the film, while words with positive connotations would typically indicate the reviewer's enjoyment or satisfaction. In this specific case, the choice of \\"desperate\\" conveys a sense of urgency or extreme need. It implies that the movie failed to deliver the desired outcome and made a bad attempt to achieve it, or compromised the intended message or purpose. \\"Miscalculation\\" further supports this negative sentiment by suggesting a misunderstanding or an incorrect assessment in executing the film's creative vision. These two words together indicate that the reviewer found the film lacking in quality or substance.

UCLA professor, Dr. Davis McClaren, arrives at the base. He presses Shepard to take him to Mount Melbourne to find a rare meteorite from Mercury. Shepard decides that the only way to get to Mount Melbourne is by dog sled. Shepard and McClaren make it to Mount Melbourne, but are called back to base camp due to an approaching heavy storm. McClaren begs for more time, and Shepard gives him half a day, which is enough time to find a fragment of the meteorite. En route back to base, McClaren slips down an embankment, breaking his leg and falling into freezing water. Shepard uses the lead dog Maya to carry a rope to McClaren and pulls him out. The two battle hypothermia, frostbite and near whiteout conditions as the dogs lead them home. Once there, the entire human crew is immediately evacuated, while the dogs are left behind. Certain that their pilot will return within days for the dogs, Shepard tightens their collars to ensure they cannot get loose and run away. Because of the harsh weather conditions, no rescue will be attempted until the next spring - and by then the dogs will be dead. Back at home, Shepard tries to secure a plane to return and save the dogs, but no one is willing to finance the risky expedition. Five months later, Shepard makes one last attempt to get back. McClaren realizes the magnitude of his ingratitude and uses the remaining balance of his grant money to finance a rescue mission. Shepard acknowledges that there is almost no chance that any of the dogs have survived this long, but he owes it to his team to go back for them. After being left behind, the eight sled dogs â lead dog Maya, Old Jack, Shorty, Dewey, Truman, Shadow, Buck, and the young Max, wait in the freezing conditions for Shepard to return.

President Donald Trump is shifting his focus back to domestic issues after returning late Tuesday from a 12-day trip to Asia. This week, Trump will resume pressing congressional Republicans to pass a tax reform measure to follow through on one of his key campaign promises. Trump appears to be working closely with Republican congressional leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. \\"We ran in 2016 on doing this tax reform,\\" Ryan told reporters at the Capitol. \\"The president ran on doing this tax cut and tax reform. So this is about fulfilling our promises to the American people.\\" However, since the president was last in the country, he and his Republican allies in Congress face a new political landscape in the wake of last week's gubernatorial election victories by Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey. In Virginia, exit polls showed that many voters were motivated primarily by their opposition to the president. \\"The fact that the president is so polarizing and so unpopular with approval ratings generally under about 40 percent, and Democrats are going to be extra-motivated to come out,\\" said University of Virginia political analyst Kyle Kondik. Kondik said the strong Democratic showing in statewide races in Virginia last week was the best non-presidential election showing for the party since 2006, the last time Democrats nationally won control of the House of Representatives. Many Democrats believe a focus on Trump could help them retake control of the House next year. \\"You can sort of smell when a wave is beginning, no guarantee it continues, but it is likely to,\\" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. \\"And that smell that was in the air in 2005 is in the air now.\\" Trump's approval ratings remain historically low for a first-year president — with several recent polls showing him below 40 percent — which could be a warning sign for Republicans ahead of next year's elections. \\"If the president is where he is today, I think that is going to be very difficult for the party to even hold the House of...

The speaker further highlights the significance of promoting economic and social development, which is essential for the overall growth and betterment of a region or a nation. Economic development is crucial because it fosters the creation of job opportunities, encourages innovation and entrepreneurship, and helps to raise the living standards of a population.

Generate a question that has the following answer: A witch for the following movie plot: Shortly after the Columbine High School massacre, Union Intermediate High School (in Tulsa, Oklahoma) was one of many schools around the country increasing security measures to prevent school shootings. Brandi Blackbear wrote horror stories similar to those of Stephen King, dressed in a slightly Gothlike way, and was not afraid to be herself, or to stand up to bullying by popular kids. Her defiance engendered hostility toward her from certain segments of her school's culture. False stories of threats of violence were circulated, and the combination of her writing and authorities' natural hyperawareness following Columbine led to her being suspended. When some of her fellow students later saw her checking out a book on world religions, including Wicca (as research for her stories), they immediately branded her a witch, and eventually accused her of casting a spell that made a teacher sick. Fear of her spread through much of the school, and she was once again suspended.Finally, her parents went to the ACLU, where they were told they had a good case against the school for violating her civil rights. The ACLU sued the affluent school for 10 million, even though the Blackbears were not sure they deserved that much based on what Brandi had suffered. Still, the ACLU argued that the school would not take any lesser claim seriously. When the school offered a settlement, the Blackbears refused. They were not interested in the money, despite needing it; what they really wanted was to have their story heard in court to inform the public that the school had mistreated Brandi. The judge ruled to dismiss the charges rather than going to trial, and ordered the Blackbears to pay 6000 in court fees, which they could not afford. Eventually it was agreed to drop the fees if the Blackbears dropped their appeal.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher... Answer:","completion":"Camille"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him? Answer the above question based on the context below: Pod was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums. Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects.

The first of which make of car came off the assembly line at Fisherman's Bend in September 1948? What is the answer?","completion":"The first make of car that came off the assembly line at Fisherman's Bend in September 1948 was the Holden 48-215, also known as the Holden FX. Fisherman's Bend, located in Port Melbourne, Australia, was home to General Motors-Holden's (GM-H) new manufacturing plant, which was responsible for producing Australia's first mass-produced car. Holden, an Australian automobile manufacturer, was a subsidiary of the American company General Motors. In the early 20th century, Holden was primarily involved in the production of horse saddles, leather goods, and later, vehicle bodies. However, with the establishment of the manufacturing plant at Fisherman's Bend and strong backing from General Motors, the company was able to debut its first full-scale automobile in 1948. The Holden FX (48-215) was a milestone for the Australian automobile industry and a significant achievement for Holden as a car manufacturer. It was specifically designed and developed to suit Australian terrain and driving conditions. The car featured an all-steel monocoque construction, a revolutionary feature for its time, which provided a more rigid, lightweight, and safer structure compared to traditional body-on-frame designs. This construction method not only enhanced the vehicle's strength but also contributed to improved handling and fuel efficiency. Under the hood, the Holden FX was equipped with a 2.15L straight-six engine, which was linked to a three-speed manual transmission. The engine produced approximately 60 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque, promising impressive performance for its time. The car's rear-wheel-drive layout allowed for better weight distribution and handling, while the fully-independent front suspension made for a more comfortable ride. Upon its release, the Holden FX received an overwhelmingly positive response from the Australian public. It was praised for its robustness and reliability, and quickly became known as the ultimate \\"Australian family car\\" for its practicality and affordability. This success laid the foundation for Holden's dominance in the Australian automobile market for several decades. Even though Holden ceased its manufacturing operations in Australia in 2017, the automobile giant's legacy continues with its rich history, and the Holden 48-215 remains a symbol of Australian automotive innovation and ingenuity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create.

Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, mentioned in an interview that they recorded the heartbeat of M.I.A.'s one-year-old son, Ikyhd.

Both sentences convey the same core information about Yves Préfontaine: that he is a Canadian writer born on February 1, 1937, in Quebec, specifically Montreal. However, there are subtle differences in the structure and presentation of information between the two sentences. The first sentence, \\"Yves Préfontaine ( born February 1 , 1937 in Quebec ) is a Canadian writer in Montreal , Quebec , Canada .\\", starts by identifying Yves Préfontaine and his birth details, followed by an indication that he is a Canadian writer currently based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The second sentence, \\"Yves Préfontaine ( born February 1 , 1937 in Montreal , Quebec ) is a Canadian writer who lives in Quebec .\\", begins similarly by providing Yves Préfontaine's name and birth information (specifically mentioning Montreal this time) and then states that he is a Canadian writer living in the broader Quebec region.

Why does the mainstream media love Kim Kardashian but turn their nose up at porn stars when Kim only came to light for doing a sex tape? Why is the “mainstream” media attacking Trump for visiting Louisiana when Obama is doing nothing but playing golf as reported by the same media? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The two questions posed are different in nature but have a common ground - they both point towards the role and perception of the mainstream media in shaping public opinion and narrative on given situations. Firstly, the question related to Kim Kardashian and porn stars, addresses the discrepancy between the media's treatment of Kim Kardashian and performers in the adult film industry. The mainstream media's attention to Kim Kardashian can be attributed to several factors: 1. Celebrity culture: Despite Kim Kardashian's rise to fame starting with a leaked sex tape, she has since strategically built a brand on her image and her family's lifestyle. They have successfully turned into a reality TV empire, and the media's coverage of Kim's life sells stories and attracts audiences. 2. Sensationalism: Mainstream media thrive on sensationalism. Kim Kardashian's lifestyle, relationships, and personal experiences, are often portrayed in a way that provokes curiosity and debate. This interest in her life is profitable for the media and becomes a self-perpetuating cycle of coverage. 3. Changing cultural norms: Though Kim Kardashian's initial claim to fame emerged from the release of a sex tape, society has evolved since then, with more progressive and inclusive attitudes towards sex and sexuality. As a result, Kim's celebrity status has overshadowed the controversial origins of her fame. On the other hand, porn stars, who openly work in the adult film industry, tend to remain marginalized and stigmatized because: 1. Social taboos: Porn stars are often met with social stigma because they voluntarily participate in an industry that is still seen as scandalous and taboo by many. This may influence mainstream media to generally avoid legitimizing the work and lives of porn stars in their coverage. 2. Market viewership: Mainstream media also cater to a broader audience, which includes conservative and progressive viewers. Covering porn stars may alienate parts of their audience, thus making it less profitable and desirable for mainstream media organizations. Regarding the second question, the issue at hand is the perception of media bias and its impact on the public's understanding of political figures. This question specifically relates to President Trump and President Obama. The mainstream media's criticism of Trump visiting Louisiana contrasts with their reporting on Obama's absence from the same situation. This inconsistency may stem from several factors: 1. Political bias: Depending on individual publication and network affiliations, the media may harbor partisan perspectives. It is important to recognize that the mainstream media is not a monolithic entity, as different outlets may have different reporting standards and biases. 2. Polarizing personalities: Donald Trump has a polarizing personality, which tends to provoke stronger reactions from the media and the public. In contrast, President Obama was seen as a more measured individual. This difference in temperament may have influenced some media outlets to view Trump's visit to Louisiana more cynically than Obama's absence. 3. News cycle dynamics: The news cycle is fast-moving and competitive. It is not uncommon for the media to emphasize controversies and conflicts to maintain their audience's interest. The framing of such situations also depends on the events happening around that time, leading to fluctuations in coverage and prioritization. In sum, the two questions raised are not the same but share the underlying themes of media perception and potential bias. Both questions highlight the importance of context and understanding the complex relationship between media organizations, public figures, and the influence of celebrity and political culture."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Please answer the following question: In recent years, temperatures in the polar areas are rising faster than anywhere else on Earth. As a result, the ice and the snow are melting at record-setting rates. One result is that sea levels are rising around the world, putting animals and people at risk. A sheet of ice acts like a huge mirror, reflecting the sun's energy. But ocean water, which is darker than ice, absorbs a lot of it. This causes the ocean to warm, which in turn speeds up ice melting and which leads to even more open waters. The cycle continues until all the ice is gone. \\"As the ice melts, water flows into the oceans, making them less salty. That, along with warmer water temperatures, can harm the creatures that live in, under, and near the ice,\\" says zoologist Michael Stoddard. \\"Cold-adapted animals -- including polar bears, foxes, hares, and seals -- also need ice for travel and survival.\\" \\"Most species of fish, sea spiders, and many other animals and plants that live in the waters of Antarctica don't live anywhere else,\\" Stoddard says. \\"Many of them have special proteins in their bodies keeping them from freezing to death and have other adaptation to the cold that has yet to be explored.\\" Therefore, experts are urging us to reconsider the way we live. The fuels that we burn in cars, power stations, and factories are largely to blame for the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are trapping overmuch heat in our atmosphere. If we can produce fewer of these gases, we can help save the polar ice. \\"Even small things would make a difference, if everyone did them.\\" Michael Stoddard says, \\"That's what we have to figure out in the near future to help save the polar ice and thus protect the oceans and us.\\" The passage is mainly written to _ .

It must have been exception because everyone else seemed to have better service. The food: I tried the new york, hand tossed pepperoni pizza and the house salad with italian dressing; both orders came promptly. I was not too wild about the salad because it was nothing special (lettuce, tomato, cheese, carrot, etc.). The best part of the pizza here was the crust and everything else could have been better.

Choose appropriate sources. Read your sources critically Incorporate primary sources, if applicable. Evaluate online sources carefully.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Unlocking the Full Potential of Research: Leveraging School Resources and Choosing Credible Sources Introduction In the age of information, the success of any research project heavily depends on the proper selection and evaluation of resources. As students, we often find ourselves overwhelmed by the sheer number of sources available at our fingertips. Unfortunately, without recognizing the importance of quality over quantity in our research, our work may end up lacking depth and credibility. In this article, we will delve into the significance of leveraging your school's resources, selecting appropriate sources, reading critically, incorporating primary sources when possible, and evaluating online sources with care. Taking Advantage of Your School's Resources Schools and universities typically provide a wide range of resources that are designed to support students in their research projects. These resources often include access to research databases, academic journals, and other scholarly materials that may not be easily accessible to the general public. 1. Library: The school library is an indispensable resource for any research project. Librarians can help you identify key sources related to your topic, locate hard-to-find materials, and provide guidance on citation styles. Additionally, the library likely subscribes to numerous scholarly databases and academic journals that are crucial for in-depth research. 2. Professors and advisers: Your professors and academic advisers are also valuable resources in your research journey. With their expertise in their respective fields, they can offer direction and suggestions regarding the most relevant sources or authors related to your topic. 3. Student research centers and services: Many schools have dedicated research centers or services to assist students with various aspects of research, from managing citations to editing papers. Utilizing these resources can help ensure your research process is well-organized and professional. Choosing Appropriate Sources Selecting appropriate sources is a fundamental step in ensuring the credibility of your research. This involves carefully considering the type and purpose of each source, its relevance to your research question, and its overall quality. 1. Align sources with your research objectives: Determine the types of sources that will be most beneficial to your research project. Are you seeking scholarly articles, case studies, or results from experimental research? Knowing what kind of information you need will help you filter your search and boost efficiency. 2. Evaluate source credibility: As you collect potential sources, consider the authority of their authors and publishers. Are they experts in the field? Are the sources published in reputable journals or by respected academic presses? Avoid sources with little or no supporting evidence or that appear to be biased. Reading Your Sources Critically Analyzing and engaging with your sources on a deeper level is essential for producing high-quality research. Critically reading your sources entails evaluating their methodologies, evidence, and arguments, while also identifying any potential biases or inconsistencies. 1. Take notes and annotate: As you read your sources, take comprehensive notes and highlight key concepts, themes, or arguments. This process aids in digesting the information and identifying patterns that will help form the basis of your research paper. 2. Ask critical questions: Reflect on the assumptions and motivations underlying the source materials. Are there any gaps or inconsistencies in the author's argument? Can you identify alternative interpretations or perspectives that might challenge the conclusions reached by the author? Incorporating Primary Sources Primary sources, such as correspondence, diaries, government documents, and eyewitness accounts, provide firsthand evidence or direct access to an event, phenomenon, or period of time. Whenever possible, researchers should incorporate primary sources into their projects. 1. Foster authentic understanding: Primary sources offer a unique and unfiltered perspective on historical, social, and cultural issues, allowing for a deeper and more nuanced understanding of your research subject. 2. Strengthen your argument: By providing direct evidence, primary sources help to support and strengthen the claims made in your research paper. Evaluating Online Sources Carefully The internet has revolutionized the research process. However, evaluating the credibility of online sources can be particularly challenging, as not all websites follow the same rigorous standards as traditional print resources. 1. Assess domain authority: Check whether the website is associated with a reputable institution, such as a university or national organization. Reliable domain extensions often include .edu, .gov, and .org. 2. Review the author's credentials and publication date: The author's expertise and the timeliness of the information should be verified. Outdated information may not be relevant to your research topic, and anonymous authors may lack credibility. 3. Cross-reference information: To validate the reliability of an online source, cross-reference its information with other reputable sources. If the facts and arguments align, it is more likely that the online source is trustworthy. Conclusion In conclusion, leveraging your school's resources, selecting appropriate sources, reading critically, and evaluating online sources meticulously play pivotal roles in the creation of a successful and credible research project. By employing these strategies, students can build a robust bibliography and establish themselves as knowledgeable and reliable researchers in their field."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Inspector Clouseau for the following movie plot: Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) is called to the country home of millionaire Benjamin Ballon (George Sanders) to investigate the murder of his chauffeur, Miguel Ostos. The chauffeur was having an affair with one of the maids, Maria Gambrelli (Elke Sommer), and attacked her in her bedroom after she broke off with him. Miguel was shot and killed in her bedroom and Maria was found with the smoking gun in her hand, but claims no knowledge of how it got there as she maintains she was knocked unconscious. All evidence points to Maria as the killer, but Clouseau is convinced of her innocence because he has developed an immediate attraction to her. Realizing Clouseau has been inadvertently assigned to a high profile case, Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) has him removed and personally takes charge of the investigation. Dejected, Clouseau returns home. He is awakened in the early hours of the morning by an apparent attempt on his life by a Chinese assassin. When the phone rings, the life or death struggle ceases and it becomes apparent that his assailant is his valet, Kato (Burt Kwouk), to whom Clouseau has given instructions to attack him when he least expects it to keep his senses sharp. The Inspector is reinstated to the Ballon case and immediately orders Maria Gambrelli's release from prison, as he is convinced she is shielding the real killer, who Clouseau suspects is Ballon himself. A series of additional murders of the Ballon staff follows. Each time the evidence points to Maria, who is continually arrested, only to have Clouseau release her again despite the growing number of murder charges laid at her feet. Clouseau's actions embarrass the SÃ»retÃ© in the press, but Commissioner Dreyfus is unable to remove him from the case because Ballon has exerted political influence to keep the unorthodox and seemingly incompetent detective assigned to the investigation. As Clouseau continues to bungle the case, Commissioner Dreyfus becomes increasingly unhinged and suffers a nervous breakdown that reduces him to a...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please write a short summary for the following article: 11 Year Old Composer Will Premiere Her Opera (VIENNA)— Alma Deutscher is a composer, virtuoso pianist and concert violinist who wrote her first sonata five years ago and whose first full opera will have its world premiere next month — and she’s only 11. Time-worn associations with Mozart, who wrote his first symphony at age 8, may come to mind. So can questions whether Alma’s unique talent could get in the way of a happy childhood. But fresh from rehearsal, Alma laughs dismissively. “I think for me it’s more interesting to be Alma” instead of Mozart, she says. And being special “is really normal because I don’t know anything else.” When not living music, the child prodigy from Dorking, England, is busy scraping her knees climbing trees, meeting friends on the playground, swimming and many other activities that an 11-year-old would enjoy. But when focused on her passion, she’s all business. Rehearsing “Cinderella” recently, Alma gave instructions and sang phrases in a clear child’s soprano, switching from piano to violin and back as she accompanied the soloists. It all seemed effortless. But the slight child in the red woolen tights and floral print dress was clearly in charge — and enjoying running the show. The energy doesn’t stop flowing off stage. Alma doesn’t even try to sit still, gesturing and fidgeting as she talks about “Cinderella.” She says she’s “extremely excited” at the prospect of the Dec. 29 premiere in the ornate theater of Vienna’s Baumgarten palace. “I can’t wait until everything will come together,” she says. “I dream about how it’s going to look like on the stage.” Zubin Mehta, the patron of “Cinderella,” is only one of today’s conducting greats awed by her talent. Simon Rattle says he is “absolutely bowled over” by her and Daniel Barenboim has used similar terms. Violin virtuoso Anne-Sophie Mutter describes Alma’s performing and composing talents as “absolutely extraordinary.” Her father, Guy Deutscher, remembers her “singing almost before she started speaking” — and one day, coming home from a toddlers’ party singing a nursery rhyme in perfect pitch. Drives to the supermarket turned into tests of will, he said. Alma, normally “an extremely good-natured girl,” started screaming if her parents tried to get out of the car while music she loved was still playing. Deutscher describes parenting Alma as a challenge with huge rewards. “Waking up in the morning and your daughter coming and saying, ‘I have the most amazing melody, please come and listen’ … it’s an amazing feeling.” Alma recalls falling in love with music sometime after age 2. It was a Strauss lullaby, she says, and she was dumbfounded. “After it finished, I asked my parents, ‘how can music be so beautiful?’ Then I started having ideas of my own. I’d just sit down at the piano. I didn’t write my ideas down, I just had them in my head, and I played them. I was 4.” The music comes unbidden, says Alma. “If I try to sit down and think, ‘now I must get inspiration,’ then I just don’t get inspiration, it doesn’t come to me,” she explained. “But when I am not thinking about it at all, when I’m just relaxing, skipping in the garden and just about to fall asleep or just about to wake up — or when I’m actually in a dream — then I get the beautiful inspiration that I put together.” Future plans include a piano concerto and a symphony. She has started a book which she wants made into a film, complete with her own score. Alma says it features ghosts riding “night mares” and poisoning dreams by breathing toxic fumes. At the same time, she says she hasn’t read any of the Harry Potter books because “they’re too scary for me.” For now, the main focus is on “Cinderella,” delightful not only because of lovely melodies that sometimes draw on Mozart and other classical composers but also because of a charming twist to the familiar story. Alma’s heroine is a composer, “a bit like me.” The step-mother is an opera director, the two step-sisters are haughty divas. And the prince is a poet who finds Cinderella through a melody she wrote. “The prince is haunted by it,” Alma exclaimed, eyes shining in excitement. “He finally has the brainwave to search everywhere in the kingdom, and he will sing the beginning of the melody and only the girl who can continue it will be the one that he’s looking for.” She freely acknowledges that she stole the most beautiful aria from someone else but says “Antonin Yellowsink” doesn’t really mind. “He’s my imaginary composer,” Alma says with a giggle. “I often dream about him.” Summary:","completion":"Eleven-year-old composer, virtuoso pianist and concert violinist Alma Deutscher will see her first full opera, \\"Cinderella,\\" premiere next month in Vienna. Already hailed as the \\"little Mozart,\\" Deutscher exhibits impressive talent, with some of today's great conductors, including Zubin Mehta, Simon Rattle and Daniel Barenboim praising her as \\"absolutely extraordinary.\\" Although she has big aspirations for the future, creating a piano concerto, a symphony, and composing her own score for a film adaption of her own book, for now, the music prodigy is focused on the premiere of \\"Cinderella\\" and enjoying life as a normal 11-year-old."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the profession of the man that shoots at Ryker and Jesse? , can you please find it?

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the song written by the when the artist who lived in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania when she was 12 years old? from the following article ? Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania. Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), was a homemaker who had worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter James Taylor. She has a younger brother named Austin, who is an actor. Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients. She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by Franciscan nuns, before transferring to The Wyndcroft School. The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.At the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \\"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\\". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since \\"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do.

Compost is nothing more than decomposed organic matter. The average compost pile contains a plethora of beneficial nutrients, including potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Choose your answer from: (1). Regarding nitrogen, the bacteria in compost break matter down into ammonium, which is then naturally converted by other bacteria into nitrates that plants can absorb through their roots. Compost high in nitrogen materials, including moist greens, fruits, and vegetables, tends to provide the highest content of nitrogen to the soil bed it is applied to. (2). Manure with sufficient nitrogen is your best bet for nitrogen fertilizer. If a pile of loosely composted compost contains hundreds or thousands of plants, you should avoid using compost as it is the top fertilizer for the garden. (3). Aim to repot manure every 4-6 months. For cloche, your compost pile should be as much compost as you intend to root your plant. (4). You can mix it up and feed it to your plants through the cuttings that are grown inside. Keep in mind that you can plant a pile of compost in a drier area that isn't the same temperature as your surrounding environment.","completion":"(1).

Compost high in nitrogen materials, including moist greens, fruits, and vegetables, tends to provide the highest content of nitrogen to the soil bed it is applied to. Explanation: The correct answer is option 1 because it explains the process of how nitrogen is released from compost. The bacteria help break down the matter into ammonium before converting it into nitrates, which plants can absorb through their roots. The other options do not provide accurate or clear explanations about how nitrogen fertilizer is made from compost. Option 2: This option is wrong because it talks about manure and does not clearly explain how nitrogen is produced in compost. Option 3: This option is incorrect because it talks about repotting manure and seems to be focused on container gardening rather than composting as a source of nitrogen fertilizer. Option 4: This option is confusing and unclear. It is wrong because it discusses planting compost in different temperature conditions but does not explain how this relates to making nitrogen fertilizer."},{"prompt":"Read the article and select the best answer.

How is \\"Do you think that this is possible?\\" said in German?","completion":"In German, the phrase \\"Do you think that this is possible?\\" can be translated to \\"Denkst du, dass das möglich ist?\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Do you think\\" – In German, this part of the phrase can be translated to \\"Denkst du.\\" \\"Denkst\\" is the second person singular informal conjugation of the verb \\"denken\\", which means \\"to think\\", and \\"du\\" is the informal second person pronoun, which means \\"you.\\" Note that \\"du\\" is used in informal situations, whereas \\"Sie\\" is the formal way to say \\"you.\\" 2. \\"that\\" – The word \\"that\\" can be translated to \\"dass\\" in German. \\"Dass\\" is a conjunction used in the same way we use \\"that\\" in English, to introduce a subordinate clause. Note that this is different from the word \\"das,\\" which is a definite article or a demonstrative pronoun. 3. \\"this\\" – The word for \\"this\\" in the context of the sentence is \\"das.\\" \\"Das\\" is a demonstrative pronoun that can also be translated as \\"that\\" in some cases, but in this context, it means \\"this.\\" Make sure not to confuse \\"das\\" (demonstrative pronoun) with \\"dass\\" (conjunction). 4. \\"is\\" – The verb \\"is\\" can be translated to \\"ist\\" in German. \\"Ist\\" is the third person singular conjugation of the verb \\"sein\\", which means \\"to be.\\" 5. \\"possible?\\" – The word \\"possible\\" can be translated to \\"möglich\\" in German. \\"Möglich\\" is an adjective which means \\"possible\\" or \\"feasible\\" and agrees in gender, case, and number with the noun it modifies. In this case, it matches with the neutral demonstrative pronoun \\"das.\\" So, putting all these translations together, you get \\"Denkst du, dass das möglich ist?\\" as the German translation of \\"Do you think that this is possible?\\" However, if you're addressing someone formally, you would use \\"Denken Sie, dass das möglich ist?\\" instead, where \\"Sie\\" is the formal second person pronoun."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Health For All is a programming goal of the World Health Organization (WHO), which envisions securing the health and well being of people around the world that has been popularized since the 1970s. It is the basis for the World Health Organization's primary health care strategy to promote health, human dignity, and enhanced quality of life. Can we infer the following? Health For All is all about health","completion":"Yes, Health For All is fundamentally about health, but it encompasses a much broader and comprehensive perspective on health and well-being than merely addressing specific diseases or medical issues. The ambition of Health For All is to create an equitable, comprehensive, and sustainable health care system for everyone, regardless of their socio-economic background, while also addressing the social determinants of health. Therefore, the concept of Health For All goes beyond just individual health problems and encompasses multiple dimensions of health at the global, national, and local levels. To thoroughly understand the scope of Health For All, it is essential to consider the following key aspects: 1. Equity in healthcare: Health For All aims to achieve equitable access to healthcare services for everyone, regardless of their socio-economic status, geographic location, or any other barriers that might exist. Under this goal, healthcare should be a fundamental human right, and everyone should have the opportunity to achieve the highest possible level of health and well-being. 2. Primary healthcare approach: One of the main pillars of Health For All is the primary healthcare approach, which emphasizes the importance of prevention, public health, and health promotion as the foundation of a robust healthcare system. This approach entails focusing on the community's health needs and addressing them through comprehensive and localized healthcare strategies. This would include interventions around nutrition, sanitation, maternal and child care, essential preventive and curative services, and many other components. 3. Intersectoral collaboration: Health For All acknowledges that achieving global health goals requires a multi-sectoral approach that brings together diverse stakeholders such as government, non-profit organizations, private sector bodies, and communities. A strong collaboration between these stakeholders ensures that health policies and interventions are aligned, efficient, and effective in addressing various social determinants of health, such as education, housing, food security, and environmental conditions. 4. Community participation: Health For All values the role of communities in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of healthcare services and interventions. This participatory approach ensures that the unique needs of different populations are addressed, empowers communities to contribute to their health and well-being, and strengthens local health systems. 5. Sustainable development: The concept of Health For All is closely related to the goal of sustainable development, which includes health as one of its key dimensions. A sustainable approach to health requires considering the long-term impact of health policies and practices on societies, economies, and the environment, and adopting measures that ensure the well-being of present and future generations. 6. Holistic view of health: Health For All endorses a holistic view of health, which includes not only the absence of disease but also a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. This perspective recognizes that health is influenced by a range of factors, and addressing these in an integrated manner is vital for the overall well-being of individuals and communities. In conclusion, Health For All is indeed about health, but it is essential to recognize that it is a comprehensive and multi-faceted concept that encompasses more than just the mere absence of disease or infirmity. It emphasizes the importance of equitable access to healthcare, primary healthcare, intersectoral collaboration, community participation, sustainable development, and a holistic approach to health in realizing the goal of securing the health and well-being of all people around the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One of the best places to eat in the UNLV area goes by the name of Yayo Taco. It is walking distance from the student union and everything they have to offer is affordable in terms of a college student's budget. The venue is a pretty chill place. It definitely has that hole in the wall feel and there's no mistaking that this is a locals joint because it has that family feel to it when you're just hanging out. Yayo holds frequent events and they have local bands come out to play in the venue and they're always a blast but the best thing about this place is that they cater to the students. Yayo is best known for having a student deal available not only to the students of UNLV, but to the students of CSN as well. This deal includes your choice of 2 sides, 4 tacos classicos, and a drink.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? David Monroe Shoup (30 December 1904 - 13 January 1983) was a decorated general of the United States Marine Corps who was awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II, became the 22nd Commandant of the Marine Corps, and, after retiring, became one of the most prominent critics of the Vietnam War. Born in Indiana to an impoverished family, Shoup joined the military for financial reasons. Rising through the ranks in the interwar era, he was twice deployed to China during the Chinese Civil War. He served in Iceland at the beginning of U.S. involvement in World War II, and as a staff officer during the Pacific War. David Monroe Shoup was born on 30 December 1904 in Battle Ground, Indiana. His family lived on a farm in Ash Grove, but moved to Covington to live on a new farm in 1916. At age 12 he was enrolled in Covington High School, a competitive high school with an advanced curriculum. Shoup was an excellent student, maintaining high marks in French, English, physics, and history. Additionally, he was involved in several extracurricular activities, including basketball, and was class president in his senior year. He graduated in 1921. He later affectionately referred to his impoverished upbringing as that of an \\"Indiana plowboy.\\" Regarded by friends as very sociable, he met Zola De Haven in his freshman year and later said he had been instantly attracted to her. They were both very competitive in academics and athletics, and the two dated throughout high school; they were married in 1931. After high school, Shoup attended DePauw University where he was one of 100 awarded the Edward Rector Scholarship, giving him full tuition. Majoring in mathematics, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity and maintained high marks, narrowly failing the selection criteria for Phi Beta Kappa Society. He was on the track and field and rifle teams, and also competed in the wrestling and football teams. He won the Indiana and Kentucky Amateur Athletic Union marathon in 1925. He waited tables, washed dishes and worked in a cement factory to help pay his expenses. Lack of funds compelled him to take a year off after his junior year to teach school, and his expenses were further strained when he contracted a severe case of pneumonia and incurred hospital bills. He opted to enroll in the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) to offset his living expenses, and later recalled that this was the only reason he joined the military. He graduated from DePauw in 1926. From an early age, Shoup was molded by the progressive ideas of Indiana politicians, sympathizing with rural progressives fighting against the interests of big businesses. He developed an anti-imperialist attitude, and his skepticism about American foreign policy, influenced by his small-town background, made him an outspoken opponent of the unnecessary use of military force. He felt the use of troops for economic or imperialist consideration was wrong, a viewpoint he would carry for his entire career.","completion":"This text is about David Monroe Shoup, a decorated general of the United States Marine Corps.

Generally the women coming forward with new stories allege that Ghomeshi asked them on dates and, without their consent, attacked them, usually by grabbing them around the throat, squeezing the throat and striking them on the face. Meanwhile, other women who allege they were attacked by Ghomeshi continue to come forward. The Star has now heard of incidents dating back to his time as member of the band Moxy Früvous, and more allegations from his time as host of Play on CBC television and from his time as host of Q . Ghomeshi — whose whereabouts are unknown — has not yet been interviewed, police said Saturday. Police are also investigating videos Ghomeshi showed his CBC bosses Oct. 23 containing “graphic evidence that Jian had caused physical injury to a woman.” A third woman is now being interviewed by the Toronto police sex-crimes unit as the criminal investigation into allegations of physical and sexual assault against fired CBC star Jian Ghomeshi expands. Trailer Park Boys actress Lucy DeCoutere is one of the women being interviewed by police. She alleged in an interview with the Star that in 2003 Ghomeshi choked her to the point she could not breathe and then slapped her hard three times on the side of her head without her consent. Over the past week the Toronto Star and other media outlets have published accounts by nine women alleging Ghomeshi violently abused and harassed them. Ghomeshi will, “at some point,” be asked to come in and discuss the allegations, the head of the sex-crimes unit, Insp. Joanna Beaven-Desjardins, said in a news conference Saturday morning. Ghomeshi was fired by the CBC last Sunday, three days after CBC saw the “graphic evidence” for the first time, according to an internal staff memo sent out Friday by Heather Conway, executive vice-president of English services. Conway indicated in the memo that the videos he provided showed “graphic evidence that Jian had caused physical injury to a woman.” Sources have told the Star Ghomeshi presented graphic videos and photos of himself and a woman to his bosses, in an attempt to show “how bruising could happen and it could still be consensual.” Ghomeshi believed the videos “were exculpatory of his conduct,” sources told the Star. After learning about the videos from media reports, Beaven-Desjardins said police will be speaking to individuals at the CBC about both the videos and any knowledge they might have of the allegations against Ghomeshi. CBC has “reached out to police and will fully cooperate with their investigation,” CBC spokesperson Chuck Thompson said Saturday afternoon. Thompson would not respond to questions about whether CBC is in possession of the videos. On Friday he told the Star he couldn’t comment for legal reasons when asked if the CBC had considered going to police after the meeting. Earlier this week, the CBC said an independent investigation into allegations against Ghomeshi within the CBC and on improving workplace safety systems will be conducted. The announcement came after one of the nine women, a CBC employee at the time, told the Star in an interview that Ghomeshi sexually harassed her in the workplace. And in a meeting to discuss her complaints with Q’s executive producer, she said she was asked “what (she) could do to make this a less toxic work environment.” In a Facebook post on Thursday, Ghomeshi said that while he does not plan to address any allegations against him in the media, he does intend to meet them “directly.” Ghomeshi wrote in a previous post that, while he has engaged in “adventurous forms of sex that included role-play, dominance and submission,” it has always been consensual. He reiterated, in a 55-million defamation and breach of trust lawsuit against CBC, that all his sexual interactions have been consensual. A formal police investigation was launched Friday, a day after Chief Bill Blair made a public statement asking complainants to contact the police so an investigation could be opened. But Beaven-Desjardins said that as soon as the media reports came out, she assigned officers to review all coverage so they could be prepared when a formal investigation commenced. She also contacted media outlets to pass police and Victim Services contact information on to their sources. The police are now asking anyone with photos, videos and social media chats related to the investigation to contact the sex-crimes unit. Beaven-Desjardins encouraged other alleged victims to come forward and assured them that their accounts would be taken seriously. ||||| Disgraced radio host Jian Ghomeshi’s agent, publisher and former bandmates are the latest people to distance themselves from him. In a brief statement on Friday, the Toronto-based company The Agency, which describes itself as “the world's leading live music booking agency,” announced that “they are no longer the agent of representation” for Ghomeshi. The Agency is the latest in a string of people and groups to distance themselves from Jian Ghomeshi. ( JOHN WOODS / THE CANADIAN PRESS ) According to Ghomeshi’s website, he was represented by The Agency’s Jack Ross, who did not return phone and email requests. Late Friday, Penguin Random House Canada said it would not be publishing Ghomeshi’s next book “in light of recent events,” according to a statement from spokeswoman Tracey Turriff, who declined further comment. Members of Ghomeshi’s former band, Moxy Fruvous, who had not played since 2000, said in a Facebook statement that they were “sickened and saddened” by the allegations leveled against Ghomeshi. Article Continued Below “We had no inkling that Jian engaged in this type of behaviour. We abhor the idea of a sexual relationship of any sort being entered into without full consent from both parties and condemn violence against women in any form. We wish only health and healing to everyone involved,” said Mike Ford, Murray Foster and David Matheson. Musician Lights, who was managed by Ghomeshi announced on her Facebook page that, though she had earlier defended him, she had now parted ways with Ghomeshi. Her statement said “I posted comments about Jian Ghomeshi the day after he was dismissed by the CBC where I rushed to defend my manager of 12 years. I am now aware that my comments appear insensitive to those impacted and for that I am deeply sorry. This is to confirm that as of now I will be parting ways with Jian Ghomeshi as my manager. I hope everyone can heal from this.” Ghomeshi was fired by the CBC on Sunday, and is suing the public broadcaster for 55 million. Nine women have so far alleged in the media that he choked them, pulled their hair, hit them over the head or sexually harassed them. Article Continued Below Ghomeshi has previously said his actions were consensual and that he intends to meet these allegations “directly.” Among the other groups to dump Ghomeshi since nine women made allegations of assault and sexual harassment against him include Navigator, the high-profile crisis management firm, his publicist rock-it Promotions, and two Canadian speakers bureaus. Sources have told the Star that Navigator dropped Ghomeshi because they believed he had lied to them about the extent of his encounters with women. In the meantime, more details are emerging about what Ghomeshi showed, including graphic video, the CBC in the days before he was fired.

It has been more than a year since allegations against the former CBC Radio host first surfaced. Ghomeshi has always denied any wrongdoing and claimed his sexual relations were consensual. Here are some key dates in his case. Oct. 24: CBC says Ghomeshi is taking an undetermined amount of time away from the network \\"to deal with some personal issues.\\" And Ghomeshi tweets: \\"Thanks for all the well wishes, you guys. I'm OK. Just taking some much needed personal time.\\" Oct. 26: CBC announces it has cut ties with the \\"Q\\" radio host after receiving \\"information\\" about him. \\"The CBC is saddened to announce its relationship with Jian Ghomeshi has come to an end. This decision was not made without serious deliberation and careful consideration. Jian has made an immense contribution to the CBC and we wish him well.\\" -CBC statement Oct. 26: Ghomeshi issues a lengthy Facebook post saying he has engaged in rough sex, but says it was always consensual. He says he was fired from CBC because of the risk that his sex life would become public \\"as a result of a campaign of false allegations.\\" “Dear everyone, I am writing today because I want you to be the first to know some news. This has been the hardest time of my life. I am reeling from the loss of my father. I am in deep personal pain and worried about my mom. And now my world has been rocked by so much more. Today, I was fired from the CBC. For almost 8 years I have been the host of a show I co-created on CBC called Q. It has been my pride and joy. My fantastic team on Q are super-talented and have helped build something beautiful. I have always operated on the principle of doing my best to maintain a dignity and a commitment to openness and truth, both on and off the air. I have conducted major interviews, supported Canadian talent, and spoken out loudly in my audio essays about ideas, issues, and my love for this country. All of that is available for anyone to hear or watch. I have known, of course, that not everyone always agrees with my opinions or my style, but I’ve never been anything but honest. I have doggedly defended the CBC and embraced public broadcasting. This is a brand I’ve been honoured to help grow. All this has now changed. Today I was fired from the company where I’ve been working for almost 14 years – stripped from my show, barred from the building and separated from my colleagues. I was given the choice to walk away quietly and to publicly suggest that this was my decision. But I am not going to do that. Because that would be untrue. Because I’ve been fired. And because I’ve done nothing wrong. I’ve been fired from the CBC because of the risk of my private sex life being made public as a result of a campaign of false allegations pursued by a jilted ex girlfriend and a freelance writer. As friends and family of mine, you are owed the truth. I have commenced legal proceedings against the CBC, what’s important to me is that you know what happened and why. Forgive me if what follows may be shocking to some. I have always been interested in a variety of activities in the bedroom but I only participate in sexual practices that are mutually agreed upon, consensual, and exciting for both partners. About two years ago I started seeing a woman in her late 20s. Our relationship was affectionate, casual and passionate. We saw each other on and off over the period of a year and began engaging in adventurous forms of sex that included role-play, dominance and submission. We discussed our interests at length before engaging in rough sex (forms of BDSM). We talked about using safe words and regularly checked in with each other about our comfort levels. She encouraged our role-play and often was the initiator. We joked about our relations being like a mild form of Fifty Shades of Grey or a story from Lynn Coady’s Giller-Prize winning book last year. I don’t wish to get into any more detail because it is truly not anyone’s business what two consenting adults do. I have never discussed my private life before. Sexual preferences are a human right. Despite a strong connection between us it became clear to me that our on-and-off dating was unlikely to grow into a larger relationship and I ended things in the beginning of this year. She was upset by this and sent me messages indicating her disappointment that I would not commit to more, and her anger that I was seeing others. After this, in the early spring there began a campaign of harassment, vengeance and demonization against me that would lead to months of anxiety. It came to light that a woman had begun anonymously reaching out to people that I had dated (via Facebook) to tell them she had been a victim of abusive relations with me. In other words, someone was reframing what had been an ongoing consensual relationship as something nefarious. I learned – through one of my friends who got in contact with this person – that someone had rifled through my phone on one occasion and taken down the names of any woman I had seemed to have been dating in recent years. This person had begun methodically contacting them to try to build a story against me. Increasingly, female friends and ex-girlfriends of mine told me about these attempts to smear me. Someone also began colluding with a freelance writer who was known not to be a fan of mine and, together, they set out to try to find corroborators to build a case to defame me. She found some sympathetic ears by painting herself as a victim and turned this into a campaign. The writer boldly started contacting my friends, acquaintances and even work colleagues – all of whom came to me to tell me this was happening and all of whom recognized it as a trumped up way to attack me and undermine my reputation. Everyone contacted would ask the same question, if I had engaged in non-consensual behavior why was the place to address this the media? The writer tried to peddle the story and, at one point, a major Canadian media publication did due diligence but never printed a story. One assumes they recognized these attempts to recast my sexual behaviour were fabrications. Still, the spectre of mud being flung onto the Internet where online outrage can demonize someone before facts can refute false allegations has been what I’ve had to live with. And this leads us to today and this moment. I’ve lived with the threat that this stuff would be thrown out there to defame me. And I would sue. But it would do the reputational damage to me it was intended to do (the ex has even tried to contact me to say that she now wishes to refute any of these categorically untrue allegations). But with me bringing it to light, in the coming days you will prospectively hear about how I engage in all kinds of unsavoury aggressive acts in the bedroom. And the implication may be made that this happens non-consensually. And that will be a lie. But it will be salacious gossip in a world driven by a hunger for “scandal”. And there will be those who choose to believe it and to hate me or to laugh at me. And there will be an attempt to pile on. And there will be the claim that there are a few women involved (those who colluded with my ex) in an attempt to show a “pattern of behaviour”. And it will be based in lies but damage will be done. But I am telling you this story in the hopes that the truth will, finally, conquer all. I have been open with the CBC about this since these categorically untrue allegations ramped up. I have never believed it was anyone’s business what I do in my private affairs but I wanted my bosses to be aware that this attempt to smear me was out there. CBC has been part of the team of friends and lawyers assembled to deal with this for months. On Thursday I voluntarily showed evidence that everything I have done has been consensual. I did this in good faith and because I know, as I have always known, that I have nothing to hide. This when the CBC decided to fire me. CBC execs confirmed that the information provided showed that there was consent. In fact, they later said to me and my team that there is no question in their minds that there has always been consent. They said they’re not concerned about the legal side. But then they said that this type of sexual behavior was unbecoming of a prominent host on the CBC. They said that I was being dismissed for “the risk of the perception that may come from a story that could come out.” To recap, I am being fired in my prime from the show I love and built and threw myself into for years because of what I do in my private life. Let me be the first to say that my tastes in the bedroom may not be palatable to some folks. They may be strange, enticing, weird, normal, or outright offensive to others. We all have our secret life. But that is my private life. That is my personal life. And no one, and certainly no employer, should have dominion over what people do consensually in their private life. And so, with no formal allegations, no formal complaints, no complaints, not one, to the HR department at the CBC (they told us they’d done a thorough check and were satisfied), and no charges, I have lost my job based on a campaign of vengeance. Two weeks after the death of my beautiful father I have been fired from the CBC because of what I do in my private life. I have loved the CBC. The Q team are the best group of people in the land. My colleagues and producers and on-air talent at the CBC are unparalleled in being some of the best in the business. I have always tried to be a good soldier and do a good job for my country. I am still in shock. But I am telling this story to you so the truth is heard. And to bring an end to the nightmare.\\" -Jian Ghomeshi Facebook post Oct. 27: The Toronto Star publishes a report detailing allegations from three women who say Ghomeshi was physically violent to them without their consent during sexual encounters or in the run-up to such encounters.

Since Robinson's father was in the Navy, the family moved many times. After his father retired from the Navy, the family settled in Woodbridge, Virginia, where Robinson excelled in school and in most sports, except basketball. He was 5 feet, 9 inches tall in junior high school; he tried his hand at basketball, but soon quit. Robinson announced he would retire from basketball after the 2002-03 season. On June 15, 2003, in the finale of Robinson's career, the Spurs won another NBA title with an 88-77 victory over the New Jersey Nets in Game 6 of the 2003 NBA Finals. Turning back the clock, Robinson scored 13 points and grabbed 17 rebounds in his final game for the Spurs. He and the year's regular season and NBA Finals MVP Tim Duncan shared Sports Illustrated magazine's 2003 Sportsmen of the Year award. Robinson averaged 21.1 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, 3 blocks per game, and 2.5 assists per game over 987 games in his NBA career. Also, he is one of only a very small group of players to have scored over 20,000 career points in the NBA, as well as being one of only four players to have recorded a quadruple-double (with 34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 blocks against the Detroit Pistons on February 17, 1994).

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What is something that you eat that has a heel? Possible A: foot, sandal, loaf of bread, shoe, boot Why is \\"loaf of bread\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Loaf of bread\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it relates to the most appropriate context of the question. When taking into account what items are typically consumed by humans, it is evident that \\"foot,\\" \\"sandal,\\" \\"shoe,\\" and \\"boot\\" are not regular choices of edible items. On the contrary, a loaf of bread is a common food item that is consumed by humans as a staple in many diets across various cultures. The term \\"heel\\" in the context of the question refers to the end slice of a loaf of bread. The heel is typically crustier than the other slices and could be seen as less desirable to some individuals due to its texture. However, it is still an edible part of the loaf, meeting the criteria of \\"something that you eat.\\" Consequently, a loaf of bread aligns with human common sense in the perspective of consumable products. To better understand the relevance of each possible answer, let's delve into why the other options are not in line with human common sense: 1. Foot: A human foot is a body part and not a food-related item. While some animals may have edible feet (like chicken), it is not commonly eaten as a regular food item by humans. 2. Sandal: Sandals are a type of footwear designed for human use. They are made of materials such as leather, rubber, or fabric that are not edible, making them an unsuitable answer to the question. 3. Shoe: Similar to sandals, shoes are also a type of footwear designed to protect and comfort human feet during various activities. They are made of non-edible materials and not considered a food item. 4. Boot: Another form of footwear, boots are made from inedible materials such as leather, rubber, or synthetic fabrics. They're designed to protect and support feet during different types of activities like hiking or work, but they're not meant to be eaten. In conclusion, \\"loaf of bread\\" stands as an answer that aligns with human common sense given its appropriateness to the context of the question. The question revolves around the consumption of something with a heel, and thus, the loaf of bread's heel serves as a fitting representation of an edible item with this attribute. The remaining options involve non-food items or body parts, which do not qualify as common-sense responses in terms of items meant for human consumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

UPDATE 4-Turkish PM makes last-ditch call for unity as govt deadline looms * Davutoglu urges parties to unite before Sunday deadline * Calls for agreement on a working government * Erdogan could call for power-sharing government * Lira hits record low of 3 to the dollar ANKARA, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu made a last-ditch call for Turkey's political parties to agree a working government on Thursday, three days before a deadline that would otherwise see President Tayyip Erdogan call a snap election. Davutoglu formally gave up efforts to find a junior coalition partner for his ruling AK Party on Tuesday, more than two months after it lost its overall majority for the first time since coming to power in 2002. Turkey's politicians have until Aug. 23 to agree a working government or else Erdogan could call for an interim, power-sharing cabinet to lead the country to a new election, which would be expected to be held in November. That would prolong uncertainty which has sent the lira to a series of record lows. Investors have already been unnerved by rising violence in the mostly Kurdish southeast and by Turkey's growing role in the conflict in neighbouring Syria. In overnight trade, the currency briefly weakened below the psychological barrier of 3 to the dollar for the first time . It spent much of the trading day down more than 1 percent before recovering losses. \\"I am ready to sit down and talk any time, as long as we find a solution in parliament. The possibility of a coalition is no longer available so instead of blaming each other, let's form a government,\\" Davutoglu told a news conference in Ankara. \\"If that first option fails, and the president calls for a snap election, I urge all political parties to take part in this election government in line with the spirit of ... the constitution,\\" he said. An interim \\"election government\\" would see power shared between four political parties with deep ideological divides, a scenario likely to lead to stagnation in policy making. Forming such a cabinet is in any case uncertain as two parties, the secularist CHP and the nationalist MHP, have said they would not take part. Parliament could theoretically vote to back Davutoglu's current caretaker cabinet staying in office for now, but opposition parties have little incentive to do so and either way an early election is all but inevitable. In a note to political parties, the election commission proposed that any new election should be held on Nov. 1, AKP officials said. \\"Parties put forward their own views on the proposed date and after that an agreement will be sought. Nov. 1 and Nov. 22 are suitable for us,\\" one senior AKP official told Reuters. The prospect of another election has failed to assuage market worries about the 870 billion economy, not least because there is no guarantee that a re-run will produce anything other than another inconclusive outcome. \\"A coalition would have been good for investor confidence, but now we have more uncertainty and I don't think the result will change with new elections,\\" said Vedat Mizrahi, a managing director at financial services firm Unlu & Co. \\"It is really tough right now. There is almost no foreign institutional investor interest in Turkey.\\" The lira is now down over 20 percent against the dollar this year, making it one of the worst performing currencies among its emerging market peers. \\"We're getting poorer by the day,\\" said elementary school teacher Nevin, 44, shopping for groceries at a supermarket in central Ankara. \\"Now they're going to knock on our doors and ask for our votes? How dare they? Shameless politicians.\\" Erdogan, who founded the Islamist-rooted AKP, could still in theory ask the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) to try to form a government. But the CHP has shown little sign of being able to assemble a majority, and Erdogan told a meeting of village administrators on Wednesday that he would not \\"waste time\\" with those who did not know the address of the presidential palace, an apparent reference to the head of the CHP. The crisis has coincided with rising insecurity, as Turkey's military jets pound Kurdish militant positions in southeastern Turkey and northern Iraq in response to attacks on the security forces, and as it opens its air bases for U.S.-led coalition air strikes on Islamic State insurgents in Syria. Investors looking to the central bank for an independent steadying hand have, so far, been disappointed. The bank declined to raise interest rates at its monthly policy meeting on Tuesday, in what investors saw as acquiescence to political pressure from Erdogan. \\"The (central bank) is in 'rabbit in the headlights' mode again,\\" said Tim Ash, credit strategist at Nomura. \\"You have central bank independence for a reason - Turkey does not have enough of it these days.\\" Some investors are starting to think, however, that the lira's persistent slide could force an emergency rate hike. \\"In the end they will have to hike even more aggressively to stop the bleeding in the lira,\\" said Unlu's Mizrahi.

This conclusion, from a new study of nearly 4,000 children, will be presented Friday at the Endocrine Society's 98th annual meeting in Boston. In the U.S., 17 percent of children and teens are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, health care providers do not know when obese children develop an abnormal pattern of weight gain, said lead investigator Allison Smego, MD, a pediatric endocrinology fellow at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. \\"Our study shows that growth patterns in children who become severely obese by 6 years of age differ from normal-weight children as young as 4 to 6 months of age,\\" Smego said. The researchers found that a high BMI, measured between 6 and 18 months of age, accurately predicted which infants were prone to early-childhood obesity. Children age 2 years or older are considered overweight if they have a BMI at or above the 85th percentile for their age and sex on standard growth charts, and are obese if their BMI is at the 95th percentile or higher. Although not typically done, infants' BMI can be tracked on World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts for birth to 24 months. In this study, Smego and colleagues looked at the electronic health records for two groups of patients who had growth data from birth through age 6 years. One group of 480 children was severely obese between ages 2 and 6 years, with a BMI above the 99th percentile on the WHO growth charts, and the other group of 783 kids was lean, with a BMI between the 5th and 75th percentiles during those ages. Looking back at the growth curves over time, the researchers found that BMI diverged between the two groups starting at only 4 months of age. A BMI above the 85th percentile at 6, 12, or 18 months was a strong predictor of severe obesity by the age of 6 years, the investigators reported. Most of the obese children were from low-income, African-American populations in Cincinnati, according to Smego. To validate their findings in a different ethnic and socioeconomic population, the researchers repeated the study in a third group: 2,649 children seen at Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora, Colo., which had a higher Hispanic population. Smego said that a BMI threshold above the 85th percentile increased the chance of severe obesity at age 6 years by threefold to nine-fold in this group. \\"Based on our findings, we recommend that pediatricians routinely measure BMI at infant well-child assessments beginning at 6 months, identify high-risk infants with BMI above the 85th percentile, and focus additional counseling and education regarding healthy lifestyle toward the families of these children,\\" Smego said. \\"It might take the pediatrician a minute to look at BMI, yet it gives them a wealth of knowledge about how their patient is growing.\\" # Endocrinologists are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time, from diabetes and obesity to infertility, bone health, and hormone-related cancers.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? For example, if you do not have a lot of currency, buy a weak kit such as chainmail or gold or leather. If you have more currency, you could buy something more powerful such as iron or even diamond. Not all maps have kits, but if yours does, it is better to go in with a kit than with nothing at all. If you play the map multiple times, you will memorize it and know where the good loot is, like studying for a big exam. As soon as the game starts, decide how you want to get your initial loot. A lot of players will attempt to loot the Cornucopia at the start of the round. Decide if you want to risk the crowd and score some loot, or immediately run off and hide. Don't immediately equip anything good that you find. This will make you a quick target for other players who want what you have. Save your equipment for important fights later. If you decide to head straight for the Cornucopia at the start of the round, grab as much as you can and then immediately run away. The Cornucopia will soon turn into a slaughter, and you probably don't want to be around for that. Most maps have chests scattered around that can provide a lot of helpful items. If you know where these chests are located, make a beeline to them. Not only will this help you get good items, but you can set up an ambush at the chest for other players. Food is essential for staving off hunger, which has a direct effect on your stamina. Try to hoard some food so you can survive while hiding and keep your health up. Although there can be only one survivor, you might last longer if you team up with someone. This can be mutually beneficial and can improve both of your chances at survival. It's much easier to win fights if you're working with someone else. Make sure your teammate does not have more powerful items than you; this way you can kill them and they cannot kill you easily, but give them a little bit so they do not know what you are planning. At some point, you're going to have to turn against your teammate. Make sure to always keep an eye on the other person, in case he or she decides to strike first. Many times, offers to team up will just be traps. Be very wary when invited to join up with someone else. A good time to sadly kill your teammate is before the deathmatch or if they try to kill you. After killing someone, make sure to take most of everything they were carrying. They may have powerful equipment that can help you out, or they may have healing items that can help prolong your life. Above all else, taking your dead opponent's items keeps those items from falling into another player's hands. If you have lots of materials, you can try to craft some better items. These can give you an edge in battle, but crafting can be dangerous. Make sure that you're in the clear before you start crafting, or you might find yourself dead with your menus still open.

If taking a bath in regular tap water isn’t helping reduce the itchy symptoms of your eczema, try adding Epsom salts to the water. You can also try adding Himalayan salt instead of Epsom. Add a generous amount of salt—about 1⁄2 cup (120 mL). Then, take a 30-minute bath. Then dip down in the bath so that your face is underwater. This will allow salt onto your facial eczema. Or, if you dislike the feeling of your face being underwater, try splashing a few generous handfuls of salty bath water on your face. If salt doesn’t help, try adding 10 drops of an essential bath oil like lavender or chamomile. Tea tree oil is a great natural way to reduce symptoms of burning or itching sensations. While tea tree oil won’t treat or remove the eczema itself, it can provide temporary relief from discomfort. You can purchase vials of tea tree oil from most natural foods stores or the organic section in large supermarkets. Tea tree oil is sometimes sold in a spritz bottle, making it easy to apply to a patch of skin. Vitamin E can also provide relief from the uncomfortable symptoms of mild eczema. Visit a natural foods store, and look for vitamin E that contains natural D-alpha tocopherol. Dab a small amount of the oil on your finger, and smear it over the part of your face with eczema. Do not apply synthetic vitamin E oil to your face, as it may contain ingredients which worsen the condition of your eczema.","completion":"To alleviate eczema symptoms, try adding Epsom or Himalayan salts to bathwater, using essential oils like lavender, chamomile or tea tree oil, or applying natural vitamin E oil containing D-alpha tocopherol."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence: \\"Beavers build dams.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"A linguist would find the sentence \\"Beavers build dams.\\" to be acceptable linguistically for several reasons. This sentence adheres to the basic principles of well-formedness in linguistic theory, and it is also an appropriate use of language from a communicative standpoint. From a syntactic perspective, this sentence reflects the necessary structure of a subject, verb, and object (SVO), which is the standard word order for a declarative sentence in English. In this sentence: 1. The subject is 'Beavers' which is a plural noun acting as the agent or the 'doer' of the action. 2. The verb is 'build', which is an action verb describing the activity performed by the subject. 3. The object is 'dams', which is another plural noun and receives the action of the verb, indicating what the beavers build. This sentence is simple, clear, and concise, conforming to the rules of English grammar. Apart from syntactic well-formedness, it also follows the rules of morphology. The plural form of both 'beaver' and 'dam' is correctly marked by the addition of 's', and the verb 'build' is in its base form, which is appropriate for a plural subject. From a semantic viewpoint, this sentence conveys a clear meaning without any ambiguity, providing information about the activity beavers are known for. Each word contributes to the intended meaning of the sentence, and there is no extraneous or contradictory information. Pragmatically speaking, this sentence would be considered acceptable and appropriate for a wide range of communicative contexts. It provides information about the behavior of beavers and how they interact with their environment. This sentence could be part of a text discussing the natural behavior of animals, an explanation of the ecological role of beavers, or simply a statement of fact in casual conversation. In summary, a linguist would likely rate the sentence \\"Beavers build dams.\\" as acceptable linguistically.

Hypothesis: The Japanese WW II rocket powered aircraft name means Sharp Sword.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that the Japanese WW II rocket-powered aircraft name means Sharp Sword from the given context. The Mitsubishi J8M \\"Shūsui\\" derives its name from a poetic term, which translates to \\"Autumn Water.\\" In the context provided, the term \\"Autumn Water\\" is used to signify \\"Sharp Sword.\\" The name was likely chosen because of the swishing sound of a sword, which is reminiscent of the sound made by swiftly cutting through air or water. The context also provides interesting information about the origins of the aircraft, stating that it was closely based on the German Messerschmitt Me 163 \\"Komet.\\" This implies that during the period of World War II, the Japanese may have been inspired by German technology and sought to create a similar aircraft as part of their defense arsenal. The Mitsubishi J8M \\"Shūsui,\\" as a rocket-powered interceptor aircraft, played a crucial role in aerial combat during World War II. Aircraft such as these were designed to rapidly climb and intercept enemy bomber aircraft, with the ultimate goal of shooting them down before they could reach their targets and inflict damage. However, it is essential to note that merely drawing a hypothesis out of the given context does not necessarily mean the hypothesis is confirmed beyond doubt. It highlights a potential conclusion based on the information provided. To make the hypothesis more robust, further research and evidence should be gathered. For example, verifying the translation of the name \\"Shūsui\\" (Autumn Water) to ensure its poetic meaning signifies Sharp Sword. Additionally, exploring primary sources and historical documents that shed light on the development and naming of the Mitsubishi J8M might help establish a concrete argument supporting the hypothesis. Nevertheless, based on the context given, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the Japanese WW II rocket-powered aircraft's name means Sharp Sword."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is also called noise pollution. Where is noise from? Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects. Scientists use a unit of measure called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels. Noise at this high level causes the greatest hearing loss. How do we reduce noise damage?

Background: Sayyid Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini (Persian: syd rwHllh mwswy khmyny [ru:hol'la:he khomei'ni:] ( listen); 24 September 1902 - 3 June 1989), known in the Western world as Ayatollah Khomeini, was an Iranian Shia Muslim religious leader and politician. He was the founder of Iran as an Islamic republic and the leader of its 1979 Iranian Revolution that saw the overthrow of 2500 years of Persian monarchy and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran. Context: In January 1963, the Shah announced the \\"White Revolution\\", a six-point programme of reform calling for land reform, nationalization of the forests, the sale of state-owned enterprises to private interests, electoral changes to enfranchise women and allow non-Muslims to hold office, profit-sharing in industry, and a literacy campaign in the nation's schools. Some of these initiatives were regarded as dangerous, especially by the powerful and privileged Shi'a ulama (religious scholars), and as Westernizing trends by traditionalists (Khomeini viewed them as \\"an attack on Islam\\"). Ayatollah Khomeini summoned a meeting of the other senior marjas of Qom and persuaded them to decree a boycott of the referendum on the White Revolution. On 22 January 1963 Khomeini issued a strongly worded declaration denouncing the Shah and his plans. Two days later the Shah took an armored column to Qom, and delivered a speech harshly attacking the ulama as a class. Khomeini continued his denunciation of the Shah's programmes, issuing a manifesto that bore the signatures of eight other senior Iranian Shia religious scholars. In it he listed the various ways in which the Shah had allegedly violated the constitution, condemned the spread of moral corruption in the country, and accused the Shah of submission to the United States and Israel. He also decreed that the Nowruz celebrations for the Iranian year 1342 (which fell on 21 March 1963) be canceled as a sign of protest against government policies. On the afternoon of 'Ashura (3 June 1963), Khomeini delivered a speech at the Feyziyeh madrasah drawing parallels between the Sunni Muslim caliph Yazid, who is perceived as a 'tyrant' by Shias, and the Shah, denouncing the Shah as a \\"wretched, miserable man,\\" and warning him that if he did not change his ways the day would come when the people would offer up thanks for his departure from the country. On 5 June 1963 (15 of Khordad) at 3:00 am, two days after this public denunciation of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Khomeini was detained in Qom and transferred to Tehran. This sparked three days of major riots throughout Iran and led to the deaths of some 400. That event is now referred to as the Movement of 15 Khordad. Khomeini was kept under house arrest and released in August. Question: What was the other points?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The White Revolution, announced by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in January 1963, was a six-point program aimed at modernizing Iran and addressing socio-economic issues. The main points of the White Revolution included: 1. Land reform: The government aimed to redistribute land, breaking the monopoly and control of a few large landowners. It sought to provide ownership opportunities to small farmers and landless peasants, ensuring them a fair share of agricultural production and improving their living standards. 2. Nationalization of forests: This measure involved transferring the ownership of forests from private hands to the state. The purpose was to ensure proper management, conservation, and development of the forest resources and to establish better practices in the utilization of forest products. 3. Sale of state-owned enterprises: This point of the reform aimed at privatizing some of the state-owned enterprises, allowing for increased private investment, competition, and efficiency within the Iranian economy. 4. Electoral changes: The Shah called for electoral reforms that would enfranchise women and allow non-Muslims to hold office. It aimed to promote inclusiveness in the political system andabolish the gender-based restrictions in voting and civic participation. 5. Profit-sharing in industry: The government proposed introducing a profit-sharing system in industries. Such a system would provide employees with a share of the company's profits, motivating them and leading to greater productivity and economic growth. 6. Literacy campaign: The government aimed to address the problem of illiteracy in Iran by introducing a national literacy campaign targeting the nation's schools. The objective was to improve educational opportunities and literacy rates within the population. Ayatollah Khomeini and other Shia religious scholars were strongly against some of these reforms, viewing them as \\"an attack on Islam\\" and signs of Westernization that threatened traditional values. Khomeini's opposition to the Shah's programs escalated tensions between the Shah and the ulama, culminating in Khomeini's arrest and the ensuing Movement of 15 Khordad."},{"prompt":"Q:Bob was studying about Earth's atmosphere.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. \\"are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , \\" How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived?","completion":"The sentiment of this sentence can be perceived as predominantly negative. The sentence expresses dissatisfaction or criticism towards the unmemorable aspects of the dialogue scenes that the writer is referencing. Specifically, it highlights that even after several attempts of augmenting the dialogue, the desired level of impact has not been achieved. In fact, the use of words and phrases such as \\"unmemorable\\" and \\"despite several attempts\\" conveys the idea that the dialogue scenes have failed to create the intended mental or emotional impression on the audience or readers. This suggests that the writer is unimpressed by the quality or substance of the dialogue scenes, perhaps referencing their lack of captivating information or the poor crafting of the dialogue itself. Moreover, the phrase \\"lengthy dialogue scenes\\" could imply that these scenes might have been expanded or drawn out, possibly leading to tediousness or boredom for the audience or readers. The sentiment, however, does not specify whether it is the length of the dialogue that contributes to its unmemorable nature or if it's just the general quality of the dialogue itself. In conclusion, the sentiment of this sentence would be perceived as negative, with the writer expressing disappointment or critique of the dialogue scenes in question. The unmemorable nature of these scenes and the failed attempts to improve their impact indicate that the writer finds them unengaging and lackluster, which may leave a similar impression on the targeted audience or readers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this \\"The four members of British indie band Viola Beach and their manager have died in a car crash in Sweden.\\"","completion":"Title: Viola Beach: A Tragic End to a Promising Journey Introduction The music world was deeply saddened when news broke that all four members of the rising British indie band, Viola Beach, and their manager had died in a fatal car crash in Sweden. The tragedy occurred during the early hours of Saturday, February 13, 2016, near Stockholm. The band was returning from their first ever international gig, and their future seemed incredibly bright. Fans, fellow musicians, and the indie music scene in both the UK and globally were left heartbroken and in shock. Viola Beach: Their Story Viola Beach, named after the lead vocalist and guitarist's hometown, first emerged on the indie music scene in 2013. Hailing from Warrington, the unsigned band had already gained recognition in their own right, receiving airtime on various radio stations and being championed by BBC Introducing, which showcases up-and-coming music acts. The band consisted of four young and talented musicians: 19-year-old Kris Leonard (guitar and vocals), 20-year-old River Reeves (guitar), 27-year-old Tomas Lowe (bass), and 18-year-old Jack Dakin (drums). Their manager, Craig Tarry (32), was not only a passionate advocate for the band but an integral part of their ascent in the British indie scene. The Accident in Sweden The night of the tragedy, Viola Beach had played at a music festival called \\"Where's the Music?\\" held in Norrköping, Sweden. The event marked their first international show, a major stepping stone for any upcoming band. Excitement and anticipation filled the atmosphere, as the band performed with energy and enthusiasm that captivated the crowd. Little did anyone know that this performance would sadly be their last. As they were driving towards the capital city of Stockholm after the show, a tragic accident unfolded that claimed their lives on Södertäljevägen road. The band's car, a Nissan Qashqai, crashed through a barrier and plunged more than 80 feet off a bridge into a canal. The vehicle was reportedly traveling at high speeds when it collided with the bridge’s beams, killing all its passengers instantly. The exact circumstances surrounding the accident remain unclear. Investigations were conducted by the Swedish police to determine its cause. Initial reports suggested that warning lights and signals were working correctly; however, other subsequent findings implied that there might have been an issue with the signals. The music community continues to mourn the loss of these talented lives. Response from the Music Industry and Fans The tragic news of Viola Beach's accident sent shockwaves through the music industry. Fellow musicians expressed their condolences and shared messages of solidarity on social media. Many high-profile bands and artists, including The Coral, Liam Gallagher from Oasis, and The Kooks, paid tribute to Viola Beach by performing covers of the band's songs with a heartfelt dedication. Fans were also quick to show their love and support for Viola Beach and their families, with tributes and memorials occurring worldwide. Social media was flooded with messages, artwork, and memories of the band. As a way to commemorate and honor their sudden departure, fans quickly began a campaign to get the band's single \\"Swings and Waterslides\\" to the top of the music charts. The single climbed to the top of the iTunes and Spotify charts in the UK, serving as a powerful and emotional reminder of the band's budding potential that was tragically cut short. Legacy and What Could Have Been Viola Beach's journey was one marked by unbridled passion, talent, and dedication. Their music was filled with contagious energy, the kind that leaves a lasting impression on its listeners. In their short career, they managed to captivate not only their loyal fan base but the music industry as a whole. The terrible accident that took the lives of the entire band and their manager still leaves us wondering what could have been. With their talent and potential, they were poised for greatness, and their dreams were just beginning to take root. However, their music and spirit will endure, as will the memories and love shared by fans and their community. As we remember Viola Beach, we are reminded of the courage and vulnerability it takes to chase one's passion in the face of adversity. Their legacy will serve as an inspiration to aspiring musicians and a stark testament to the unpredictable fragility of life. Viola Beach may have left us far too soon, but their music will continue to resound in the hearts and minds of fans for years to come."},{"prompt":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: who dies Jill, Lauren, Stephanie or Brooke Suggested answer: Lauren Fenmore Baldwin (formerly Williams and Grainger) is a fictional character from the CBS soap operas The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful , portrayed by Tracey E.

Process: - Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nose - The oxygen travels into the lungs - The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells) - The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart - All cells receive the oxygen. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is at high altitude happens, how will it affect \\"LESS oxygen being brought to the bodys cells\\". Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation of being at high altitude does have a direct effect on the process of oxygen reaching the body's cells. At higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is lower, which means that there is less oxygen available in the air for the body to take in. This situation can lead to a condition known as hypoxia, where there is insufficient oxygen to meet the body's needs. Here's the detailed impact on the process: 1. Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nose: At high altitudes, the air is thinner and contains less oxygen. When a person breathes in, they will inhale a lower concentration of oxygen as compared to sea level. This reduces the amount of oxygen available for the body. 2. The oxygen travels into the lungs: The lower oxygen levels in the air lead to lower partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs. This creates a smaller driving force for oxygen to diffuse from the alveoli (small air sacs in the lungs) into the bloodstream. 3. The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells): With lower oxygen partial pressure, the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is reduced. As a result, the oxygen-carrying capacity of the erythrocytes is diminished, leading to lower levels of oxygenated blood. 4. The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart: The heart will need to pump faster and harder to deliver the required oxygen to the body's tissues, as the amount of oxygen in each erythrocyte is less than at lower altitudes. This increased demand for oxygen supply might result in a higher heart rate. 5. All cells receive the oxygen: Due to the reduced oxygen-carrying capacity and increased demand, cells in the body may not receive an adequate amount of oxygen. This can limit the cellular function and impair various bodily processes, leading to symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath. To adapt to high altitudes, the body undergoes various physiological changes, such as increased production of erythrocytes and the release of certain hormones that help to improve oxygen transport. However, depending on the degree of altitude and duration of exposure, these adaptations may not be sufficient, and individuals may still experience the effects of hypoxia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
