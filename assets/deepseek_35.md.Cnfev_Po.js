I appreciate your kind words. I'd love to help you out. What ideas do you have in mind for the song, and what direction do you want to take it in? Chris: We want the song to have a smooth, sultry R&B vibe with strong, meaningful lyrics.

We were hoping you could give us advice on the best way to approach this and help us turn our ideas into a polished track. Jay: Alright, I like where you're headed. For a smooth R&B track, you'll want to work on a catchy yet soulful melody. The lyrics should be honest and heartfelt. To start, you both should try writing some lyrics independently, and then we could see what matches up or complement each other's ideas. Chris: That's a cool idea. We'll definitely give that a try. Jay: As for the music production aspect, you'll need a strong beat to carry the song, but it shouldn't steal the spotlight from your voices. I can help with that. We can experiment with different sounds and instruments to find the perfect beat for your song. Dave: That sounds great. We're really excited to see what we can come up with together. Jay: It's important to remember that creating a great R&B song isn't just about the lyrics and the beat – it's also about how you both use your voices. Pay close attention to your vocal dynamics and harmonies. R&B has a lot of smooth transitions and vocal runs, so you'll want to use these techniques to keep the listener engaged. Chris: Thanks for your suggestions, Jay! We really appreciate it. Jay: You're welcome! I'm excited to hear what you guys come up with. If you have any questions or need any guidance along the way, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to help you create an amazing R&B song together! Dave: Thank you, Jay.

Article:","completion":"Title: Independent Review Author Expresses Hope for UK Government Support on Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon Project Introduction: Charles Hendry, author of an independent review into the planned Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon project, says he remains hopeful that the UK government will provide backing for the scheme. The ambitious project is expected to harness tidal energy, serving as a groundbreaking advancement in renewable energy sources in the country. Background on the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon Project: The Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon is a proposed energy project designed to capture tidal energy and generate electricity. The project, which is estimated to cost approximately £1.3bn, involves building a 320-megawatt (MW) tidal lagoon with 16 underwater turbines, around an 11 km sea wall in Swansea Bay. If successful, it would be the world's first tidal lagoon power plant and could potentially provide clean electricity for more than 150,000 homes in the United Kingdom. Independent Review Findings: Charles Hendry was assigned to lead an independent review into the feasibility and potential benefits of the Tidal Lagoon project. The review's findings, which were published in January 2017, concluded that the project would bring \\"significant economic opportunity\\" and provide a long-term energy source. Hendry stated: \\"I believe the project would help provide the energy security that is required over the coming decades, whilst delivering important advantages like reduced carbon emissions and job creation.\\" UK Government Stance: The UK government has not yet reached a decision on whether to financially support the project, but Hendry's expressions of optimism offer some reassurance for proponents of the scheme. The tidal lagoon project, if approved, could set a precedent for future renewable energy projects not only in the UK but around the world. Public Support and Future Implications: The Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon project has garnered widespread public and industry support. Many proponents argue that the project would be a major step towards achieving the UK's goal of reducing carbon emissions and generating a significant portion of its energy from renewable sources. Moreover, the initiative could lead to the development of associated industries, injecting an economic boost into the region and creating high-quality job opportunities for locals. Conclusion: As the author of the independent review, Charles Hendry remains optimistic that the UK government will see the long-term benefits and potential of the groundbreaking Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon project. If supported, the project has the potential to revolutionize renewable energy generation and contribute considerably to the UK's future energy security and economic prosperity. The world eagerly awaits the UK government's decision, as it could potentially pave the way for a new era of renewable energy projects globally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 15-year-old girls were dressed in elegant evening gowns and escorted to the ball held in a Copacabana dancehall by members of the Pacifying Police Unit from their community. These police units have been instrumental in reclaiming slums that were previously ruled by drug-dealing gangs. The community came together to make this event a reality: the girls' hair and makeup were done by volunteers, and their beautiful dresses were loaned by a formal wear shop. Debutante balls, which mark a girl's transition from childhood to adulthood, are a time-honored custom among upper-middle-class and wealthy Brazilian families. However, these young ladies from the favela slum would typically not have the means to celebrate this milestone in such a grand manner. This extraordinary event helped build goodwill between the residents of pacified favelas and the police officers who patrol them. The group debutante ball was a momentous occasion for the teenage girls and their families, as well as the police officers who attended to share in the celebration of these young women's transition into adulthood. Throughout the evening, touching moments were captured in photographs: girls exiting police cars and taking the hand of the officer who patrols their neighborhood, police officers kissing the hands of their charges, and the beautiful debutantes posing with the police for a group picture, among many others. With the generous support of various community members, the debutante ball became a reality for these girls from the Santa Marta favela, proving that the people in this community can come together to make a difference and create unforgettable memories for everyone involved. This inspiring event not only provided a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the young women but also fostered a sense of unity between the community, the girls, and the local police, creating a powerful bond that will last much longer than just one night. The group debutante ball organized by the Pacifying Police Unit is a shining example of how a caring community can transform someone's life and give them a memory to cherish forever."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Congress Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl to resign, prompting new appointment to McCain seat GOP Sen. Jon Kyl was appointed earlier this year to replace late Sen. John McCain. Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) will resign at the end of this year, forcing Republican Gov. Doug Ducey to appoint a new replacement to the late Sen. John McCain's seat ahead of a 2020 special election to fill the last two years of McCain's term. Kyl sent Ducey a letter Wednesday announcing his resignation effective at the end of this month. Story Continued Below \\"When I accepted your appointment, I agreed to complete the work of the 115th Congress and then reevaluate continuing to serve,\\" Kyl wrote. \\"I have concluded that it would be best if I resign so that your new appointee can begin the new term with all other Senators in January 2018 and can serve a full two (potentially four) years.\\" Ducey's office said in a statement that the governor will appoint another replacement in the near future. Prospects include GOP Rep. Martha McSally, who lost a campaign for Arizona's other Senate seat earlier this year; Kirk Adams, Ducey's former chief of staff and a former speaker of the Arizona House; and Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery. \\"Senator Kyl didn't need to return to the Senate. His legacy as one of Arizona's most influential and important political figures was already without question,\\" Ducey said. \\"But he did return and I remain deeply grateful for his willingness to step up and serve again when Arizona needed him.\\" The new appointed senator must be a Republican, according to state law, because McCain won the term as a Republican in 2016. But beyond that, the Arizona GOP is divided over the best choice for the appointment. While McSally brings experience, connections and name identification from her recent statewide campaign, she also became the first Republican to lose a Senate race in the state in three decades when Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema defeated her by 2.4 percentage points. Some Arizona Republicans have questioned the McSally campaign's decision-making and how far behind Ducey she ran as the governor coasted to reelection, casting doubts on whether she would be the best choice for an appointment. Adams, who led the state House and narrowly lost a Republican primary for Congress before joining Ducey's office, has strong connections with the donor community in Arizona. But he has never run a statewide campaign. And Montgomery, who has been Maricopa County attorney since 2010, has no federal or statewide campaign experience. But Montgomery has been elected multiple times in Maricopa County, where he turned aside a well-funded challenger in 2016 even as Republican Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio lost his reelection race. Though Maricopa — Arizona's largest county and home to Phoenix — is a traditional Republican stronghold, Sinema defeated McSally by more than 4 percentage points there, a significant factor in her victory. Dan Eberhart, a Phoenix-based Republican donor, said there is \\"momentum\\" in the donor community for an \\"anybody but McSally\\" appointment to the seat. \\"Donors are quietly whispering in Gov. Ducey's ear that Martha McSally had her chance and came up a little short,\\" Eberhart said. Barrett Marson, a veteran Republican strategist who ran a pro-McSally super PAC during the Senate race, said he expected the choice would come down to Adams or McSally. \\"Each has incredible upsides and each frankly have some downsides,\\" Marson said, pointing to McSally's recent loss and Adams' lack of statewide experience. He said the appointment would likely be decided based on who would have the best chance to hold the seat in the 2020 special election, when Democrats are expected to make a strong challenge, and again in 2022 when the seat is up for a full term. \\"You need to give a person a good head start,\\" Marson said.

Republican donors spent millions of dollars McSally's election effort and likely want to see that investment pay dividends. Ducey and McSally met recently, but it is unclear if there was discussion about a Senate appointment. Other names have been mentioned as well, including Ducey's former chief-of-staff, Kirk Adams, and state Treasurer Eileen Klein. Ducey will have to weigh pressure from power players in the White House and on Capitol Hill against advice by friends, staffers and other voices in Arizona. It is not known if Ducey has discussed his next appointment to the seat with McCain's widow, Cindy McCain. Martha McSally met with Cindy McCain Friday afternoon at her north Phoenix home, according to Republicans familiar with the conversation. In the meeting, McSally apologized for not mentioning the senator’s name during President Donald Trump's signing of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 2019. McSally did not use McCain's name in discussing the act when it was signed in August. Cindy McCain expressed her appreciation for the apology and conveyed the importance of her late husband’s legacy and his service to Arizona, they said. The two women did not speak directly about the Senate appointment, the Republicans said. The meeting lasted about 30 minutes. Follow the reporter on Twitter and Facebook.

Jon Kyl has announced his resignation, effective December 31st. Kyl was appointed earlier this year to replace the late Sen. John McCain. This will force Republican Gov. Doug Ducey to appoint a new replacement to McCain's seat ahead of a 2020 special election to fill the last two years of McCain's term. The new appointed senator must be a Republican, according to state law. Some potential replacements include GOP Rep. Martha McSally, Ducey's former chief of staff Kirk Adams, and Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Help as much as you can. Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Pressure is what results when gas particles rebound off the walls of their container. The basic unit of pressure is the newton per square meter (N/m2). This combined unit is redefined as a pascal (Pa). One pascal is not a very large amount of pressure. A more useful unit of pressure is the bar, which is 100,000 Pa (1 bar = 100,000 Pa). Other common units of pressure are the atmosphere (atm), which was originally defined as the average pressure of Earth’s atmosphere at sea level; and mmHg (millimeters of mercury), which is the pressure generated by a column of mercury 1 mm high. The unit millimeters of mercury is also called a torr, named after the Italian scientist Evangelista Torricelli, who invented the barometer in the mid1600s. A more precise definition of atmosphere, in terms of torr, is that there are exactly 760 torr in 1 atm. A bar equals 1.01325 atm. Given all the relationships between these pressure units, the ability to convert from one pressure unit to another is a useful skill.

The United Kingdom, one of the very few stable nations with a functioning government, is deluged by asylum seekers fleeing the chaos and war which have taken hold around the world. In response, the UK has become a militarized police state as British government forces round up and detain immigrants.

The transit papers require that the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a large sum.

You should answer the question using the information from the passage. Input: passage: Fatty acids are broken down to acetyl-CoA by means of beta oxidation inside the mitochondria, whereas fatty acids are synthesized from acetyl-CoA outside the mitochondria, in the cytosol. The two pathways are distinct, not only in where they occur, but also in the reactions that occur, and the substrates that are used. The two pathways are mutually inhibitory, preventing the acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation from entering the synthetic pathway via the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction. It can also not be converted to pyruvate as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reaction is irreversible. Instead the acetyl-CoA produced by the beta-oxidation of fatty acids condenses with oxaloacetate, to enter the citric acid cycle. During each turn of the cycle, two carbon atoms leave the cycle as CO in the decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thus each turn of the citric acid cycle oxidizes an acetyl-CoA unit while regenerating the oxaloacetate molecule with which the acetyl-CoA had originally combined to form citric acid. The decarboxylation reactions occur before malate is formed in the cycle. Only plants possess the enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into oxaloacetate from which malate can be formed to ultimately be converted to glucose. question: do fatty acid synthesis and degradation occur in the same location of the cell?

Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz. I am facing a new situation today: David wants to categorize animals according to the sound waves they can hear. Eventually, he was able to categorize them in three different groups, group A, group B, and group C. He placed the animals that can only hear ifrasound in group A. Then he placed the animals that are only able to hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do in group B. The last group of animals were able to hear only ultrasound.

Build a movie plot around this: What is the Great Eatlon? giant eagle A:","completion":"Title: The Great Eatlon Genre: Adventure/Fantasy Plot Summary: In the mystical land of Antharas, there exists a legend of an enormous eagle-like creature known as the Great Eatlon. This majestic bird is often said to be humankind's last line of defense against an ancient, malevolent threat called the Dark Nexus. When the Dark Nexus unexpectedly begins to awaken from a centuries-long slumber, it falls upon a disillusioned young man, an aspiring warrior, and an enigmatic wanderer to unravel the mystery of the Great Eatlon, and seek its help in order to save their world. Act I: In the sprawling city of Arandor, a young man named Aiden dreams of excitement and adventure, feeling stifled by the monotony of his everyday life. Working as an apprentice to his father, a blacksmith, Aiden spends his days forging weapons and armor for warriors who, he feels, lead much more interesting lives. One fateful day, a traveling storyteller named Leona arrives in the city. As the sun begins to set, she weaves a tale of the Great Eatlon to a captivated audience in the town square. She explains that the mythical bird was created centuries ago by a legendary sorcerer as a guardian against the Dark Nexus, a powerful and malevolent force that threatened to destroy all life in Antharas. Act II: Gradually, news reaches the city about strange occurrences outside Arandor's walls - colossal, twisted roots emerging from the ground, unexplained disappearances, and frightening shadows that seem to stir with malevolent intent. Sensing that the Dark Nexus has begun to awaken, Leona reveals to Aiden that she is an adept - a warrior who swore an oath to protect Antharas from the Dark Nexus. A legendary Holy Order of Adept Warriors exists, tasked with safeguarding the secret of summoning the Great Eatlon, which has been passed down through generations. With catastrophe looming and time running out, Leona and Aiden venture forth to seek the Holy Order, find the Great Eatlon, and unite a divided world against the impending threat of the Dark Nexus. During their journey, they encounter Mara, a mysterious wanderer with unique abilities and knowledge of Antharas' ancient history. With her guidance, the trio delves into long-lost ruins, encounters mythical creatures, and begins to uncover the intricate tapestry of events that led to the creation of the Great Eatlon. Through each step, they grow closer as a group; Aiden coming to understand that his seemingly mundane life has given him the skills and wisdom necessary to confront the challenges placed before him. Act III: With the Dark Nexus inching closer to full awakening, Aiden, Leona, and Mara manage to locate the Holy Order and learn the secrets of summoning the Great Eatlon. As they unite the people of Antharas to stand together against the looming threat, Aiden suddenly finds himself the reluctant leader of an army. In the climactic final battle, Aiden, empowered by the bond he shares with his friends, manages to summon the majestic Great Eatlon. With the combined might of the Holy Order, the people of Antharas, and the Great Eatlon, the trio secures a hard-fought victory against the Dark Nexus, banishing it to a dormant state once more. In the aftermath, Aiden realizes that the true power of the Great Eatlon lies not simply in the legendary beast itself, but in the unwavering unity and spirit of the people standing together against overwhelming darkness. The tale ends with Aiden, Leona, and Mara together, reflecting on their incredible journey as they watch the Great Eatlon disappear into the sunset, knowing that it will always be present to protect Antharas when the need arises."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.On May 31, 2016, several cities experienced record setting flooding. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the state that saw its only historical decline in population over a twenty-year period ending in 1950?, what is it ?

Summarize: B vitamins may help to reduce the effects of stress, which may include preventing headaches. Try taking a daily B-complex multivitamin to see if this helps to reduce the number and intensity of your barometric pressure headaches. Purchase a small barometer that you can install at home. Pay attention to whether the pressure drops or rises suddenly before you develop a headache. Then in the future, take preventative headache medication at the first sign that the pressure is changing quickly. Check to see if your cell phone has a barometer app. This can alert you if the pressure begins to rise or drop. It's also a good idea to watch the weather predictions for pressure changes. Because dehydration is a common headache trigger and hydration is key in managing a headache, men should drink 15 cups (3,500 ml) of water a day while women should drink 11 cups (2,600 ml). Staying hydrated is especially important if you notice that increased humidity triggers your headaches. Magnesium can help to treat and prevent headaches because it promotes muscle relaxation. If you know the weather will be changing, include magnesium in your diet or take a supplement. Magnesium can block pain receptors in the brain and prevent blood vessels from narrowing in the brain. If you want to supplement, ask your doctor before you begin taking a daily 400 to 500 mg magnesium citrate supplement. To get magnesium from your diet, eat more: Dark leafy greens Fish Soybeans Avocado Bananas If you've noticed that bright light, glare, or sensitivity to fluorescent lights triggers your headache or makes it worse, pay attention to weather changes. For example, if the weather has been overcast and a bright, sunny day is predicted, be prepared to take medication, stay indoors, or wear sunglasses. Extreme changes in weather can also bring changes to humidity, pressure, and temperature which can affect your headaches.","completion":"To reduce the effects of stress and prevent headaches caused by barometric pressure changes, follow these steps: 1.

It also happens to be the first stop in a wildly busy auto show season that includes layovers in Chicago, Geneva, Beijing, New York, Paris, Frankfurt, Los Angeles and, well, back in Detroit once January 2017 rolls around. This year, the sky is the limit when it comes to the variety of new cars and concept vehicles. Chevy is going electric with the production version of the Bolt EV, Chrysler is reinventing the minivan (again), while BMW and Porsche have turbocharged performance monsters at the ready. The 365-horsepower M2 Coupe represents everything we love about BMW. Lithe and lean, this rear-wheel-drive rocket is motivated by a twin-turbocharged, inline-6 cylinder engine coupled to your choice of 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual clutch automatic transmission. FOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS ON FACEBOOK. 'LIKE' US HERE AND BE SURE TO FOLLOW ALL THE ACTION LIVE FROM DETROIT Scion is getting its first SUV. The C-HR has worn both Toyota and Scion badges during previous auto show appearances around the world. But Scion is getting the glory – and the potential sales boon – in the Motor City. Powered by a 4-cylinder and with a choice of front- or all-wheel-drive, the C-HR cashes in on the market surge for smaller, budget-conscious crossovers and SUVs. Minivans aren’t dead; they’ve just been ignored by the brand that invented them. Chrysler is finally revamping the Town & Country minivan, giving this family-friendly conveyance a wide range of gas and hybrid powertrains, along with an all-wheel-drive option for anyone living in snowy climates (like Detroit!). Here’s a name we didn’t think we’d see again. The first Ridgeline was a popular truck-meets-crossover, though the styling always struck us as being…well, weird. Look for the next Ridgeline to feature a boxier body, positioning it closer to outright pickups rather than cutesy crossovers. We’ve been saying it for years; Hyundai needs its own luxury division. That day has finally arrived, courtesy of the large and luxurious G90 sedan. This four-door cruiser is the first of many Genesis-branded cars and SUVs. Will buyers consider this South Korean upstart as a viable alternative to powerhouse brands from Germany, Japan, and the U.S.? Detroit will offer a big hint of things to come. Ford’s midsize sedan is due an update, even if the Aston Martin-like front end still packs plenty of curb-side appeal. Rivals like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry don’t stand still for long, so expect Ford to offer plenty of fuel-sipping engines, along with a plug-in hybrid variant. Most importantly, Ford’s oft-criticized infotainment system should get a massive overhaul to make it simpler to use. Big, bad, and very blue! The Lincoln Continental Concept wowed crowds throughout 2015 and, here in Detroit, we’re seeing the production version in all its glory. A twin-turbo V-6 engine and tons of road presence could mark the Continental as being the car that makes good on the Lincoln brand’s promised renaissance. Mercedes-Benz is leaving no stone unturned when it comes to loading the 2017 E-Class Sedan with power and tech. Autonomous drive functions, diesel engines, highly advanced dashboards and a twin-turbo V-8 are just a few of the highlights coming to this iconic German luxury sedan. The XC90 crossover has earned rave reviews, so now it’s up to the Swedish brand’s S90 sedan to keep the good vibes going. Elegant design, Volvo’s suite of City Safety features, and an optional 316-hp 4-cylinder engine that’s both turbo- and supercharged ensure that Volvo isn’t going away like dearly departed Saab. And thank goodness for that! Power, power, and MORE power. The all-wheel-drive Porsche 911 Turbo is mind-crushingly quick, yet it won’t try to kill you (much) if the weather doesn’t want to cooperate. A top speed in excess of 200 mph is made possible by the twin-turbo, flat-6 cylinder engine mounted at the rear of the car. The sprint from 0 to 60 mph takes only 2.8 seconds. Infiniti is revamping its hottest selling SUV in time for Detroit. The company’s new twin-turbo V-6 is being kept in the Q50 sedan, though the QX60 does benefit from crisper styling, including new head- and tail-lights, along with an upgraded cabin. Like Lincoln and Hyundai’s Genesis, Infiniti is a luxury brand on the move in the Motor City. Lexus is being coy, but we’re certain Toyota’s luxury division has something big planned. Possibly drawing inspiration from the LF-FC Concept shown at the 2015 Tokyo Motor Show, this V-8-powered performance coupe should have around 500-hp and a 10-speed automatic transmission. Buick is a really big deal in China – it’s one of the country’s most popular car brands – so it was only a matter of time before a Chinese-built Buick headed stateside. Built in Shandong province, the Envision is a midsize SUV that blends inoffensive styling with Buick’s penchant for building whisper-quiet cabins. Mercedes has axed the SLK name, replacing it with the SLC you’ll see in Detroit. The base SLC300 comes with a 241-hp 4-cylinder, but we’re pining for the big daddy twin-turbo V-6 in the AMG-tuned SLC43. With 362-hp, this little Mercedes roadster only needs 4.6 seconds for the 0-60 mph sprint. Acura is giving a strong hint as to its future design direction with the Precision Concept. The teaser image looks to be a long sedan, with a low and swept-back greenhouse, along with aggressively flared rear fenders. A slinky four-door coupe, perhaps? Or could it be the rebirth of a Legend? (Please Acura, bring back actual names, especially that one!) Chevy is thinking small when it comes to going green. The electric-powered Bolt will be noticeably smaller and less expensive than the American brand’s current Volt hybrid. Driving range is expected to be around 200 miles a charge, while the Bolt’s price should fall around 30,000.","completion":"The 2016 Detroit Auto Show showcased many exciting new cars and concepts.

When I went to high school, I was an A-student, but not for long. I wanted cool clothes and hung out with friends. I became a C-student, but I didn't care. One night I complained about not having enough Italian shirts. Then my mother gave me all the money and said I could get the money left to buy shirts if I finished buying all the things the family needed. I was pleased with that, but after I bought those things, there was no money left. I got to know how difficult it was for my mother to do all these. I went back to my studies and became an A-student again. Finally, my dream came true and I became a doctor.

The answer is:","completion":"To answer the question, let's consider the main factors that can affect the brightness of two objects: distance and intrinsic brightness. Step 1: Understand the context The question mentions two objects - a star and the sun. The context indicates that the distance from the observers plays an essential role in the perceived brightness of these objects. Step 2: Consider the distance factor The Sun is the star located at the center of our solar system, and its average distance from Earth is approximately 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers. This distance makes the Sun the closest star to us. Meanwhile, other stars are located much farther away. The closest known star to us, Proxima Centauri, lies at a distance of around 4.24 light-years from Earth, which is roughly 268,770 times farther than the Sun. Step 3: Analyze the intrinsic brightness The intrinsic brightness of a star refers to its luminosity or the amount of energy it emits. The Sun, being a medium-sized and average-brightness star, might have higher or lower intrinsic brightness compared to other stars in the universe. Step 4: Draw a conclusion Given that distance is a significant factor in determining the perceived brightness of celestial objects, the dimmer of the two would be \\"a star.\\" This conclusion is based on the vast difference in distance between the Sun and other stars, which makes the Sun appear brighter in our sky even if some stars may have higher intrinsic brightness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Concerned for his safety and that of his family, Mr. Hill has installed security cameras around his property in an attempt to catch the vandals in the act. Local residents have expressed mixed opinions on the matter, with some sympathizing with Mr. Hill and condemning the abusive behavior, while others question whether the incidents are truly motivated by racism or simply the result of general disillusionment with property developers and gentrification. A community meeting has been scheduled to address the issue and promote dialogue between all parties involved.

I never thought I would buy bratz, but she really likes them and if they're not too slutty, I don't see the harm in it. Plus, buying the sporty ones can encourage her to think she's not just a pretty face and can do more with her life than sit and look pretty. A:","completion":"The given review is likely to increase the chances of you buying the product, especially if you are concerned about the appropriateness of the toy for a young child.

It reflects the precious memories and experiences they shared, and the tweet serves as a reminder of the beautiful impact this friend had in their life.

On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused. Patricia handed her a box. \\"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\\" she said, \\"and I know that it is hard to explain things to kids.

He stated the following: \\"We had previously drawn attention to the fact that no other candidate country has ever been offered open-ended negotiations.\\" In this statement, Baykal highlights the differential treatment that Turkey has allegedly received from the European Union in comparison to other countries that have applied for membership in the past. He emphasizes that Turkey has been subjected to a unique process of open-ended negotiations, which means that there were no definitive deadlines or clear expectations regarding the possible outcome of the negotiations. This approach, according to Baykal, has not been applied to any other candidate country in the past, which suggests that Turkey has been treated unfairly. The concerns raised by the CHP leader have been shared by many within Turkey who believe that the EU has not treated Turkey as an equal contender for accession, and instead imposed stricter conditions and requirements on the country. Some of the reasons cited for this differential treatment stem from apprehensions about Turkey's predominantly Muslim population, its potential impact on European integration, and its geopolitical location between Europe and the Middle East. Critics have also mentioned the fact that the negotiations with Turkey have been proceeding at a rather slow pace, with both sides experiencing difficulties in reaching agreement on certain benchmarks and criteria. Despite commencing in 2005, the accession talks between Turkey and the EU have not reached a conclusion, and there have been several occasions when the process was stalled or suspended. Nonetheless, both Turkey and the EU have expressed interest in continuing the negotiations, with the ultimate goal of securing Turkey's accession membership.

The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety.

It uses the Latin script with additional diacritic marks to denote specific sounds. The language is closely related to other Slavic languages such as Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian. In the Czech language, word order is relatively flexible compared to English. While the usual word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), it can be changed to emphasize certain parts of the sentence without losing its overall meaning. Additionally, Czech is a highly inflected language, meaning that words change their form to reflect grammatical information such as tense, case, person, gender, and number. For those interested in learning the Czech language, some useful phrases to start with are: 1. Dobrý den (Good day) - a standard greeting during daytime. 2.

Uther's lust for Cornwall's wife Igrayne (Katrine Boorman) soon ruins the truce, and Merlin agrees to help Uther to seduce Igrayne on the condition that he gives Merlin whatever results from his lust. Merlin transforms Uther into Cornwall's likeness with the Charm of Making. Cornwall's daughter Morgana senses her father's mortal injury during his assault on Uther's camp; and, while Igrayne is fooled by the disguise and Uther impregnates her, Morgana sees through it, watching Uther as Cornwall dies in battle. Nine months later, Merlin takes Uther's son Arthur. Uther pursues but is mortally wounded by Gorlois' knights. Uther thrusts Excalibur into a stone, crying that \\"None shall wield Excalibur, but me!\\", and Merlin proclaims, \\"He who draws the sword from the stone, he shall be king.\\" Years later Sir Ector and his sons, Kay and Arthur (Nigel Terry) attend a jousting tournament. Sir Leondegrance (Patrick Stewart) wins the chance to try pulling Excalibur from the stone, but he fails.

The exact time of the liftoff varies from source to source and is mentioned as 05:30:42 Moscow Time or 07:22 Moscow Time.At peak acceleration Laika's respiration increased to between three and four times the pre-launch rate. The sensors showed her heart rate was 103 beats/min before launch and increased to 240 beats/min during the early acceleration. After reaching orbit, Sputnik 2's nose cone was jettisoned successfully; however the \\"Block A\\" core did not separate as planned, preventing the thermal control system from operating correctly. Some of the thermal insulation tore loose, raising the cabin temperature to 40 °C (104 °F). After three hours of weightlessness, Laika's pulse rate had settled back to 102 beats/min, three times longer than it had taken during earlier ground tests, an indication of the stress she was under. The early telemetry indicated that Laika was agitated but eating her food. After approximately five to seven hours into the flight, no further signs of life were received from the spacecraft.The Soviet scientists had planned to euthanise Laika with a poisoned serving of food. For many years, the Soviet Union gave conflicting statements that she had died either from asphyxia, when the batteries failed, or that she had been euthanised. Many rumours circulated about the exact manner of her death. In 1999, several Russian sources reported that Laika had died when the cabin overheated on the fourth orbit. In October 2002, Dimitri Malashenkov, one of the scientists behind the Sputnik 2 mission, revealed that Laika had died by the fourth circuit of flight from overheating. According to a paper he presented to the World Space Congress in Houston, Texas, \\"It turned out that it was practically impossible to create a reliable temperature control system in such limited time constraints.\\"Over five months later, after 2,570 orbits, Sputnik 2—including Laika's remains—disintegrated during re-entry on 14 April 1958.","completion":"Dimitri Malashenkov submitted a paper explaining how Laika died in the city of Houston, Texas, during the World Space Congress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir.

In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: \\"He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all.

Read this: In the Byzantine Rite of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches, the music performed in the liturgies is exclusively sung without instrumental accompaniment. Bishop Kallistos Ware says, \\"The service is sung, even though there may be no choir... In the Orthodox Church today, as in the early Church, singing is unaccompanied and instrumental music is not found.\\" This a cappella behavior arises from strict interpretation of Psalms 150, which states, Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord. In keeping with this philosophy, early Russian musika which started appearing in the late 17th century, in what was known as khorovïye kontsertï (choral concertos) made a cappella adaptations of Venetian-styled pieces, such as the treatise, Grammatika musikiyskaya (1675), by Nikolai Diletsky. Divine Liturgies and Western Rite masses composed by famous composers such as Peter Tchaikovsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Alexander Arkhangelsky, and Mykola Leontovych are fine examples of this. khorovïye kontsertï were typically done similar to what pieces? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The khorovïye kontsertï, or choral concertos, were typically done similar to the Venetian-style pieces during the late 17th century. This was a period when Russian Orthodox Church music started to adopt elements from Western European music, particularly from the Italian tradition. The Venetian-style pieces often referred to the polychoral style that was prevalent in Venice at that time, popularized by composers such as Giovanni Gabrieli and Claudio Monteverdi. These compositions featured multiple choirs, usually spatially separated, singing in alternation or antiphonally in a kind of dialogue, and often with different vocal combinations, color, and texture. The late 17th-century Russian khorovïye kontsertï made a cappella adaptations of these Venetian-styled pieces, staying true to the Byzantine Rite's tradition of singing without instrumental accompaniment. This adaptation was in part due to the influence of Nikolai Diletsky, who wrote about this style in his treatise Grammatika musikiyskaya (1675). The unaccompanied choral music often featured rich harmonies and polyphonic textures, with a primary focus on the human voice and the beauty it could create within the Eastern Orthodox Church's liturgical context. Examples of the khorovïye kontsertï-style compositions can be found in the works of later composers such as Peter Tchaikovsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Alexander Arkhangelsky, and Mykola Leontovych. These composers blended the traditions of the Byzantine Rite with the creative potential of Western musical styles, thus giving rise to a rich choral tradition marked by its a cappella rendering and intricate vocal lines that managed to convey the beauty and spirituality within the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Church's liturgies."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

That sounds good, but some surfactants, like sulfates, can also be damaging to your hair, as they strip it of its natural oils. When using the Curly Girl method, avoid products with these ingredients. Look for products that are labeled \\"sulfate-free\\" to help you choose the best option for your hair. In addition, read the ingredient list to look for sulfates. Even if a product is labeled \\"sulfate-free,\\" it may still contain sulfate ingredients. That's because the manufacturer is typically referring to more damaging sulfates, such as sodium lauryl sulfate. Go over the ingredient list carefully to find sulfate ingredients before deciding if a product is Curly Girl approved. Common sulfates include alkylbenzene sulfonate, sodium cocoyl sarcosinate, ammonium or sodium xylenesulfonate, and dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate. Look for words or endings like \\"sulfate,\\" \\"sulfoacetate,\\" \\"sulfonate,\\" and \\"sulfouccinate.\\" These products tend to build up on your hair over time because they coat your hair to give it shine.

Answer:","completion":"The Woman's Journal was around for a longer time period as compared to Missbehave magazine. To provide a detailed understanding, let's dive into the history and publication run of both magazines: 1. Woman's Journal: The Woman's Journal was an American women's rights periodical that was first published on January 8, 1870. The magazine was established by Lucy Stone and her husband, Henry Browne Blackwell, both prominent figures in the women's suffrage movement. The publication served as the official organ of the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) and primarily focused on women's rights, with a particular emphasis on women's suffrage. The Woman's Journal was initially a weekly newspaper and later transitioned to a monthly magazine format before merging with another publication, \\"The Woman Citizen,\\" in 1917. After this merger, it continued publication under the new title, \\"The Woman's Journal and Suffrage News\\", until 1931. So, the Woman's Journal, in various forms and titles, had a publication run of over 60 years. 2. Missbehave: Missbehave was a contemporary women's magazine that was launched in 2006 by former \\"Vice\\" magazine editor, Lesley Arfin. It targeted a younger, urban demographic and covered topics such as fashion, culture, music, and lifestyle. The magazine aimed to empower young women by presenting alternative role models and encouraging self-expression. However, Missbehave faced financial challenges and struggled to maintain its footing in an increasingly competitive market. As a result, the magazine ceased publication in 2009, only three years after its inception. In conclusion, the Woman's Journal enjoyed a much longer publication run compared to Missbehave. Starting from 1870 until its discontinuation in 1931, the Woman's Journal had a publication run of over 60 years, whereas Missbehave had a publication run of only three years (2006 to 2009). This demonstrates the substantial difference in longevity between these two magazines, making the Woman's Journal the clear winner in terms of the duration it was around."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"To answer these questions and determine if they are paraphrases, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the scope and context of each question. Step 2: Investigate and determine the answers to each question. Step 3: Compare the context and answers of both questions to determine if they are paraphrases. Step 1: Identify the scope and context of each question. The first question asks for the best budget smartphone by an 'Indian Company'. The context here is specifically about Indian Company smartphones that are budget-friendly. The second question asks for the best non-Chinese budget smartphone. This question's context is broader, as it encompasses all budget smartphones that are not made by a Chinese company. Step 2: Investigate and determine the answers to each question. A) \\"What is the best budget smartphone by an 'Indian Company'?\\" There are several Indian smartphone companies that offer budget options. Based on online reviews and specifications, the Micromax IN 1B could arguably be considered one of the best budget smartphones by an Indian Company. B) \\"What is the best non-Chinese budget smartphone?\\" This question has a broader context, as it is not limited to only Indian companies. Popular options for non-Chinese budget smartphones include brands like Samsung, Nokia, and Motorola. Among them, the Samsung Galaxy A12 could be considered a great budget option. Step 3: Compare the context and answers of both questions to determine if they are paraphrases. The context of both questions is different. While Question 1 is focused on Indian companies, Question 2 is focused on non-Chinese companies (which could include Indian companies but also other countries' companies). Furthermore, the answers to both questions are also different. Thus, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article with the title: \\"House Republicans Elect John Boehner as Speaker\\" Article:","completion":"Title: House Republicans Elect John Boehner as Speaker Introduction In a recent, momentous decision, House Republicans have elected John Boehner as their new Speaker. Boehner, an experienced politician and former House Majority Leader, has proven himself to be a capable leader worthy of taking on this role. This article will delve into the factors that contributed to this decision, as well as what this means for the Republican Party moving forward. Background Before being elected as Speaker, John Boehner had held various leadership positions within the Republican Party over the years. Serving as a congressman from Ohio since 1991, Boehner had risen through the ranks, earning respect and admiration from his colleagues. His tenure included a stint as the House Majority Leader from 2006 to 2007, and as Minority Leader from 2007 to 2011. Boehner's experience and dedication to his party were critical factors in his recent election as Speaker. Reasons for Boehner's Election One of the primary reasons for Boehner's election was his ability to bring people together. Boehner has a strong track record of bridging gaps between the diverse factions within the Republican Party, including Tea Party members and moderate conservatives. Additionally, Boehner's skills in crafting and negotiating legislation were highly valued by his colleagues. Known for his pragmatic approach and focus on results, Boehner has been able to work effectively with legislators from both parties, which has resulted in the passage of several crucial bills despite the often-divisive nature of Congress. Implications for the Republican Party With Boehner now serving as House Speaker, the Republican Party is expected to strengthen its position in Congress. Boehner's leadership style, which emphasizes unity and collaboration, is likely to help develop a more cohesive party platform going forward. Moreover, Boehner's election could signal a shift in the party's strategy regarding its legislative agenda. As a seasoned negotiator, Boehner may be more inclined to forge compromises with Democrats in order to pass significant legislation, rather than adopting a purely obstructionist stance. However, Boehner will still face challenges from within his own party. Some members of the Tea Party faction may not fully support his approach to governance, which may result in internal disputes and potential difficulties in maintaining party unity. Conclusion In conclusion, John Boehner's election as House Speaker marks an important milestone for the Republican Party. His experience, ability to unify different factions, and pragmatic approach to legislation make him an ideal choice for this critical leadership role. As Boehner sets out to lead the Republican-controlled House, it will be intriguing to observe the impacts his leadership will have on both the Republican Party and the American political landscape as a whole."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please answer the following question: WHITE HOUSE/BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said there is a plan to reunite the more than 2,000 children who have been detained apart from their parents. \\"We have a plan to do that,\\" the secretary told reporters at an event in Washington Thursday morning. Shortly before she spoke, a VOA reporter at an immigration court hearing in Brownsville, Texas, said prosecutors dropped misdemeanor charges against 17 migrants. The migrants, who were separated from their children remain detained, but dropping the charges could be a means to reunite them and allow the families to be detained as units. David Bier, an Immigration Policy Analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said if government prosecutors are dropping criminal charges in similar cases across the immigration court system, it calls into question the Trump Administration's 'Zero Tolerance' policy towards immigration. It's \\"an even more clear signal that the whole purpose of bringing these prosecutions is to separate parents from children and not about enforcing the law.\\" he told VOA. The administration's policy requires that anyone who crosses the border illegally face criminal charges. \\"If it continues to be the case that some of these cases or many of them are dismissed by courts – that should be the end of the policy,\\" Bier added. The moves come as the House of Representatives prepares to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations, as well as other issues that have divided the country's major political parties. Nielsen repeated her calls for lawmakers to act. \\"I want to be very clear on this. Congress has the authority and responsibility to make the law of the land and to fix the immigration system,\\" the secretary said. \\"We have done everything we can do in the executive branch.\\" The outcome of the votes is uncertain.

Some supporters felt good about the decision, as they believed that keeping families together was a more humane approach. Others may have felt indifferent or even bad, thinking that the administration was stepping back from its initial stance on tough immigration enforcement. The response among Trump supporters was not uniform, and it is important to note that individual opinions may differ. It is not possible to definitively categorize the collective response of Trump supporters as bad, indifferent, or good, as there was a range of reactions with differing degrees of support for the policy change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Wonder Boys Movie plot: Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university (the movie was shot chiefly in and around Carnegie Mellon). He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal.

News article: 6 Creative iPad Uses For Small Business Retail This post originally appeared on the American Express OPEN Forum, where Mashable regularly contributes articles about leveraging social media and technology in small business. We all know iPads make great presentation devices and are excellent for business travel and chock-full of useful apps. Now, let’s focus on retail businesses — shops, salons and restaurants that use iPads to better service customers. Read on for some creative implementations of the iPad. If you start using an iPad at your business, just be sure to sanitize it frequently — fingers can carry a lot of germs. “The iPad is awesome,” says Flannery Foster, co-owner of Brooklyn’s goodyoga studio. The studio is also a bed and breakfast and serves as home to Flannery and her partner, “so we want it to seem less like a business and more like a community center or a home.” First order of business? Ditching the front counter and bar code scanner you see at a lot of yoga studios and gyms. “When people walk in the door, we hand them the iPad, and they sit on the couch — it’s a lot more casual, and we can bring them tea or water,” Foster says. Instead of standing awkwardly at the counter and filling out waivers and liability forms on a clipboard, the iPad makes people feel comfortable and also makes data entry a breeze for goodyoga. The studio uses a Google form, so the staff doesn’t have to worry about decoding a patron’s chicken scratch and the team saves times since the client info goes into the database automatically. “People have fun with it, and we have a lot of people who’ve never used an iPad before,” says Foster. “Sometimes they’re apprehensive, but most people have a lot of fun using it, and they love being able to sign with their finger when they pay with Square.” Lesson: Impress new customers and get them in your system quickly (for e-mail blasts, etc.) with a sleek iPad setup. TriBeCa nail salon Tenoverten offers iPads at every nail station. Co-owner Nadine Ferber says customers mostly use the iPads for web browsing, so they don’t have to offer any fancy apps. And yes, they still offer the typical glossy magazines for those customers who’ve been staring at a screen all day at work and want something more low-tech. “Customers love the iPads — some people have never used one before and are just thrilled to be able to without making a commitment to buying one,” says Ferber. She says more than half of the people who come in for manicures or pedicures use the iPad during their service, either to look something or check an email. “It’s a great tool for them to multitask while taking a little time out of the day for themselves,” she says. “And it’s one of the most differentiating things about our business as we are the only nail salon in the world that has an iPad at every manicure station.” Lesson: An iPad is a great investment as a differentiator that could keep customers coming back. Butter Lane in New York’s East Village was an early adopter of the iPad craze, affixing one to the wall to encourage people to “like” and follow the shop on Facebook and Twitter. Now the cupcakery has taken to rewarding customers who interact with the iPad, offering a free frosting shot to those who do. Frosting shots sell for 1, so it’s a small price to pay, and co-owner Maria Baugh says the shop gets a lot of engagement with the device, and “it’s definitely increased our number of ‘likes’ and follows — we give away a lot of icing shots!” Baugh says the device also helps them get customers in other ways. “We find that people use it to get more information about our [baking] classes and sometimes register for them,” she says. However, be warned that if you have an iPad, some customers might use it to check their own social media profiles, and you should also make an effort to lock it down. “The first one we put up just after iPads came out was stolen within the first month! We now have heavy duty industrial brackets holding it in place — it would take serious power tools to get this one off the wall,” says Baugh. Lesson: Use an iPad on-site to increase your Facebook and Twitter followings — you can offer a small reward as a thank you. “The iPads allow guests to control the flow and timing of their experience,” says Paul Motenko, co-founder of Stacked. “Guests can order a drink and appetizer and then entrees and desserts, when they are ready — or their whole meal at once to move things along faster.” Stacked also offers customers the option to pay directly via the iPad, so patrons don’t have to wait for the server to bring the bill, and one’s credit card information is encrypted at the table, so the system is secure. Of course, sometimes talking to a person is easier than dealing with a machine, so there are concierges on the floor to help guests when they need it. And all guests are given paper menus so that everyone can read through the menu at their own pace. When they are ready, they order from the custom-developed iPad app and tap “send” and then the order is routed directly to the kitchen. Motenko says customers love using the iPad. Since Stacked offers burgers, pizzas, salads and sausages with myriad available toppings, guests build their meal from the plate up. “The technology just makes it easier to customize what you want, how you want it and how quickly you want it,” he says. Since the iPad is intuitive, Motenko says guests of all ages have found the app to be easy to use and empowering to choose your own ingredients. Lesson: The iPad is a great, non-invasive tool that’s easy to use. You can save money on staff and not have to worry about pacing a meal, since the guests order at their own convenience. Healthy fast-food concept 4food opened last year in New York City, chock full of digital integrations, like a 15′ Twitter feed on one of the walls. The restaurant has six iPads available for customers to order from and browse the web. During peak hours, 4food “hawkers” roam the restaurant with iPads to take orders from customers so they don’t have to wait in line. The iPad integration is working well for the concept, and 4food brand strategist Ashley Tyson says the restaurant hopes to develop an iPad app soon so that customers can order easily and access information about the food and offerings. Lesson: Integrating digital tools into your business can help it run more efficiently, which could help your bottom line. ‘We take all of our orders with an iPod, and the staff runs credit cards with iPads,” says Jordan Langer of 620 Jones, a San Francisco bar. His team was also “very heavily entwined in developing the app” that drives the POS system. “It was a project that POSlab started doing, and then we jumped on board as their first main client. We started going after it with them because we know how a real POS should work,” says Langer. Jones servers go to tables with an iPod to take orders, and then the iPad drives the merchant processing. The iPads are always in the hands of staff and never handed to patrons. “People love it … they absolutely love it,” Langer says. “Inventory’s a lot easier to manage, the development is a lot easier, the interaction with the customers is a lot easier.” Lesson: An iPad can help you organize and stay on top of inventory, in addition to serving as an excellent POS system.

Article: Long ago, Bluebird's feathers were the colour of dust. She did not like her ugly colour. She was attracted by the colour of the lake near her home. It was as blue as the sky after a storm. Bluebird wanted to be the colour of that beautiful lake very much. Flapping her wings one morning, Bluebird flew from her tree to the blue lake. Then she bathed in the water three times. After each bath, she sang, \\"Blue water. Still water. I went in. I am blue.\\" Bluebird repeated this every morning. On the third day, she came out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Now Coyote was a trickster --and hungry too. He stayed behind Bluebird's tree for a long time every day and watched her go to the lake. He pretended to be interested in everything she did. He wanted Bluebird for lunch, but he was afraid of the blue water. On the third morning, Coyote saw Bluebird come out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Impressed, he sat next to Bluebird's tree and waited for her. When she returned, he asked, \\"How did you get blue feathers? I want to be blue like the mountains too.\\" Bluebird didn't believe Coyote, but she taught him how to bathe three times each morning and how to sing her song. Coyote did what she said, and after three days of bathing in the lake, his white fur turned deep blue. Convinced that blue fur was even more beautiful than blue feathers, Coyote forgot all about being hungry. He ran as fast as he could to the top of the hill. Standing on his back legs, he raised his front legs off the ground and howled. But Coyote slipped and rolled down the hill. He couldn't stop himself, and the dust and dirt covered his new blue fur. He rolled and rolled until he hit into Bluebird's tree heavily. No matter how much he tried, foolish Coyote could not shake the dust from his fur.

Continue the following story. Tim went to ride his motorbike down the coast this morning and checked the tire pressure which was low enough to not ride the","completion":"bike safely. Realizing this, Tim decided to tackle the issue before he even attempted to set off for the journey. Having learned his lessons from past experiences, he knew very well the potential risks of motorbiking with low tire pressure. First, he went to his garage to look for his trusty bike pump. It was a bit old and rusty, a relic from his early biking days but surprisingly efficient. Hidden behind a stack of boxed memorabilia and other infrequently used tools, it was like finding a treasure each time. Having dusted off the old pump, Tim approached his bike for a closer inspection of the tires. With an experienced eye, he could see that the rubber on his tires was worn out but still had a few more miles before needing a replacement. Sighing with relief, he knelt down beside his motorcycle and fixed the nozzle of the pump onto the valve of the bike tire. As he began to pump, he could feel his arm muscles work with the rhythm of each pump. The morning sun had started shining brightly illuminating his garage in a golden hue, making the ambiance full of warmth and vivacity. The sound of metal clanging reminded him of the many mornings he had spent tuning up his motorcycle, a beloved hobby that gave him a sense of profundity and satisfaction. After a few minutes of vigorous pumping, the tire began to regain its solid, firm feel. Satisfied with the pressure, Tim removed the pump nozzle from the tire valve. He had a special gauge for checking the tire pressure which he had bought just recently. Fetching it from a drawer filled with an array of bicycle repair tools, he checked the tire pressure. The reading came back as normal, free from any deficiency that could potentially compromise his safety. Casting a final appreciative glance at the bike that had seen him through many adventures, Tim took a few steps back. The bike stood there in all its glory, the newly pumped up tire adding to its proud stance. It was a thing of beauty, a source of joy, and a means of escape all combined into a well-greased, well-oiled machine. Satisfied, Tim wiped his sweaty forehead with the back of his hand and gave a small triumphant smile. Today was the day he would ride down the coast, feel the fresh ocean breeze against his face, and let his cares be drowned out by the purring of his motorbike's engine. He had a quick shower, ate a hearty breakfast, and picked a pair of sunglasses off the stand. As he put on his leather jacket and gloves, a sense of adventure welled up within him. Finally, strapping on his helmet and swinging his leg over his bike, he revved it up, the engine roaring to life. With a final wave to his quiet suburban home, Tim kicked up the stand and pushed down on the accelerator, his motorbike leaping forward, eager to be on the open road. With his tire issue resolved and the prospect of a thrilling ride ahead, he felt an overwhelming sense of anticipation. Today was going to be another memorable chapter in his book of biking adventures. And as he rode down the lane, the wind carrying him forward, he knew that there was no other place he'd rather be than on his motorbike, exploring the unknown coast down the winding lanes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full anglicized name of the person whose later biographer tentatively accepted the epithet of Scotsman coined by John Evelyn? from the following article ? John Michael Wright, who at the height of his career would interchangeably sign himself \\"Anglus\\" or \\"Scotus\\", is of uncertain origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by Horace Walpole and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian Thomas Hearne claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest. A London birth certainly seems supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a \\"Mighell Wryghtt\\", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.What is known is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to George Jamesone, an Edinburgh portrait painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as \\"Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London\\". The reasons for this move to Scotland are unclear, but may have to do with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright is likely to have lodged at the High Street tenement near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).It is also possible that Wright met his wife during his Scottish residency. Nothing is known of her, except from a statement of thirty years later which describes her as \\"related to the most noble and distinguished families of Scotland.\\" If this is accurate, it may explain how Wright was later able to find aristocratic patronage. All that is known for certain is that Wright had at least one child by her, a son, Thomas.

Summarize this article in one sentence. The YouGov survey, commissioned by Stonewall Scotland, also revealed that a third of teachers hear homophobic language from other staff. The poll suggests the problem is rife, but only 16% of teachers have had specific training to deal with it. Some staff also said they were not allowed, or were not sure if they were allowed, to teach about LGBT issues. The Teachers' Report 2014 showed that 89% of primary school staff and 83% of secondary school staff have not received any specific training on tackling homophobic bullying. It also revealed that the majority of teachers in both secondary and primary education believe school staff have a duty to prevent and respond to homophobic bullying. The vast majority of primary school teachers - 92% - said different types of families, including those with same-sex parents, should be addressed in the classroom. Introduced by the Conservative government in 1988, Section 28 prohibited schools and councils from using lessons or publications to \\"promote\\" homosexuality. The law was scrapped in Scotland in 2000, but the YouGov poll revealed that 75% of primary and 44% of secondary school staff say they either were not allowed to, or were not sure if they were allowed to teach about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues in their school. Drama teacher John Naples Campbell, who has been teaching for more than 10 years, told the BBC: \\"There are still a lot of teachers within Scotland who believe that Section 28 is still there, or who were actually trained under Section 28 and haven't been given the training by the Scottish government to actually deal with (the issues) now.\\" \\"I think staff need to be more openâ€¦ we need to be much more confident about being open within our classrooms about issues that affect young people in the world today.\\" Stonewall Scotland director Colin Macfarlane said it was \\"troubling\\" that so many teachers said they had never received specific training on how to tackle homophobic bullying. He added: \\"That's why this year Stonewall Scotland launched a Train the Trainer programme which means we can work directly with teachers across Scotland. \\"However, the responsibility cannot be ours alone. The Scottish government, local authorities, schools and other agencies must now make it a priority that every single teacher is trained to tackle all types of bullying and abuse in our schools.\\" A Scottish government spokesman said: \\"Every secondary school in Scotland has been sent guidance on dealing with homophobia and homophobic bullying, as well as the filmed adaptation of Stonewall's highly successful play for schools. \\"Our national approach to anti-bullying sets out a common vision and aims to make sure that work across all agencies and communities is jointly focused on tackling bullying. We expect that all schools develop and implement an anti-bullying policy, which should be reviewed and updated on a regular basis. \\"To support this we have established and wholly fund respectme, a national anti-bullying service, to build confidence and capacity to tackle all bullying, including prejudice-based bullying, effectively.\\" The Teachers' Report 2014 presents the findings from 260 respondents in Scotland. A total of 122 primary staff and 138 secondary staff were surveyed. Summary:","completion":"A survey shows that many teachers in Scotland still hear homophobic language at school and are unsure if they can teach about LGBT issues, but there are now training programs to help them deal with these issues better."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: A seventh woman has stepped forward publicly with allegations that the comedian and actor Bill Cosby sexually assaulted her decades ago. In an interview on WPTV in West Palm Beach, Fla., the woman, Therese Serignese, 57, a registered nurse, accused Mr. Cosby of drugging and having sex with her after one of his shows at the Las Vegas Hilton in 1976 when she was 19. Although Mr. Cosby’s lawyers have routinely characterized such allegations as unfounded, the drumbeat of similar accusations over the last few weeks has led Mr. Cosby to withdraw from television interviews and has cost him several business opportunities as companies have canceled projects. Mr. Cosby has been all but silent on the matter. On Wednesday, The Associated Press released an interview it conducted with him on Nov. 6 in which he would not answer questions on camera about the allegations. The interview was intended to promote an exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African Art, which features some works from Mr. Cosby’s collection, but when asked about the furor, he declined to comment. After the interview, while still being filmed, Mr. Cosby asked that none of the video of his refusal to comment be shown. “I would appreciate it if it was scuttled,” he said. In her interview with the local TV station in Florida, Ms. Serignese said that after meeting Mr. Cosby in the hotel gift shop, he invited her to watch the show, and she was given a front-row seat. She said that while she was alone with Mr. Cosby at an after-party, he offered her three large pills and said she should take them. She said she felt that she could not object. She was then sexually assaulted, she said. After that, she said, she stayed at a room in his penthouse suite for several weeks, but he made her leave when she told him she might be pregnant, which turned out to be a false alarm. They kept in touch, she said, and, later, when she got into financial difficulty, Mr. Cosby sent her money. Mr. Cosby’s lawyer Martin D. Singer did not reply to a request for comment. Mr. Cosby’s other lawyers have characterized the accusations that he drugged, raped or molested women decades ago as “decade-old, discredited allegations.” Ms. Serignese also gave her account to People magazine and to The Huffington Post. She said she had not spoken out publicly years ago because at that time she was young and believed that, given the culture of the era, few would have listened. “I did not want to be shamed, humiliated,” she said. But now, she said, she wants an apology. She said she came forward anonymously in 2005 and was one of 13 “Jane Doe” witnesses who had said they were prepared to present similar accounts as part of a lawsuit filed by Andrea Constand, a woman who had met Mr. Cosby when she was a staff member with the basketball program at Temple University, Mr. Cosby’s alma mater. She said she had been drugged and molested by Mr. Cosby. Ms. Constand’s suit was settled in 2006, but the terms were not released. By late Thursday, two additional women had come forward with stories about Mr. Cosby’s inappropriate sexual advances toward them, each occurring decades ago. Mr. Singer issued a statement in response. “We’ve reached a point of absurdity,” he said. “The stories are getting more ridiculous.” On Thursday, Temple University in Philadelphia said that Mr. Cosby would remain a trustee, a position he has held since 1982, according to The A. P. As the allegations have swirled around Mr. Cosby in recent weeks, NBC, Netflix and a cable network have canceled projects with him. But he has not let up on his “Cosby 77” stand-up tour. He was slated to go on stage Thursday evening at the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas. On Friday, he is scheduled to appear in Melbourne, Fla., at a sold-out show at the Maxwell C. King Center for Performing Arts. The center said in a statement that while it was aware of the claims, “we are only in a position to judge him based on his career as an entertainer and humanitarian.” But on Thursday, the Desert Diamond Casino in Tucson canceled Mr. Cosby’s Feb. 15 show. The casino, in a statement, did not give a reason but said it regretted “any inconvenience to our guests.” A version of this article appears in print on November 21, 2014, on page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: 7th Accuser Joins Claims of Assault by Cosby.

Washington's Graham Gano kicked 2 field goals just before halftime, from 38 and 46 yards out. The only score of the 3rd quarter was a 2-yard TD catch by Brandon Pettigrew of the Lions. The Redskins took the lead in the 4th quarter with a 5-yard TD run by Keiland Williams; they went for a 2-point conversion and failed, however. The Lions took the lead back with a 7-yard catch by Calvin Johnson; they also failed to complete a 2-point conversion. The Redskins responded with a 96-yard kickoff return for a TD by Brandon Banks; they again failed to complete a 2-point conversion. The Lions retook the lead with a 10-yard TD catch by Calvin Johnson, and completed a 2-point conversion. The Lions added to their lead a few minutes later with a 32-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Lions sealed their win with a fumble recovery by Ndamukong Suh which he ran back 17 yards for a touchdown, but the 2-point conversion failed.

The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

While on a television program several years ago, I recounted a story about moving with my family into a new home in the suburbs of Washington. As a black family, we were welcomed to the neighborhood with a shocking sight. My mother and I looked out the kitchen window the morning after we moved in to notice that someone had driven across our new lawn, skidding over mom's cute dogwood tree, and placed a cross there to intimidate us. Not being wanted in this neighborhood based on the color of our skin made a fearful and lasting impression on me as a 9-year old. About a week after the show a letter came to my office. Penned by a man who identified himself as a \\"White Fundamentalist Supremacist Christian,\\" the letter was a fiery missal responding to my television appearance and underscoring his disdain for black people and his glee over the fact that I had a \\"burning cross\\" (I never said it was burning) in my front yard. I have this letter posted on the back of my office door with a note I wrote across it with a black sharpie: \\"This is why God has called us to be gracists and ambassadors of reconciliation!\\" As whites become minorities in America, traditional minority groups like mine will be called upon to graciously build bridges to help whites adjust to their new minority status without malice or vengeance. Diversity is an ever-evolving, rotating movement of new people and new perspectives in America. While the term may have been largely about blacks at one time, and more recently, Latinos, we find Koreans, Chinese and Filipinos filling up the melting pot. In some areas of the country, as in Michigan, it's the burgeoning Muslim population, or in Minnesota and Ohio, the growing populations of Somalis. Diversity is here to stay. Welcome to the realization of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream. Yet, when King gave his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech, I wonder if he ever envisioned a day when whites in America would actually be the minority. Judging people by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin is altogether as important as it is for blacks. This will become increasingly the case in the decades to come. Integrating whites into the mosaic of American society is an important ideal to embrace, because integration has always been construed as mixing other minorities into a white-dominated world. Whites will become a minority within three decades, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. If this happens as predicted, within little more than one generation, whites will be the largest minority group in America. In the United States we are in for a new age of diversity that all Americans should be aware of with eyes wide open. For the first time in U.S. history, the majority rule of whites will be threatened, which means the concept of rugged individualism that worked so well for whites in America in centuries past may be threatened. The rules of personal responsibility and relational networking (some call it the \\"good old boy\\" network) as an avenue for success will no longer be sufficient in a multicultural and global society. I predict the new minority whites will break into at least two groups: diverse whites, those who are culturally aware and multiculturally proficient, and reverse whites, those who will fight doggedly to hold on to whatever superior status they can. Other minorities, especially blacks, have a choice to be what I call \\"gracists,\\" people who extend favor, kindness, forgiveness and grace to others regardless of, and sometimes because of, color, class or culture. Whites will have the choice of retreating into fear and loathing or embracing their new status with understanding and grace. The integration of whites is not their sole responsibility. Gracism is the powerful assertion that each group should extend grace toward other groups, including minorities extending it to their former oppressor and whites extending it to others rather than protectionism out of fear. The more perfect union will become a reality if that union of gracists will realize that the dream of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. extends to all multicultural configurations and presupposes the coming together of all people as equally human. The factional system of dysfunctional diversity, where power structures are reserved for a majority race to dominate others, is being dismantled one generation at a time. The mosaic of more Americans sharing power beyond one or two dominating racial groups will demand new partnerships based on sociological-political ideas that will drive robust debates, giving birth to innovation and collaboration. The ugly beast of race baiting and power hoarding will not easily die, at least not without a vitriolic fight. In the not-so-distant future, we can expect that diverse whites and reverse whites will be at odds. Gracists must be present to step into the divide and integrate them both. Reverse whites who want to go back to the way things were will still write letters applauding fear mongering. White interest groups may subversively advocate for sustaining institutional structures that perpetuate inequality. The fear of loss of racial dominance may give birth to a growing number of whites feeling cultural disequilibrium. But diversity is here to stay. Immigration is our history. Unity has a chance at being our destiny. If we enter into this brave new world with a spirit of grace, our success as a multicultural, multi-ethnic nation will be a dream realized. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Anderson. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"This article, written by a black individual recounting their own experiences with racial intimidation in childhood, explores the topic of diversity and the predicted shift of Whites becoming minorities in America. The author notes the increasing diversity of America, encompassing not only Blacks and Latinos but also other ethnic groups from Asia and Africa. He suggests that while America moves toward Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision of people being evaluated on their character rather than their skin color, it's crucial to consider this in light of Whites also becoming a minority. Based on U.S. Census Bureau predictions, Whites are set to become a minority within three decades. This shift challenges the traditional concept of individualism under which Whites largely prospered, in favor of a more multicultural and globally oriented society. The author categorizes the future white minority into two - 'diverse whites' who are more culturally aware and 'reverse whites' who will strive to maintain their previously superior status. The author introduces the concept of 'gracism', which involves people extending favor, forgiveness, and grace to others irrespective of color, class, or culture. He argues that gracism is not only the responsibility of the whites but of all racial groups, each extending grace towards the other, including to their previous oppressors. The author predicts the ongoing dismantling of power structures that allow a single race to dominate others, leading to a more democratic distribution of power across racial lines. This shift could promote new partnerships, foster innovation, and fuel robust debates. However, he also warns of potential resistance and conflict, particularly among 'reverse whites' reluctant to accept the change. The author ends on a hopeful note, emphasizing that with grace and tolerance, America can successfully transition into a truly multicultural, multi-ethnic nation. He argues that the increasing racial and cultural diversity is America's reality and potentially its destiny. So it's critical to embrace it with grace and understanding. The continued integration of formerly dominant racial groups is seen as a key part of achieving this vision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They were fascinated by the subject and learned a lot. Team A studied Earth, team B studied planet Venus. Which team didn't learn about sulfur dioxide clouds? Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! The answer is:","completion":"Team A didn't learn about sulfur dioxide clouds. To elaborate, Team A focused their studies on Earth's atmosphere. As the hint in the question suggests, clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Earth's atmosphere primarily consists of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), and trace amounts of other gases like argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. The clouds in Earth's atmosphere mostly contain water vapor and occur in various forms, such as cirrus, stratus, and cumulus. On the other hand, Team B studied the atmosphere of Venus. Venus has a thick and highly toxic atmosphere, composed mainly of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid. The clouds on Venus are primarily made of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid, which makes them very different from the clouds we find on Earth. Additionally, the atmospheric pressure at the surface of Venus is 90 times greater than on Earth. This, coupled with a strong greenhouse effect, makes Venus the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures reaching up to 465°C (860°F).

The real assassin chuckles as he leaves the scene and reports to an unseen contact that the job is finished. Four months later, a commission holds a special public gathering and they conclude that the waiter, named Thomas Richard Lindern (Chuck Waters), acted alone and that there is no greater conspiracy to the assassination of Senator Carroll.Three years later.

If \\"A photographer adjusting the settings on his camera.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A photographer adjusts the lights.\\"?","completion":"While it is possible that a photographer adjusting the settings on his camera may also adjust the lights, it does not logically follow as a necessity. There are various aspects to consider when understanding the relationship between adjusting camera settings and adjusting lights within the context of photography. Here, we will discuss these aspects in detail to provide a comprehensive understanding of why these two actions don't necessarily imply one another. Firstly, let us consider the numerous settings on a camera that can be adjusted. These include: 1. Aperture: This controls the amount of light that enters the camera lens during exposure. A larger aperture allows more light, while a smaller aperture allows less light. 2. Shutter Speed: This determines the duration that the camera sensor is exposed to light. Faster shutter speeds allow less light, and slower shutter speeds allow more light. 3. ISO: This controls the sensitivity of the camera sensor to light. Higher ISO values increase sensitivity, allowing for correct exposure at lower light levels, while lower ISO values decrease sensitivity. 4. White Balance: This setting adjusts the colors in an image to ensure accurate color representation based on the temperature of the light source. 5. Focus: This setting controls the sharpness of the subject within an image. None of these adjustments explicitly require a photographer to adjust the lights, as they can all be made on the camera itself. However, adjusting the camera settings may sometimes lead a photographer to consider adjusting the lighting as well if they feel it could help achieve their desired outcome. This is more a matter of preference and need, rather than a logical conclusion. Secondly, let us consider the various lighting conditions a photographer may encounter and the reasons for (or against) adjusting external lights: 1. Natural Light: When working with natural light, a photographer may opt to utilize the available sunlight and make adjustments on the camera itself instead of adding supplementary light sources. 2. Studio or Artificial Light: In a studio setting or when using artificial light, a photographer may need to manipulate external lights to achieve the desired effect. However, adjusting the camera settings may still be done independently of adjusting the lights. 3. Mixed Light: In situations where both natural and artificial light sources are present, a photographer may need to balance these light sources using both camera settings and external lighting adjustments to achieve the best possible result. It should be noted that adjusting lights in any context might require various techniques, such as modifying light intensity, changing the direction of the light, or utilizing light modifiers like diffusers, umbrellas, and softboxes. However, these actions don't necessarily correlate with adjusting camera settings. In conclusion, while it can be beneficial for a photographer to adjust and balance both camera settings and lighting to achieve optimal results in their photography, it doesn't logically follow that adjusting the camera settings inherently leads to adjusting the lights. The two actions have the potential to be done independently of one another, and will often depend on factors such as the photographer's preferences, needs, and the lighting conditions they are working with."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

NME's Keith Altham said it is \\"a brave effort by Hendrix to produce a musical form which is original and exciting\\".

Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and keyboard player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.Dylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar's Club, and on September 24, they made their debut in Austin, Texas. Two weeks later, encouraged by the success of their Texas performance, Dylan took the Hawks into Studio A of Columbia Records in New York City. Their immediate task was to record a hit single as the follow-up to \\"Positively 4th Street\\", but Dylan was already shaping his next album, the third one that year backed by rock musicians. contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was in the Paul Butterfield Blues Band?, what is it ?

English jeweller and naturalist William Bullock and his son travelled to Mexico soon after its independence, spending six months in 1823 collecting archeological artifacts and many bird and fish species new to science. The bird specimens were given to naturalist William John Swainson, their countryman, to formally describe, which he did in 1827. Among these was the red warbler, which was assigned to the genus Setophaga, as Setophaga rubra. Over the next half century, other authorities moved it to Cardellina, with the red-faced warbler, and to the widespread tropical warbler genus Basileuterus, as well as to the Old World warbler genus Sylvia and the Old World tit genus Parus. In 1873, English naturalists Philip Lutley Sclater and Osbert Salvin moved the species to the genus Ergaticus, where it remained for more than a century.The red warbler forms a superspecies with the pink-headed warbler of Chiapas and Guatemala. Despite their disjunct ranges and considerably different plumages, the two have sometimes been considered conspecific. Conversely, it has also been suggested that the red warbler should be split into a northern gray-eared species (C. melanauris) and a southern white-eared species (C. rubra). A comprehensive 2010 paper by Irby Lovette and colleagues analysing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of the New World warblers found that the red and pink-headed warblers are each others' closest relative and that their common ancestor diverged from a lineage that gave rise to the red-faced warbler. The authors recommended moving the red and pink-headed warblers to the genus Cardellina, a suggestion which has been adopted by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC).There are three subspecies, which differ slightly in appearance: C. r. rubra, described by Swainson in 1827, has white ear patches and is found from southern Jalisco and southern Hidalgo to Oaxaca.

My girlfriend and I always frequent Starbucks and this is one of the locations that she is a regular at. Every day, if not twice a day, she comes here and will order a Venti Iced Caramel Macchiato, no ice (because she has sensitive teeth), skinny and mixed well. What they do with no ice is that they add milk to fill it up. For almost 4 months now, she's never had a problem with that. But this last week, after getting her coffee she noticed that her usual coffee was no .75 more. What?? When asking the girl behind the window to explain, she said that was for the few ounces of milk. Last I checked, a gallon of milk was about 2.00. So you're telling me for barely 3/4 of a cup, you are going to charge .75? WOW. She asked to speak to the manager, who you could tell loved being the manager of a Starbucks.. Oh the power. She kindly mentioned that she was a regular customer and this is the first she's been charged for this. He rudely replied \\"well we have to charge for milk since you dont want ice. Do you want your coffee or not?\\" I wont say what i was thinking, but she did.. lol. She said \\"Ill take my damn coffee and never be back here again!\\" Seriously, every other Starbucks we visit and its probably 4 or 5 total, have never charged to add milk. In fact, she's such a regular that they usually start making her drink when she walks in. Was it worth it Starbucks on 43rd?? Get a new manager who actually is nice to the customers. Im done. NO wonder this place has horrible reviews.

If \\"A person mixes together ingredients.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A person is eating the ingredients\\"?","completion":"No, it does not logically follow that if \\"A person mixes together ingredients,\\" then \\"A person is eating the ingredients.\\" These are two separate actions that may or may not be related. Let us break down the two statements and understand the logic behind each of them. Statement 1: \\"A person mixes together ingredients.\\" This statement describes the action of a person combining different ingredients, typically during the process of preparing a dish or recipe. It implies that the individual is engaged in an activity such as cooking, baking, or making a beverage. Mixing ingredients is an essential step in creating various food items or concoctions. In this step, the person is not consuming the ingredients but rather combining them to achieve a desired result, such as a specific taste or texture. Statement 2: \\"A person is eating the ingredients.\\" This statement describes the action of a person consuming the ingredients, either individually or as a part of a prepared dish. Eating is an act of ingesting food or ingredients, typically to provide nutrition and sustenance. While it is possible that the person may sometimes taste ingredients during the preparation process to ensure the desired flavor is achieved, it does not necessarily mean that they are eating the ingredients as a whole or in significant quantities. When we analyze these two statements, we can see that they describe separate and distinct actions. In other words, just because a person is mixing ingredients, it does not automatically mean that they are eating the ingredients. Mixing ingredients is related to the preparation process, while eating refers to the consumption of food. However, it is worth noting that the two actions could be related in some instances. For example, after a person mixes together ingredients to prepare a dish, they may decide to eat the resulting food after it is cooked or properly presented. In this case, mixing the ingredients is a precursor to eating them. Nevertheless, the act of mixing ingredients alone does not imply that a person is eating them simultaneously or will automatically consume them shortly after. In conclusion, mixing ingredients and eating them are two separate actions, and one does not necessarily imply the other. While it is possible that both actions may occur consecutively or in conjunction as a part of the food preparation and consumption process, they are ultimately independent of one another and should not be assumed to occur simultaneously or interchangeably."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If heat causes fewer grapes to grow, it will have a direct impact on the number of grapes available for washing. With a reduced number of grapes, there will be less grapes to wash, meaning the second stage in the process will be affected. The decrease in grape production due to heat will result in a lower volume of grapes to be cleaned, and therefore, the washing workload will lessen. The supposed perturbation influencing the second effect mentioned can be analyzed as follows: 1. Less raw material (grapes) due to heat: As fewer grapes are grown, the raw material for wine production will be significantly reduced. This will directly affect all the subsequent steps, including washing, as there will be fewer grapes available for processing. 2. Change in workload: With the reduction in grape volume, there will be less demand for washing and handling the grapes. This will affect the workload on the individuals or machinery involved in the washing process, potentially resulting in reduced efficiency or increased idle time. 3. Quality considerations: As the heat affects grape growth, this can also have an impact on the quality of grapes, which may lead to a higher percentage of grapes being discarded before washing due to inadequate quality. This, in turn, can exacerbate the reduction in the number of grapes to be washed. In conclusion, the effect of heat causing less grape growth directly influences the washing stage of the grape production process by reducing the volume of grapes to be washed, leading to a lesser workload and potentially affecting grape quality. Therefore, it can be said that the perturbation has a lessening effect on the second stage, washing, as it causes a decrease in the number of grapes available for processing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The word \\"strike\\" in both sentences refers to the same core meaning of hitting or making contact with something, usually to produce some effect. However, the context in which the word \\"strike\\" is used in each sentence helps to shape how the action is performed and the purpose of the action. In the first sentence, \\"Strike 'z' on the keyboard,\\" the word \\"strike\\" means to press, hit or make contact with the 'z' key on a keyboard. The purpose of this action is to input the character 'z' into a computer program or system. It implies that the person should apply force to the key in a firm manner to ensure that the desired character is entered. In the second sentence, \\"The pianist strikes a middle C,\\" the word \\"strike\\" refers to a similar action, where the pianist is hitting or making contact with the piano key (middle C) to produce a specific note or sound. In this context, striking the key is done to create music, and the forcefulness or technique with how the key is struck will influence the style and character of the sound produced.

Let's do that: 1092 - 1078 = 14 So, now our equation on the left-hand side is simplified as: 14 = -2*c To solve the equation for c, you need to isolate c. To do this, divide both sides by -2 to cancel out the -2 multiplying c on the right side. It's important to remember that whenever you perform an operation (like division) on one side of an equation, you must also perform the same operation on the other side to keep the equation balanced.

Write highlights for this article: British Gas has launched an investigation into solar panels at dozens of schools and businesses after a series of mystery fires. Some 92 schools that signed up for free panels have been told their equipment will need improvements before it is considered safe to use. It comes after solar panel fires in three schools were confirmed by British Gas following a tip-off to The Mail on Sunday. A third roof blaze damaged two classrooms at Sutton Bonington Primary School in Nottinghamshire (above) Although an investigation after the first two was ruled 'inconclusive', it is believed the energy giant was forced to carry out improvements when a third roof blaze damaged two classrooms at Sutton Bonington Primary School in Nottinghamshire. More than 90 schools and 27 business fitted with the suspect equipment have been left without free solar energy since April. The news is likely to come as a blow to Energy Minister Greg Barker, who the same month unveiled plans to put solar panels on the roofs of 24,000 schools. British Gas has stressed that 160 other schools fitted with earlier versions of the panels are unaffected and that household ones are safe. A spokesman for Nottinghamshire County Council said the panels had been installed as part of British Gas's Generation Green project, which gives schools free equipment in return for a Government green subsidy payment. A British Gas spokesman would not reveal the cost of the shutdown, although sources say it could run 'well into six figures' once compensation – for the extra cost of mains electricity – is included. Gab Barbaro, managing director of British Gas Business Services, said: 'Safety is our number one priority. Following an incident in April, we decided to turn off solar panels at certain non-domestic sites as a precaution while we undertook a full investigation. British Gas has stressed that 160 other schools fitted with earlier versions of the panels are unaffected and that household ones are safe (File photo) No one was hurt and we have worked with independent experts to establish the cause. 'As a further precautionary step, we are upgrading part of the solar installations at these sites.' Professor Stuart Irvine, director of Glyndwr University's Centre for Solar Energy Research, said panel fires were unusual. He added: 'The cause here may lie in wiring or junction boxes, where power is converted for the grid, rather than the panels themselves. 'There's an argument that the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) needs to look at this. We must make sure there's adequate testing of components and sufficient protection for buyers.' A spokesman for the DECC said: 'As legal action is pending, it would not be appropriate to comment.' Highlights:","completion":"1.

Question: This article: Since 1991, the anniversary of the massacre has been designated the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, intended as a call to action against discrimination against women. A White Ribbon Campaign was launched in 1991 by a group of men in London, Ontario, in the wake of the massacre, for the purpose of raising awareness about the prevalence of male violence against women, with the ribbon symbolizing \\"the idea of men giving up their arms.\\" Commemorative demonstrations are held across the country each year on December 6 in memory of the slain women and numerous memorials have been built. The Place du 6-Décembre-1989 in the Côte-des-Neiges/Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough of Montreal was created as a memorial to the victims of the massacre. Located at the corner of Decelles Avenue and Queen Mary Road, a short distance from the university, it includes the art installation Nef pour quatorze reines (Nave for Fourteen Queens) by Rose-Marie Goulet. It is the site of annual commemorations on December 6.A memorial erected in Vancouver sparked controversy because it was dedicated to \\"all women murdered by men\\", which critics say implies all men are potential murderers. As a result, women involved in the project ironically received death threats and the Vancouver Park Board subsequently banned any future memorials that might \\"antagonize\\" other groups.The event has also been commemorated through references in television, theatre, and popular music. A play about the shootings by Adam Kelly called The Anorak was named as one of the best plays of 2004 by the Montreal Gazette. Colleen Murphy's play \\"December Man\\" was first staged in Calgary in 2007 The movie Polytechnique, directed by Denis Villeneuve was released in 2009, and sparked controversy over the desirability of reliving the tragedy in a commercial film. Several songs have been written about the events, including \\"This Memory\\" by the folk duo the Wyrd Sisters, and \\"6 December 1989\\" by the Australian singer Judy Small.In 2013, a new... contains an answer for the question: What groups selection committee was made up of presidents, principals and deans of engineering from several prestigious Canadian universities?, what is it ?

Bob was camping 300 yards away and he made a fire using small sticks, kindlings and sawdust he had left over. Bob's fire burned fast and bright. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person made a fire that burned less bright? Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Danny made a fire that burned less bright. This is because he used large logs that he fell a few months back, which have a smaller surface area and thus burn relatively slowly compared to small twigs, kindlings, and sawdust used by Bob.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you're treating a stain on a piece of fabric or clothing, stretch the fabric over a large bowl. Position the stain in the center and wrap a rubber band around the outside of the bowl to hold the fabric in place. Bring a kettle of water to a boil and slowly pour the hot water through the stain and into the bowl. The hot water can loosen the stain and force it out of the fabric. If you're cleaning a fabric stain on a couch, you'll need to remove the cover or cushion to get to the stain. Get out a small bowl and pour in 1/4 cup (60 ml) of gentle dishwashing liquid. Stir in 1/4 cup (60 ml) of hydrogen peroxide until it's combined. Apply the solution to the stain and let it just soak in for 20 minutes. Once the stain looks like it's lifting, wash the material in the washing machine. Only use the brightening dish soap solution on light fabrics since it can lighten dark fabrics. Another way to lift stubborn stains is to coat the stain with white vinegar. Take a few spoonfuls of liquid laundry detergent and rub the soap in. This should loosen the stain. Wash the fabric in hot water to completely remove the stain. If you don't have very many materials to make a deep cleaning solution, just spray club soda mixed with equal parts of white vinegar over the stain. Use paper towels or an old towel to blot up the mixture. You can repeat spraying and blotting until you see the stain lifting.

This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question.

As you drink, try to hold your breath for as long as you can. Additionally, you might plug up your ears. This technique works best if your water is ice cold rather than just chilled. Add water to a glass until it’s half full. Then, lean over your glass and drink from the side farthest away from you, which will simulate drinking upside down. As another option, you can lie upside down off of your bed or couch, then carefully drink the water. Stop every few sips to see if your hiccups have gone away. Be careful that you don’t accidentally breathe in the water or pour it into your nose. Take a spoon and fill it with white or brown sugar. Then, hold the spoon in your mouth for 5-10 seconds. Finally, swallow the sugar and take a big sip of water. If this doesn't work straight away, it's not a good idea to ingest spoonful after spoonful of sugar. Instead, switch to a different technique. Place a lemon wedge into your mouth. Then, either bite into the wedge and drink the juice, or suck on the wedge to get the juice. If the taste is too much for you, it’s okay to add a little sugar to the lemon wedge to sweeten it. The taste of the lemon juice causes a similar reaction to someone scaring you. Vinegar may help combat your hiccups, but you may find its smell and taste to be unpleasant. Since pickle juice contains vinegar, you can drink it instead. Take a few sips of pickle juice or put a few drops of it onto your tongue. Then, repeat as necessary until your hiccups are gone. All pickle juice contains vinegar, no matter the type of pickle. Scoop out a small spoonful of peanut butter, then place it onto your tongue. Hold it in place for 5-10 seconds to let it dissolve some. Then, swallow the peanut butter without chewing.

Sentence 2: Scheck would have many more trials. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"In order to analyze the truth of the second sentence based on the first sentence, we must first understand the content and context of both sentences. It is important to note that the truth of the second sentence is not solely dependent on the content of the first sentence, but it can be related depending on the context. Sentence 1: \\"But the Woodward case--his second Trial of the Decade--reflects Scheck's high-mindedness as much as his greed.\\" In this sentence, we get information about a specific case, the Woodward case, which is referred to as Scheck's second \\"Trial of the Decade.\\" This statement seems to suggest that Scheck has participated in two significant and high-profile trials during this decade. Moreover, the sentence describes Scheck's characteristics, mentioning both his high-mindedness and his greed. Sentence 2: \\"Scheck would have many more trials.\\" This sentence states a prediction or hypothesis that Scheck will be involved in many more trials in the future. It does not specify how many trials or over what period. Now, to address the question as to whether the second sentence is true if the first one is true: these sentences are related to each other in the sense that they both pertain to Scheck and his career in trials. However, the truth of the second sentence is not determined solely based on the first sentence. The first sentence confirms that Scheck has already participated in at least two well-known trials, but it does not provide any direct information regarding his future involvement in trials. The second sentence is a separate statement about Scheck's future and cannot be verified as true or false based on the information provided in the first sentence alone.

I just bought this movie on DVD and watched it for the first time the other night. I've been a fan of Tolkien's work for about 4 years now, ever since I got out of high school. I didn't grow up on this movie...perhaps my mother kept me away from it. It's definitely not for children. Not that it's bad in a graphic sense, but that the themes would go right over most 10 year olds heads. Overall, the animation was excellent considering this was made in 1978/1979. I thought the story followed the book fairly well in a loose sense. But I am bothered that Bashki didn't just add another 40 minutes or so and tack on the Return of the King parts. That would've made it the ultimate movie. I was bothered by it's abrupt end, and then when I heard Return of the King sucked, I was bothered even more. Too bad it wasn't one great animation film. It might have garnered a higher vote from me. I give it a 7. I can only hope Peter Jackson will do the books justice with the new live action LOTR. Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review? Choose from: + negative + positive","completion":"The sentiment of this review is generally positive. In this review, the watcher begins by expressing their longstanding appreciation for J.R.R. Tolkien's work and how they have recently watched a movie adaptation of it. They praise the animation quality given the time it was created, noting it was \\"excellent.\\" They also commend the filmmakers for following the original story to a reasonable extent, describing the adaptation as \\"fairly good in a loose sense.\\" This shows that, overall, their impression of the movie is largely favorable. However, the review also contains elements of criticism and disappointment. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the film's ending and the omission of some parts of the original story, specifically related to \\"Return of the King.\\" They express disappointment that these missing parts weren't included, suggesting it would have made the movie more complete and likely would have earned it a higher personal rating from them. Despite these criticisms, the reviewer still rated the film a 7, showing that they found significant value and enjoyment in the movie despite its flaws. They end by expressing hope for future versions of LOTR by Peter Jackson, indicating that they remain a fan of the franchise. In conclusion, while the reviewer found fault with some aspects of the film, their overall sentiment leans toward the positive side, acknowledging the film's strengths and ultimately giving it a respectable rating.

Therefore, according to Kierkegaard, there isn't a specific system or method that can explain all of reality.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government? from the following article ? Makeba was among the most visible people campaigning against the apartheid system in South Africa, and was responsible for popularising several anti-apartheid songs, including \\"Meadowlands\\" by Strike Vilakezi and \\"Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd\\" (Watch out, Verwoerd) by Vuyisile Mini. Due to her high profile, she became a spokesperson of sorts for Africans living under oppressive governments, and in particular for black South Africans living under apartheid. When the South African government prevented her from entering her home country, she became a symbol of \\"apartheid's cruelty\\", and she used her position as a celebrity by testifying against apartheid before the UN in 1962 and 1964. Many of her songs were banned within South Africa, leading to Makeba's records being distributed underground, and even her apolitical songs being seen as subversive. She thus became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government both within and outside South Africa. In an interview in 2000, Masekela said that \\"there [was] nobody in Africa who made the world more aware of what was happening in South Africa than Miriam Makeba.\\"Makeba has also been associated with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: \\"Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The Black people are the victims of capitalism, racism and oppression, period\\". After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that \\"black is beautiful\\". Along with performers such as Simone, Lena Horne, and Abbey Lincoln, she used her position as a prominent musician to advocate for civil rights.

Answer the following question: Article: As one of Hollywood's all-time greatest actress, Audrey Hepburn is famous all over the world. When Hepburn died in 1993, the world mourned the loss of a great beauty, a great actress and a great humanitarian. Born in Belgium on 4th May 1929, Hepburn dreamed of becoming a successful ballet dancer. She had also been a model before she entered the film industry. In 1951, while acting in Monte Carlo Baby, Hepburn met the famous French writer Colette, who was attracted by Hepburn's beauty and charm. She insisted that Hepburn was the perfect girl to play the lead role in Gigi, a play based on her novel. That event marked the beginning of Hepburn's successful career. Shortly after, Hepburn was chosen to play the lead role of a young princess in the Hollywood film Roman Holiday. It was a big success and earned her an Oscar for Best Actress. She also won a Tony Award for the play Ondine.[:..] During her lifetime, Hepburn earned four more Oscar nominations. In 1989, she made her final appearance in her last film Always and played the role of an angel. Throughout her acting years, she acted in only one TV series, Gardens of the world with Audrey Hepburn. By showing us the beauty of nature, Hepburn wanted to remind us that we should protect the environment. Hepburn is remembered not just as a great actress, but also as a great humanitarian. She was honoured with a number of awards because of her efforts in her charity work. In 1992, the President of the United States presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1991, Hepburn discovered that she had cancer. In 1993, at the age of 63, she passed away peacefully in her sleep. Question: People remember Hepburn not only as a great actress but also as _ .

If Enclosed by the mountains of the Galilee and the Golan, this azure freshwater lake is surrounded by orchards, banana plantations, kibbutzim, and Old and New Testament sites., can we conclude that \\"The lake between the Galilee and Golan mountains is not saltwater.\\"?","completion":"Yes, one can conclude that the lake between the Galilee and Golan mountains, based on the given description, is not saltwater. Here is a more detailed explanation to elucidate on the matter. Firstly, the description explicitly designates the lake as a \\"freshwater\\" body. Freshwater, by definition, is water that contains minimal amounts of dissolved salts, particularly sodium chloride, or what we familiarly refer to as \\"salt\\". Therefore, these types of bodies of water, contrast sharply with \\"saltwater\\" which, as expected, possesses a high concentration of the dissolved salt. This category predominantly includes the oceans and seas. Secondly, the ecosystems and biodiversity surrounding and within freshwater and saltwater bodies tend to reflect their environmental conditions. According to the description, the lake hosts an array of human-made and natural features that are generally affiliated with freshwater. To illustrate, orchards and banana plantations necessitate access to fresh, untreated water to thrive. Saltwater, owing to its high salt content, is typically unsuitable for these types of crops since excess salt can impede the ability of plants to take in essential nutrients from the soil. Additionally, kibbutzim, which are collective communities typically found in Israel, often rely on local supplies of freshwater for various uses such as household, irrigation, and livestock. Also, the sites mentioned from the Old and New Testament, primarily in the region of Galilee, often reference areas associated with fresh bodies of water. Lastly, the described lake is virtually certain to refer to the Sea of Galilee, known also as Lake Tiberias or Kinneret in Israel. This lake is recognized for its biblical significance to Christianity and its rich historical context, besides being the primary water source of the country. It is one of the few freshwater lakes in the region and is indeed enclosed by the mountains of Galilee and Golan. In conclusion, the given description of the lake, along with the reference to its environment and associated activities, strongly indicate that the lake situated between the mountains of Galilee and Golan is indeed a freshwater lake, and not a saltwater body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Following this logic, the best fits could be 'Americans', 'Ben Affleck', 'CIA', 'Jonna Mendez', 'Mendezes', or 'Tony Mendez'. However, 'Ben Affleck' and 'CIA' seem out of context because there is no mention of them in the prior sentences. 'Jonna Mendez' or 'Mendezes' wouldn't likely comment on their own thoughts about Tony's demeanor in third person. Thereofore, the best choice could be 'Tony Mendez'. Although it sounds a bit repetitive, it makes sense in a context where Jonna Mendez is referring to how people, in general, would perceive Tony's demeanor. The sentence would then be: 'I think Tony Mendez just thought that was Tony's demeanor,' she also said. Here, she might be indicating how Tony perceived his own demeanor, which other people also might have noticed. Therefore, I choose 'Tony Mendez'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During the 1690s he completed Hill of Tarvit (1696), Craighall (1697–99) in Fife, and Craigiehall (1699) near Edinburgh. The latter, built for the Marquess of Annandale, still stands, and is used as the British Army's Scottish headquarters. From 1698 he was working on a new house for the young Charles Hope, later first Earl of Hopetoun. Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, was completed in 1702, and represents Bruce's grandest country house design. The master mason was again Thomas Bauchop, and the inspiration was again Anglo-Dutch, with French rustication. The bulk of Bruce's work is now obscured by 18th-century remodelling, carried out by William Adam. Bruce was commissioned again by Hopetoun in 1708, to build a private aisle at Abercorn Kirk. The Hopetoun Loft overlooks the interior of the kirk, and connects to a retiring room with an oval \\"squint\\" giving a view of the pulpit.In 1702 Bruce was commissioned by the burgesses of Stirling to design a new tolbooth for the town. Bruce provided only sketch plans, which were executed by local masons between 1703 and 1705. Bruce's last country houses were Harden House (now known as Mertoun House), built for the Scotts in the Borders, and his smallest house, Auchendinny in Midlothian. His final work, in around 1710, was for Nairne House, for the Jacobite Lord Nairne. The house was not completed until two years after Bruce's death, and the extent of his involvement is unclear. Nairne House was demolished in 1760, although the cupola was retained and installed on the roof of the King James VI Hospital in nearby Perth. contains an answer for the question: What was the location of the structure that was built for Marquess of Annandale?, what is it ?

The key phrase here is \\"we reject the holding,\\" which indicates that the current court is overruling the decision made in the Schenck case. Part #2: Identifying a constitutionally valid statute or a decision by the same or higher ranking court Usage: In this sample sentence, there is no explicit reference to a constitutionally valid statute or a decision by the same or higher ranking court. However, the statement \\"we reject the holding\\" suggests that the current court has the authority to overrule the previous decision, implying that the current court is at least the same rank as the court that decided the Schenck case. Thus, it meets the criteria of being a decision by the same or higher ranking court. Part #3: Establishing a different rule on the point of law involved Usage: In the given sentence, the point of law involves the fiduciary duty of introducing brokers. By rejecting the holding from the Schenck case, the current court is effectively establishing a different rule on that point of law. The previous decision stated that there is no fiduciary duty for introducing brokers in certain circumstances, and the current court is disagreeing with that conclusion, which suggests that they are establishing a different rule on this specific legal issue."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Trevor gets back with her and decides to rob a local mobster. Trevor wants some cash to buy Laura some gifts and Andy was told by some local mobsters that they are investing money with huge profits and he wants some cash to buy in. However, their robbery is very sloppy and the head mobster quickly figures out what happened. However, he and Andy's grandfather were good friends, so he tells Andy and Trevor that they can work off what they owe by smuggling stolen diamonds. Billy finds out what is going on and is mildly amused by it until he realizes that Trevor has gotten back together with Laura behind his back. He retaliates by convincing the mobsters that Trevor is a junkie and is stealing the diamonds that he is supposed to be delivering to supply his habit.

It's the story of the three little pigs and the big bad wolf that blew down a house made of straw and one made of sticks. The only house left standing was the one made of bricks. Now there is new evidence to suggest that houses built with bales of straw can be very strong. They are also very environmental. Pete Walker is a professor at the University of Bath in Britain. He and a team of researchers there have built a house made out of straw bales and hemp material. During the next twelve months the team will study the effectiveness of these materials in home building. Professor Walker says there are many good reasons for using straw. Professor Walker: \\"One of the benefits is it's a relatively inexpensive renewable material that's readily available.\\" He also agrees that straw takes in carbon dioxide as it grows and helps the environment in other ways. So it can be seen as having no harmful effects on the environment. Professor Walker: \\"The straw bale walls are relatively thick and so all that straw provides very good thermal insulation. So we make buildings that require very little heating in the winter or indeed very little cooling in the summer. So they require very little additional energy.\\" Professor Walker says this reduces home operating expenses. It also reduces the effect on the environment. He says the current interest in straw bale houses is a direct response to the problem of climate change. David Lanfear owns an eco-friendly home building service in the United States called Bale on Bale Construction. He says he laughed when some friends first told him about houses built of straw. But after doing his own research, he learned that building with straw bales made a lot of sense. He has now helped to build more than ten straw bale houses and says the building material is becoming more widely accepted. To build the houses, he fills a wood frame with tightly packed bales of straw. Next he coats the walls inside and out with layers of clay plaster. He says the common ideas... Question: What can we infer from the passage? Answer: A:","completion":"From the passage, we can infer that straw bale houses can be a strong, environmentally-friendly, and cost-effective alternative to traditional home construction materials. The research conducted by Professor Pete Walker's team at the University of Bath suggests that using straw and hemp materials in home construction can lead to energy-efficient homes with good thermal insulation, leading to reduced home operating expenses and less impact on the environment. Additionally, the growing interest in straw bale houses is a response to addressing climate change, and these construction methods are becoming more widely accepted. The passage emphasizes the potential benefits of using renewable and eco-friendly materials like straw in addressing environmental issues while providing cost-effective solutions for home construction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"It was adopted on 18 October 1817.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"While it is true that the flag of Chile, or 'La Estrella Solitaria,' was officially adopted on October 18, 1817, this brief explanation does not adequately detail the process of how the flag was actually created. The flag of Chile consists of three distinct elements: two horizontal bands of white (top) and red, with a blue square at the hoist-side end of the white band, and a white five-pointed star in the center of the blue square. The flag, in its present form, was conceived by Minister Jose Ignacio Zenteno, Secretary of War under Bernardo O'Higgins, a key figure of Chilean independence. The design comprises significant symbolism: the blue square signifies the sky and the Pacific Ocean, the white band indicates the snow-covered Andes, and the red represents the blood that was spilled by those who fought for Chile's independence from Spain. Furthermore, the star within the blue square depicts a guide to progress and honor. Prior to the adoption of the current flag, Chile used a variety of flags associated with its struggle for independence. The current Chilean flag followed the Flag of the Patria Vieja, which was used from 1812 to 1814, and the flag of the transitional period. The flag was created as a symbolic representation of the values, aspirations, and sacrifices of the Chilean people in their fight for independence. So, while 'It was adopted on 18 October 1817.' is factually accurate, it is very simplified and does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the creation of the Chilean flag."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: John Charles Wiltshire-Butler (born 1 April 1975), known professionally as John Butler, is an Australian singer, songwriter, and music producer. He is the front man for the John Butler Trio, a roots and jam band, which formed in Fremantle, Western Australia in 1998. The John Butler Trio has recorded five studio albums including three that have reached number one on the Australian charts: Sunrise Over Sea, Grand National and April Uprising. His recordings and live performances have met with critical praise and have garnered awards from the Australian Performing Right Association and Australian Recording Industry Association. Context: The early sessions for the John Butler Trio's sixth studio album commenced in mid-2013, following the band's largest tour of the US. For the first time in the band's lifetime, the members began with a blank songwriting slate, rather than using the initial ideas of Butler that had been introduced. Butler gathered with Luiters and Bomba at The Compound in Fremantle, Western Australia, which serves as the band's headquarters and the frontman's artistic space, and co-wrote material for the first time, deviating from the Butler-centric process of the past: \\"I had always brought the material.\\" After contributing a large portion of work towards the album, Bomba eventually left the Compound space to work on his Melbourne Ska Orchestra project and was replaced by Grant Gerathy. Butler explained in an interview during the band's US tour: But a lot of these songs on this album I kind of magpied. Magpies are this bird in Australia that takes shiny things from anywhere and builds its nest, and so that's kind of what I do. I'll take a little of my own experience of having some heavy party time with certain friends, and then I'll hear some other stories about addicts or other intense relationships. I'll put them into the mixing pot and make up these characters to explore different possibilities and emotional landscapes. One of the songs on the album, \\"Wings Are Wide\\", was written as a dedication to his grandmother, who gave Butler his grandfather's Dobro guitar that became the foundation for his songwriting. Butler admitted that \\"I wasn't at all into roots music or playing the slide or anything when I got it, and it sat under my bed for a long, long time.\\" Released in Australia on 8 February 2014, Flesh and Blood was produced by Jan Skubiszewski and features a vocal duet with Ainslie Wills. Question: Is there an example of a song he magpied ?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, there is an example of a song that John Butler \\"magpied\\" during the creation of the John Butler Trio's sixth studio album, Flesh and Blood. In an interview, Butler mentioned that he took inspiration from various sources, including his own experiences and stories of others, to create song characters and explore different emotional landscapes. While he didn't explicitly mention the song's title in the interview, it can be inferred that one such \\"magpied\\" song on the album is \\"Wings are Wide,\\" which he wrote as a dedication to his grandmother. \\"Wings Are Wide\\" is a tribute to his grandmother who gifted him his grandfather's Dobro guitar. This instrument played a significant role in forming the foundation for his songwriting and musical style, even though it initially sat untouched under his bed for a long time. The song was written as an appreciation for his late grandmother and represents the blending of personal experience along with a sense of gratitude and respect for family tradition."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To isolate b, first add 12995 to both sides of the equation: -565*b - 12995 + 12995 = 0 + 12995 -565*b = 12995 Now, divide both sides of the equation by -565: b = 12995 / -565 Step 3: Calculate b.

История развития Проблемы рационального управления водными ресурсами и их использования в бассейне Аральского моря возникли еще в 70-80-х годах прошлого столетия (рамка 4.1). Translate to English","completion":"4.1.1. The history of development The issue of rational water resource management and their use in the Aral Sea basin emerged as early as the 1970s-1980s (Frame 4.1). The emergence of the problem of rational utilization and management of water resources in the Aral Sea basin can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s. During this period, the growing demand for water resources in the region, coupled with inadequate policies and practices, led to significant environmental degradation and the resulting socio-economic effects. The Aral Sea, once the fourth largest lake in the world, has been shrinking at an alarming rate, mainly due to the excessive diversion of water from its two primary sources, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers. This diversion was primarily driven by the intensive agricultural development, particularly of irrigation for cotton production, in the Soviet period. In the 1960s, the Soviet government had sanctioned major irrigation projects, including the construction of a canal network that diverted large volumes of water from the two main rivers to agricultural fields. This increased the demand for water resources manifold in the region, leading to over-extraction and inefficient use of water. The situation was further exacerbated by the lack of effective water management and monitoring systems in place. As a result, by the 1970s and 1980s, the Aral Sea began to experience severe environmental degradation, including a decrease in its area and volume, the increased salt concentration in the water, and the progressive disappearance of its endemic flora and fauna. These changes had profound ripple effects on the surrounding region, such as soil salinization, loss of biodiversity, a decline in fish stocks, increased desertification, and negative impacts on human health and welfare. Recognizing the critical state of the Aral Sea basin and the urgent need for action, the international community started to take notice of the issue. From the mid-1980s onwards, numerous conferences, summits, and workshops were organized to address the issue. These efforts culminated in the establishment of the Interstate Commission for Water Coordination (ICWC) in 1992, and the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) in 1993, which aimed to facilitate cooperation among the Central Asian states to address the pressing water management issues in the region. Since then, various initiatives and projects have been implemented to restore and improve the condition of the Aral Sea basin. These efforts have primarily focused on improving water management infrastructures, promoting more efficient water use, and restoring ecosystems in the affected areas. Additionally, the international community has also provided financial and technical assistance to help the countries in the region address the complex challenges. Despite the significant progress made over the past decades, the Aral Sea basin remains under tremendous stress due to the ongoing water resource challenges and related environmental and socio-economic consequences. To ensure a sustainable future for the region, it is crucial for the international community and the countries in the basin to continue working together on coherent and long-term measures to improve water management, conserve the ecosystems, and promote sustainable development. In conclusion, the issue of rational water resource management and their use in the Aral Sea basin emerged as early as the 1970s-1980s as a result of inadequate policies and practices during the Soviet era. Since then, various initiatives and measures have been implemented to address the issue, and it continues to be a priority for the region and the international community to ensure a sustainable future."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

If she's looking at the Sun one day and notices less sunspots then she usually sees, what is happening to the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth increasing or decreasing? Assuming that: When there are more sunspots the Sun is more active and there are more solar storms and more of the Sun's energy reaches the Earth. Answer:","completion":"When Mary notices fewer sunspots than usual, it indicates that the Sun is in a less active phase, and the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth is decreasing. Sunspots are dark, cooler regions on the Sun's surface that are generated by intense magnetic activity. An increase in sunspots typically correlates with heightened solar activity, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), both of which can release significantly more energy into space and towards the Earth. During periods of lower sunspot activity, the Sun's overall energy output, or solar irradiance, may slightly decrease. As a result, the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth is reduced compared to periods when there are more sunspots, and the Sun is more active. However, this effect on the Earth's climate is relatively small compared to other factors like greenhouse gas concentrations and human-related activities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - Eastern Christianity consists of four main church families: the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Assyrian Church of the East, as well as the Eastern Catholic Churches (that are in communion with Rome but still maintain an Eastern liturgy). The term is used in contrast with Western Christianity (namely the Latin Church and Protestanism). Eastern Christianity consists of the Christian traditions and churches that developed in the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia Minor, the Balkans, Southern India and parts of the Far East over several centuries. The term does not describe a single communion or religious denomination. Some Eastern churches have more in common historically and theologically with Western Christianity than with one another. The various Eastern churches do not normally refer to themselves as \\"Eastern\\", with the exception of the Assyrian Church of the East and its offshoots. - An angel, especially according to Abrahamic religions and Zoroastrianism, is a spiritual being superior to humans in power and intelligence. Angels are typically described as benevolent, dreadful, and endowed with wisdom and knowledge of earthly events, but not infallible; for they strive with each other, and God has to make peace between them. Most of them serve either as intermediaries between Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits. They are studied in the theological doctrine of angelology. In Christian Science, the word \\"angel\\" is used to refer to an inspiration from God. The use of the term has extended to refer to artistic depictions of the spirits, and it is also used figuratively to refer to messengers and harbingers, and to people who possess high qualities of goodness, purity, selflessness, intelligence, and/or beauty. - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church. - An icon (from Greek \\"eikn\\" \\"image\\") is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from Eastern Christianity and certain Eastern Catholic churches.

Article: If your dog looks pleased to see you - it is probably because it loves the particular way you smell. The odour of a familiar human apparently lingers like perfume in the animal's brain - where it triggers an instinctive emotional response, research published yesterday reveals. Our scent acts on a part of the canine brain associated with reward and the strongest reactions are produced by humans that pets know best, say scientists in America. Gregory Berns, of Emory University in Atlanta, said: 'While we might expect that dogs should be highly tuned to the smell of other dogs, it seems that the \\"reward response\\" is reserved for their humans. 'When humans smell the perfume or cologne of someone they love, they may have an immediate, emotional reaction that's not necessarily cognitive. 'Our experiment may be showing the same process in dogs. But since dogs are so much more olfactory than humans, their responses would likely be even more powerful than the ones we might have. 'It's one thing when you come home and your dog sees you and jumps on you and licks you and knows that good things are about to happen. 'In our experiment, however, the scent donors were not physically present. Why do animals avoid pylons? Because they emit terrifying flashes of light that are INVISIBLE to humans. Dolphins use sponges to protect their sensitive noses while foraging for food on the sea floor 'That means the canine brain responses were being triggered by something distant in space and time. It shows that dogs' brains have these mental representations of us that persist when we're not there.' The university's experiment - the first of its type - involved 12 dogs of various breeds who underwent brain scans while five different scents were placed in front of them. The scent samples came from the subject itself, a dog the subject had never met, a dog that lived in the subject's household, a human the dog had never met, and a human that lived in the subject's household.

BBC Sport spoke to EFL chief executive Shaun Harvey about: After a number of former professional footballers came forward with historical child abuse allegations, Operation Hydrant was set up by the police as an over-arching inquiry. By January, 1,106 cases, implicating 248 clubs, had been referred in what Football Association chairman Greg Clarke called one of the game's biggest crises. Prior to 1992, the Football League was the major domestic league and a number of its member clubs have been implicated. Media playback is not supported on this device Harvey said: \\"This has been exceptionally difficult for football. But let's not forget, it has been a lot more difficult for the individuals who were directly affected. \\"Other than help the victims, we can't do anything that changes the past. But sexual predators exist in our society. We have to make sure, as an industry, we do everything to repel them at our borders. \\"I am satisfied, having seen what goes on today, that we are in an infinitely better place than we were when these historical cases came forward. \\"We will never be complacent. We must put in place a culture that allows parents and players to come forward with anything they feel uncomfortable with so we can deal with these matters in the here and now rather than wait for a 20-year review.\\" There are currently three black managers in charge at the 92 clubs in the top four divisions of the English football pyramid; Brighton's Chris Hughton, Marcus Bignot at Grimsby and Carlisle's Keith Curle. There have been 29 managerial appointments since Bignot replaced Paul Hurst at Grimsby on a six-month rolling contract on 7 November to become the most recent black manager to be given a job. In June 2016, the EFL unanimously approved proposals aimed at tackling the under-representation of coaches and managers from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. The new measures were a version of American football's Rooney Rule and included the introduction of mandatory recruitment practices for coaching positions in academy football and a voluntary recruitment code in first-team football. There has been no change in the number of BAME managers since then. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was sacked by QPR a day before Bignot's appointment. Harvey said: \\"It is apparent the imbalance is there, just on a purely statistical basis. \\"We have set on this process of trying to address the inequality. There is probably further to go but we have moved the dial to a position that is way beyond where we have been in the past. \\"You can't just take a snap shot. The Rooney Rule wasn't an overnight success. It took time. Football needs to be given the same amount of time to achieve the same outcome.\\" In recent months, Leyton Orient, Morecambe, Coventry, Charlton and Blackpool have all experienced large amounts of disquiet amongst their supporters about the ownership of their clubs. At others, including Championship trio Nottingham Forest, Blackburn and Leeds, there is an uneasy relationship between the fans and the owners. Media playback is not supported on this device So, is football's fit and proper persons test for club owners and directors doing its job? Harvey said: \\"It is purely an objective test. It tests against a set of conditions that ask if you are an appropriate person to own, be a director or be a relevant person at a club. That is as far as it goes. It offers no view on skill or ability. It offers no view on judgement. \\"There is always something to be reviewed and we have a responsibility to ensure people are running clubs in their best long term interests. \\"But it is very difficult, unless you get into areas of subjectivity, to start engaging on how someone is going to perform. \\"We also have to be careful that we don't categorise people as good owners or bad owners because fans' views move, usually because of success on the pitch or ticket prices.\\" From 2016-17, parachute payments - the money given to clubs relegated out of the Premier League to prevent them suffering major financial problems given the increased contracts needed to compete in the top flight - are expected to be around £90m per club over a three-year period. It has been suggested they might be reviewed because some promoted teams are choosing not to invest in their squad, knowing they will receive a huge amount of money even if they go down. Harvey said: \\"Yes, the allegation has been made that clubs have got promoted, pocketed the cash, then come back down in a very healthy financial situation. In reality, the number of clubs who come into that category are very small. \\"The real challenge is maintaining a competitive balance. \\"If we can't keep football competitive in the Championship, week in, week out, and clubs don't start the season with a realistic ambition of getting promoted, the competition will eventually die. \\"We can't allow that to happen. Neither can we get into a position where clubs are putting themselves in financial trouble chasing the dream of getting promoted.\\" Prior to 2016-17, when it introduced 'profit and sustainability' rules that would be assessed over three seasons, the EFL's Financial Fair Play regulations were based upon a single season. In 2013-14, clubs that exceeded losses of £8m were subject to a transfer embargo or a fine if they had been promoted. Champions Leicester and play-off winners QPR were fined. Both clubs decided to fight their cases through the courts. Neither has been resolved, with Leicester saying on 2 March they were confident of success. Harvey said: \\"There are ongoing matters with some clubs who didn't meet FFP requirements in the relevant years. Those issues and debates continue. For everybody's benefit, they need to be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible. \\"The objective of keeping clubs secure for the long term whilst allowing them the ambition to chase promotion is one most people can agree with. The real challenge is how do you achieve it when you have some owners who would like to be able to spend as much money as they choose and we have some who seek a sustainable model so they don't have to invest as much to stay in the division. \\"We will never find the right balance exactly but the profitability and sustainability model means we should be in a position where clubs' long-term futures are not messed with and everyone is given a chance of getting promoted.\\" In January, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said English football would benefit from allowing the reserve teams of major clubs to compete in the Championship. A similar system applies in Spain, where B teams can be promoted as far as the league below their senior team. In 2016-17, no Spanish B team is higher than the third tier. The concept has been resisted in England. In July 2016, Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said it would never happen. Harvey agrees, and now also dismisses the notion of Scotland's Old Firm, Celtic and Rangers, being invited into English football, an idea that was floated when the subsequently scrapped 'Whole Game Solution' was launched in May 2016. Asked if B teams or Celtic and Rangers will ever form part of the English pyramid, he said: \\"As it stands, no. \\"The clubs who are the key to the 92 club professional structure make their views clear each time this conversation is mooted. \\"They want sovereign clubs playing inside our competition. \\"Whilst ever that is the case, it will never change.\\"","completion":"The EFL, or English Football League, used to be the major soccer league until the Premier League was formed in 1992. Some big issues affecting soccer are being discussed, and BBC Sport talked to the EFL's chief executive, Shaun Harvey, about them. They talked about historical child abuse cases that have come forward, whether there are enough coaches from different backgrounds, and how people can own soccer clubs and get lots of money even if their teams don't do well. Harvey believes they are doing their best to fix these problems and make soccer better for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The flaring violence resulted in a heartbreaking loss of six lives. The attack happened abruptly, overwhelming the defenses momentarily and introducing a phase of unrest within the armed forces' quarters. I would further explain in detail to give a broad picture without exploiting the horror. The besiege started in the serene morning hours in central Srinagar, a beautiful city always abuzz with colors, abruptly turned into a scene of chaos and terror. The sudden attackers, whose identities remain concealed, targeted a paramilitary barracks, crucial for the city's security. The intention behind their action still remains foggy, and authorities are delving deep to unveil the cause. The audacious military strike soon metamorphosed into a bloodbath as six brave souls succumbed to their injuries. The fallen, part of our paramilitary forces, were integral to the city's shield against such threats. Their untimely demise has sent ripples of sadness through the city and beyond. The shock and grief are quickly turning into a surge of rage against these unidentified attackers. The mayhem and loss of forces have sparked urgent calls for increased security measures and fast-tracking the hunt for these hidden murderers. In the aftermath of this horrific incident, it is crucial to uphold the unity and resilience typical of the city's inhabitants. The authorities are sparing no effort to track down the attackers and bring them to justice. Meanwhile, the city is rallying together for the families of the martyred soldiers, proving that terror can shake, but not break the spirit of Srinagar. In every step of writing, I aimed at reporting the unfortunate incident sensitively, considering the severity and gravity of the situation.

Sentence:","completion":"Amatriciana sauce, also known as \\"Sugo all'amatriciana\\" in Italian, originates from the country of Italy, a nation renowned for its rich culinary culture and flavorful dishes. The sauce is mainly associated with the town of Amatrice in Central Italy, from which it derives its name. Primarily composed of tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, onions, guanciale (cured pork cheek), Pecorino Romano cheese, and a hint of chili pepper, Amatriciana sauce is treasured for its savory and tangy taste. Its unique blend of ingredients not only highlights the best of Italian flavors, but also reflects the nation's diverse regional cuisine, which has evolved over centuries. The country of Italy, located in southern Europe to the south of Switzerland and Austria, is characterized by a rich cultural heritage, covering a wide range of realms such as art, music, literature, and cuisine. Known for its idyllic landscapes, historic cities, and distinctive culture, Italy is a popular destination for tourists and gastronomy enthusiasts alike. The nation is bordered by the Alps to the north, with its long Mediterranean coastline stretching from Liguria in the northwest to Calabria in the south. Italy's southernmost regions are even influenced by the neighboring African continent's climates, which greatly contribute to the country's diverse culinary traditions. As a parliamentary republic, Italy is governed by a combination of elected representatives and political leaders, who work together to shape the legislation and policies that guide the nation. One such leader is Pietro Grasso, an esteemed politician, who has held various positions of power throughout his career. Born in Licata, Sicily, on January 1, 1945, Grasso pursued a legal career as a magistrate before transitioning into politics. During his tenure as an anti-Mafia prosecutor, he demonstrated a resolute determination to fight organized crime, which earned him the admiration of the Italian public. In 2012, Grasso was elected to the Italian Senate, where he served as the President of the Senate from March 2013 to March 2018. As a key leader in the governance of Italy, Pietro Grasso has worked to uphold Italian values, safeguard the rule of law, and promote the diverse culture of the country, while striving to protect and preserve Italy's centuries-old culinary and artistic traditions including the mouth-watering Amatriciana sauce. In summary, Amatriciana sauce is a beloved Italian culinary creation, bearing an undeniable connection to the country it originates from. Italy, as a nation characterized by a rich cultural heritage, offers a vibrant tapestry of enticing tastes, with leaders like Pietro Grasso ensuring that this legacy is preserved and celebrated for generations to come.

The territorial call of the Australian raven is a slow, high ah-ah-aaaah with the last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture. This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species are very difficult to tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.The volume, pitch, tempo and order of notes can be changed depending on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There is a variety of contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging.

Two men have pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges tied to the shooting death of a Chicago teenage girl, who days before had performed at a Washington brunch in the run-up to President Barack Obama's inauguration. Kenneth Williams, 20, and Michael Ward, 18, have been in custody since last month, when a judge ordered that they be held without bond after their first court appearance. On Thursday, they formally pleaded not guilty to a host of charges, the Cook County State Attorney's Office said. The two young men are accused of killing 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton on January 29. Police: Killing was case of mistaken identity. Police said Ward and Williams were gang members seeking revenge against the people who had shot Williams in July, men against whom Williams had refused to press charges when police arrested them. He and Ward thought they had spotted members of a rival gang at the park when police said Ward sneaked up on Hadiya and her friends and began shooting. Williams was the getaway driver, Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy has said. Ward later confessed to shooting Hadiya and two others in a case of mistaken identity, according to McCarthy. He is charged with 141 counts of murder, 10 counts of aggravated discharge of a firearm, eight counts of attempted murder, two counts of aggravated battery with a firearm and one count of mob action, according to the Cook County State Attorney's Office. Opinion: Chicago's violence took my dad, friends. Williams, meanwhile, faces 17 counts of murder, 10 counts of aggravated discharge of a firearm, two counts of attempted murder, two counts of aggravated battery with a firearm and one count of mob action. The Cook County State Attorney's Office did not return calls from CNN on Friday, seeking an explanation as to why the two men face so many murder charges even though only one person was killed. The Chicago Tribune, citing interviews with legal experts and former prosecutors, said it is not uncommon in Illinois for prosecutors to press a large number of charges -- with the understanding that, as the investigation evolves, many of the charges might be dropped. The newspaper pointed out that William Balfour at one point faced 53 murder charges in the 2008 deaths of three of actress/singer Jennifer Hudson's relatives. He was convicted last May on three counts of first-degree murder. Nurses dodge bullets to provide care in Chicago.

After receiving thirty pieces of silver from the highly feared Jewish priests of the Temple in Jerusalem, one of Jesus' other apostles, Judas Iscariot, tells them the location where his teacher is and the priests send a contingent of guards to arrest Jesus for heresy.In the woods outside Gethsemane, Judas approaches with the temple guards and betrays Jesus with a kiss on his cheek. As the guards move in to arrest Jesus, Peter intervenes and attacks them, cutting off the ear of Malchus, one of the guards, but Jesus tells Peter to stop with the violence and magically heals Malchus' ear. The temple guards arrest Jesus and the rest of the apostles flee.John runs and tells Jesus' mother, Mary, as well as Mary Magdalene of the arrest, and Peter follows Jesus at a distance who is severely beaten by the Temple guards on their way back to Jerusalem.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. James Whale (22 July 1889 - 29 May 1957) was an English film director, theater director and actor. He is best remembered for his four classic horror films: Frankenstein (1931), The Old Dark House (1932), The Invisible Man (1933) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Whale also directed films in other genres, including what is considered the definitive film version of the musical Show Boat (1936). He became increasingly disenchanted with his association with horror, but many of his non-horror films have fallen into obscurity. After the armistice he returned to Birmingham and tried to find work as a cartoonist. He sold two cartoons to the Bystander in 1919 but was unable to secure a permanent position. Later that year he embarked on a professional stage career. Under the tutelage of actor-manager Nigel Playfair, he worked as an actor, set designer and builder, \\"stage director\\" (akin to a stage manager) and director. In 1922, while with Playfair, he met Doris Zinkeisen. They were considered a couple for some two years, despite Whale's living as an openly gay man. They were reportedly engaged in 1924, but by 1925 the engagement was off. In 1928 Whale was offered the opportunity to direct two private performances of R.C. Sherriff's then-unknown play Journey's End for the Incorporated Stage Society, a theatre society that mounted private Sunday performances of plays. Set over a four-day period in March 1918 in the trenches at Saint-Quentin, France, Journey's End gives a glimpse into the experiences of the officers of a British infantry company in World War I. The key conflict is between Capt. Stanhope, the company commander, and Lt. Raleigh, the brother of Stanhope's fiancee. Whale offered the part of Stanhope to the then barely known Laurence Olivier. Olivier initially declined the role, but after meeting the playwright agreed to take it on. Maurice Evans was cast as Raleigh. The play was well received and transferred to the Savoy Theatre in London's West End, opening on 21 January 1929. A young Colin Clive was now in the lead role, Olivier having accepted an offer to take the lead in a production of Beau Geste. The play was a tremendous success, with critics uniform and effusive in their praise and with audiences sometimes sitting in stunned silence following its conclusion only to burst into thunderous ovations. As Whale biographer James Curtis wrote, the play \\"managed to coalesce, at the right time and in the right manner, the impressions of a whole generation of men who were in the war and who had found it impossible, through words or deeds, to adequately express to their friends and families what the trenches had been like\\". After three weeks at the Savoy, Journey's End transferred to the Prince of Wales Theatre, where it ran for the next two years. With the success of Journey's End at home, Broadway producer Gilbert Miller acquired the rights to mount a New York production with an all-British cast headed by Colin Keith-Johnston as Stanhope and Derek Williams as Raleigh. Whale also directed this version, which premiered at Henry Miller's Theatre on 22 March 1929. The play ran for over a year and cemented its reputation as the greatest play about World War I. how many openings did it have?","completion":"James Whale's play, Journey's End, had two main openings. First, it opened in London's West End at the Savoy Theatre on January 21, 1929. Then, it had a New York opening at Henry Miller's Theatre on March 22, 1929.

Question 1: Why is Avatar: The Last Airbender not on Netflix? Question 2: Who is Katara in Avatar: The Last Airbender? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"No, the answers to these two questions are not the same. Each question pertains to different aspects of the show 'Avatar: The Last Airbender'. Let us address each question individually for a thorough explanation. Question 1: Why is Avatar: The Last Airbender not on Netflix? The availability of 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' on Netflix may vary depending on the country or region. As streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video sign contracts and licensing agreements with a variety of content providers, these agreements may limit the platforms from hosting specific shows or films. In some cases, the contract may only include streaming rights for a specified period, and once the contract expires, the streaming platform may face the removal of the content in question. Another factor that affects the availability of a show on a streaming platform is the competitive landscape. Some content producers may opt to release their work on their own streaming platforms or exclusively on other partnerships rather than Netflix. So, if 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' is not on Netflix in your country or region, it is likely because of licensing agreements or decisions made by the content creators. Question 2: Who is Katara in Avatar: The Last Airbender? Katara is a significant character in the animated television series 'Avatar: The Last Airbender.' She is a teenage waterbender from the Southern Water Tribe and the daughter of Hakoda and Kya. Katara has a brother named Sokka, and together, they embark on a journey with Aang, the main protagonist of the series and the last surviving airbender. Katara plays a vital role as the group's main waterbender, responsible for the healing of any injuries and the eventual teaching of waterbending to Aang. Katara is known for her strong sense of morality, passion for justice, and commitment to her family and friends. Throughout the series, Katara's character develops, and she faces personal challenges that ultimately allow her to master not just her waterbending skills but also grow as an individual. In conclusion, the answers to the two questions differ significantly. The first question addresses the availability of 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' on Netflix, depending on licensing agreements, while the second question describes Katara, an essential character in the series."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: I added a comma after \\"Following this\\" to separate the introductory phrase from the main clause for easier comprehension. Step 3: I added a comma after \\"one of his sisters\\" to separate the main idea of the sentence from the specifics about what was in the letter. Step 4: Within the specifics about what was in the letter, I added a comma after \\"death in general\\" to indicate a slight pause before specifying that the meaning was also given to his father's death.

Choices: - sewing - sewing machine - art store - frame - livingroom The rationale to choose \\"sewing\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"Among the given options - sewing, sewing machine, art store, frame, livingroom - the correct one is \\"sewing\\". This is based on the context provided within the question which identifies hobbies related to craftiness with needles. To begin, let's comprehend each option in relation to the question. The question is asking about a potential hobby someone would have if they're good with needles. We can safely conclude it's referring to a needlework hobby. Hence, the answer is likely going to be a needle-related handicraft. 1. Sewing: This is an action done with needles to connect pieces of fabric or other materials together. It certainly fits the context of someone who is artistic with needles. 2. Sewing Machine: This tool does involve needles and is used in sewing, but it is a tool, not a hobby. Hence, it's not as accurate response as \\"sewing\\". 3. Art Store: This is a place where someone might purchase supplies for various crafts and hobbies, but it's not a hobby unto itself. While one could argue the person may enjoy shopping at art stores, it doesn't directly correlate to craftiness with needles. 4. Frame: A frame is generally used to display completed artwork, like needlepoint or a beautiful piece of sewn fabric. It doesn't involve the use of needles, nor is it a hobby. 5. Livingroom: This is a room in someone's house; it isn't related to needlework or a hobby in itself. Perhaps a person might enjoy crafting in their living room, but the crafting is the hobby, not the room. Hence, the answer is \\"sewing\\". It is the only option that is both a hobby and involves the use of needles. Sewing is a craft that requires precision, skill, and creativity, especially in designing and making clothes, home decor, and assorted other projects. Many people who are good with needles often learn to sew because it is a versatile skill that allows for a high degree of personal expression and practical application. Therefore, the rationale to choose \\"sewing\\" is that it directly relates to the craftiness with needles and is a hobby in itself."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Paragraph: Representing yourself in court can be a tricky endeavor. There are confusing legal terms to learn, strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case. Lake County officials and a private agency that assists indigent litigants in Illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self-help center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters. The center, which will be housed in the law library at the main courthouse in Waukegan, could open later this summer. \\"I think it's going to be extremely helpful,\\" Court Administrator Bob Zastany said. \\"There is a population out there that will take advantage of this resource.\\" The self-help center will be the only one of its kind in the county. Only a few operate nationwide, officials said. The project is the work of Lake County circuit court officials and Prairie State Legal Services, a statewide agency with an office in Waukegan that provides information and legal assistance to poor and elderly Illinois residents. The organization has received a 25,000 grant from the Illinois Equal Justice Foundation, a nonprofit group that funds programs designed to increase access to legal information and assistance, to help pay for the effort. Prairie State will share the money with the county. The county's law library is on the first floor of the governmental center at 18 N. County St. The new self-help center will be designed to help litigants find the information they need to properly represent themselves in court, an undertaking that can be complicated and confusing. \\"Some people can do OK on their own, and some people can do OK with some help,\\" said Linda Rothnagel, the managing attorney for Prairie State Legal Services. \\"But other people can't do it. It's not always easy.\\" Self-representation is a right affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The practice is far more common in civil matters than in criminal cases. In fact, self-represented litigants - formally called \\"pro se\\" in Latin, or \\"for oneself\\" - in criminal defenses are so rare that statistics about the practice generally are not kept, legal experts say.

Possible A: restaurant, nightclub, las vegas, atlantic city, new york city Why is \\"nightclub\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Nightclub\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is an alternative venue where people commonly go to socialize, unwind, and have a drink, especially during late hours. Since John was looking for a bar but couldn't find one, a nightclub would be a reasonable alternative for him to consider. Nightclubs typically offer many of the same amenities as bars, such as alcoholic beverages, a social atmosphere, and entertainment options like live music or DJs. In addition, nightclubs are usually open late into the night, which aligns with John's situation since he was working late at the casino.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who transcribed the music of an English composer? In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...

Please briefly summarize this news article: Will the Next Attorney General Crack Down on Marijuana? Despite substantial scientific evidence that marijuana is not as harmful as alcohol, many law enforcement officials continue to pretend otherwise. Add to that list Loretta Lynch, President Obama’s nominee for attorney general. In response to a question at her confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Ms. Lynch pointedly disagreed with Mr. Obama who once told David Remnick of The New Yorker that he didn’t think ingesting the drug was more dangerous than drinking. She said that Mr. Obama was “speaking from his personal experience and personal opinion.” She also said that she did not support marijuana’s legalization. Ms. Lynch’s statements are not all that surprising considering the fact that she spent much of her career as a federal prosecutor in the heady days of the “war on drugs.” Other officials in law enforcement including the current head of the Drug Enforcement Administration hold similar views. But as my colleague Philip Boffey wrote in an editorial in July, the scientific evidence is not on Ms. Lynch’s side. In 2010, for example, a British scientific committee said that alcohol was the most harmful to users and society of the 20 drugs it studied; marijuana ranked eighth, behind heroin, cocaine and tobacco. Ms. Lynch’s views are important because the Department of Justice, which she will head if confirmed, said in 2013 that it would not interfere with the legalization of cannabis in Colorado and Washington as long as those states met several conditions. Since then Oregon and Alaska have also legalized recreational use and the District of Columbia legalized the possession of small amounts. In her hearing, Ms. Lynch did not say if she would try to reverse the department’s policy toward state legalization. But she emphasized that under the existing policy federal officials could still pursue cases to make sure marijuana was not distributed to children, and crack down on transportation of the drug across state lines to places where the drug was not legal. Ms. Lynch’s statements serve as a reminder that the Obama administration’s policy on marijuana could easily be reversed. It would make much more sense for the administration or Congress to remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act’s Schedule I and let states decide whether they want to permit its use.","completion":"The article ponders upon the possible changes in marijuana policies by the next Attorney General under the Obama administration, specifically Loretta Lynch, President Obama’s nominee for attorney general. Despite research suggesting that marijuana is not as harmful as alcohol, many officials including Lynch continue to hold a different perspective. At her confirmation hearing, she disagreed with President Obama's view that marijuana is less dangerous than alcohol, and expressed her opposition to the drug's legalization. Her views are particularly relevant given the potential role she would play as head of the Department of Justice, which in 2013 announced it would not interfere with the legalization of cannabis in states including Colorado and Washington, provided certain conditions were met. It is however uncertain if she would attempt to reverse this policy. While she did emphasize that under the existing policy, federal officials could still pursue cases to prevent distribution of marijuana to minors and to curb its transportation across state lines to places where it's not legal, the article speculates that Obama’s policy could yet be reversed under her. The author of the article strongly suggests instead that the administration or Congress should remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act’s Schedule I, allowing states to decide its usage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But while his fans from Green Bay, New York and Minnesota will be able to see him in action at 8 p.m. ET August 26 on NBC, he's not making yet another comeback to the NFL. Favre was on the field in Grant Park in downtown Chicago recently with other NFL greats such as Jerry Rice, Michael Irvin, Deion Sanders, Marcus Allen and Barry Sanders, playing in the annual EA Sports \\"Madden\\" Pigskin Pro Am flag football game.

Information: - A prologue or prolog ( Greek prólogos , from pro , \`\` before '' and lógos , \`\` word '' ) is an opening to a story that establishes the setting and gives background details , often some earlier story that ties into the main one , and other miscellaneous information . The Ancient Greek prólogos included the modern meaning of prologue , but was of wider significance , more like the meaning of preface . The importance , therefore , of the prologue in Greek drama was very great ; it sometimes almost took the place of a romance , to which , or to an episode in which , the play itself succeeded . It is believed that the prologue in this form was practically the invention of Euripides , and with him , as has been said , it takes the place of an explanatory first act . This may help to modify the objection which criticism has often brought against the Greek prologue , as an impertinence , a useless growth prefixed to the play , and standing as a barrier between us and our enjoyment of it . The point precisely is that , to an Athenian audience , it was useful and pertinent , as supplying just what they needed to make the succeeding scenes intelligible . But it is difficult to accept the view that Euripides invented the plan of producing a god out of a machine to justify the action of deity upon man , because it is plain that he himself disliked this interference of the supernatural and did not believe in it . He seems , in such a typical prologue as that to the Hippolytus , to be accepting a conventional formula , and employing it , almost perversely , as a medium for his ironic rationalismo . - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. - A preface or proem is an introduction to a book or other literary work written by the work's author. An introductory essay written by a different person is a \\"foreword\\" and precedes an author's preface. The preface often closes with acknowledgments of those who assisted in the literary work. - A foreword is a (usually short) piece of writing sometimes placed at the beginning of a book or other piece of literature. Typically written by someone other than the primary author of the work, it often tells of some interaction between the writer of the foreword and the book's primary author or the story the book tells.

First, I inspected each element in the given list: [37, 99, 61, -19, 55, -34, 3, 82]. 2. If the current element is positive, I multiplied it by 2. 3. If the current element is negative, I multiplied it by -3. 4. I added the result of each multiplication (step 2 or 3) to a new list. Here's the step-by-step logic applied for the given list: For 37: Positive, so 37 * 2 = 74 For 99: Positive, so 99 * 2 = 198 For 61: Positive, so 61 * 2 = 122 For -19: Negative, so -19 * -3 = 57 For 55: Positive, so 55 * 2 = 110 For -34: Negative, so -34 * -3 = 102 For 3: Positive, so 3 * 2 = 6 For 82: Positive, so 82 * 2 = 164 After applying the logic to each element, the resulting list is: [74, 198, 122, 57, 110, 102, 6, 164]."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"What can large amounts of water do to wood?\\" Context: \\"The general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render it softer and more pliable.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\"). Question: \\"Was the white house on the initial list of targets developed by KSM, Atef, and Bin Laden?\\" Response: \\"Yes\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question that the White House was on the initial list of targets developed by KSM, Atef, and Bin Laden."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"No, the supposed perturbation of more dissolved oxygen being picked up by blood cells does not directly or indirectly affect the process of valley formation. Here's why: 1. The described process focuses on geological formations and erosion, which are primarily influenced by physical factors such as rock type, rainfall, gradient, and the flow path of the river. 2. The perturbation suggested is biological in nature. The amount of dissolved oxygen picked up by blood cells typically impacts bodily functions and processes in living organisms, like respiration and energy production. 3. Even on an ecological level, an increase in the amount of dissolved oxygen in blood cells doesn't directly influence geological processes. While it could potentially affect the organisms living in or around the river, it would not cause significant changes in the river's course, flow, or erosion capabilities, essential factors for the creation or reduction of valleys. Therefore, the perturbation does not have a meaningful impact on the described process.

PUBLISHED:. 07:37 EST, 28 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 06:32 EST, 21 November 2013. Allowances: Idreez Popoola, 34, should have been deported in 2006 after his temporary UK visa expired but he was allowed to continue living and working in Britain. An illegal immigrant who was twice spared deportation went on to rape a woman just months after using human rights legislation to remain in the UK. Idreez Popoola, 34, will finally be sent back to his home country of Nigeria when he is released from a seven-year jail term imposed after the attack in the victim’s home. Last night an MP said the case highlighted Britain’s ‘dysfunctional’ border controls. A court heard that Popoola came to the UK on a 12-month visa in 2005, but when it expired he was given permission to remain on a temporary basis. But when Popoola was arrested by Northamptonshire Police in December 2011 over an allegation of assault he was found to be an ‘overstayer’ – an immigrant who had not left the country by an agreed date. Although no charges followed the alleged assault, Popoola – by now married with a child – was told he would be deported. However, he successfully appealed the ruling, arguing that the Human Rights Act provided him with the right to a family life. Northampton Crown Court heard that Popoola, who worked as a nightclub bouncer, was granted temporary leave to remain in the UK again in January last year, after his family circumstances were taken into account. But 11 months later he went on to brutally rape a woman in her own home. Bouncer: The court heard Popoola met his victim while working as an agency-employed bouncer outside Bar So in Northampton town centre. Popoola, who sold mobile phone top-up. cards in Nigeria before moving to the UK, is thought to have lived in. Oxford before settling in Thornton Heath, South London, where he trained. as a bouncer and gained work with an agency which supplied a. Northampton nightclub. Judges granted Popoola the temporary right to stay in the UK because he had family just days before he raped a woman in her home. Gordon. Aspden, prosecuting, said Popoola met his victim at a McDonald’s. restaurant in the town. After going back to her home he attacked her,. then forced her to drive him to a train station. Popoola was sentenced to seven years after being found guilty of rape following a four-day trial. Judge. Lynn Tayton told him: ‘It was a serious aggravating factor that the. rape took place in the victim’s own home, as this was an abuse of the. trust placed in you by the victim and has undermined her feelings of. safety in her own space.’ Michael Ellis, Tory MP for Northampton North, said: ‘This is an example of the dysfunctional border control in the UK. ‘Although. there has been considerable improvement since this government took. over, the previous regime was completely not fit for purpose. ‘Here. is another example of someone who has gone on to commit a serious and. unforgivable act when they shouldn’t have even been in the country at. all.’ Alp Mehmet, deputy chairman of the Migration Watch UK pressure. group, said: ‘The sensible course of action, in respect of anyone. without a right to be here, is to remove them as speedily as possible.’ A. Home Office spokesman said: ‘We have introduced tough new rules to. protect the public from those who try to stay here through abuse of the. Human Rights Act. 'Our Immigration Bill will give the full force of. legislation to our policy that foreign criminals should ordinarily be. deported despite their claim to a family life.'

Article:At the height of the conflict between the Colombian government and left-wing Farc guerrillas, Mr Bermudez - then a 26-year-old policeman - was on patrol in a rural area in the south of the country when he stepped on a land mine. The explosion left him completely blind and with terrible facial injuries. Eleven years and dozens of medical procedures later, Mr Bermudez is no longer angry with the guerrillas who probably laid the mine that maimed him but he is frustrated with a deeply divided society, which he says has missed a chance to move on and pursue a lasting peace. \\"If I and all the other victims of violence can find the strength to forgive and to compromise then those people, sitting behind their desks in the cities, who have not suffered in the same way can surely do the same,\\" Mr Bermudez tells me in his modest Bogota home. He lives here with his wife and two young daughters, children he has never seen because of his blindness and whom he dotes on. Scrapping by on a police pension and as a part-time musician, Mr Bermudez worries about what kind of country his girls will grow up in now that a peace deal between the government and the Farc guerrillas hangs in the balance after Colombians' surprise rejection of the deal in a referendum on Sunday. 'Fundamental flaw' Other Colombians are more optimistic, even interpreting the \\"no\\" vote as a positive development. Jaime Castro is a former mayor of Bogota and was a prominent campaigner against accepting the agreement that had taken four years to negotiate. \\"The fundamental flaw with President [Juan Manuel] Santos' strategy was that it was a single-party, political approach rather than a national policy,\\" says Mr Castro. \\"If what we now end up with is a multi-party solution, acceptable to everyone, it could strengthen the process.\\" Earlier this week I took a short stroll through La Candelaria, the old colonial quarter of Bogota. There is plenty of poverty, misery and crime in Bogota - like any other Latin American metropolis - but the Colombian capital is a much safer and more tranquil place than I remember when I first started reporting from here in the 1990s. Indeed no one wants a return to the violence that ravaged the country and its institutions for decades. Juana Acosta was an adviser to the peace talks, which were held in the Cuban capital, Havana. She worked specifically on the issue of justice and political participation. It is one of the most contentious parts of the existing agreement and Ms Acosta admits that it is probably one of the main reasons why it was narrowly defeated in the referendum. \\"Which former guerrillas, who are accused of abuses and violations, will be allowed to take part in the political process and what punishment they must serve for their crimes is one key area that Farc negotiators are going to have to look at again,\\" Ms Acosta tells me. The adviser, who hopes to be returning to Havana for fresh talks, added: \\"Colombian society cannot allow again the presence of child soldiers. We cannot allow again atrocities against the civilian population. We are not prepared again to live through such violence so we're going to have to find a way through this and to sign a new peace agreement.\\" Those close to the talks, like Ms Acosta, realise that time is now a crucial factor. In recent weeks and months, thousands of Farc guerrilla fighters have been gathering in jungle camps, preparing to hand over their weapons and uniforms. The plan was for them to rejoin society after demobilising, receiving guaranteed monthly payments from the state and limited immunity from prosecution. But after the result of the plebiscite, no one is really sure what will happen next. The longer the hiatus remains, the greater the risk that the Farc members will sink back into the jungle, re-arm, perhaps join other smaller left-wing organisations or criminal gangs making money from the drugs trade. For now all sides say they are committed to peace but in his latest pronouncement, President Santos warned that a mutually agreed ceasefire between his government and the Farc would expire at the end of October. While Colombia's ministry of defence has since said that the ceasefire can be extended again beyond that date, Mr Santos' statement was interpreted as a thinly veiled warning to negotiators that they would have only weeks to put their heads together and resubmit a modified agreement. The president's words also elicited an ominous response from the Farc leadership, with the question; \\"What happens when the ceasefire expires? Does the fighting start all over again?\\" It is a thought most Colombians, especially people like Edgar Bermudez, who have suffered so much already, dare not contemplate. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The article narrates the story of Edgar Bermudez, a victim of a landmine blast, who is concerned about the future of Colombia after the country's surprise rejection of the peace deal between the government and the FARC guerrillas in a recent referendum. The political atmosphere has been polarized, and the rejection of the peace deal has left many feeling uncertain about the future of the country. Jaime Castro, a former mayor of Bogota, believes the \\"no\\" vote to be a positive development, stating that a multi-party solution, acceptable to everyone, could strengthen the process. However, Juana Acosta, an adviser to the peace talks, acknowledges that the existing agreement's most contentious parts need to be revisited for a successful peace deal to come to fruition. The rejection of the agreement has led to concerns over the demobilized FARC fighters rearming and rejoining smaller left-wing organizations or engaging in drug trade.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The best answer in the given choices would be \\"very deadly,\\" as it is directly related to the consequences of faulting of rocks in Earth's crust leading to earthquakes. However, this answer choice only covers one aspect of the results of faulting of rocks, and it is important to understand that there are several other consequences and processes related to it. Faulting of rocks in the Earth's crust is the fracturing or breaking of the Earth's surface due to the shifting of tectonic plates. This can cause several phenomena, such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the creation of new landforms. The movement, deformation, and fracturing of rocks near the fault line have significant implications for the surrounding environment and the planet as a whole. Some of the consequences of the faulting of rocks in Earth's crust include: 1. Earthquakes: As the tectonic plates move and interact with each other, energy builds up along the fault lines. This energy is eventually released, causing the ground to shake and move, sometimes resulting in very deadly and destructive natural disasters. 2. Mountain-building: The movement of tectonic plates can result in compression, leading to the formation of mountain ranges. This can alter the landscape and change the regular patterns of erosion and sedimentation in adjacent areas. 3. Basin formation: As the rocks are pulled apart along the fault lines, depressions, or basins can be created. These basins can eventually fill up with water, creating lakes or seas. 4. Uplift and subsidence: The faulting of rocks can lead to uplifting or subsidence of the Earth's crust, leading to changes in elevation and topography. 5. Formation of fault-block landforms: The movement of large blocks of crust vertically along fault lines can lead to the creation of new landforms such as fault-block mountains and rift valleys. 6. Volcanic activity: The movement of tectonic plates can create volcanic activity, as magma from the Earth's mantle is able to move closer to the surface and erupt through fractures and cracks. 7. Mineral and resource deposits: Faulting of rocks can lead to the exposure and concentration of valuable minerals and resources, creating economic opportunities for mining and extraction. In conclusion, while the earthquakes resulting from the faulting of rocks in Earth's crust can indeed be very deadly, it is crucial to understand the broader context of related geological processes and consequences. The movement and interaction of tectonic plates, faulting, and fracturing of the Earth's crust have significant impacts on our planet's geology, landscape, and human society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gilgamesh has been not reading the cuneiform tablets.","completion":"The sentence \\"Gilgamesh has been not reading the cuneiform tablets\\" is a somewhat awkward construction, but it can still be understood. For a more linguistically acceptable and natural-sounding version, the sentence should be rephrased for better clarity and grammatical accuracy. There are generally two ways to express negation in the present perfect continuous tense: 1. Using \\"not\\": The first and more common way is to place \\"not\\" before the auxiliary verb. In this case, \\"has\\" is the auxiliary verb being used, so \\"not\\" should be placed immediately after \\"has.\\" This creates a contraction \\"hasn't\\" (has not). Here's the corrected sentence: Gilgamesh hasn't been reading the cuneiform tablets. 2. Using \\"no\\": Another way of expressing a negation with an emphasis on the lack of activity is by using \\"no\\" before the gerund (the -ing form of the verb). This is less common, and it may sound less natural in some instances. However, it's still grammatically correct: Gilgamesh has been reading no cuneiform tablets. Both versions above are linguistically acceptable, with the first one being the most commonly used and considered more natural by native English speakers. It is important to remember that the placement of \\"not\\" directly before the main verb can often lead to awkward or confusing sentence structures, so putting \\"not\\" after the auxiliary verb is a safer choice for creating clear and understandable negations."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Given the question: Given the following context: Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\". The period in which the triptych was created was a time of adventure and discovery, when tales and trophies from the New World sparked the imagination of poets, painters and writers.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Avoid heat while your ankle recovers. Heat increases blood flow to the injured area and aggravates inflammation. Warm compresses, saunas, and steam showers may do more harm than good in the first three days after your injury occurs. Stay away from heat during this time and stick to cold compresses to help relieve pain and swelling. Do not drink any alcohol while you are recovering. Alcoholic drinks open up the blood vessels in the body. When your blood vessels open up, the swelling in your ankle can become much worse. Alcohol will also delay the healing process, so it is a good idea to avoid it while you recover. Stay away from running and other physical activities to make sure that your ankle heals. Running and other high impact physical activities will only make things worse. Rest for at least one week before resuming exercise. Do not massage your ankle for at least a week. While massaging the pain away in your ankle might sound like a good idea, giving your ankle a massage will just add external pressure to your injury. This external pressure will actually make the swelling worse. You can start to gently massage your ankle one week after you have allowed your ankle to rest and recover.

The UCL Academy introduced the later start when it opened in September. This comes after research shows that teens don't wake up before 10. Pupils have been more alert and engaged in lessons, according to the school. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: The UCL Academy's Later Start Times: A Beneficial Shift for Teen Students Introduction The UCL Academy, a prestigious educational institution in London, introduced a significant change in its daily timetable when it opened up its doors to students in September. The decision to start the school day later, at 10 a.m., is based on scientific research that shows teenagers are not well-rested and mentally prepared for learning before this time. Early results indicate that this shift in schedule has a noticeably positive impact on students' attentiveness and overall engagement in lessons. The Science Behind Later Start Times There has been a growing concern among educators, parents, and researchers about the impact of traditional school start times on adolescent students, particularly in their teenage years. Studies have revealed that teenagers' unique circadian rhythms, which control their sleep-wake cycles, tend to shift as they enter puberty. This change makes it harder for them to fall asleep early and wake up feeling refreshed before 10 a.m. According to sleep experts, the melatonin hormone, which plays a significant role in regulating sleep, shows an altered secretion pattern in teenagers. This alteration causes teens to feel alert at a later time at night and consequently, makes them drowsy in the mornings. It is important to note that insufficient sleep in teens has been linked to lower academic performance, increased anxiety and depression, and higher risks of obesity and car accidents. The UCL Academy's Approach Faced with such evidence, the UCL Academy decided to take the bold step of starting the school day at 10 a.m. This allowed students to arrive at school feeling more awake, alert, and prepared to engage in the learning process. Students adopted the new schedule enthusiastically and quickly adapted to the change. Positive Outcomes and Educator Perspectives Teachers and school administrators at the UCL Academy have reported numerous benefits and improvements in their students' behavior and performance since implementing the later start time. Pupils are more attentive during lessons and have increased focus and concentration. This heightened engagement in the educational process has led to a more dynamic classroom environment where students are active participants rather than passive listeners. Moreover, the change in schedule has also indirectly created a positive impact on students' mental health by allowing them adequate time to rest and recharge. The reduced levels of fatigue have helped them cope better with academic pressure, leading to a decline in stress-related issues. Future Directions and Implications The positive results experienced by the UCL Academy highlight the importance of considering individual students' needs when designing school schedules. As more schools around the world follow suit and experiment with later start times, researchers and educators will be keen to monitor their long-term impact on academic achievement, student well-being, and overall development. The potential benefits of a later school start time should encourage other institutions to reevaluate their current schedules and make adjustments that prioritize student health and optimal learning. By acknowledging and addressing the unique physiological and psychological challenges faced by teenage students, we can cultivate a more supportive educational environment that nurtures their growth and success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The domination, in that aria, of themes which will be repeated in the love duet make it clear that though the painting may incorporate the Marchesa's features, Tosca is the ultimate inspiration of his work. Cavaradossi's dialogue with Angelotti is interrupted by Tosca's arrival, signalled by her motif which incorporates, in Newman's words, \\"the feline, caressing cadence so characteristic of her.\\" Though Tosca enters violently and suspiciously, the music paints her devotion and serenity. According to Budden, there is no contradiction: Tosca's jealousy is largely a matter of habit, which her lover does not take too seriously.After Tosca's \\"Non la sospiri\\" and the subsequent argument inspired by her jealousy, the sensuous character of the love duet \\"Qual'occhio\\" provides what opera writer Burton Fisher describes as \\"an almost erotic lyricism that has been called pornophony\\". The brief scene in which the sacristan returns with the choristers to celebrate Napoleon's supposed defeat provides almost the last carefree moments in the opera; after the entrance of Scarpia to his menacing theme, the mood becomes sombre, then steadily darker. As the police chief interrogates the sacristan, the \\"fugitive\\" motif recurs three more times, each time more emphatically, signalling Scarpia's success in his investigation. In Scarpia's exchanges with Tosca the sound of tolling bells, interwoven with the orchestra, creates an almost religious atmosphere, for which Puccini draws on music from his then... answer the following question: What is the name of the person that wrote the Recondita armonia in a high B flat?

Justin Halpern, the Twitter celeb behind \\"#*! My Dad Says,\\" urges kids to read Studies suggest that consuming short blasts of information has led to Web-induced attention deficit, making today's youth more impulsive and impatient and far less likely to log off long enough to leap into the pages of a good book. So the irony is not lost on Justin Halpern that he has been enlisted to encourage kids to read. \\"I think I am part of the problem,\\" admitted Halpern, who created the popular Twitter feed that was turned into a bestselling memoir and a CBS comedy, \\"#*! My Dad Says,\\" starring William Shatner. \\"Scratch that,\\" Halpern said. \\"I would say I am definitely part of the problem.\\" Halpern, who found fame and good fortune on Twitter, realized just how short attention spans had become when he scanned a brief book review of the first 743-page volume of Mark Twain's autobiography, released 100 years after the author's death, which Halpern gave his dad for Christmas. \\"It was such a silly thing reading this 50-word review of this 4-pound book in my lap,\\" Halpern said. Halpern, along with spiritual advisor Deepak Chopra and celebrity chef Eric Ripert, contributed a compilation of books he enjoyed (David Mitchell's \\"Cloud Atlas\\" and Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle,\\" to name two) and books his dad reads (John Steinbeck and James Joyce are favorite authors) to Read for a Cause, a yearlong campaign from San Francisco Internet company Scribd.com to encourage other people to share their favorite books. The campaign benefits Room to Read, an international literacy organization that builds libraries in underserved communities. \\"There is so much media coming at kids before they are even able to process it. If they can just sit down and focus on a book, they can sit down and focus on a lot of things,\\" Halpern said. Samuel Halpern, a retired doctor from San Diego, bonded with his son over books. As a child, Justin would climb into his dad's lap for a few pages at bedtime. If Samuel Halpern wanted Justin to fall asleep quickly, he would read to him from Marshall McLuhan's \\"Understanding Media.\\" Justin was 7 at the time. There's no question that Samuel Halpern has enjoyed his son's success. He read his son's book published by Harper Collins and watches the TV show that's based on it. But his take on this generation's Internet fixation and on Twitter itself exceeds Twitter's 140-character limit by several orders of magnitude. \\"He thinks Twitter is the dumbest thing he has ever seen in his entire life,\\" Justin Halpern said. \\"The only reason I didn't put that up on Twitter as one of his quotes is that I felt like it was biting the hand that feeds me.\\" When moving in with your parents can land you a book deal When Father's Day gifts bomb From Twitter to CBS pilot: 'Stuff My Dad Says' to star William Shatner Photo (top): WIlliam Shatner plays Justin Halpern's dad on \\"#*!

They talked for 5 minutes. Now they were out of thing to discuss. Gina racked her brain but could find nothing to say. What happened next?","completion":"Step 1: Assess the situation Gina and Tami have exhausted their topics of conversation after talking for 5 minutes on the playground. They are now facing an awkward silence and are unsure of what to talk about next. Step 2: Introduce a new element to the story In order to make the story interesting and keep it moving, it is important to introduce a new element or event that can engage the two characters and provide them with something to discuss. Step 3: Relate the new element to the characters and their current situation To maintain a coherent story, the new element should be connected to Gina and Tami's current situation of being on the playground. Step 4: Develop the story with that new element in mind After considering the above steps, I come up with the following continuation of the story: Just when Gina thought they had completely run out of things to talk about, she spotted a group of kids playing an interesting game on the other side of the playground. It looked like some sort of combination of tag and hide-and-seek, and she thought it was a pretty clever innovation. Gina decided to seize the opportunity to bring up a new topic of conversation with Tami. \\"Hey Tami, have you ever seen that game the kids are playing over there?\\" Gina asked, pointing to the kids running around and hiding behind playground equipment. Tami squinted her eyes to see better and then shook her head. \\"No, I haven't. It looks pretty fun, though. Maybe they made up their own game!\\" This led to Gina and Tami discussing the various childhood games they used to play and how creative kids can be when left to their own devices. Gradually, their conversation began to flow naturally as they shared memories and even came up with new game ideas by combining their favorite childhood games. The awkward silence was now gone, and the two friends continued to chat while enjoying their time at the playground."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: I could not have said it better myself. Sentence 2: You put it in the best way possible. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"To determine whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, we need to analyze the meaning and implications of both sentences. Sentence 1: \\"I could not have said it better myself.\\" This sentence implies that the speaker believes someone has expressed an idea, opinion, or statement in an optimal or superior way. The speaker acknowledges that they personally could not have conveyed the message more effectively. Sentence 2: \\"You put it in the best way possible.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is praising someone for expressing a thought, opinion, or statement in the most optimal manner possible. The implication here is that there is no better way to convey the message than the one that the person used. Now, let's examine the entailment relationship between the two sentences. Entailment occurs when the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another. In other words, if sentence A entails sentence B, then whenever sentence A is true, sentence B must also be true. In this case, if Sentence 1 is true (i.e., the speaker could not have said it better themselves), it implies that someone else has expressed the idea in an exceptional way. This idea aligns with Sentence 2, where the speaker explicitly praises someone for expressing an idea in the best way possible. Given the analysis above, we can conclude that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. When the speaker says, \\"I could not have said it better myself,\\" it inherently suggests that the other person put it in the best way possible. Although the two sentences are different in structure, their meanings are closely related, revealing that the truth of the first statement guarantees the truth of the second."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yet foreign students,whether educated in British private schools or elsewhere,are decreasingly likely to go to English universities.According to the Higher Education Funding Council for England,307,200 overseas students began their studies in the country in 2012-13,down from 312,000 two years earlier and the first drop in 29 years.Student numbers from the rest of the European Union(EU)fell--probably a result of the increase in annual tuition fees in England from PS6,000(10,000)a year to PS9,000.But arrivals from India and Pakistan declined most sharply. In contrast to the visa system for private schools,which is extremely loose(the Home Office counts private schools as favoured sponsors),student visas have been tightened.Foreign students used to be allowed to work for up to two years after graduating.They now have only four months to find a job paying up to PS20,600 if they want to stay in Britain. This change was intended to deal with fake colleges offering two-year work visas.But it seems to have put off serious students too.Nick Hillman of the Higher Education Policy Institute says the government has sent unclear messages about the sort of immigration it wants to restrict.Australia and America,which have more relaxed entry criteria for students,are becoming more favoured destinations. Britain's student-visa system bas become more onerous overall.As a result,Britain is losing out to other countries in the contest for talent.Its unwelcoming attitude will harm its long-term development.And the drift of foreign students from leading British private schools to American colleges may have another, somewhat happier,consequence:America might become rather better at cricket .

Question: How did the French defend the Fortress of Louisbourg? Answer: The latter victory was marred when France's native allies broke the terms of capitulation and attacked the retreating British column, which was under French guard, slaughtering and scalping soldiers and taking captive many men, women and children while the French refused to protect their captives. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Although the response provides information about a specific event during which France defended the Fortress of Louisbourg, it does not fully answer the question of how the French defended the fortress in a general sense. To provide a more satisfactory answer, let's analyze the French defensive strategies and fortifications: Step 1: Study the fortress design The Fortress of Louisbourg was strategically designed for defense. Key elements included walls made of solid masonry, bastions for efficient cannon placement, and several gun batteries that prevent enemy ships from approaching the fortress. Step 2: Assess the garrison The presence of a well-trained French army garrison, including soldiers, sailors, and other personnel, also played a crucial role in defending the fortress. The total number of troops reinforced the defenses, deterring potential attacks. Step 3: Evaluate the geographical location The fortress's location on the eastern coast of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, coupled with its natural surroundings, provided additional defense. The rocky coast made it difficult for larger ships to get close, hindering enemy ground assaults, while the harbor entrance was narrow and guarded by powerful naval artillery. Step 4: Establish alliances The French maintained alliances with local native tribes, who provided valuable support during conflicts and skirmishes around the fortress. These alliances also gave the French an advantage in reconnaissance and intelligence gathering. Taking these steps into account, the French defended the Fortress of Louisbourg through a combination of fortress design, a well-maintained garrison, utilizing the advantageous geographical location, and establishing strategic alliances with native tribes in the region."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Question: \\"What are negative features of the women who want Scout to be more feminine?\\" Context: \\"Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\"\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Some negative features of the women who want Scout to be more feminine in the given context are: 1. They promote racist and classist points of view: The women who criticize Scout's lack of adherence to a feminine role often hold prejudiced beliefs. For instance, Mrs. Dubose not only chastises Scout for her appearance but also insults Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. 2. They uphold traditional gender roles: These women expect Scout to conform to the standard gender norms prevalent in their society. They criticize her for not wearing dresses and behaving in a manner they perceive as feminine, and try to pressure her into adhering to those expectations. 3. They can be judgmental and narrow-minded: These women judge Scout based on her appearance and behavior, without considering her unique qualities, independence, or intelligence. They seem to value conformity more than individualism. 4. They may lack empathy or understanding: The women who criticize Scout for not being feminine enough often do not take the time to understand her perspective, experiences, or reasons for her choices. They are quick to judge and dismiss her as a misfit without considering the complexities of her character and situation. Overall, the negative features of the women who want Scout to be more feminine include their prejudiced views, rigid adherence to traditional gender roles, judgmental attitudes, and lack of empathy. These characteristics ultimately clash with Scout's upbringing and the positive role models she has in Calpurnia and Miss Maudie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The first question is specifically about creating a landing page using Launchrock and linking it to a domain name, while the second question is about hosting a website page in general and linking it to a domain name. I will provide detailed answers to both questions. 1. Can I make a landing page with Launchrock and link it with my domain name? Yes, you can create a landing page with Launchrock and link it to your custom domain name. Launchrock is a platform that helps you build landing pages to collect email addresses and generate early interest in your products or services. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to create a landing page with Launchrock and link it to your domain name: Step 1: Sign up for Launchrock Visit the Launchrock website (https://www.launchrock.com/) and sign up for an account. You can choose from their free plan or opt for one of the paid plans for more features. Step 2: Create your landing page After signing up, you will be taken to the Launchrock dashboard. Click on \\"Create New Site\\" and choose a template for your landing page. Customize the template to match your preferences, including colors, fonts, images, and content. Be sure to preview your changes as you go. Step 3: Set up a custom domain To connect your landing page to your custom domain name, go to your Launchrock dashboard and select your site. Click on \\"Settings\\" and then \\"Domain,\\" where you will see an option to add a custom domain. Step 4: Configure your domain registrar Log into your domain registrar's account (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.). You will need to create a CNAME record that points your custom domain to Launchrock. The exact steps to create a CNAME record may vary depending on your registrar, but it typically involves navigating to the domain's DNS settings and adding a new record with a designated host and target. For Launchrock, the target should be \\"sites.launchrock.com.\\" Step 5: Verify your domain Once you have set up the CNAME record, return to the Launchrock dashboard and click on \\"Verify\\" in the custom domain settings. It may take some time for the domain to propagate, so if verification does not work immediately, wait a while and try again. Step 6: Publish your landing page When your custom domain is verified, you can publish your landing page by clicking on \\"Publish\\" at the top of the Launchrock dashboard. 2. How do I host a website page and link them to a domain name? To host a website and link it to a domain name, you will need a hosting provider, a domain registrar, and your website files. Here is a step-by-step guide: Step 1: Choose a hosting provider A hosting provider is a company that offers server space for storing your website files and makes them accessible to users on the internet. Some popular hosting providers include Bluehost, SiteGround, and HostGator. Choose a plan that suits your needs and sign up for an account. Step 2: Register a domain name A domain name is the URL that users will type into their browser to visit your website (e.g., www.example.com). You can register a domain name with a domain registrar like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains. Search for an available domain name and register it through your chosen registrar. Step 3: Connect your domain to your hosting provider To link your domain name to your hosting provider, you will need to update your domain's DNS settings. Log in to your domain registrar and look for the option to manage your domain's DNS settings. Update the nameservers to the ones provided by your hosting provider. This change may take some time to propagate, so be patient. Step 4: Upload your website files Once your domain is pointing to your hosting provider, log in to your hosting account and locate the file manager or FTP (File Transfer Protocol) access. Upload your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) to the appropriate directory on your hosting server, usually called \\"public_html\\" or \\"htdocs.\\" Step 5: Test your website Once your files are uploaded, visit your domain name in your web browser to ensure that your website is accessible and functioning as expected. In summary, while both questions are related to creating and hosting a website or landing page, the first question pertains specifically to using Launchrock for the process, whereas the second question addresses the general steps involved in hosting any website and linking it to a domain name."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Disclaimer: This is review is for the SUSHI BAR ONLY Went here last Saturday and stopped in for a quick bite at the sushi bar, mainly to try it out because I've heard so many good things about Nakama.

Two of the 4 rolls I ordered were loosely made which as a sushi lover I found to be kinda unacceptable. One had an end piece that frankly would have gotten the sushi chef a failing grade by anyone's standards - it was falling apart and had nothing but rice and paper on it despite this being a fairly pricey signature roll. One of my sushi pieces was similarly falling apart - the rice hadn't been packed enough and the salmon was just slapped on there. I would even have sent those back if I could have found a waitress or been able to hear myself think. They were just too crowded to give the proper amount of love to each dish, and as you know, a dish prepared without love is bound to be lacking. The noise and my seat in relation to the crowded door area just made me want to get out of there. I was bumped several times by people weaving their way past each other, at one point someone bumped my elbow as I was raising a cup of hot sake. Hmm ... a splash of hot sake? ... let's say it's not my favorite sensation in the crotch area. Anyway, the staff was friendly when you were able to flag someone down and I am sure everyone was doing their best, but think this place is highly overrated - making it over crowded - making the whole experience that much less enjoyable for everyone. Hope your experience is better than mine - the place should have been better from what I've been told by Nakama fans. Good luck!! Is this review positive or negative?","completion":"This review is negative.

Article: Should e-cigarettes (electronic cigarettes) be a new choice for the smokers trying to get rid of the habit? Reactions from Americans are mixed. More than half of the people questioned in a survey think e-cigarettes should be controlled by the US Food and Drug Administration, but 47 percent believe the e-cigarettes should be available to the smokers who want to quit. \\"In the hunt for a safter cigarette, e-cigarettes are becoming a popular choice among those either trying to quit.\\"or looking to replace standard tobacco smoke with an alternative that manufacturers claim to be safer, \\"Zogby International, which conducted the survey, said in a statement. About half of the 4,611 adults who took part in the survey had heard about e-cigarettes, which are battery-powered, or rechargeable cigarettes that vaporize a liquid nicotine solution. They do not produce smoke but a water vapor without smell. Sold mostly on the Internet, e-cigarettes were first made in China. Last year the World Health Organization (WHO) warned against using e-cigarettes, saying there was no evidence to prove they were safe or helped smokers break the habit. The WHO said people who smoke e-cigarettes breathe in a fine fog of nicotine into the lungs. Nearly a third of people questioned in the survey think that e-cigarettes should be allowed in places where smoking is forbidden, because they don't produce smoke, but 46 percent disagree. Men who were aware of the availability of e-cigarettes were more likely than woman to say they should be a choice available to smokers who want to quit. Young people, aged 18-29, and singles were the groups most open to trying e-cigarettes. Smoking is the single largest cause of preventable death worldwide, according to the WHO. Question: What do we know about e-cigarettes from the passage? Options: A: Most Americans are familiar with them. B: They are a good choice as there is no nicotine.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Drunken driving--sometimes called America's socially accepted form of murder--has become a national epidemic . Every hour of every day about three Americans on average are killed by drunken drivers, adding up to an incredible 250,000 over the past ten years. A drunken driver is usually defined as one with a 0.10 blood alcohol content or roughly three beers, glasses of wine or several glasses of whisky drunk within two hours. Heavy drinking used to be an acceptable part of the American manly image and judges were serious in most courts, but the drunken slaughter has recently caused so many well-publicized tragedies, especially involving young children, that public opinion is no longer so tolerant. Twenty states have raised the legal drinking age to 21, reversing a trend in the 1960s to reduce it to 18. After New Jersey lowered it to 18, the number of people killed by 18-20-year-old drivers more than doubled, so the state recently upped it back to 21. Reformers, however, fear raising the drinking age will have little effect unless accompanied by educational programs to help young people to develop \\"responsible attitudes\\" about drinking and teach them to resist peer pressure to drink. Though new laws have led to increased arrests and tests and, in many areas already, to a marked decline in accidents, some states are also punishing bars for serving customers too many drinks. A bar in Massachusetts was fined for serving six or more double brandies to a customer who \\"obviously drunk\\" and later drove off the road, killing a nine-year-old boy. As the accidents continue to occur daily in every state, some Americans are even beginning to speak well of the 13 years of national prohibition of alcohol that began in 1919, what President Hoover called the \\"noble experiment\\". They forgot that legal prohibition didn't stop drinking, but encouraged political corruption and organized crime. As with the booming drug trade generally, there is no easy solution. Question: What can be inferred from the fact of the traffic accidents in New Jersey? - The legal drinking age should be raised. - Young drivers were usually bad. - Most drivers hoped to raise the legal drinking age. - Drivers should not be allowed to drink. A:","completion":"The best answer that can be inferred from the fact of the traffic accidents in New Jersey is: The legal drinking age should be raised.

(CNN) -- It was in the majestic surroundings of Muirfield that the original gold-plated superstar of golf secured his first major title. The small town of Gullane to the east of Edinburgh that is all set to welcome the modern titans of the game for the 142nd staging of the British Open played host to a true pioneer back in 1896. Harry Vardon won a total of six British Open titles, a record that still stands, but his achievements in the game stretch far beyond his haul of majors, which was lifted to seven by his 1900 U.S. Open triumph. Had someone won seven or even six Opens we wouldn't have had OPTIONS: - America as a God. - British Open as a God. - CNN as a God. - Edinburgh as a God. - God as a God. - Gullane as a God. - Harry Vardon as a God. - Muirfield as a God. - Open as a God. - Peter Thompson as a God. - U.S. Open as a God. - Vardon as a God.","completion":"The most logical completion to this passage using the given options would be \\"Harry Vardon as a God\\". The argument goes something like this: The entire passage discusses the sport of golf and focuses particularly on the exploits of Harry Vardon. Vardon is hailed as a champion for winning six British Open titles, a record that still stands, and his other major achievements, most notably his U.S. Open victory in 1900. The sentence \\"Had someone won seven or even six Opens we wouldn't have had\\" is a speculative statement and is missing an ending that aligns with the context of the passage. The context clues provided throughout the extract suggest that the passage is looking to compare or contrast another entity or individual with the achievements of Harry Vardon. None of the other options, such as 'America', 'CNN', or 'Edinburgh', are appropriate, as they have nothing to do with golf championships, which is the central theme of the passage. Therefore, when considering the context of golf and the major achievements in the British Open, the most logical completion would be \\"Had someone won seven or even six Opens we wouldn't have had Harry Vardon as a God.\\" This would suggest that if someone else had matched or surpassed Vardon's achievements, Vardon might not have been held in such high esteem. His extraordinary record set him apart, and had someone else achieved as much, his legacy might not have been as profound, festooned with an almost deific reverence, hence the use of the term 'God'."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question: Process: - The air is cold - Water is in the air - The water forms tiny ice crystals - The ice crystals collide with each other - The ice crystals stick to each other - The ice crystals get bigger as more of them stick together - The ice crystals get too heavy to be in the air - The ice crystals become snowflakes - The snow flakes fall to the ground as snow. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose air is more cold happens, how will it affect less ice crystals stick together. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation, which is the air becoming even colder, may have an effect, both direct and indirect, on the process of ice crystals sticking together. Step-by-step justification: 1. The air is colder than before: In the perturbation hypothesis, the air is assumed to be colder than in the initial process. This change may affect how water particles interact in the air. 2. Water is still in the air: The fact that water remains in the air doesn't change, but the colder temperature may influence the rate at which water molecules join together to form ice crystals. 3. Ice crystals forming: Colder air may cause ice crystals to form more quickly, as water particles will be more likely to freeze upon contact with other particles due to the lower temperature. 4. Ice crystals colliding with each other: The increased rate of ice crystal formation may lead to more frequent collisions between ice crystals, affecting how they stick together. 5. Ice crystals sticking together: The perturbation hypothesis suggests that fewer ice crystals will stick together in colder air. This could be due to the colder air causing the outer surfaces of ice crystals to freeze more quickly, making it harder for them to bond with other ice crystals. 6. Ice crystals getting bigger: With fewer ice crystals sticking together, there may be smaller snowflakes formed, potentially affecting the overall appearance and volume of snowfall. 7. Ice crystals becoming too heavy: The ice crystals or snowflakes still eventually become too heavy to remain in the air and will fall to the ground. 8. Snowfall: The snowflakes will still fall to the ground as snow, but the perturbation might result in changes to the appearance, size, or volume of the snowfall due to the altered behavior of ice crystals in colder air. So, the perturbation of colder air does have an effect on the process leading to the formation of snow, mainly through altering the behavior of ice crystals and how they stick together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Baran Movie plot: It is winter in Teheran. Lateef is 17. He works at a building construction site managed by MEMAR, the site foreman. Lateef's job is to serve tea and prepare food for the workers with whom he is always quarrelling. The workers come from all parts of Iran, particularly from Iranian Azerbaijan (Azeris are referred as \\"Turks\\" in the film). Some workers are Afghan refugees from war-torn Afghanistan. They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide. As the story starts, an Afghan worker, NAJAF, falls from the building and breaks his leg. He is taken to the hospital. The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds. From then on his attitude changes completely; he becomes protective, helpful and gradually desperately in love with Rahmat. While Rahmat does not express herself verbally at all, over time she seems to respond to this love. During a surprise visit of the labour inspectors, they find themselves face to face with Rahmat. She panics and runs away, as they chase her through the city streets. Lateef runs after them, struggling with the inspectors while Rahmat flees. Lateef is beaten and taken to the police station. Now Memar must pay a fine, comply with the law, and lay off all illegal Afghan workers. Lateef can't bear Rahmat's absence, and decides to locate Soltan to get some news of her. He goes to the village where the Afghans live, walks around, meets an enigmatic cobbler, and ends up in the courtyard of a shrine near a graveyard...","completion":"Based on the movie plot of Baran, it does not explicitly mention Lateef refusing money. However, his actions and motivations throughout the film suggest that his primary concern is not about money, but rather his feelings towards Rahmat and his desire to help and protect her. Lateef's decision to locate Soltan to get news about Rahmat also indicates that his focus is more on Rahmat's wellbeing than on his own financial gain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- As the Olympic flame burned above Sochi on Tuesday evening, a scene of mayhem and death exploded a few hundred miles away in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, where blazes roared and violent clashes erupted along protesters' barricades. At least 100 people were killed just on Thursday and hundreds more hospitalized in confrontations pitting government forces against demonstrators opposed to a regime that has strong support from President Vladimir Putin's Russia. It was the deadliest day in the three months since the showdown started. Between the two spectacles, you can bet Putin's attention focused more sharply on the crisis in Ukraine, which is officially an independent country since 1991 but in reality remains a state over which Moscow exercises enormous influence, infuriating much of Ukraine's population. To Putin, staging a successful","completion":"Olympics in Sochi represented a showcase for Russia's resurgence as a global power and a confirmation of his strong leadership. He was counting on the world's attention to be on the sporting events and the achievements of the athletes, not on the escalating unrest in a neighboring country. However, the violence in Kiev and the rising death toll were impossible to ignore. Just as the Sochi Olympics were about to end, the crisis in Ukraine reached a boiling point, with protesters not only demanding the ousting of then-President Viktor Yanukovych, who had strong ties to Moscow, but also seeking closer ties with the European Union. In the days following the bloodshed, the Ukrainian parliament voted to remove President Yanukovych from office and issued a warrant for his arrest on charges of \\"mass murder of peaceful citizens.\\" Yanukovych fled to Russia, where he was granted protection. The events in Ukraine forced Putin to shift his focus from Sochi's Olympics to a political crisis that threatened his influence in the region. In response to the turmoil, Putin took a series of aggressive measures, including the annexation of Crimea, a region in Ukraine with a predominantly ethnic Russian population, in March 2014. The move sparked international outrage and sanctions against Russia. Forced to manage the crisis in Ukraine, Putin sought to achieve the following objectives: 1. Regain control over Crimea and assert Russian influence in the region. 2. Prevent Ukraine from moving closer to the European Union and Western alliances, which he perceived as a threat to Russia's national security. 3. Maintain Russia's strategic Black Sea fleet based in Crimea. 4. Bolster nationalist sentiment in Russia and reinforce his image as a strong and decisive leader. The situation in Ukraine deteriorated further, as pro-Russian separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk declared independence from Ukraine and engaged in a conflict with Ukrainian forces. This fueled a prolonged and bloody war that has claimed thousands of lives and displaced over a million civilians. The tension between Russia and the West was further exacerbated by the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 in July 2014 over eastern Ukraine, which killed 298 people. International investigators concluded that the plane was shot down by a Russian-supplied missile. Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement and blamed Ukraine for the tragedy. Despite efforts by the international community to find a diplomatic solution, the conflict in Ukraine remains unresolved. Due to Russia's annexation of Crimea and the ongoing fighting in eastern Ukraine, Putin's role on the global stage has been characterized by increasing tension and discord with Western powers, which has led to a new era of geopolitical rivalry. In conclusion, the most logical completion of the news story highlights how the Sochi Olympics' success was overshadowed by the escalating crisis in Ukraine, which forced Putin to focus on securing Russian interests in the region. The ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kyiv has had significant geopolitical repercussions, causing the unraveling of relations between Russia and the West, and shaping the international landscape in a manner reminiscent of the Cold War."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Eliot Ness, a young and ambitious federal agent, is determined to bring Capone and his empire down. With the support of his elite team of agents known as The Untouchables, Ness sets his sights on orchestrating a massive liquor raid to cripple Capone's operation. Ness and his team spend months gathering intelligence, planning the raid, and preparing for the inevitable confrontation with Capone's gang. Unbeknownst to them, however, two corrupt policemen, Officers Martin O'Connell and Samuel \\"Slick\\" Thompson, have infiltrated The Untouchables and are secretly working for Capone. As the day of the raid approaches, tensions between The Untouchables and Capone's gang escalate. Several violent encounters occur between Ness' team and Capone's gang members, creating a volatile atmosphere in the city. With so much riding on the success of the raid, Ness remains focused, yet unaware of the betrayal lurking in the shadows. On the eve of the raid, O'Connell and Thompson rendezvous with one of Capone's lieutenants. They provide him with detailed information on the raid's plans, including the exact location, time, and personnel involved. Capone, now tipped off, is prepared for the raid and devises a counter-strategy to ambush The Untouchables. The following day, Ness and his team move forward with the raid, completely unaware of the danger that awaits them. As they enter the warehouse, they are greeted by an eerie silence. Suddenly, gunfire erupts from all directions, revealing that Capone's gang had lain in wait. In the chaos, several of The Untouchables are killed or injured, forcing Ness and the remaining agents to retreat.

Article: Bamboo plants are typically classified as clumping bamboo, running bamboo, or reeds. Reeds are rarely planted in yards, if ever, so you can expect to deal with either clumping or running bamboo. Running bamboo sends out rhizomes, which spread into other areas, causing the plant to become invasive. Clumping bamboo grows in tight clusters and rarely spreads out over larger areas. Most bamboo varieties do best in tropical climates, but if you live in a somewhat cooler area, there are a few hardier varieties you can attempt to grow with some success. If you living in warmer hardiness zones, like zones 7 through 10, a few good choices might be Bambusa multiplex ‘Alphonse Karr’, Borinda boliana, and Phyllostachys nigra. The first two are clump bamboo types, while the last is running bamboo. For slightly cooler climates, like those found in hardiness zones 5 and 6, try the clumping type Fargesia dracocephala ‘Rufa’ or the running type Pleioblastus viridistriatus. Bamboo needs a great deal of sun, so you should usually pick a spot in your yard that receives 8 or more hours of sun daily. Note that some tropical species do require shade during the hottest parts of the day, however. Shade can be especially important during winter. The combination of frost and direct sunlight can dehydrate the plant quickly. As such, if you live in an area that receives frost during winter, you should opt for a spot that receives partial shade instead of one with direct sun. While bamboo can do well in many types of soil, it does best in loam or marly soils. Improve your odds of success by digging and mixing in amendments to the soil before planting. Work garden compost or manure into the soil to provide it with additional nutrients. Ideally, the compost should be worked into the bottom of the transplant hole so that the bamboo roots sit on top of it. Loam soil is a mixture of five parts topsoil composted with two parts sand, two parts silt, and one part clay. Avoid rocky or soggy soils, as well as soils that are relatively impermeable. Bamboo has a shallow root system, yet it also grows tall and fast. As a result, it can easily get damaged by strong winds. You will need a barrier to prevent this from happening. The easiest way to protect your bamboo is to position them behind garden hedges or trees. Otherwise, you might need to build a fence around the area. If you are planting running bamboo, you will need to construct a barrier to prevent the bamboo from invading other parts of your yard. After determining the area in which you want to confine the bamboo, install barriers of sheet metal or concrete around the perimeter. These barriers should be 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) deep. What is a summary?","completion":"Bamboo plants are mainly classified into clumping and running varieties, with the latter being invasive due to their spreading rhizomes.

I have a new situation: Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data. But I can use this background: Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost.

The JAA was an associated body of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC), which aimed to facilitate cooperation among its member states to develop and implement common safety regulatory standards and procedures in civil aviation. The primary purpose of the JAA was to harmonize civil aviation regulations across European member states to create a safer, more efficient, and integrated European aviation system. Although the JAA was not a direct regulatory body itself, it achieved regulation through its member authorities who were responsible for civil aviation regulations within their respective nations. This collaborative approach allowed the JAA to work on various aspects of aviation safety, such as aircraft design and maintenance, flight operations, and air traffic management, sharing knowledge and expertise among member states in a mutually beneficial manner. The establishment of the JAA demonstrated an agreement among the participating European states to work together on a common platform, with the primary objective of enhancing the safety, efficiency, and overall performance of their civil aviation industries. By jointly developing and implementing safety regulations and procedures, these European states were able to share resources, knowledge, and experience, which would contribute to better understanding and management of potential risks and challenges in the field of civil aviation. In summary, it is accurate to conclude that a number of European States agreed to the formation of the Joint Aviation Authorities, as this body enabled them to collaborate and establish common safety regulatory standards and procedures in civil aviation, ultimately leading to a more integrated and safer European aviation system. However, it is important to note that the JAA has since been replaced by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which now serves as the central regulatory body for civil aviation within the European Union."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She had been dropping hints to her friends and family about how desperately she wanted it, but no one seemed to notice. Step 1: Understand the context of the text First, I made sure to understand that the text is discussing a gift that Angela and Erin received. Angela is more thankful for it, and the text is aiming to provide the reasons as to why that is the case. Step 2: Develop a reason for Angela's higher gratitude To continue the text, I needed to provide a valid reason as to why Angela has a higher level of gratitude for the gift than Erin does. So, I decided to mention that Angela had been longing for this gift and had been trying to communicate her desires subtly. Step 3: Add an element of intrigue To make the story more engaging and elicit more empathy for Angela's character, I described her unsuccessful attempts at informing others about her wishes, contributing to her increased appreciation for the gift. Step 4: Review and ensure continuity In order to make certain that the response is consistent and follows the intended context, I verified if my continuation fits the storyline and provides a satisfactory answer while not deviating from the original intent. As a result, when Angela finally received the gift, her joy was indescribable. She couldn't help but wear the brightest smile on her face, her eyes sparkling with immense gratitude. In comparison, Erin was appreciative of the gift but, unlike Angela, it wasn't something she had been wishing for. It was more of a pleasant surprise for her, rather than an answer to her heartfelt desires. Step 5: Provide contrast for Erin's reaction To emphasize the disparity in their gratitude for the gift, I showcased Erin's reaction as appreciative but lacking the intensity of Angela's response. This paints a clearer picture of the difference in their levels of thankfulness and the reasons behind it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I dipped the cookies but not the cakes in milk because the","completion":"cakes were made with a delicate sponge and rich chocolate ganache, each layer carefully balanced to create the perfect indulgence. Dipping them in milk would only disturb their exquisite composition, whereas the crisp, dense cookies would become pleasingly tender when soaked. As I continued my little teatime ritual, I couldn't help but think about the love and care that went into creating these delightful treats. The cookies were a handed-down family recipe, hard and crumbly, studded with sweet raisins and buttery pecans. They had been a steadfast standby of my childhood, whipped up for any special occasion or a late-night snack shared between family members. The cakes, on the other hand, were a new creation from a local bakery, born of a daring idea and the passion of a novice baker turned entrepreneur. The novel combination of flavors and textures captured the imagination of those in my town, and it soon became an object of fascination to behold and consume. Despite the differences in their origin stories and composition, both treats held a special place in my heart. The cookies and cakes embodied the values of tradition and innovation, two elements that had always motivated me to push my boundaries and explore new avenues of personal growth. With each nibble, I contemplated the story behind each dessert and the broader lessons I could take from them. I ruminated on the importance of preserving time-honored customs, like regularly gathering with family and friends to break bread. At the same time, I also cherished the ambitious spirit of risk-taking and progress that the cakes represented. Like the young baker who dared to make his mark on the world, I too yearned to leave my comfort zone and see how my own passions could transform not only my life, but also the lives of those around me. It was with these thoughts swirling in my mind that I began to notice a faint melody drifting through the air, the sweet notes of a piano beckoning me to pause and take in the moment. Feeling oddly inspired, I carefully set aside my plate, letting the tune guide me into the living room where the glistening keys of our grand piano awaited. With a reverent touch, I slowly pressed my fingers against the ivory, letting my intuition guide my actions. At first, the music I created was hesitant, just as I had been when contemplating the blend of tradition and innovation in the treats I enjoyed earlier. But as I continued to play, my confidence grew, and the notes began to find their own voice, becoming bolder and more assured. As I continued to play, I began to realize that, just like the treats on my plate, the melody that I was creating was a captivating blend of the familiar and the unexpected. I was finding a unique harmony in the moment as I allowed tradition and innovation to dance together in a tune that was all my own, and, as the music crescendoed, I realized that I had embraced the best of both worlds. The harmony of cookies and cakes, the interplay of family recipes and bold new ideas, had granted me insight into a critical truth—an understanding that honoring the past could gracefully coexist with embracing the future, that our foundation in tradition can nourish the seeds of our growth, and that we are all limited only by the breadth of our own dreams, creativity, and courage. As the last note of my impromptu recital hung in the air, I found myself uplifted by this newfound wisdom, and filled with a sense of gratitude for the cookies and cakes that had brought me to this moment of ephemeral clarity. For it is in these small, seemingly insignificant moments of sweetness that we can often find the most transformative and lasting inspiration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This low-budget erotic thriller that has some good points, but a lot more bad one. The plot revolves around a female lawyer trying to clear her lover who is accused of murdering his wife. Being a soft-core film, that entails her going undercover at a strip club and having sex with possible suspects. As plots go for this type of genre, not to bad. The script is okay, and the story makes enough sense for someone up at 2 AM watching this not to notice too many plot holes. But everything else in the film seems cheap. The lead actors aren't that bad, but pretty much all the supporting ones are unbelievably bad (one girl seems like she is drunk and/or high). The cinematography is badly lit, with everything looking grainy and ugly. The sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people are saying. The worst thing in this movie is the reason you're watching it-the sex. The reason people watch these things is for hot sex scenes featuring really hot girls in Red Shoe Diary situations. The sex scenes aren't hot they're sleazy, shot in that porno style where everything is just a master shot of two people going at it. The woman also look like they are refuges from a porn shoot. I'm not trying to be rude or mean here, but they all have that breast implants and a burned out/weathered look. Even the title, \\"Deviant Obsession\\", sounds like a Hardcore flick. Not that I don't have anything against porn - in fact I love it. But I want my soft-core and my hard-core separate. What ever happened to actresses like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lovell, Shannon Whirry and Kim Dawson? Women that could act and who would totally arouse you? And what happened to B erotic thrillers like Body Chemistry, Nighteyes and even Stripped to Kill. Sure, none of these where masterpieces, but at least they felt like movies. Plus, they were pushing the envelope, going beyond Hollywood's relatively prude stance on sex, sexual obsessions and perversions. Now they just make hard-core films without the hard-core sex. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"The review is mostly negative towards the movie. While it acknowledges some good points, such as the plot and the lead actors, it heavily criticizes the supporting actors, cinematography, sound quality, and unappealing sex scenes.

In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted. Paragraph: Jake and Todd used different farming methods to produce their crops.

In fact, the premise provides evidence that directly contradicts this hypothesis. From the premise, we can gather a number of pieces of information: 1. Dark rings have formed under the woman's eyes: This is an indicator that something may be wrong with the woman. Dark circles or rings under the eyes can be a sign of various issues, such as fatigue, stress, or illness, which may reasonably cause Jon concern. 2. The eyes themselves nearly sent Jon into a panic: This statement alone contradicts the hypothesis that Jon wasn't worried about her eyes. When something causes a person to nearly panic, it is an indication that the situation is causing a significant amount of distress or worry. If Jon's reaction was close to bordering on panic, it is safe to say that he was extremely worried about her eyes. 3. The overall tone of the premise suggests concern: When analyzing the statement as a whole, the language used suggests a tone of worry and alarm. Words like \\"dark rings,\\" \\"nearly sent,\\" and \\"panic\\" all evoke a sense of anxiety and concern on Jon's part, further disproving the hypothesis that Jon wasn't worried about her eyes. So, based on the premise, we can confidently conclude that Jon was indeed worried about the woman's eyes, and the original hypothesis, \\"Jon wasn't worried about her eyes,\\" is false."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If canyon changes are tracked with pins, then how do we track canyon changes? Answer choices: - LEDs - wind - forces - river - slow - Pins - Raft - three A:","completion":"To track canyon changes, we can use pins as markers to identify and document specific locations and features within the canyon. Here is a step-by-step process of how to do this: 1. Determine the specific locations and features that need to be tracked within the canyon. These could include geological formations, the canyon walls, or specific points where changes are most likely to occur (e.g., erosion or deposition areas). 2. Obtain a sufficient number of pins that can be placed into the ground or rock surfaces. Ensure the pins are durable, weather-resistant, and easily visible for tracking purposes. 3. Make sure you have the necessary tools and equipment to properly place the pins, such as hammers or drills, depending on the type of surface. 4. Carefully place the pins at the predetermined locations, making sure to record their position accurately. It is important to ensure that the pins do not cause any harm to the environment or disturb any local habitats. 5. Develop a system for monitoring and documenting any changes in the canyon. This could include regular visits to the pinned locations, recording measurements, or taking photographs to visually document any differences over time. 6. Periodically analyze the collected data to identify any trends or significant changes. This information can then be used to inform environmental conservation efforts, geological research, or safety measures within the canyon. By using pins to track canyon changes, we can monitor and document both short-term and long-term alterations to the environment and better understand the underlying forces, such as river erosion or geological processes, that contribute to these changes."},{"prompt":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Options: - youngstock - aged - mature - old - senior Explain why a human would choose \\"old\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human might choose \\"old\\" to answer the question above for several reasons. Firstly, the question seems to be inquiring about the age of the man being referred to, and the choices provided are all related to age. Therefore, in this context, \\"old\\" seems like the most fitting option. Here's a deeper analysis of each option and why \\"old\\" might be the most suitable choice for a human: 1. Youngstock: This term typically applies to young animals, particularly in the context of livestock. It does not accurately describe the age of a person and would not make sense in this context. 2. Aged: Although this term could technically be used to describe an older individual, it tends to have a more formal and less specific connotation. In this context, \\"old\\" is more concise and directly reflects the idea that the young lady might be particularly interested in the man's wealth and not concerned with his age. 3. Mature: This term generally implies an individual who is fully grown and has a developed sense of responsibility. Although it suggests that the person is not youthful, it does not provide a clear indication of their age. \\"Old\\" would be a better choice to emphasize the potential age difference and the fact that the young lady did not care about it. 4. Old: This term is straightforward and clearly indicates that the man in question is advanced in age. It matches the context of the question, and it reveals the young lady's priorities, which were centered on his wealth rather than his age. Choosing \\"old\\" paints a clearer picture of the situation and the young lady's motivations. 5. Senior: While this term does signify age as well, it can be somewhat ambiguous when applied to humans. It might refer to both elderly people and those holding higher or leadership positions, such as in a company or a family. In this case, \\"old\\" provides a clearer understanding of the man's specific age, which is the focus of the question. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"old\\" to answer the question above because it directly aligns with the context of the question and provides the most accurate description of the man's age. It also helps underline the young lady's indifference to his age, as her main concern was his wealth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The basic punches include hooks, jabs, straights, and uppercuts. You'll also want to learn basic push and roundhouse kicks. In grappling, you'll want to learn the different positions and how to do basic moves like armbars, triangle chokes, and the rear naked choke. Practice mastering these basic techniques before advancing to more elaborate techniques. Going to class regularly will keep your skills sharp and can keep you in shape. Try not to take too much time off in between classes when you're starting off. Go to at least three classes per week and then pace yourself to see how many classes you feel comfortable going to each week. While being sore is natural, you don't want to overdo it. When you get physically fatigued, overly sore, or injured, take time off from training and let your body recover. If you don't let your body recover from training, you can become weaker and less focused. Fatigue, weakness, decreased performance, and constant muscle soreness are signs of overtraining. Sparring is the portion of your training when you get to test your technique on a fellow classmate. Don't be scared to exchange punches and kicks with your classmate. When sparring, go in with an end goal in mind, like scoring a flush roundhouse kick or working to improve your distance making with your jab. Work on perfecting the basics on a moving target, and remember to pace yourself. The goal of sparring is to perfect your technique, not to hurt your opponent. It's good manners to shake your opponent's hand before and after sparring. Sparring partners will often try to match your intensity, so expect to get what you give. Rolling is when you practice your grappling techniques on a classmate without incorporating strikes. Grappling and wrestling can be grueling, and it takes a lot of endurance, so take your time and pace yourself. Practice getting out of tough situations, gaining superior positioning, and trying various submissions. Even though training and practicing technique is essential, it's also important that you work to improve your strength and endurance. Squats, deadlifts, and bench presses combined with regular sprinting, jump rope, and stretching will make you stronger, quicker, and more flexible. Designate one or two days a week in your training to work on your strength and conditioning along with your technique training. Make sure to check with the local governing body for fighting sports in your state before you sign up to compete so that you're aware of all rules and regulations. Typically when you're ready to fight, your gym or trainer will help you register for an organized competition. Talk to them and make a decision on which kind of competition or fight you want to compete in. Keep track of the things you're eating by writing down the different meals that you have throughout the day and counting your calorie and nutrient intake. You'll want to hydrate yourself and maintain a diet that's high in protein and carbohydrates. If you're training heavily, try to maintain a diet of 1 gram (0.035 oz) of carbs and protein per pound that you weigh. Your diet should also contain plenty of omega-3 fats and traditional vitamins and minerals.

Regularly attend classes, preferably at least three times a week, and allow your body to recover from intense training to avoid overtraining. Incorporate sparring and rolling sessions to practice techniques on live opponents while maintaining good sportsmanship. Alongside technique training, work on strength and endurance through exercises like squats, deadlifts, sprints, and jump rope, designating specific days for conditioning.

It was bad enough that America was at war, but the young Virginia girl was not used to battles being fought this close. _ .Annie sat up in bed and listened.Had a stranger broken in? Earlier, the family had heard that captured officers recently escaped from a prison nearby. Quietly opening her bedroom door, Annie walked out. A figure in a black gown was walking down the hall. It was Aunt Bet, carrying a candle in one hand and a plate of fried chicken in the other. Annie followed her aunt to a stairway at the far end of the house. Aunt Bet climbed to the top, and opened a door leading to the attic . Annie followed closely behind. In the attic, Aunt Bet stopped at a chest of drawers, moved it aside, and felt along the wall behind it. Slowly a door sprang open, revealing a hidden room. A thin man stepped out of the opening. As Aunt Bet handed him the plate of food, the young man saw Annie in the doorway and froze. Desperately shaking her head \\"no\\", the girl raised one finger to her lips. The officer understood and shifted his look. Quickly Annie went back downstairs and hid, waiting until after Aunt Bet left to return. Back inside the attic,Annie called softly to the man inside, who told her where to find the hidden spring. Soon the young officer stood in the open doorway. A small candle burned on a table behind him and, in its soft light, Annie studied his face. Clear eyes reflected the calm of one who faced death bravely. Smiling, he said,\\"What trouble you should have gotten into if your aunt had turned around!\\" That night, Annie learned Aunt Bet was one of many daring Southerners whose hatred of slavery drove them to risk their lives by spying for the North.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer. No doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy.

Write a text based on this summary: irish vote on budget eu says crisis pot is enough Text:","completion":"Title: Irish Voters Approve Budget Amidst EU Assurances on Crisis Fund Adequacy The Irish citizens have recently cast their votes on the country's budget, showcasing their active participation in shaping the nation's economic future amidst a critical period marked by financial tensions within the Eurozone. This significant event has emerged in parallel with the European Union's latest assertion that the existing crisis funds would sufficiently support its member countries in overcoming any economic challenges they may face moving forward. Ireland has long struggled with various economic crises, especially in the aftermath of the 2008 global recession. With an immense sovereign debt burden and the nationalization of several banks, the nation faced considerable hurdles in its path to recovery. The Irish government has been working tirelessly to address these issues and restore the robust growth that characterized the Celtic Tiger era. The recently-held vote on the national budget is a crucial step in this process, as it allowed the citizens of Ireland to voice their opinions on the country's financial priorities and the best course of action to remediate the outstanding economic concerns. The outcome of this vote will not only impact Ireland's trajectory in the short term but will also shape its long-term prospects in the broader European context. Meanwhile, the European Union has stepped forward to assuage fears that a major financial crisis would leave member states with insufficient aid. It has reassured its member countries that the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), a fund established to provide financial assistance to Eurozone countries in need, possesses ample resources to help any member state address and overcome its economic challenges. This message of confidence has served as an important source of optimism for countries like Ireland, which continue to grapple with the ramifications of past financial crises. Moreover, the EU's assertion reinforces its commitment to maintaining the stability of the Euro as the common currency. By ensuring that the ESM is adequately funded, the European Union seeks to reinforce the notion that it stands ready to protect and support the economic integrity of the Eurozone, even in times of significant financial turmoil. This, in turn, allows the member states to focus on finding ways to bolster their national economies, safe in the knowledge that the European Union remains a stable support network. In conclusion, the recent Irish vote on the nation's budget represents an important milestone in the nation's journey towards economic recovery, with greater public involvement and European Union assurances fostering a positive outlook for the future. The European Union's declaration that the ESM is sufficiently funded to tackle potential crises further strengthens the EU's role as a stabilizing force in times of financial uncertainty. As the Eurozone continues its path towards growth, the collaboration between individual member states, like Ireland, and the broader European community will be crucial in fostering sustained prosperity on a transnational level."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The new sultan Ahmed I who was 13 years old appointed Cigalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha as the commander of the eastern army who marched from Istanbul 15 June 1604, a very late time for the campaigning season. Until he reached the front on 8 November 1604, the Safavid army had already captured Yerevan in June and advanced towards Kars before being stopped in Akhaltsikhe. Seeing the late season as an excuse, he did not counter-attack Abbas I and decided to stay in Van until the end of the winter. However, the Safavid advance forced him to march towards Erzurum. The inactivity created unrest among the Turkish ranks. His campaign of 1605 was unsuccessful, the forces he led towards Tabriz suffering defeat near the shore of Lake Urmia on 9 September 1605. This was the first Safavid pitched victory against the Ottomans in their history. In this battle Abbas I utilized his predominantly cavalry force to great advantage, decisively defeating the Ottomans, who suffered some 20,000 dead.

Given the question: Given the background: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators. and the situation: Pam and Ellie are two entomologists. they are both studying ants at the moment: Ellie is studying leafcutter ants, while Pam is studying ants that farm aphids. Answer the following question: Which scientist read less about dairying ants milking the aphids? The answer is:","completion":"Ellie read less about dairying ants milking the aphids. Both Pam and Ellie are entomologists studying ants; however, their focus is on different types of ants. Pam is specifically studying ants that farm aphids, which involves the mutualistic relationship between aphids and ants, including the milking behavior. This means that Pam would need to extensively research and observe the interactions between ants and aphids, including how dairying ants milk aphids for honeydew. On the other hand, Ellie is focusing on leafcutter ants. Leafcutter ants do not farm aphids nor engage in the mutualistic relationship involving milking aphids. Instead, leafcutter ants are known for their fungus-farming behavior, where they collect plant material and use it to cultivate a symbiotic fungus as a food source. Therefore, Ellie's research would likely focus more on the behaviors related to leaf cutting, fungus cultivation, and the complex social structure within leafcutter ant colonies, rather than the interactions between ants and aphids. As a result, it can be concluded that Ellie, who is studying leafcutter ants, read less about dairying ants milking the aphids compared to Pam, who is specifically studying ants that farm aphids."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Breistroff, a Harvard graduate, was a professional hockey player with a promising career. Snow worked for a hedge fund in New York City. On July 17, 1996, their lives changed forever. Breistroff boarded TWA Flight 800 bound for his native France on his way to Germany to play professional hockey. \\"He called me, and he told me he was getting on the plane. And he asked me to marry him on the phone before he got on the plane,\\" Snow told CNN the next day. Twelve minutes after takeoff from JFK Airport, the plane exploded in midair off the coast of Long Island. Two hundred thirty passengers were on board. No one survived. \\"After we said our final 'I love yous' ... about two hours later, my mom called,\\" Snow recalled recently. \\"She said, 'Please tell me that Michel didn't go to Paris tonight.'\\" Snow immediately turned on the TV. \\"I just remember fire and really dark water. And at that point, my life stood still,\\" she said. \\"He was strong, he was young, and he definitely swam to shore. And I held on to that hope. And then the next morning it became a recovery mission.\\" About five weeks later, Snow's greatest fear was confirmed when Breistroff's remains were recovered from the bottom of the ocean. \\"One of the hardest things for me was just going home,\\" she said. \\"Everybody is resuming life as normal but I had a huge hole in my heart, and I had a future planned with somebody and that was gone.\\" Snow looked for a support group in New York City but couldn't find one. She spoke with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and he suggested she attend a meeting with families from Pan Am Flight 103, which had exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, eight years earlier. \\"When I walked in the room, it was the first time I didn't have to apologize for my tears. They didn't have to say a word. They got it,\\" she said. Snow met a woman who lost her fiancé on the Pan Am flight. \\"She would meet with me and talk with me,\\" Snow said. \\"She is really how I got through it.\\" From there, Snow began pairing up mothers to mothers, siblings to siblings, spouses to spouses -- Pan Am families with TWA families. A few months later, ACCESS was born. ACCESS, short for AirCraft Casualty Emotional Support Services, is a nonprofit bereavement support program for people who have lost loved ones in aviation disasters. \\"We have 250 grief mentors from air disasters dating back to 1958 -- private, military and commercial air disasters,\\" Snow said. \\"This gives people an opportunity to share what they went through with somebody else and also provide hope for them.\\" Most of the trained grief mentors have called in for help in the past, Snow said. Rachel Courtney is one of them. Courtney lost her father, James Courtney, along with his legal assistant in a private plane crash in 1998. \\"For a period of three weeks, we were searching for him in the woods,\\" Courtney said. \\"The first night I was home, we were all in a small airport...I thought he's probably cold and in the woods and that nobody's helping him. And I was completely panicked.\\" A year later, Courtney was still grappling with the loss. \\"I realized that the world was moving on but in a lot of respects, I wasn't,\\" she said. \\"Heidi ended up pairing me up with another woman who was a mentor, who had lost her father in an aircraft disaster.\\" Courtney's experience inspired her to help others. \\"To me, it was 'I got through this,'\\" she said. \\"I wanted to be there to help other people see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.\\" When planes go down, like AirAsia Flight 8501, which left 162 people dead in December, Snow and her team of grief mentors stand by ready to help. \\"Every time we have the opportunity to speak about ACCESS on the news...We get calls for help from people who have lost loved ones who didn't know we were there,\\" she said. Snow appeared on several CNN shows after the AirAsia crash. \\"Every time these incidents occur we are walking with them, we remember, we are grieving with them,\\" Snow told Michaela Pereira on CNN's \\"New Day.\\" In addition to providing one-on-one support, the organization shares information with airlines and organizations to help them offer more effective emotional support after these types of losses. Snow also wrote the book \\"Surviving Sudden Loss: Stories from those who have lived it\\" as another tool families could use to deal with their grief. \\"This is a lifelong journey. ... I feel so blessed that I've been given the opportunity to be with these incredible people who come forward and volunteer their time,\\" Snow said. \\"They really look at life differently because they start to realize how precious it is and how life can change in an instant.\\"","completion":"Heidi Snow and Michel Breistroff's lives changed forever on July 17, 1996, when Breistroff boarded TWA Flight 800, which exploded midair 12 minutes after takeoff, leaving no survivors.

Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Relatives of a woman killed in a Spanish airline crash were erroneously given the remains of another victim, and then were asked by authorities to return them, CNN partner network CNN+ reported Thursday. The victims of the crash were first laid out at a Madria convention center. A Madrid judge has opened an investigation into the error, and judicial sources say the initial indication is that the mixup occurred not in the proper identification of the victim, but in delivering the wrong remains to the family in question, CNN+ reported. The family Wednesday received an urn numbered 104, and were told it contained the ashes of their loved one, Pilar Gonzalez Ferreira, who died in the crash. But as the family was preparing to leave Madrid, officials called to tell them about the error and asked for the return of urn 104, CNN+ reported. Instead of urn 104, the family was supposed to have received urn 134, which actually contains the remains of Pilar Gonzalez, CNN+ reported, citing judicial sources and another family which also lost a relative in the crash. The Spanair MD82 jet crashed last week at Madrid's airport as the plane was trying to take off, killing 154 people. The aircraft, bound for Spain's Canary Islands, managed to rise only slightly before coming down quickly to the right of the runway, its tail section hitting the ground first, just off the asphalt. Then the out-of-control plane skidded and bounced at least three times as it careered 1,200 meters (3,840 feet) across uneven terrain and exploded, coming to rest in a gully, a top official of the investigative commission told a news conference in Madrid on Tuesday. Many of the bodies were badly charred from the fire, and authorities have used DNA samples to carry out numerous identifications.

But people who decide to \\"go organic\\" could soon find themselves piling on the pounds. The warning comes from American researchers who studied whether the sight of an organic label was enough to influence a person's choice. For example, if people believe organic foods, produced without using pesticides and artificial fertilizers , have fewer calories, they may end up eating far too much and spending less time on sports activities and put on weight. Cornell University researchers said: \\" Some people mistakenly think that these foods are more nutritious , just because they carry an organic label.\\" \\"The growing popularity of organic foods has led to some concern, as these foods may not necessarily be healthier than non-organic ones, but still may lead consumers to nutritional mis-judgments. If people feel a food to be more nutritious, they tend to let their guard down when it comes to counting calories---in the end leading them to overeat.\\" Although a small number of differences in nutrient content were found to exist between organically-produced crops and traditionally-produced ones, these are of little health importance.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Frenzied, over-the-top 'A-Team' gives B-movies a bad name By Claudia Puig, USA TODAY As the leader of the A-Team, boldly asserts: \\"Overkill is underrated.\\" Though it's a clever line, it's hardly a viable mantra for a coherent action flick — even one based on a shlocky '80s TV show. Director Joe Carnahan ascribes to the wrongheaded notion that frantic equals exciting. But there's nothing exciting about this awful, over-the-top reboot. There is, however, plenty of frenetic action of the sort that's delivered so speedily that instead of quickening our pulses, it makes our eyes glaze. Despite a talented cast, this nearly two-hour inane frenzy of action and violence is rarely more than bloated and boring. The A-Team 2.0 consist of Bradley Cooper as the womanizing Templeton \\"Face\\" Peck, District 9's Sharlto Copley as the borderline insane \\"Howlin' Mad\\" Murdock and Quinton \\"Rampage\\" Johnson as the nimble fighter B.A. Baracus, made famous by Mr. T. The three are led by Neeson, who plays Hannibal Smith. Why Neeson has decided to reinvent himself as an action hero is mystifying. But then, it's also bewildering why a studio chose to remake this forgettable TV show. The team is supposedly an ultra-courageous, elite military squad who carries out inventive and daring escapades. Their antics also are played for silly comic effect. But neither the comedy nor the stunts and effects make for much fun. Baracus is a fierce fighter, but he's a remarkable baby when it comes to flying. He's alternately drugged and enticed with food to get him on board a helicopter flown by the nutso Murdock. This is Carnahan and company's idea of humor. The film opens abruptly when the quartet — Iraq War vets this time around — takes a top-secret assignment which results in their being framed. They're all thrown into prison, hellbent on proving their innocence. An unconvincing romance between Cooper's Face and Jessica Biel's Capt. Sosa is shoehorned in. The much-used technique of cutting back and forth among characters devising and executing elaborate plans wears thin. There is one outlandish scene where the team flies a tank through the air. Never mind credibility — at least it's an original visual effect in a movie that is thoroughly derivative. Subverting a quote from Gandhi to justify violence may be stretching the notion of originality. But if the rest of the movie had been cheeky enough, that would have been a much funnier line. Instead, we get wooden acting and over-the-top action. It's hard not to pity the fools who spend their dollars on this overblown mess.

Answer this question: how are cholera and typhus transmitted and prevented?","completion":"Cholera and typhus are both infectious diseases caused by bacteria, but they are transmitted through different means and have distinct prevention strategies. 1. Cholera transmission: Cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It is primarily transmitted through the consumption of contaminated water or food. Ingestion of water or food contaminated with fecal matter containing the bacterium is the main route of transmission. In some cases, it can also be transmitted through eating raw or undercooked shellfish that come from contaminated water sources. Cholera prevention: To prevent cholera, the following measures can be taken: - Drink only safe water: Boil water or treat with a reliable disinfectant before drinking. Bottled or packaged water is safer if seals are intact. - Cook food thoroughly: Ensure that food is cooked and served hot, especially seafood. - Wash fruits and vegetables: Thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables with safe water before consumption. - Maintain good hygiene: Regularly wash hands with soap and clean water, especially before preparing or consuming food, after using the toilet, and after contact with contaminated surfaces. - Proper sanitation: Dispose of sewage and fecal matter safely to reduce the risk of water contamination. - Cholera vaccines: In high-risk areas, cholera vaccines may be administered for additional protection. 2. Typhus transmission: Typhus is caused by bacteria belonging to the Rickettsia family. There are several types of typhus, but the most common form is epidemic typhus, which is transmitted through infected body lice. When a person comes into contact with the feces or crushed body of an infected louse, the bacteria can enter the body through scratches or mucous membranes. Other forms, like murine typhus, are transmitted through infected fleas or ticks. Typhus prevention: To prevent typhus, the following steps can be taken: - Maintain personal hygiene: Regularly wash your body, clothes, and bedding to reduce the risk of lice infestation. - Avoid contact with potential carriers: Stay away from rodents or areas with a high population of rats, mice, or fleas. - Use insect repellent: Apply insect repellents containing DEET to your skin and clothing to repel lice, fleas, and ticks. - Wear protective clothing: In high-risk areas, wear long sleeves, pants, and socks to minimize skin exposure to potential carriers, and tuck pants into socks to deter ticks. - Check for and remove ticks: Examine your body and clothes after outdoor activities in endemic areas, and carefully remove any ticks found. - Pest control: Implement pest control measures to reduce the population of rodents and other vermin around your home and community. In general, maintaining good hygiene and sanitation and protecting yourself from insect vectors are key in preventing both cholera and typhus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Gary is a high school student examining two cells under a microscope for his biology class. In a petri dish, marked Cell X, Gary sees that substances inside the cell are spreading apart from each other making it less concentrated. In the dish marked Cell Y, Gary sees substances coming together and moving into close proximity to one another. Is cell Y moving up or down the concentration gradient? Hint: Active transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane with the help of extra energy. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is less concentrated to an area where it is more concentrated. This is the opposite of diffusion. The substance moves up, instead of down, the concentration gradient. Like rolling a ball uphill, this requires an input of energy.

Hypothesis: The Pentagon is leaking more than it had in the early '90s. Step 2: Analyze the premise The premise states that George Joulwan, as the NATO military commander, called for the Pentagon to stop leaking information during his tenure in the early '90s. This indicates that there were some leaks during that time, but it does not provide any comparison with other time periods. Step 3: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that the Pentagon is currently leaking more information than it did in the early '90s, i.e., it claims that there has been an increase in the leakage over time. Step 4: Evaluate if the premise entails the hypothesis The premise only provides information about the existence of leaks in the early '90s, specifically when George Joulwan made the call for the Pentagon to stop leaking. However, it does not offer any information about the current state of leaks or a comparison of leaks over time.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Start with the given command: \\"run around left twice after turn left\\". 2. Identify the keywords: - \\"run\\" - corresponds to the I_RUN action - \\"around left\\" - agent must execute specified action while turning around to the left - \\"twice\\" - repeat the scoped command two times - \\"after\\" - execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope - \\"turn left\\" - corresponds to the I_TURN_LEFT action 3. Break down the command into individual actions based on keywords: - turn left (before): I_TURN_LEFT - (twice) run around left (after): I_RUN around left, repeated twice 4. To run around left, the agent must: - Take a left turn while running: I_TURN_LEFT - Run: I_RUN - Take another left turn: I_TURN_LEFT - Run again to complete the around action: I_RUN 5. Since the command is to be executed twice, repeat the actions in step 4: - I_TURN_LEFT, I_RUN, I_TURN_LEFT, I_RUN (first repetition) - I_TURN_LEFT, I_RUN, I_TURN_LEFT, I_RUN (second repetition) 6.

She came to mind when I reflected on the audience's reaction to \\"The Mother.\\" People gasped when May (Anne Reid) writhed passionately in bed with her younger hunk lover, Darren (Daniel Craig) or later saw sexually explicit drawings by May. I doubt the audience was aghast at the nudity or the drawings' content as much as feeling uneasy at seeing a woman in her 60s rapturously enjoying sex. Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi (\\"My Beautiful Laundrette,\\" \\"My Son the Fanatic\\") again proves why he's among the most trenchant storytellers on either side of the Atlantic. His story's not easy to take. This searing family drama isn't a film you can claim you enjoyed watching because it's raw, complex, and often makes us very uncomfortable. Nevertheless, it's powerfully good stuff. Kureishi and Roger Michell (who directed \\"Notting Hill,\\" of all things) craft an unsentimental, wrenching and superbly-acted portrait of an older woman who realizes, after all these years, she can and should still enjoy all of life's pleasures. In a wonderfully epiphanous moment, when her son, Bobby, asks her not to be difficult, May shoots back, \\"Why not?\\" Why not, indeed. Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for her turn as May. It's subtle, restrained, powerful and sad, often all at the same time. Watch Reid when May observes Darren and Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) in a seemingly passionate clutch in a pub. Or, when she begs Paula to open the front door after a disastrous date. Reid's eyes and face reveal all of May's anguish and despair. In the film's most devastating moment, May drops to her knees before Darren, willing to do anything for him, only asking him to be kind. This is a tremendously gutsy performance by a remarkable actress. I enjoyed Michell's use of natural sound, especially when May and Toots first arrive at Bobby's place. It perfectly illustrated the cacophony around May and Toots, the flippant manner in which their own family welcomes them. This film, at times, reminded me of the honesty and rawness of Mike Leigh's work, except \\"The Mother\\" hangs on to a slight sense of optimism to keep afloat. My one quibble: Michell's decision to give May and Darren's first love scene an almost cheesy sensibility. The lovers remain out of focus while, in the foreground, a white curtain flutters gently in the breeze. And the only sound is of May in the throes of passion. The problem with Michell's approach is that both Reid and Craig, who completely envelops the role of Darren, plough their way so fearlessly into these roles that it's unfair to hide their characters' almost primitive energy from the audience. Especially since Michell has no qualms about making later sex scenes visceral. This film doesn't have immensely likable characters. We sympathize with May, but she, too, causes her daughter's suffering. But I doubt Kureishi intended to people his story with likable folk. His point, I believe, was to unmask a family that's already cracking when something emotionally cataclysmic happens. It's unflinching in its candor and ultimately unforgettable.

Information: - The Volkswagen Beetle (officially the Volkswagen Type 1, informally in Germany the Volkswagen Käfer, in Poland the Volkswagen Garbus and in the U.S. the Volkswagen Bug) is a two-door, four passenger, rear-engine economy car manufactured and marketed by German automaker Volkswagen (VW) from 1938 until 2003. - The Love Bug (sometimes referred to as Herbie the Love Bug) is a 1968 American comedy film and the first in a series of films made by Walt Disney Productions that starred an anthropomorphic pearl-white, fabric-sunroofed 1963 Volkswagen racing Beetle named Herbie. It was based on the 1961 book \\"Car, Boy, Girl\\" by Gordon Buford. - Auto racing (also known as car racing, motor racing or automobile racing) is a sport involving the racing of automobiles for competition. - In sport, racing is a competition of speed, against an objective criterion, usually a clock or to a specific point. The competitors in a race try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of time. Typically this involves traversing some distance, but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal. - An economy car is an automobile that is designed for low cost purchase and operation. Typical economy cars are small (compact or subcompact), lightweight, and inexpensive to buy. Economy car designers are forced by stringent design constraints to be inventive. Many innovations in automobile design were originally developed for economy cars, such as the Ford Model T and the Austin Mini. Gordon Murray, the Formula 1 and Mclaren F1 designer, said when designing his new Murray T.25 city car: \\"I would say that building a car to sell for six thousand pounds and designing that for a high volume production, where you have all the quality issues under control is a hundred times more difficult than designing a Mclaren F1, or even a racing car. It is certainly the biggest challenge I've ever had from a design point of view.\\" The alternative approach other than innovating to build a low cost car, is build a stripped down no frills version of a conventional car. - Walter Elias \\"Walt\\" Disney (December 5, 1901December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer.

As a film producer, Disney holds the record for most Academy Awards earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other honors.

Question: There is no hiding from the impact agenda. The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

Summarize this article: Diverse Images/UIG/Getty Images A hallucinogenic drug derived from magic mushrooms could be useful in treating depression, the first safety study of this approach has concluded. Researchers from Imperial College London gave 12 people psilocybin, the active component in magic mushrooms. All had been clinically depressed for a significant amount of time — on average 17.8 years. None of the patients had responded to standard medications, such as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or had electroconvulsive therapy. One week after receiving an oral dose of psilocybin, all patients experienced a marked improvement in their symptoms. Three months on, five patients were in complete remission. “That is pretty remarkable in the context of currently available treatments,” says Robin Carhart-Harris, a neuropsychopharmacologist at Imperial College London and first author of the latest study, which is published in The Lancet Psychiatry1. The equivalent remission rate for SSRIs is around 20%. The study's authors are not suggesting that psilocybin should be a treatment of last resort for depressed patients. “Our conclusion is more sober than that — we are simply saying that this is doable,” says Carhart-Harris. “We can give psilocybin to depressed patients, they can tolerate it, and it is safe. This gives us an initial impression of the effectiveness of the treatment.” Drug problems Demonstrating the safety of psilocybin is no small task. Magic mushrooms are categorized as a Class A illegal drug in the United Kingdom — the most serious category, which also includes heroin and cocaine. The ethics committee that granted approval for the trial was so concerned that trial volunteers could experience delayed onset psychotic symptoms that it requested a three-month follow-up on the subjects. “The study result isn’t the remarkable part — it’s the fact that we did it at all.” “This was unprecedented,” says neuropsychopharmacologist David Nutt at Imperial, who is senior author of the study. It took 32 months between having the grant awarded and dosing the first patient, says Nutt. By comparison, it took six months “to get through the machinations” for his team’s previous studies using the equally illegal drugs LSD and MDMA, he says. “Every interaction — applying for licenses, waiting for licenses, receiving the licenses, applying for contracts for drug manufacture, on and on — involved a delay of up to two months. It was enormously frustrating, and most of it was unnecessary,” says Nutt. “The study result isn’t the remarkable part — it’s the fact that we did it at all.” Scientists at the Heffter Research Institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico, have been investigating how psilocybin could be used to alleviate depression and anxiety in people with terminal cancer, but this is the first study to look specifically at how psilocybin could be used to treat depression alone. The World Health Organisation calls depression “the leading cause of disability worldwide”. But effective therapies are hard to find. Searching for new treatments, researchers have looked to potent and quirky alternatives such as ketamine and ayahuasca, both of which have shown promise in clinical trials. “It’s worth noting that we have not developed any new treatments which are widely used since the 1970s for depression, despite the fact that this is the major public-health problem in the Western world and middle-income countries,” says Glyn Lewis, who studies psychiatric disorders at University College London. Particularly interesting, he says, is the fact that psilocybin seems to take effect with a single dose, unlike some current medications for depression that must be taken daily. “This study is simply asking: is this interesting enough to pursue further as a treatment for depression?” says Lewis. “My own judgement is that yes, it is.” ||||| A small scale study into treating depression using psilocybin, the psychedelic compound of magic mushrooms, has found it can be safely administered. The study team, from Imperial College London, say this could pave the way for future randomised-controlled trials to establish the efficacy of the compound in treating this form of depression. Psychedelic drugs have potent psychological effects and are only given in our research when appropriate safeguards are in place, such as careful screening and professional therapeutic support. – Dr Robin Carhart-Harris Study author It is estimated that 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression. The annual cost of depression in England is thought to be around £7.5 billion. Most people with depression respond positively to treatment using antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioural therapy. But around 20 per cent of those with depression do not respond to treatments and are classified as having treatment-resistant depression. Previous studies have looked into the potential of using psychedelic drugs for conditions such as end of life anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and smoking dependence. Psilocybin acts on the serotonin system suggesting it could be developed for use in the treatment of depression. The study, funded by the Medical Research Council, aimed to assess safety and whether a potential treatment dose of psilocybin could be tolerated. Hallucinogenics such as psilocybin can cause unpleasant reactions, including anxiety and paranoia, so it is important to establish whether the drug can be administered safely to people with depression. To investigate the safety and feasibility of using psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression, researchers from Imperial conducted a strictly monitored feasibility study. As this was not a randomised-controlled trial, the patients knew they were receiving the drug and there was no control group to provide comparison either with existing treatments or with no treatment at all. Twelve people with moderate to severe treatment-resistant depression who had not responded to at least two courses of antidepressants were recruited (six men and six women, aged 30 to 64). Most of the participants actively volunteered to take part following presentations by the researchers and media coverage. Eleven of the participants had previously undergone psychotherapy. The volunteers went through a thorough screening process before they were allowed to participate. Criteria used to rule out participants from taking part included people with a history of suicide attempts, those with diagnosis of a psychotic disorder and other significant medical conditions. Participants were fully supported at all times before, during and after they received psilocybin. The patients received Home Office-approved psilocybin capsules during two dosing sessions seven days apart. The psilocybin was administered to the participants at a research facility and participants were monitored by at least two members of clinical staff at all times during the psilocybin administration sessions. There was a follow-up with patients the next day, and then one, two, three and five weeks after the second dosing session. Blood pressure, heart rate and the self-reported intensity of the effects of psilocybin were monitored before and continuously during each dosing session. No serious unexpected side effects were reported during the study. All participants reported temporary anxiety before and during initial drug administration. All patients showed some decrease in symptoms of depression for at least three weeks. Seven of them continued to show a positive response three months after the treatment, with five remaining in remission after three months. There are some limitations to this study, in addition to the small sample size. Previous studies have shown that using psychedelics can leave one open to suggestion, which could have been part of the positive outcomes seen here. It was also not possible to control for the psychological support received throughout this study. Lead author, Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, said: “Psychedelic drugs have potent psychological effects and are only given in our research when appropriate safeguards are in place, such as careful screening and professional therapeutic support. I wouldn't want members of the public thinking they can treat their own depressions by picking their own magic mushrooms. That kind of approach could be risky.” Senior author Professor David Nutt, the Edmond J Safra Chair in Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial, said: “It is important that academic research groups try to develop possible new treatments for depression as the pharmaceutical industry is pulling out of this field. Our study has shown psilocybin is safe and fast acting so may, if administered carefully, have value for these patients.” Dr Louise Jones, head of translational research at the MRC, said: “We currently don’t have effective treatments for some people’s depression so we need to know more about how drugs such as psilocybin could be used for patient benefit. This study showed that, with appropriate safeguards, psilocybin can be safely administered to some patients with treatment-resistant depression. It will now be important to undertake studies that evaluate its role as a potential treatment.” The study was published in The Lancet Psychiatry. See the press release of this article ||||| Summary:","completion":"The safety study from Imperial College London suggests that psilocybin, a hallucinogenic compound found in magic mushrooms, could potentially be effective in treating depression. This conclusion comes as a result of research conducted on 12 individuals who had been suffering from treatment-resistant depression for an average of 17.8 years, and had not found relief from standard treatments such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or electroconvulsive therapy. One week after receiving a single oral dose of psilocybin, all patients saw significant improvements in their symptoms. After three months, five of the patients were in complete remission from their depression, marking a substantial increase from the typical 20% remission rate seen with SSRIs. However, the authors clarify that they are not suggesting psilocybin as a definitive substitute or last resort treatment for depression. Instead, their study demonstrates that it is feasible and safe to give psilocybin to depressed patients who can tolerate it, setting the ground for additional and larger scale research to investigate the potency of the compound in treating depression. It should be noted that while the effectiveness and speed of psilocybin's impact on depression is significant, the substance is still considered a Class A illegal drug in the United Kingdom alongside substances like heroin and cocaine. This research faced many logistical and ethical hurdles due to the drug's status. It took 32 months for the research team to be granted permission and to administer the first dose to a patient. Special precautions were made to ensure the trial's safety due to concerns about the potential for delayed onset psychotic symptoms in volunteers. This research builds upon similar endeavours. For instance, scientists at the Heffter Research Institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico have been investigating how psilocybin could potentially alleviate depression and anxiety in terminally ill cancer patients. However, this is the first study to evaluate the use of psilocybin in treating depression independently. Finally, the team emphasized the importance of having controlled, academic research environments for the administration of drugs like psilocybin given their potent psychological effects and the potential risks associated with misuse. Research into alternative treatment methods for depression is vital given its status as the “leading cause of disability worldwide,” according to the World Health Organisation, and considering that not all patients respond positively to currently available therapies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: why was ling released uncharged after going to jail? Movie title: Koma Movie plot: The movie begins with a young woman, who attended a wedding party held in a hotel and became drunk, waking up in one of the hotel rooms; only to realize in horror that her kidney has been surgically removed. Socialite Ching (Angelica Lee), who also attended the party, identified Ling (Karena Lam) as the prime suspect because she found out that Ling was the only stranger presented in the ball room. She is unknown to everyone in the party, even to the hotel staff. During the police investigation, Ching discovers that Ling has been secretly involved with her boyfriend Wai (Andy Hui Chi-On), and this is the very reason why she was in the hotel when the crime was committed. Ling was released uncharged due to insufficient evidence as police believed Ching could be framing her for cheating with her boyfriend. Rather than quickly disappear, Ling starts stalking Ching, apparently jealous that Ching could have everything Ling wanted without an effort while Ling has to fight for it. Ching, at the beginning, sees that as a form of harassment, but soon twists it around and follows Ling instead. Ling seems accepting of this, showing her the darker side of life living as a poor girl compared to Ching's rich-girl background. The two engage in a subtle cat-and-mouse game, and Ching begins to fear for her life when Ling starts making threats to remove her kidney too. One night, Ching is kidnapped by a mysterious man that seems to be an ally of Ling's. Here, Ching reveals that her kidney is weak, and the man will not be able to sell it for much. She passes out, and wakes to find Ling injured beside her. Ching takes her to the hospital, and it isn't long before Ching finds out that Ling is actually a kind person, more true then the friendships Ching shares with her superficial socialite friends. She learns that Ling has a childhood sweetheart, whose identity she does not reveal. Ching and Ling then make a deal with the mysterious man so that Ching can get a kidney. However Ching informs the police beforehand, and when they...","completion":"Question: Why was Ling released uncharged after going to jail?

Please answer the following question: Jason Munt said him and Carly Furnish got beamed up by a bunch of aliens just after he'd boldly gone with her in the car park woods. It was the boldly going bit people thought was bullshit. Carly Furnish was a good God-loving girl. Trouble was, she'd gone missing. And Jason Munt had a weird crescent-shaped branding in his back, and was sticking to his story. Jason got hauled in by the cops and told he was in a whole heap of trouble. He reported blinding lights and a feeling like floating. He described being strapped to a table by little green men. A cop slapped the table and shouted, 'there's a frigging girl out there.' Jason said he knew how it sounded - the little green men, the whole thing - but it's true: they were little and green, just like out of the comic books. He volunteered tests for drink and drugs. He came back negative on both counts. They left him to stew. He said the last he saw of Carly was her being sucked up in some kind of light ray. He said, 'she seemed asleep - all peaceful, like.' Jason could not explain why he'd been beamed back down to earth, yet they'd seemingly taken Carly all the way off home with them to the Planet Zog. There were plenty of people willing to reckon it proved aliens had mighty good taste, but it wasn't the time nor the place to say it out loud. The cops released Jason after two days of questions. He stuck to his story throughout. The desk sergeant said, 'mark my words, there's a lot of hate out there.' Jason headed straight home. He lived in one of the straggle of council houses leading up to the tip. Carly Furnish and her folks lived two doors down.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Styli made of sapphire and osmium alloy replaced those made from what? Context: In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.

He fought at the Battle of Quatre Bras on 16 June 1815 and at the Battle of Waterloo two days later, when he led the spectacular charge of the British heavy cavalry against Comte d'Erlon's column which checked and in part routed the French Army. One of the last cannon shots fired that day hit Paget in the right leg, necessitating its amputation.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi touted the agreement in a letter to her Democratic colleagues, saying negotiators \\"fought for and achieved drastic reductions to the Trump/GOP plan,\\" including much less funding for the wall than Trump requested and a limit on the number of immigrants that can be...

Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship.

Given the background: Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth's interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior. and the situation: Two friends met after 20 years and had a beer together.

What is the best way to: How to get more volume in your hair","completion":"The best way to get more volume in your hair involves a combination of proper hair care, styling techniques, and using the right hair products. Here's a detailed guide to help you add volume and thickness to your locks: 1. Choose the right shampoo and conditioner: Select volumizing shampoos and conditioners that are specially formulated to add volume and body to your hair. These products typically contain ingredients that help remove excess oil, residue, and build-up from the hair shaft while moisturizing and nourishing the scalp. 2. Avoid heavy hair products: Using heavy, oil-based products weigh down your hair, reducing volume. Instead, look for lightweight products like mousses and serums that add volume without weighing your hair down. 3. Shampoo effectively: To maximize your hair's volume potential, be sure to thoroughly cleanse your roots and scalp when shampooing. Focus on massaging the shampoo into your scalp with your fingertips for at least 30 seconds, then rinse out completely to remove any dirt, oil, and residues. 4. Use a microfiber towel or shirt: Instead of using a regular towel to dry your hair, opt for a microfiber towel or an old cotton T-shirt. This will help prevent breakage and friction that leads to flat, lifeless locks. 5. Apply a volumizing mousse or root-lifting spray: Dampen your hair and then apply a lightweight mousse or a root-lifting spray from roots to mid-lengths. This will provide extra volume and hold throughout your hair. 6. Utilize hair rollers: Hair rollers are an old but effective method that helps add volume and bounce to your hair. Choose large velcro or hot rollers for the best results. Apply the rollers to your hair (preferably to dried or slightly damp hair) and let them set for at least 30 minutes before removing them. Comb your hair gently to maintain the volume. 7. Master the right blow-drying technique: Blow-drying your hair upside-down can create more volume by lifting the roots. Use a round brush to help maintain tension as you pull your hair upward and away from your scalp. Additionally, use the cool-shot feature on your hairdryer to set the style and add extra volume. 8. Use dry shampoo: On days when you don't wash your hair, apply dry shampoo at the roots. This will absorb excess oil and add instant volume and texture. 9. Add layers to your haircut: Ask your hairstylist for a layered haircut if your hair is long. Layers help remove some of the weight from your locks and create a more voluminous appearance. 10. Tease your hair: Use a fine-toothed comb or a teasing brush to gently tease the hair at your roots. This method creates additional volume by lifting the hair away from your scalp. Be sure not to over-tease, as it can cause damage to the hair shafts. 11. Use hair extensions or clip-ins: If your hair is naturally thin or you want to create extra volume for a specific event, consider using hair extensions or clip-in pieces. These can add instant fullness and length to your hair without causing damage. 12. Maintain healthy hair habits: Trim your hair regularly to avoid split ends and hair breakage, which can make your hair appear thinner. Also, practice good hair care routines like using a heat protectant spray before applying heat tools and eating a balanced diet. By following these tips, you can achieve a voluminous, fuller hair look. It might take some practice and experimentation, but with patience and the right techniques, you'll be able to add lasting volume to your locks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyzing the text to understand its content and underlying message. 2. Identifying the narrator's attitude towards the subject matter. 3. Determining the type of ideology that the narrator is showing based on the analyzed content and attitude. Step 1: Analyzing the text The text seems to be discussing the narrator's thoughts on someone mentioning that John McCain is \\"good on global warming\\" and campaign finance. The narrator then explains how when people hear this statement repeatedly, they begin to believe that McCain is a positive choice. However, the narrator also implies that there's more to the story, which people might not listen to if they're already convinced that McCain is a good option. Step 2: Identifying the narrator's attitude The narrator appears to be skeptical or critical of the idea that McCain is a good choice simply because of his stance on global warming and campaign finance. By using phrases like \\"say that enough\\" and \\"you've sold them,\\" the narrator suggests that this portrayal of McCain is more about manipulation and persuasion than accurate representation. Step 3: Determining the type of ideology Based on the narrator's skeptical and critical tone towards persuasion and manipulation, one could argue that the narrator is showing a more liberal or progressive ideology. This is because the narrator seems to be urging others to question the oversimplified representation of McCain's stance and consider other aspects as well before making a judgment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I just read a review defending this film because it had a low budget, now my take on things. The CGI monsters was reasonable well animated but was implemented in the worst possible way. The fight scenes weren't even fights it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with very interaction at all. When the monster did interact it looked like it was done in paintshop pro. In my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets. They may not look as fancy but at least they interact, just look at Peter Jacksons early films. As for the acting Beowulf did an descent job but the rest of the cast were either not trying or they forgot where they where. The script seemed confused to me. One minute they would be talking as if it were a modern day setting the next you get drama club Shakespeare speech. I'm not say it should be all 'ye' and 'that it be' but you need to find a cohesive balance so the lines sound like they come from the same person. I did notice one part near the start when Beowulf was quoting the old testament which would have been find had he not spent the rest of the films talking about the gods and portents. In short, this film is a very slightly polished turd, but a turn none the less.","completion":"Okay little buddy, this person who wrote the review didn't really like the movie.

Please answer the following question: Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source... What experience does the author credit with teaching him about knowledge workers?

While in the field, she collected two flowers to examine in detail. She puts the first flower, flower X, under a microscope and begins to look at it. After examination she determines it's an anemophilous plant. She then takes flower Y and repeats the same process to determine that it's an entomophilous type of plant. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which flower has a less exposed stamen? Hint: Anemophilous pollen grains are light and non-sticky, so that they can be transported by air currents. They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains.

They seem to be discussing Abby's bad marriage and Ray indicates that he's driving her to Houston. But instead of driving Abby to Houston, Ray drives to a motel and they have sex. We later find out that Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya), who owns a Texas bar, has suspected Abby's affair with Ray, one of his bartenders, so he hires private detective Loren Visser (M.

The following day Ray goes to the bar to collect his earnings, two weeks worth of work, but instead confronts Marty and quits his job. Marty threatens Ray's life and advises him not to trust Abby, that she will one day tell him she \\"hasn't done anything funny\\" and he won't believe her. Marty then hires Visser to kill the couple. Visser suggests he take a fishing trip to Corpus Christi to establish an alibi. He then breaks into Ray's home, steals Abby's gun, and photographs the sleeping couple through the bedroom window. Visser presents an edited photo of their fake corpses to Marty, who dumps four dead fish on his desk. Marty goes to the bathroom to vomit, then opens the safe to give Visser his 10,000 fee.

Although Joel - who works as a mechanic in the family garage - is wary of Lauryn's decision to enroll, he eventually gives her his blessing. When Lauryn enters the stage, however, her dance (mostly a hip hop routine) was halted by the judge, who hostilely rejects her, saying that they need to see something more \\"sensual and feminine\\". Dejected, Lauryn goes to a diner to down her sorrows, but soon finds her car towed off.

The group was formed in 1992, and featured Jason Lytle, Aaron Burtch, Jim Fairchild, Kevin Garcia and Tim Dryden. After several self-released records and cassettes, the band signed to Will Records in the US and later the V2 subsidiary Big Cat Records in the UK, going on to sign an exclusive deal with V2. The bulk of the band's recorded output was the work of Lytle, who worked primarily in home studios. Common lyrical themes include technology and a resistance to change. Adrien Begrand, writing for PopMatters, described the lyrics on The Sophtware Slump as \\"one's attempt to transcend the glut of technology in today's urban lifestyle, in search of something more real, more natural, more pastoral\\". Ben Sisario of The New York Times stated that the band \\"provided the soundtrack to dot-com-era alienation, singing in a cracked yet still innocent voice of life spent staring into a computer screen\\". Ross Raihala, reviewing Sumday for Spin, identified what he called Lytle's \\"geeky identification with technology\\". On The Sophtware Slump, CMJ writer Richard A. Martin commented on Lytle's \\"sympathy for the lost souls and machines of the high-tech dot-com landscape\\". Lytle described his empathy with machines in 2003, stating \\"I find it easier dealing with certain things by living through inanimate objects\\" and how the song \\"I'm on Standby\\" is about Lytle relating to a mobile phone: \\"I was spending so much time learning the art of turning off, while still being 'on'\\". Lytle said of the tracks on Excerpts from the Diary of Todd Zilla: \\"For some reason, they are tied together by the idea of being fed up with your environment.\\" He stated in 2001: \\"I have a growing appreciation for that which is simple and natural. I get that from the outdoors, and seeing the accumulation of clutter and waste and not being too happy about it.\\" There is also much humor in Lytle's songwriting, including the band's promotional Christmas single released in 2000, \\"Alan Parsons in a Winter Wonderland\\", which was also included on the charity compilation It's a Cool Cool Christmas, described by AllMusic's Tim DiGravina as possibly \\"the funniest song from 2000\\".

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person to whom Bartok dedicated the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928? Szigeti was an avid champion of new music, and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside the classics. Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty. The reason for Szigeti's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music. Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would...

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article. Input: Article: A recent survey in the United States showed that the average family spent more money on its pets than on its children. Although rather shocking, it should not surprise anyone who has seen the doggy parlors where loved pets rest. Are Americans unique in treating their little friends in this way? No, the English, too, pay more attention to their pets. This can clearly be seen when we look at pet foods, which often contain more vitamins than human food. They certainly cost much. Last year the British public spent two hundred million pounds on pet food alone, to say nothing of veterinary bills or animal furniture. It is difficult not to feel angry about this when considering what the same amount could do for victims of starvation and poverty, so it is not unusual for me _ when I read an old man left all his money to his dog instead of his children. There are a variety of reasons why I find pets-raising alarming. They cause physical problems. An example of this is New York where they have great difficulty getting rid of the mess that dogs leave on the streets. Many people find this funny, but in a number of large cities it is a major problem. Animals can cause disease, too. It is the threat of rabies -- a disease with no known cure. Another problem is the carelessness of pet owners. Most little children want a dog or a cat, and they continually push their mothers and fathers until they get one. It is only when the \\"sweet little thing\\" has been brought home that the parents realize how much time and money must be spent on \\"Rover\\" or \\"Bonzo\\". Then they just abandon it. As a result, they are allowed to run free. English farmers lose hundreds of sheep a year, killed by someone's pet and you must have read of children being hurt by some pets of their own. Lastly, I would only suggest that we have got our priorities wrong and that something should be done about it. In my view, it's time we stopped being sentimental about pets. I can see no reason why we should get upset when animals are cut up for medical experiments. This will lead us to discovering cures for serious human diseases, then I say, \\"keep cutting!\\" Answer: Sports.

Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century Question: \\"What notes did Whalen Lai say about Madame White Snake?\\" Answer: \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

In retaliation for her father constantly berating her, she adds hydrogen peroxide to his hair tonic, turning his hair an unhealthy blonde. He takes his children to his workshop, where he reveals that the cars he sells are faulty.

For about a week, the nation's Catholic bishops enjoyed some measure of their bygone political clout. The bishops launched a vigorous grassroots campaign to protest a rule from the Obama administration's health care mandate that would force many Catholic institutions to cover birth control through their employee health plans. Catholic churchgoers have seen such campaigns attempted before, with bishops issuing stinging denunciations that are repeated in church publications and in letters read to parishioners at every Mass. But this time, to the surprise of many, the bishops' effort seemed to work. President Barack Obama quickly modified the rule. He didn't satisfy the bishops -- but still, the clergymen had upset the political calculus that they no longer affect Catholic voters. The bishops were able to wield influence because their message against the contraception mandate was framed in a way that appealed to a broad spectrum of Catholics. For moderates and liberals, there were calls to freedom and conscience, rather than blunt declarations to heed ecclesial authority. For conservatives, there was the opportunity to circle the wagons against secularism. But if the bishops insist on coming across as shrill and partisan, as some are wont to do, they'll wind up once again preaching to half the choir. Moderate and liberal Catholics won't stand behind the bishops if they perceive a partisan position. And it won't take much to trigger that reaction because certain bishops were transparently opposed to Obama during the 2008 election campaign, and many more of them later maligned the University of Notre Dame for granting the president an honorary degree. I noticed a letter to the editor in the diocesan newspaper in Brooklyn, where I live, that captures the unease I believe a good number of Catholics feel. The writer said she understood the church's position on the birth-control mandate, but she practically pleaded with the editor, who had accused the Obama administration of pushing socialism, to take a less polarizing tone. If the bishops really want to gain back some of the clout they used to hold, they would do well to consider the community organizing tactics that their own parishes have adopted in many poor urban neighborhoods. It is an approach that relies heavily on building consensus. Guided by the writings of Saul Alinsky, coalitions of houses of worship have organized around specific issues, such as a plan to build low-cost housing. The community organizers' first step was to secure the enthusiastic support of parishioners, demonstrated through massive rallies. Once pastors really do speak for their people, they are then in a position to demand that elected officials of whatever party support their agenda.

One morning she was having a particular difficult time getting to sleep when the doodle bops theme song came on T.V. She stopped crying almost instantly, and for the rest of the show was content. I sat her in her bouncy seat and watched her kick her legs, swing her arms, and actually laugh at this show. The kept her entertained and happy the entire time. I also got a video of them so that at times when my little one is flustered I have something to calm her. Granted, late at night if she awakes with colic to fuss the doodle bops are not her cup of tea, but they sure do come in handy when I need a little time to do housework,etc. The biggest surprise about the doodle bops is that my child doesn't even like watching T.V. She'd rather be in the floor playing with a toy or with our small toy poodle than watch T.V. yet, the doodle bops have totally captured her attention.

(IV) see a man in a white shirt talking..","completion":"Based on the given context, let us consider each of the provided options before choosing the most appropriate ending for the next paragraph. Option (I): \\"see men partying with dogs in a van.\\" This ending seems somewhat unrelated to the previous events described. The paragraph is discussing a slow-motion replay of a slam and the appearance of a title on the screen. This option introduces new characters and an entirely different scene, which does not naturally follow the existing paragraph. Option (II): \\"see a man throw a blue ball and the title comes on the screen.\\" This ending presents a scene where a man throws a blue ball and the title appears on the screen. While it adds a new element (the man with the blue ball), it still maintains continuity by mentioning the title on the screen. This could signify a transition to a related scene or the introduction of a topic. Option (III): \\"see the other man lift the first man and slam him on the sidewalk.\\" Although this ending does involve the first man being lifted and slammed on the sidewalk, it does not seem to relate to the slow-motion replay or title mentioned earlier in the paragraph. This ending would make more sense if the paragraph was discussing the continuation of a physical altercation, rather than focusing on a slow-motion replay and a title. Option (IV): \\"see a man in a white shirt talking.\\" This option introduces a man who is talking, but it doesn't provide any context or connection to the previous scene. It is quite a vague ending and does not give any indication of why this man in a white shirt is relevant or how the slow-motion replay and title relate to his talking. Considering the provided options, Option (II) - \\"see a man throw a blue ball and the title comes on the screen\\" - seems the most plausible and coherent ending for the next paragraph. This option connects well with the mentioned title on the screen and introduces a new element that may signify a transition to a related scene or the introduction of a topic. The other options either do not maintain continuity with the existing paragraph or lack sufficient context to create a natural flow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend.

The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance.

This movie is not primarily about the act of \\"riding giants,\\" but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport, RIDING giants, to change the emphasis. In my teens I lived a block from the Wedge, one of the hardest-breaking and best bodysurfing spots in the world. I've been out in 15-to-18 foot surf, and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12-foot waves on many occasions. That experience is why I am in complete awe of the surfers in this film. The idea that Jeff Clark, to all appearances a normal mortal, could get away with riding Maverick's BY HIMSELF for over a decade is beyond my grasp. The first safety rule of any water sport is \\"Never surf/dive/swim by yourself.\\" He went where sane people would not, and lived to tell about it. I wouldn't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left. In the world of warm water: the first shot of the waves at Jaws always makes the skin tingle over my entire body. These are not just scary waves, these are uncontrolled-bowel-evacuation waves. When we see Laird Hamilton not only surviving 40-to-60 foot waves (I can hardly type those numbers), but actually working the faces like a fun day at Rincon, I'm blown away. There is a dedication and focus in big-wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world. This a great film. I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it neglects to mention that there are great big-wave riders in the world outside the Hamilton/Kalama crew, and I think they deserved mention. Splice in Ken Bradshaw at outside Log Cabins and a 10 it is! Now, what is this review like? Available options: I. negative; II. positive;","completion":"III. mixed; This review is a mix of positive and critical elements. The reviewer discusses their admiration for the surfers and their awe at the waves these athletes face. There is also a high rating given (9 out of 10). However, the reviewer points out that the film could have included more big-wave riders outside of the main crew, which is a slightly critical comment. Overall, the review leans more towards a positive tone, but it is not without its critique."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Is this product review positive? Title: It's FUN to read all Eight Doctors! Review: It is not easy bringing the many voices of a Time Lord, known as THE DOCTOR, together. However, Terrance Dicks is one of the writers in the DOCTOR WHO UNIVERSE that seems up to the task. There are those in DOCTOR WHO FANDOM who feel that multi-DOCTOR stories are trite, and too cute. I believe that if this particular native of Galifrey is to be viewed as a renegade on the run from his own people, then criss-crossing the time-stream and meeting himself seems like a natural occurrence. Dick's story allows one to go into one's own memory matrix and conjure up the prior doctors, while maintaining the EIGHTH's own persona. This is also the first meeting with the EIGHT's newest companion, SAM JONES. It also helps clear up some of the incontinuities of the 1996 tele-film. Answer: Answer:","completion":"Yes, this product review is positive. The reviewer appreciates the writer Terrance Dicks' ability to bring the many voices of the Doctor together and enjoys the concept of the Doctor meeting himself within the story. They also mention that the story allows them to recall memories of prior doctors while maintaining the Eighth's persona, and it introduces a new companion, Sam Jones.

Piers explains that his vote was a protest against the other main political parties and does not want to see UKIP in power due to their lack of policies on important matters such as the economy. However, he agrees with UKIP's notion that the UK wastes a lot of money staying in the European Union. The young voter emphasizes that he wants the other political parties to realize they are not doing enough to address the country's problems, such as housing and tertiary education costs. In the interview, Piers mentions that he is struggling with the idea of moving out of his parents' house and the cost of going to university. He also points out that immigration is an issue as the country is over-populated and lacks employment opportunities.

Movie title: Drop Zone Movie plot: Aboard a commercial airliner, U.S. Marshals Terry (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) and Pete Nessip (Wesley Snipes), are escorting computer expert Earl Leedy (Michael Jeter) to a high security prison. When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the (Boeing 747) airliner, Terry is sucked out to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them. Ex-DEA agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey) is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in Washington DC so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an Independence Day parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above Washington DC. Pete believes that the assault may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy. However, the FBI declares that sneaking a parachute through airport security is impossible, and that parachuting at the jet's altitude and speed is not survivable. A devastated Pete is blamed for overreacting to the incident, and forced to turn in his badge. Undeterred, Pete consults a U.S. Navy High-altitude military parachuting instructor who confirms that he and his team have parachuted from that height and speed, but also states that the high-density metal rings in the parachutes would not pass airport metal detectors and that the operation required either rare skills or suicidal recklessness. The instructor believes the world class skydiver Dominic Jagger (Luca Bercovici) could perform the jump, but does not know his current whereabouts. Pete is instead referred to Jagger's reckless ex-wife, ex-con Jessie Crossman (Yancy Butler) - who is unaware that Jagger is part of Ty's crew.

Article: Brigham Young University is a part of the Church Educational System of LDS Church. It is organized under a Board of Trustees, with the President of the Church (currently Thomas S.

Prior to 1939, BYU had a separate board of trustees that was subordinate to the Church Board of Education. The President of BYU, currently Kevin J Worthen, reports to the Board, through the Commissioner of Education. Question: Who acts as chairman of BYU?","completion":"The chairman of Brigham Young University (BYU) is the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. BYU falls under the Church Educational System (CES) of the LDS Church, and its organization falls under a Board of Trustees. The President of the LDS Church acts as the chairman of this Board. As of the information given in the text, Thomas S. Monson is the current President of the LDS Church and therefore, he is the chairman of BYU. The Board of Trustees includes the same members as the Church Board of Education, following a pattern that has been in place since 1939. Before the year 1939, BYU operated differently with a unique board of trustees that was subordinate to the Church Board of Education. But this has since changed, and the current structure has remained consistent. This setup makes the President of BYU, at the time being Kevin J Worthen, obliged to report to the Board of Trustees, with the communication being facilitated by the Commissioner of Education. Under this organizational structure, the LDS Church President in the capacity of BYU's chairman provides religious, philosophical, and organizational direction, and it allows the Church to maintain governance and supervision over the university. This underscores the interlinkage and integration of the institution's religious and educational objectives serving both secular-academic and LDS Church education needs. Thus, to sum up, the person holding the position of the LDS Church President also functions as the chairman of the Board of Trustees at Brigham Young University, and as such, he holds significant influence over the broader operational structure and policy direction of the institution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While organizing some paperwork pertaining to real estate cases, she is puzzled when she notices medical records in one of the files.

Still, Erin succeeds in making her boss, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), as passionate about the case as she is, and he takes it on. Both Ed and Erin must make great sacrifices in their lives, as the legal costs spread Ed very thin, and the round-the-clock work takes Erin out of touch with both her boyfriend and her kids.Erin's kids resent the lack of attention from her, and her attempts to explain the merits of what she is doing to her eldest son are futile ..... but, one day her eldest son happens across one of the many documents pertaining to the PG&E; case.

The season 2002 Seattle Seahawks was the 27th season of the team with the national football league. In this sentence, the primary focus is on the Seattle Seahawks' 2002 season. The sentence presents the information that the 2002 season marks the 27th season of the team being a part of the National Football League (NFL). The main idea here is to convey the chronological position of the 2002 season within the team's history and its association with the NFL. 2. The 2002 National Football League season was the 27th season of the team with the Seattle Seahawks. Conversely, in the second sentence, the primary focus is on the 2002 NFL season. The sentence aims to communicate that, during the 2002 season, the NFL saw the Seattle Seahawks participate in their 27th season as a team in the league. In this case, the primary focus is on the overall NFL season and the Seattle Seahawks' involvement within the broader context of the 2002 season. In summary, both sentences convey that the Seattle Seahawks participated in their 27th season in the NFL during the 2002 season.

I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine râpée', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that? One etymological source indicates that 'poutine' really means 'mess'. If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work.

Q: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy. Kwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals... Question: Why did North Korea have a chance at sanction relief === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"North Korea had a chance at sanction relief because they were willing to engage in negotiations with the United States and other countries, and possibly take \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" By participating in discussions and demonstrating a commitment to the denuclearization process, North Korea could potentially receive relief from sanctions, economic aid, and security guarantees in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis mentioned that sanctions relief would be granted if North Korea took the necessary steps towards denuclearization, which aligns with the Kim government's stance that both actions and concessions should be matched during the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How Do I Promote An Online Business?","completion":"The two questions may appear identical at first glance, but they possess subtle differences in their phrasing and subject matter: 1. \\"How do I promote my online business?\\" 2. \\"How do I promote an online business?\\" Nonetheless, both inquiries essentially seek advice on effective ways to promote an online business. Consequently, a detailed and comprehensive response can address both questions simultaneously. Promoting an online business is all about increasing brand visibility, attracting and engaging the right audience, and ultimately converting them into loyal customers. There are several methods and strategies to accomplish this: 1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO): To make your online business easily discoverable, it's crucial to optimize your website and content for search engines. This includes incorporating relevant keywords, optimizing meta-tags, improving site speed, and obtaining high-quality backlinks. Regularly update your content and ensure it addresses users' needs to rank higher organically in search results. 2. Content Marketing: Creating and sharing valuable content that resonates with your target audience helps establish your brand's authority and credibility and drives traffic to your website. Publish a blog, create infographics, videos, and other forms of content relevant to your niche to engage your audience and provide value. 3. Social Media Marketing: Having a strong social media presence allows you to connect with your target audience, boost brand visibility, share content, and generate interest in your business. Regularly post updates, engage your followers, and invest in social media ads to increase your reach and conversions. 4. Email Marketing: Email marketing serves as a powerful tool for nurturing leads, retaining customers, and driving sales. Build an email list and segment it based on customer needs, behavior, and preferences. Craft personalized and targeted email campaigns to engage your subscribers and encourage action, such as making a purchase, signing up for a webinar, or sharing content. 5. Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Advertising: Invest in online advertising platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, or LinkedIn Ads to create targeted ad campaigns that reach potential customers searching for products or services like yours. Optimize your ads with relevant keywords, compelling headlines, and strong call-to-actions to maximize conversions. 6. Influencer Marketing: Partner with influencers in your niche to expand your reach, credibility, and brand trust. Collaborate on content, giveaways, and sponsored posts to generate buzz about your online business and promote it to a broader audience. 7. Online Communities and Forums: Join relevant online communities, forums, and discussion boards to interact with potential customers. Provide helpful advice, answer questions, and establish your expertise without overtly promoting your business. However, you can include your website link in your bio or sign-off to drive organic traffic to your website. In sum, while the two questions differ slightly, they both inquire about promoting an online business. By focusing on SEO, content marketing, social media, email marketing, PPC advertising, influencer marketing, and community engagement, you can increase the visibility, credibility, and profitability of your online business."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: America's Leftward Tilt? - NYTimes.com The presidential election is now a close contest, but barring an Electoral College tie, someone is going to win, someone is going to lose, and both sides will have to make sense of it all. The obvious story line of this election, whoever wins, is that Americans want pragmatic solutions to the relentless distress they have experienced for over a decade, whether that means a more active or a more passive government. They are looking for anyone who can provide a coherent vision of how to fix an economy that is not working for people who work for a living. But rather than a victory for pragmatism, we may well see both the winners and losers take away a very different lesson: that this election was a mandate for another shift to the right. If Mitt Romney loses, conservatives will no doubt conclude that he just wasn’t conservative enough, that they should have picked someone more appealing to their base. If President Obama loses or squeaks out a victory just four years after President George W. Bush destroyed the economy (which should have discredited conservative economics once and for all), many Democrats are likely to conclude that he tried to move too left too fast when he pushed for a stimulus and health care reform for which Americans were simply not ready, rather than that he simply sold both programs poorly (something he now acknowledges). Similarly, whichever candidate wins, the first order of business will be deciding which programs to cut — unless a deal to prevent us from going over the fiscal cliff is reached during the lame-duck session of Congress after the election. Most voters intuitively understand that jobs and deficits are linked — too much of an emphasis on deficits leads to too few jobs — because working people with money in their wallets drive demand, whereas wealthier people with money in their wallets drive Jaguars (and send the rest of their income to their hedge fund managers). Even in the heart of red America, people understand that high unemployment and income disparities of the magnitude we are now witnessing are bad for economic growth. But you have to speak in a way that brings out their inner Keynes, as I discovered when testing the following message in the Deep South: “The only way to cut the deficit is to put Americans back to work.” That message beat the toughest austerity message by over 30 points. The reality is that our government hasn’t become this dysfunctional because the parties are so “polarized.” It’s because there is only one pole in American politics today, and its magnetic field is so powerful that it has drawn both parties in the same direction — rightward. And it is in that same direction that the magnetic field of contemporary American politics is likely to pull the stories the two parties tell after the election — and the policies the winner pursues. The data, however, suggest just the opposite — that both candidates have benefited in the general election every time they have taken a left turn. President Obama was in deep political trouble 15 months ago when he cut the closest thing he could to a “grand bargain” with House Speaker John A. Boehner to slash the federal budget by trillions, and he did nothing for his popularity nine months earlier when he extended the Bush tax cuts to the wealthy. Not until he began talking like a populist did he begin picking up steam in the polls. Indeed, one of the most powerful messages the Democrats chose not to use in the 2010 midterm elections — which would have supported a policy that was extremely popular then and remains as popular now — was a simple message on taxes I tested nationally, which won in every region and with every demographic, including Tea Partyers: “In tough times like these, millionaires ought to be giving to charity, not getting it.” Once that position (and other populist appeals) became central to Mr. Obama’s presidential campaign, the election looked like it would be a rout. BUT then in the first debate, Mr. Romney moved to the center, taking back his promise of tax cuts for the rich and proposing instead to let people choose which tax deductions they wanted to take (for their home mortgages, for example) but limiting the amount that can be deducted. Perhaps understandably, the president didn’t know what to do with a Republican challenger who was outflanking him half the time on his left, and suddenly the race was competitive again. For both men, a pragmatic left-hand turn helped them steer their way toward a middle class desperate for hope. This should have come as no surprise. A majority of Americans still holds Bush accountable for the Great Recession, and with good reason. We are still breathing the fumes of his toxic brew of deregulation, massive transfers of wealth to the rich and a doubling of the national debt. His policies, and those of a Republican Congress that had its way with the economy for six years, were in fact the culmination of a right-wing ideological revolution led by Ronald Reagan, which changed the way Americans view their government. Mr. Reagan’s shadow continues to loom large, because Democrats have yet to make the case for a compelling alternative and have too often accepted the premises of the right. There are, of course, differences in how both sides view the role of government. But too often the consensus among the parties is that the solution to what ails us is deficit cutting and attacks on, or failure to support, the unions that gave us the weekend, 20th-century benefits and the eight-hour day. Both candidates have implicitly or explicitly blamed “public employees” with their “bloated pensions” and waste-filled jobs for our economic woes (with Mr. Obama sending a signal by freezing the pay of federal workers, as if tightening their belts would somehow loosen the noose around the Treasury). The term “public employees” itself evokes faceless bureaucrats, rather than images of firefighters and police officers, E.P.A. scientists monitoring our air and water to protect our children’s health, or the people who get up at the crack of dawn to pick up our trash. Both candidates have been as relentless in their attacks on teachers’ unions as Mr. Reagan was with the air traffic controllers whom he summarily fired for going on strike. Both parties have seen the austerity so many Americans are feeling at the kitchen table and concluded that the answer to austerity is more austerity — with “grand bargains” and “sequestrations” that promise to undo the effects of a stimulus that virtually all economists agree kept us from falling deeper toward a depression in early 2009. Austerity has been a failure almost everywhere governments have tried it, with Spain, where one in four working people is no longer working, being the most recent example. Both parties preach the gospel of free trade, which polls poorly because ordinary Americans can see with their own eyes how we have freely traded the good American wages and benefits away. SO what underlies this powerful pull to the right? Many factors, but two stand out. The first is campaign money. When Americans saw the scope of the savings and loan scandal in the 1980s, which today seems like just a bad day on the unregulated derivatives market, Ronald Reagan’s attorney general, Edwin Meese III, put nearly a thousand bankers behind bars. In contrast, Mr. Obama’s attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., can’t seem to smell the stench of a fraud that cost millions of people their jobs or homes. The second is an ideological vacuum. For years, even Republicans accepted the premises of the New Deal, which drew them leftward just as today’s political winds blow everything in their path rightward. President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the Interstate highway system. President Richard M. Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency. Neither believed in the radical dismantling of programs that protected ordinary Americans, and both believed that a crucial role of government is to provide the infrastructure that makes economic prosperity possible. Then came the conservative movement that ushered in Reagan, whose ideology has dominated our political discourse ever since, even after its proven failure. If Nixon and Bill Clinton were the last gasps of Roosevelt’s breath, then Mr. Bush, Mr. Obama and perhaps Mr. Romney may well be the last gasps of Reagan’s. If the centrifugal pull of the 2012 election is likely to be to the right, is there any potential counterweight? Perhaps one: both presidential candidates want a legacy. The most important legacy Mr. Obama could have would be to spend his second term using executive orders, judicial appointments and the bully pulpit to return democracy to everyday Americans by demanding clean elections, uncorrupted by money. If Mr. Obama wins a close election on the strength of the country’s changing demographics, he may feel a special responsibility to tackle the seemingly intractable problems that a second-term president can more easily address. If Mr. Romney wins and wants a second term, he would be wise to wed an economic narrative about innovation with a narrative that will save his party from extinction by making comprehensive immigration reform a central item on his agenda. If Mr. Romney succeeds in reviving a moderate Republicanism that recognizes that an increasingly interconnected world will require an increasingly diverse work force, he could potentially drag his party into the 21st century. In other words, if the candidate who wins takes a left turn like the one that won him the presidency, the Reagan era would finally be over. We can only hope.

News article: An investigator and his dog search a wooded area Sunday, July 21, 2013 near where three bodies were recently found in East Cleveland, Ohio. Searchers rummaging through vacant houses in a neighborhood... (Associated Press) Authorities who responded to a report of a foul odor and found the bodies of three women in a low-income U.S. neighborhood ended a daylong search without finding others. A registered sex offender was in custody. East Cleveland Police Chief Ralph Spotts had warned searchers to be prepared to find one or two more victims Sunday, but he declined to elaborate. The discovery was the Cleveland area's latest high-profile case of missing women. Earlier this year, three women in an unrelated case were found and freed after being held captive in a home for years. Spotts identified the suspect as 35-year-old Michael Madison and said he was expected to be formally charged Monday. Mayor Gary Norton said the suspect indicated he might have been influenced by Cleveland serial killer Anthony Sowell, who was convicted in 2011 of murdering 11 women and sentenced to death. Sowell was arrested after a woman escaped from his house and said she had been raped. Police found the 11 women's mostly nude bodies in garbage bags and plastic sheets throughout the home. In this latest case, one body was found Friday in a garage. Two others were found Saturday _ one in a backyard and the other in the basement of a vacant house. The three female bodies, all wrapped in plastic bags, were found about 200 yards (182 meters) apart, and authorities believed the victims were killed in the last six to 10 days. Spotts said the suspect's comments hadn't provided clarity on whether more bodies might be found. \\"He really hasn't stated that there's any more, but he hasn't said anything that would make us think that there's not,\\" Spotts said. Sunday's search included 40 abandoned houses. Authorities want to be thorough, the mayor said. \\"Hopefully, we pray to God, this is it,\\" he said. The bodies were each in the fetal position, wrapped in several layers of trash bags, Norton said. Cuyahoga County medical examiner Dr. Thomas P. Gilson said the bodies were in advanced stages of decomposition and that it would take several days to identify them and how they died. It wasn't immediately clear whether Madison had an attorney. No one commented at the address he registered. Madison was classified as a sex offender in 2002 when he was sentenced to four years in prison for attempted rape, according to Cuyahoga County court records. He had previous convictions in 2000 and 2001 for drug-related charges. One neighbor, Nathenia Crosby, said she was familiar with the suspect and had seen him walking through the neighborhood. She said she had told him to stop chatting with her 19-year-old daughter. \\"When I found out how old he was, I said, \`You need to move on, she's too young,'\\" Crosby said. ___ Associated Press writer Peggy Harris in Philadelphia contributed to this report. ||||| EAST CLEVELAND, Ohio -- For the second time in three months and the third time in four years, evidence of haunting crimes against women sprouted in one of Greater Cleveland’s inner-city neighborhoods. Police here Sunday ended a weekend-long search for bodies near East 139th Street and Shaw Avenue, finding no victims besides the three discovered Friday and Saturday. It was a scene familiar for its landscape of abandoned homes, overgrown weeds and television cameras. The world was watching, as it did in May, when three young women were rescued from a Cleveland home after being missing for nearly a decade. Sunday’s scene, where three dead women were found wrapped in plastic bags, also brought reminders of Anthony Sowell, a serial killer from Cleveland’s recent past. Michael Madison was arrested and is expected to be charged today in connection with the deaths. He indicated he was influenced by Sowell, captured in 2009 after killing 11 women and burying them in and around his Imperial Avenue home, said East Cleveland Mayor Gary Norton. Sowell, who is on death row, was a registered sex offender at the time of his crimes. Madison, 35, registered as a sex offender with the Cuyahoga County sheriff after a four-year prison sentence for a 2002 attempted rape conviction. He had pleaded guilty and was given the least serious offender status, which requires yearly registration for 10 years. Madison “said some things in questioning that led us to believe he was influenced by Sowell,” Norton told The Plain Dealer. But Police Chief Ralph Spotts disputed Norton’s account and said Madison never talked admiringly of Sowell. “He’s not being cooperative,” Spotts said of Madison. “He’s not saying there aren’t any more bodies, but he’s not saying there are. He’s playing both sides of the fence.” None of the women, who Norton said were black, has been identified. Spotts said he hopes at least one body is identified today. All three were in advanced states of decomposition, said county Medical Examiner Thomas Gilson. Authorities believe the women had been killed within the last 10 days. The first body was found in a garage Friday morning near the corner of Hayden Avenue and East 139th Street. The other two bodies were found Saturday afternoon, one in heavy weeds about 150 feet from the garage, the other near a broken window inside the basement of a vacant home on East 139th Street. Dozens of law enforcement officials from East Cleveland and other agencies — the FBI, Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Office — returned to the neighborhood Sunday. They spent the afternoon combing an area of vacant homes, overgrown lots, railroad tracks — even bushes and brush behind the Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center. Crews worked north from Strathmore Avenue to Elm Avenue and east from Hayden to Manhattan Avenue. Cues from cadaver dogs raised the possibility of more bodies. At one point in the afternoon it appeared at least one other body had been discovered. Officers had pulled out evidence bags and raised a tarp to block onlookers behind an occupied house at 1374 E. 139th St. But Spotts called off the search about 7 p.m. “We officially found nothing,” he said. “We will not pick up the search again.” Spotts also said officials do not expect to find bodies outside the search area. “We don’t think he took anything he couldn’t carry,” Spotts said. Madison was arrested Friday night after a two-hour standoff at his mother’s Cleveland home. Residents of the East Cleveland neighborhood police searched told reporters that Madison hung out at an apartment near the garage where the one body was discovered. He often walked the neighborhood and talked to women aggressively, they said. Eric Wilson, 40, said he’s known Madison since their days at Euclid High School, where Wilson was four years ahead of Madison. Wilson said he saw Madison frequently in the area where the bodies were found. Several weeks ago Madison appeared in the neighborhood with scratches all over him, Wilson said. He told people he had gotten into a fight with a woman. “He was kind of quiet,” Wilson said. “He never created a conversation. But if you talked to him too long he’d say some kind of demented things.” When pressed for an example, Wilson said: “He hated women.” The weekend discoveries made international news, with organizations such as CNN and the BBC devoting attention to the case. The same organizations poured into Cleveland in May when Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight escaped a Seymour Avenue home where authorities said they had been held captive for roughly a decade. Ariel Castro, 52, faces 977 criminal counts in that case, including charges of kidnapping, rape and two counts of aggravated murder related to claims that he beat and tortured one of the women into miscarrying a child. Prosecutors have accused Castro of kidnapping the women and raping them repeatedly in his home, where he sometimes kept them chained or tied. The first of the victims was kidnapped in 2002. A lawyer for Castro has said some of the charges against his client cannot be refuted and that if the death penalty is not sought, a plea deal could be worked out. Sowell was convicted in 2011 of killing Tonia Carmichael, Nancy Cobbs, Tishana Culver, Crystal Dozier, Telacia Fortson, Amy Hunter, Leshanda Long, Michelle Mason, Kim Y. Smith, Diane Turner and Janice Webb. Prosecutors said he lured his victims to his Imperial Avenue home, where he bound, strangled and discarded them. Sowell was convicted of multiple counts of aggravated murder and a slate of other offenses for their deaths. He also was found guilty of attempting to kill three other women. A judge sentenced him to death, based on a jury's recommendation. ||||| EAST CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Law enforcement officials here have ended their search for more bodies in a neighborhood where three others have been found since Friday. After hours of work involving dozens of officers and dozens of buildings, Police Chief Ralph Spotts told reporters about 7 p.m. Sunday that crews were done for the time being. \\"We officially found nothing,\\" Spotts said. Authorities had been searching the area near East 139th Street and Hayden and Shaw avenues since Saturday, after the bodies of two dead women were found close to where a third women's body was found Friday. Cadaver dogs brought to the scene Sunday signaled the possibility of more bodies. At one point in the afternoon it appeared another body had been discovered. Officers had pulled out evidence bags and raised a tarp to block onlookers behind an occupied house at 1374 E. 139th St. A suspect, arrested Friday, hung out at an apartment near the garage and often walked the neighborhood and talked to women, residents said. Michael Madison, 35, of Cleveland, was arrested Friday night after a two-hour standoff at his mother's home on Chickasaw Avenue. Spotts said charges against Madison are likely Monday. A news conference is scheduled for 11 a.m. Spotts also said Sunday evening that Madison is not being cooperative. The chief did not believe crews would search beyond for bodies beyond the Hayden and Shaw area. “We don’t think he took anything he couldn’t carry,\\" said Spotts, meaning that police believe it's unlikely there would be bodies far from the scene. The three women have not been identified. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office said Sunday that the bodies are in advanced stages of decomposition, so determining identities and cause of death may take several days. \\"We are not currently requesting families of missing persons to submit DNA specimens as part the identification process, but we will advise the public should this step become necessary,\\" Medical Examiner Thomas Gilson said in a news release. Sunday's search focused on weeded lots, railroad tracks and 50 or more abandoned homes in the area was winding down today. About 30 residents and police fanned out at noon, hoping to find nothing.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which person studied less about Energy in ATP ? Ben and Andy studied minerals and micro-nutrients. Ben studied more about magnesium, zinc and molybdenum, while his buddy Andy studied about sodium and potassium. Hint: Sodium and potassium are two of the most important elements in living things. They are present mainly as positively charged ions dissolved in water. The sodium-potassium pump moves sodium ions (Na + ) out of the cell and potassium ions (K + ) into the cell. In both cases, the ions are moving from an area of lower to higher concentration. Energy in ATP is needed for this \\"uphill\\" process. Figure below shows how this pump works. Trace these steps from left to right in the figure Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, both Ben and Andy studied minerals and micro-nutrients. However, Andy studied about sodium and potassium, elements that are directly related to the sodium-potassium pump, which in turn is connected to the energy in ATP. Since Ben studied about magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum, which are not mentioned as being related to energy in ATP, we can conclude that Ben studied less about Energy in ATP than Andy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \\"Hammer A Nail\\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \\"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\\" Ono had supposedly not heard of the Beatles, but relented on condition that Lennon pay her five shillings, to which Lennon replied, \\"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\\" Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work Apple, much to her fury.Ono began to telephone and visit Lennon at his home. When Cynthia asked him for an explanation, Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her \\"avant-garde bullshit\\". While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the Two Virgins album, after which, he said, they \\"made love at dawn\\". When Lennon's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, \\"Oh, hi.\\" Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child on 21 November 1968, a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted.Two years before the Beatles disbanded, Lennon and Ono began public protests against the Vietnam War. They were married in Gibraltar on 20 March 1969, and spent their honeymoon at the Hilton Amsterdam, campaigning with a week-long Bed-In for Peace. They planned another Bed-In in the United States but were denied entry, so they held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, where they recorded \\"Give Peace a Chance\\".

Afraid for his life, he frequently tries to enlist in martial arts classes at a local dojo, only to have his applications mysteriously (read: deliberately) vanish. To further matters, the local minister turns the sermon at an Easter mass from the passion and resurrection of Christ to matters of Sodom and Gomorrah at the very sight of McClain and his mother entering the church to join in the ceremony. In the dojo's defense, they turn young McClain away not directly because of his sexual orientation, but because they fear losing their students over the matter. In fact, the family that runs the dojo has had some acceptance issues of their own to deal with, not just because of being Asian, but actually because of being multi-ethnic, with Irish, Asian, and even Filipino members and relatives. They're also of mixed faiths, with the grandparents devout Buddhists and one of their sons a Christian actively involved with the local church. The family has a very proud tradition of teaching the martial arts throughout the generations, a tradition that sadly is not open to the women of the family, as we learn when we are introduced to Karen O'Neil (played by the film's director D.

Q:Given the below context: Temperley writes: \\"After 1855 [Bennett] was spurred by belated honours, and occasional commissions, to compose a respectable number of significant and substantial works, though it was too late to recapture his early self-confidence.\\" Works from his later years included the cello Sonata Duo for Piatti; a pastoral cantata, The May Queen, Op. 39, for the opening of the Leeds Town Hall in 1858; an Ode (Op. 40) with words by Alfred, Lord Tennyson for the opening of the 1862 International Exhibition in London; an Installation Ode for Cambridge University (Op. 41) with words by Charles Kingsley, which included a lament for the late Prince Albert; a symphony in G minor (Op. 43); a sacred cantata,The Woman of Samaria for the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival of 1867; and finally a second Piano Sonata (The Maid of Orleans, Op. 46). Many of these works were composed during his summer holidays which were spent at Eastbourne. The Ode for the Exhibition was the cause of a further imbroglio with Costa, who although in charge of music for the Exhibition refused to conduct anything by Bennett. Eventually it was conducted by Prosper Sainton, between works by Meyerbeer and Daniel Auber also commissioned for the occasion. The affair leaked into the press, and Costa was widely condemned for his behaviour.In March 1856 Bennett, while still teaching at the RAM and Queen's College, was elected Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge. He modernised the system of awarding music degrees, instituting viva voce examinations and requiring candidates for doctorates to first take the degree of Bachelor of Music. Two years later on 8 June 1868 the newly formed (later Royal) College of Organists awarded him an Honorary Fellowship.In 1858 came yet another clash involving Costa, when the autocratic Earl of Westmorland, the original founder of the RAM, saw fit to arrange a subscription concert for the Academy to include a Mass of his own composition, to be conducted by Costa and using the orchestra and singers of the Opera, over the...

The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval.

But they did see some signs of who might have done it. At the same time, a different group from the UN looked at 14 other times when these chemical attacks might have happened. They found that both sides in a big disagreement had done bad things called war crimes. The people in charge of the Assad regime had also done something called crimes against humanity. The other side, the rebels, didn't do this, but only because their leaders are harder to figure out. All of this happened after Syria said they have chemical weapons and agreed to stop using them. The Assad government said this was a \\"victory,\\" but the rebels think something different. They believe Assad won't keep his promise and will use other weapons to fight them. In fact, things got worse in some places, with lots of loud and scary bombs falling and many people getting hurt. An expert on these things said the Assad regime was fighting back \\"with a vengeance.\\" Some rebels also said their friends from other countries are sending them weapons, but only smaller ones that won't help them win the fight.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: vampires for the following movie plot: The film is narrated by a troubled Edgar Allan Poe (Klaus Kinski). It begins with Poe's attempts to confirm a ghost story by examining the ghosts' tombs; however, he doesn't go too far to avoid being haunted and killed. Later, a journalist named Alan Foster (Anthony Franciosa) visits Poe to drive him out of madness, but he is forced to challenge the horror writer on the authenticity of his stories. This leads to Foster's accepting a bet from Lord Blackwood to spend the night in a haunted castle on All Soul's Eve. Foster is surprised by ghosts who appear to be half-humans, in very effective and horrifying special effects. Ghosts of the murdered inhabitants appear to him throughout the night, re-enacting the events that led to their respective deaths and driving Foster to madness. He meets the following ghosts: Elisabeth Blackwood (MichÃ¨le Mercier) who falls in love with Foster; the annoying and easy-to-hate Julia (Karin Field); the rough criminal William Perkins (Silvano Tranquilli); and the most despicable one of all, Dr. Carmus (Peter Carsten). Near the end of the film, the ghosts reveal their true nature: they aren't actually ghosts but vampires with ghostly powers, and they need Foster's blood in order to maintain their existence. Because she loves him, Elisabeth tries to save Foster by aiding his escape. He succeeds in escaping the castle, but not the garden... Distracted and careless, he pushes the door so hard that he is smashed between the two gates and is sliced to death by razors on the main gate. But at least he isn't transformed into a vampire.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

Kiedis was lyrically influenced by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love. Songs written for the album such as \\"By the Way,\\" \\"I Could Die for You,\\" \\"Dosed,\\" \\"Warm Tape\\" and non-album tracks \\"Someone\\" and \\"Body of Water\\" all digressed into the many sides of love. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he'd only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like \\"This Is the Place\\" and \\"Don't Forget Me\\" expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug-dependency). He referenced early Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in \\"This Is the Place\\" and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: \\"On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean.\\" \\"Venice Queen\\" was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California's Venice Beach.

You need sports tape to tape your foot using this method. You can get rolls of sports tape at superstores, supermarkets, or drugstores.","completion":"Step 1: Clean and dry your foot Before taping, make sure your foot is clean and dry. This will ensure that the tape adheres properly and stays in place during movement. Remove any dirt, oil, or sweat by washing your foot and then thoroughly drying it with a clean towel. Step 2: Cut strips of sports tape Depending on the size of your foot, cut four to five strips of sports tape about 10-12 inches long. This should be enough for taping your foot for plantar fasciitis. Step 3: Apply anchor strips Sit down and position your foot so that the sole is facing up. Apply a strip of sports tape horizontally across the ball of your foot (just below your toes), making sure not to pull the tape too tight. This is the anchor strip, which will hold all your other tape strips in place. Make sure that the tape adheres well to your skin by pressing it down and smoothing out any wrinkles or air bubbles. Step 4: Apply support strips Starting from the anchor strip, apply a support strip diagonally across the bottom of your foot, pulling it up and around your heel, and then overlapping the anchor strip on the other side of your foot. Make sure to keep the tape taut, but avoid applying too much tension. You want the tape to provide support without restricting blood flow or movement. Repeat this process with two or three more strips, applying each strip in a crisscross pattern to provide maximum support. Step 5: Apply top anchor strip To secure the support strips in place, apply another horizontal strip across the top of your foot, just below your ankle. This will act as the top anchor, holding the support strips in place and providing additional stability. Again, don't pull the tape too tight – you want to be able to move your foot comfortably. Step 6: Smooth out the tape and test for comfort Smooth out any wrinkles or air bubbles in the tape to ensure it is securely adhered to your skin. Then, gently flex and move your foot to test the tape for comfort and effectiveness. Step 7: Adjust if necessary If the tape feels too tight or uncomfortable, carefully peel it off and reapply it with less tension or using fewer support strips. The goal is to provide support and alleviate pain, so it's essential to feel comfortable with the tape. Step 8: Wear supportive footwear While taping is helpful in providing support and relieving pain, it is also important to wear supportive footwear when walking or exercising to help prevent further injury to your plantar fascia. Shoes with proper arch support or orthotic insoles designed for plantar fasciitis can be beneficial. By following these steps, you'll successfully tape your foot for plantar fasciitis and potentially experience relief from pain and discomfort associated with this condition. Remember to check the tape periodically and replace it as needed, especially after activities that cause sweating or if it becomes loose."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake.

Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound.

Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried.

Premise: \\"difficulty understanding the owner's project performance expectations.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"a hard time comprehending what the owner wants\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, \\"difficulty understanding the owner's project performance expectations,\\" it is accurate to assume that the hypothesis \\"a hard time comprehending what the owner wants\\" is indeed true. The premise and the hypothesis are aligned in describing the situation where someone struggles to understand the project owner's desired outcomes and expectations. In order to delve further into this, let's examine each segment of the hypothesis and correlate it with the given premise. 1. \\"A hard time\\" - This directly connects to the term \\"difficulty\\" used in the premise and signifies that the person is facing challenges in grasping the expectations. 2. \\"Comprehending\\" - This word echoes \\"understanding\\" in the premise and denotes the mental process of grasping or assimilating information. 3. \\"What the owner wants\\" - This key phrase ties back to \\"the owner's project performance expectations\\" from the premise. Both expressions suggest that the challenge experienced by the individual revolves around understanding the desired outcomes or goals set forth by the owner of the project. From this detailed analysis, it is evident that the hypothesis \\"a hard time comprehending what the owner wants\\" is true based on the provided premise. The hypothesis essentially rephrases the premise in a slightly different, yet equally valid way. Having established the link between the premise and the hypothesis, it is essential to consider how this comprehension issue could impact the overall project. If team members or project managers have difficulty fully understanding the performance expectations, it can lead to misalignment in project objectives and deliverables, delayed timelines, and possibly unsatisfactory outcomes for the project owner. It is crucial for effective communication, goal setting, and monitoring to be in place to ensure everyone involved in the project is on the same page and works towards a common objective that meets the owner's expectations. This can be facilitated by using detailed project scopes, regular meetings, and various communication channels tailored to the project's needs and the owner's preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","completion":"The government hopes to significantly alleviate the tax burden and increase foreign investment. This sentence in Turkish conveys that the government is planning to take measures to reduce the tax burden on its citizens, businesses, and other entities in a significant way. The primary goal of this action is to attract more foreign investment into the country by creating a more favorable economic environment for investors. By reducing the tax burden, the government aims to make the country more competitive on the global stage and encourage foreign companies to invest, expand, or even relocate their operations. Foreign investment is a key driver of economic growth, as it provides an inflow of capital, new technologies, and business practices, as well as promoting competitiveness and creating jobs. Providing a more attractive tax environment can incentivize investors to choose a country over others and bring positive economic impacts. There can be various ways for the government to alleviate the tax burden, such as lowering the corporate tax rates, providing tax exemptions or tax holidays for specific industries or investment projects, and simplifying the tax system for easier compliance. Additionally, the government may introduce other policies to support and complement these tax measures, such as improving the regulatory environment, investing in infrastructure, and ensuring a stable political landscape. While these measures can foster a more investment-friendly climate and contribute to the country's economic growth, there can also be potential drawbacks. Reduced tax revenues may limit the government's capacity to fund public services and social programs, and increased foreign investment can lead to concerns about preserving national interests. Therefore, striking a balance between attracting foreign investment and maintaining adequate public resources is essential for implementing such policies effectively. In summary, the government's plan to significantly alleviate the tax burden as expressed in the Turkish sentence aims to attract more foreign investment, ultimately contributing to the country's economic growth and development. However, it is crucial to consider potential drawbacks and maintain a balanced approach when implementing these measures."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 45*p - 1703 = -15*p - 83 for p.","completion":"To solve the equation 45 * p - 1703 = -15 * p - 83 for p, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Add 15 * p to both sides of the equation. This will isolate the variable p on one side of the equation and all constants on the other side. 45 * p - 1703 + 15 * p = -15 * p - 83 + 15 * p Simplifying both sides of the equation: (45 * p + 15 * p) - 1703 = -83 Step 2: Combine the p terms on the left side. Sum the coefficients of p terms: 45p + 15p = 60p So the equation becomes: 60 * p - 1703 = -83 Step 3: Add 1703 to both sides of the equation. This will move the constant term to the other side of the equation and leave only the term with the variable on the left side. 60 * p - 1703 + 1703 = -83 + 1703 Simplifying both sides of the equation: 60 * p = 1620 Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by 60. This will isolate the variable p on the left side. (60 * p) / 60 = 1620 / 60 Simplifying both sides of the equation: p = 27 So the solution for the equation 45 * p - 1703 = -15 * p - 83 is p = 27."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

We have this equation: 0 = 45*k + 65 - 181 - 109 First, let's deal with the numbers. We need to combine them. So, let's add 65, then subtract 181, and finally subtract 109. Here's what we get: 65 - 181 = -116 Now, -116 - 109 = -225 Now our equation looks like this: 0 = 45*k - 225 We need to solve for k, which means we want to find the value of k that makes the equation true. Let's add 225 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -225: 0 + 225 = 45*k - 225 + 225 This simplifies to: 225 = 45*k Now, we just have to divide both sides of the equation by 45 to find the value of k: 225 / 45 = 45*k / 45 Which simplifies to: 5 = k And there you have it!

This is because the majority of those sales in 1954–55 were to the \\"hillbilly\\" market in the South and Southwestern United States, where replacing the family 78 rpm player with a new 45 rpm player was a luxury few could afford at the time. By the end of 1957, RCA Victor announced that 78s accounted for less than 10% of Presley's singles sales, essentially announcing the death throes of the 78 rpm format. The last Presley single released on 78 in the United States was RCA Victor 20-7410, I Got Stung/One Night (1958), while the last 78 in the UK was RCA 1194, A Mess Of Blues/Girl Of My Best Friend (1960).\\". Can you tell me what it is?","completion":"Certainly! The passage you provided primarily discusses the transition from 78 rpm records to 45 rpm records in the mid-1950s, using Elvis Presley's early singles as an example. However, it does not explicitly mention the media platforms on which music could be found. In a broader context, music can be found on various media platforms depending on the era and technological advancements. Here is a comprehensive list of the main media platforms for music: 1. Vinyl Records (1948 - present): Music was first produced on vinyl records available in different formats, including 78 rpm (mentioned in your passage), 45 rpm (singles), and 33⅓ rpm (albums). 2. Reel-to-Reel Tapes (1940s - 1980s): These magnetic tapes were used by professionals and audiophiles before being phased out in favor of cassette tapes and other formats. 3. 8-Track Tapes (1960s - 1980s): A popular car audio format, 8-track tapes allowed users to switch between tracks quickly, although they faced limitations in sound quality and durability. 4. Cassette Tapes (1960s - 1990s): Cassettes were a portable and affordable medium for music consumption, contributing to the rise of the mixtape culture in the 1980s and 1990s. 5. Compact Discs (CDs) (1982 - present): CDs offered a digital format with better sound quality and durability than previous formats but became less popular due to the rise of digital downloads. 6. Digital Downloads (late 1990s - present): With the launch of platforms like iTunes and Napster, consumers could purchase and download individual songs or entire albums, paving the way for digital music consumption. 7. Streaming Services (mid-2000s - present): Online platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube provide access to vast music libraries and playlists through monthly subscriptions or free ad-supported options.

While I was young when this album came out, I continued to listen to and appreciate it more and more as I got older and to this day, still listen to it at least once a week.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate? While Raff was able to offer \\"practical suggestions [in orchestration] which were of great value to Liszt\\", there may have been \\"a basic misunderstanding\\" of the nature of their collaboration. Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me.\\"Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff. Walker writes that Joachim later recalled to Raff's widow \\"that he had seen Raff 'produce full orchestral scores from piano sketches.'\\" Joachim also told Raff's biographer Andreas Moser that \\"the E-flat-major Piano Concerto was orchestrated from beginning to end by Raff.\\" Raff's and Joachim's statements effectively questioned the authorship of Liszt's orchestral music, especially the symphonic poems. This speculation was debased when composer and Liszt scholar Peter Raabe carefully compared all sketches then known of Liszt's orchestral works with the published versions of the same works. Raabe demonstrated that, regardless of the position with first drafts, or of how much assistance Liszt may have received from Raff or Conradi at that point, every note of the final versions represents Liszt's intentions.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". On 1 March 1951 Mao sent a cable to Stalin, in which he emphasized the difficulties faced by Chinese forces and the urgent need for air cover, especially over supply lines. Apparently impressed by the Chinese war effort, Stalin finally agreed to supply two air force divisions, three anti-aircraft divisions, and six thousand trucks. PVA troops in Korea continued to suffer severe logistical problems throughout the war. In late April Peng Dehuai sent his deputy, Hong Xuezhi, to brief Zhou Enlai in Beijing. What Chinese soldiers feared, Hong said, was not the enemy, but that they had nothing to eat, no bullets to shoot, and no trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded. Zhou attempted to respond to the PVA's logistical concerns by increasing Chinese production and improving methods of supply, but these efforts were never completely sufficient. At the same time, large-scale air defense training programs were carried out, and the Chinese Air Force began to participate in the war from September 1951 onward.

Q: David Gauntlett makes a good point in his newest book (Making Media Studies: The Creativity Turn in Media and Communications Studies) and that is that traditional forms of media studies are no longer applicable. Gone are the days of massive institutions and production companies, gone are the traditional audiences and simplistic texts. In, is the new age media companies, the everyday media makers, the consistent consumers and the fantastical mess of The WWW. While universities are pumping out the same content areas since the 1980’s (e.g. institutions, production, audiences and texts) that are only relevant to a handful of media forms (cinema, television, online broadcasting and publications), the rest of the world is moving on. David Gauntlett so rightly says that creativity in media, should also refer to thinking creatively about the subject. What are the new ways of running media and communication studies? How has the subject itself changed? What approaches and methods can help media and communications studies to become innovative and useful in spheres beyond itself? David Gauntlett encourages a kind of call to arms, an acquiescence of the incapacities of the old system and a redirected gaze to the future needs of media students and media studies programs. Inspired by Tim Ingold’s book Making, David believes media studies should have making at it’s front and centre. He also believes the ability to do things with media should be embraced over and above the ability to talk about what others do with media, or what media does to us. The notion is that media studies should be hands on, that it should be all about ideas and critical engagement and this should be expressed through actual making. To borrow three key distinctions from the anthropologist Tim Ingold: 1. It’s about learning WITH media rather than ABOUT media. 2. There is an intent to move FORWARD rather than looking BACKWARDS at how things are. 3. It’s aims are TRANSFORMATIONAL rather than DOCUMENTARY.

Please bear with. I first came to the DC/NOVA area via the US Army. It had a very small town feel. I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before. Nothing is too grossly indulgent anymore and they throw away vast amounts of money trying to one up the last kids party without giving a thought to what a kid needs or the fact they are teaching kids that over indulgence is okay. Now, my son and I were invited to a birthday party for this FIVE year old. The sole Parent had rented the club house, surrounding grounds and pool area of a local country club.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Starting college can be a difficult experience. You have to deal with new responsibilities and growing independence, a challenging course load and, of course, the social scene. When a roommate is thrown into the mix, it may feel like you're struggling with all that stuff while living in a small box with a stranger. But having a roommate doesn't need to be one more thing to worry about. When students go into their living situations with realistic expectations and a willingness to compromise, things can work out just fine. When you first meet your roommate, chances are you'll be on your best behaviour. You want to get along, since this is the person who's going to be sharing your living space for the next year. But try to think ahead to potential worst cases, too. For example, imagine it's 2 a.m. and you're working on a paper that should be finished in 8 hours. Your roommate comes in from a party and wants to continue the party in your room. At times like these, you won't be feeling good. That's why talking about problems that might come up ahead of time -- and respecting each other's wishes when the time comes -- is so important. Talk about the things that are really important to you, and make sure your roommate understands. Then encourage him or her to do the same. For example, does it make you angry when people take things without asking first? Let your roommate know your feelings about these types of things from the start, so that both of you have a feel for each other's likes, dislikes, and habits. Answer:","completion":"Question: What is an essential aspect of successfully sharing a living space with a roommate in college? A. Ignoring each other's habits and preferences B.

Trace fossils such as tracks and burrows found in the Tonian period indicate the presence of triploblastic worms, like metazoans, roughly as large (about 5 mm wide) and complex as earthworms. During the beginning of the Tonian period around 1 billion years ago, there was a decrease in Stromatolite diversity, which may indicate the appearance of grazing animals, since stromatolite diversity increased when grazing animals went extinct at the End Permian and End Ordovician extinction events, and decreased shortly after the grazer populations recovered. However the discovery that tracks very similar to these early trace fossils are produced today by the giant single-celled protist Gromia sphaerica casts doubt on their interpretation as evidence of early animal evolution.

Michael Cromwell is a self-absorbed, successful commodities broker living in New York City. Wanting to marry his new fiancée Charlotte, he needs to obtain a final divorce from his first wife Patricia who left him some years earlier. Patricia now lives with a semi-Westernised tribe in Canaima National Park, Venezuela. Michael travels there to get her signature on divorce papers, but upon arriving, discovers that he has a 13-year-old son named Mimi-Siku. Michael attempts to bond with Mimi-Siku in his brief stay with the tribe and promises to take him to New York \\"when he is a man.\\" Michael is also given a new name, Baboon, as is a custom in the tribe. That night, Mimi-Siku undergoes the traditional rite of passage of his tribe, who then considers him to be a man. The tribal elder gives Mimi a special task: to become a tribal leader one day, Mimi must bring fire from the Statue of Liberty and he looks forward to traveling with his father. Against his own protests, Michael brings Mimi-Siku to New York with him. Michael works as a trader at the World Trade Center in building 7. Michael's fiancée, Charlotte, is less than pleased about the unexpected visitor in a loin cloth outfit, who tries to urinate in front of her at a fake tree (as is usual in his tribe), suggests eating her cat, and Maitika, his enormous pet tarantula escapes from his box and into her apartment. Mimi-Siku wears traditional dress during much of his stay in New York. As Michael attempts to adapt Mimi-Siku to city life, cross-cultural misunderstandings occur when Mimi-Siku reverts to customs considered acceptable by his tribe. On climbing the Statue of Liberty to reach the flame, Mimi-Siku is disappointed when he sees that the fire is not real. Answer:","completion":"Charlotte, Michael Cromwell's fiancée, is displeased by Mimi-Siku's arrival in New York City. Michael, a successful commodities broker, brings his 13-year-old son Mimi-Siku to the city after discovering his existence during a trip to Canaima National Park, Venezuela. Mimi-Siku, who had been living with a semi-Westernized tribe with his mother Patricia, is not accustomed to the norms and conventions of urban American life. Several incidents contribute to Charlotte's displeasure with Mimi-Siku's presence. Firstly, due to a cultural misunderstanding, Mimi-Siku tries to urinate in front of her at a fake tree, as this is a common practice in his tribe. Additionally, he suggests eating Charlotte's pet cat and allows Maitika, his enormous pet tarantula, to escape from its box and enter her apartment. Moreover, Mimi-Siku's traditional dress and unfamiliarity with city life create further cross-cultural misunderstandings as he attempts to adapt to his new environment. For example, he is disappointed to discover that the fire in the Statue of Liberty is not real during an attempt to fulfill his tribal task of obtaining fire from the iconic monument. Overall, Charlotte's displeasure with Mimi-Siku's arrival stems from the unexpected nature of his presence, cultural differences, and the disruption he causes to her life with Michael. As Mimi-Siku's father, Michael is responsible for helping his son adapt to a new culture and lifestyle, which creates tension between him, Charlotte, and Mimi-Siku as they navigate this challenging situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The unbelievable video, which looks like the couple have been held hostage in North Korea, was played to court on Monday as Heard and Depp were in attendance. It was later released by their No. 1 enemy, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, on his Facebook page. \\"Australia is free of many pests and diseases that are commonplace around the world.

I really really want to give this place more than 2 stars because I have been to other locations and liked them quite a bit. And truthfully the food was quite good. However the service was severely, SEVERELY lacking. Positives: Like I said, food was good. Drinks were brought promptly, etc. etc. Negatives: Our waitress. She said she was new, so maybe the blame should ultimately be placed on the management for lack of adequate training. First off, we had a table of 7 and she said for tables of 8 or more they don't do separate checks. So when we repeated that we only had 7 at our table, she still gave us attitude about having to split checks. I know it's a pain in the butt but no one in our party had cash.... Then she forgot a few of our drinks. They were brought promptly but when you forget a few, and also forget the waters we ordered and never come back to check on us again until you bring our food out, we may have a problem. So 2 people we were with went about 20 minutes without drinks while the rest of us were sipping our beer and wine (and missing our waters.) When we went to order our food, a guy we were with asked what came on his sandwich and she replied \\"well you can read can't you?\\" Um. Ok. Then our food came out. We ate it, liked it, and then sat there for about a half hour after we had all finished eating. We were upstairs and there was almost nobody else up there so I'm not sure why it took so long for her to come back and pick up our plates (or ask us if we wanted more drinks?) She finally came back and we asked for the checks, she brought them and we paid. And then sat there again for about a half hour. At this point we were all super frustrated. It took a bartender to realize how long we'd been sitting there and he finally came and took care of our checks. UGH. All in all, I love there food and that they cater so well to us gluten free folk.

The reviewer expresses a sense of disappointment and frustration with the service they experienced at the restaurant. They really wanted to give the place more than 2 stars, likely due to their previous positive experiences at the other locations and the good food they had at this particular visit. There are several factors contributing to the negative sentiment: 1. The service: The reviewer explicitly complains about the poor service they received, calling it \\"severely, SEVERELY lacking.\\" They mention the waitress's (who was new) shortcomings, including attitude while splitting checks, forgetting drinks, not checking on the table frequently enough, and leaving them waiting for a long time before clearing their table or processing their payment. 2. Management: The reviewer suggests that perhaps the blame should be placed on the management for not providing adequate training to the new waitress, which might have led to the subpar service. However, there are elements that convey positive aspects as well: 1. The food: The reviewer acknowledges that the food was quite good, which appears to be the primary reason they wish they could give the place more stars. 2. Prompt drinks: The drinks were brought promptly by the waitress, which is appreciated by the reviewer. 3. Gluten-free offerings: The reviewer appreciates the restaurant's catering to gluten-free customers, indicating that they would still consider the place for its food offerings. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review can be characterized as mixed with a tendency towards negative, largely due to the dissatisfaction with the service.

But by the time you finish this puzzle by Joel Fagliano and Byron Walden, you’ll be seeing them. I can almost guarantee it. And the most evil part of the joke in today’s puzzle is that the revealer is staring you right in the face the whole time. It just hits us MUGGLES late in the game, as Mr. Walden says below, because it uses the crossword convention of starring clues to trick the solver into complacency. Then it delivers a one-two punch when you realize that those starred clues are starred not just to call our attention to the theme. They’re there because they are part of the clues themself. This was one of the hardest Sunday puzzles I can remember doing, mostly because 1) Byron “I’ve Read Shelley’s ‘Epipsychidion,’ Haven’t You?” Walden is involved, and b) there is no obvious indication that you are supposed to mentally add the word “star” to the beginnings of each clue to get the answers. Well, there is, but it took me a while to get that. (It’s the asterisks, Deb.) I stumbled onto RIGHT SIDE at 38A through the crossings, but I couldn’t for the life of me figure out what the starred clue “Board” had to do with it. I knew something was up, because of the starred clue, but that was way before I understood what was happening. The way it’s supposed to be read is “[Star] Board,” which is, of course, the nautical RIGHT SIDE. Similarly, at 60A, we have “”[Star]Ted talks, say” for BROKERED A SETTLEMENT. Oh, and Mr. Fagliano’s and Mr. Walden’s clues are pretty tough, too. Although “Take its toll” made me laugh. Please wait here while I go bang my head on something hard. O.K., I’m back. You’ve got this, right? You understand that ROMEO AND JULIET are not literally a “Crossed pair,” right? Nicely done, Mr. Fagliano and Mr. Walden. Absolutely “Stellar Work.” Byron Walden: The idea for the puzzle was Joel’s. I was psyched when he asked me to collaborate on it, because I like puzzles that play with crossword conventions, and I am a big fan of Joel’s puzzles generally. For an easy puzzle, you want the structure of the theme to be evident right away. For a trickier puzzle, you want the revelation to come right at, or possibly just after the end. For this one, I envisioned the typical solver getting it somewhere in the middle, maybe just past halfway through. Too soon, and it becomes just a slightly odd themeless. Too late, and the joy of the joke gets washed away. Hopefully, we found the right mix. Joel Fagliano: Had a ton of fun putting this together with Byron. One thing we debated in the theme stage was whether a clue like “*Search party?” for ED MCMAHON was fair game — after all, it completely eliminates the quote marks used in the show “Star Search,” not to mention the space between “Star” and “Search.” In the end, we agreed it might be a little cheap, but that hopefully it would add an extra “aha” layer for the solver. We both favor wide-open grid patterns and constructing challenges, so our styles meshed pretty well when it came time to fill the grid. I’ve always felt that Byron is one of the best themeless constructors, so the task of working on a Sunday with him with big chunky corners like this was very cool. In the end, I think we kept the compromises to a relative minimum while working in some nice longer fill, but I’ll be interested to read how solvers felt. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The Sunday crossword puzzle by Joel Fagliano and Byron Walden challenges solvers by using asterisks as part of the clues, requiring players to add the word \\"star\\" to the beginning of each clue to reveal the correct answers, resulting in a tough yet entertaining experience that plays with traditional crossword conventions. The constructors aimed to strike a balance between providing a tricky puzzle and maintaining the joy of solving by allowing the realization of the theme to emerge partway through the game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(B). positive.).","completion":"Title: Timeless Horizon Rating: 1.5/5 stars In the world of cinema, Timeless Horizon was expected to deliver an experience that would be memorable, leaving audiences wanting more. Unfortunately, it failed to live up to those expectations and ultimately earned itself a negative sentiment. Despite featuring a star-studded cast, the film turned out to be a disappointing endeavor, and this review will be dissecting the aspects of the movie that left much to be desired. To begin with, the most stunning aspect is the lackluster plot that spectators had to endure. Timeless Horizon promised to deliver a thrilling adventure and emotional ride in a breathtaking world, while the plot ended up feeling like an unseasoned dish. The movie follows a group of astronauts, embarking on a journey to explore uncharted territories in search of a new habitable planet. Unlike other films in the genre, the storytelling fell short, leaving audiences disconnected from both the characters and the overall adventure. It seemed as though the plot was filled with countless subplots that only served to confuse, rather than enhance the narrative. Performance-wise, it is quite unbelievable that experienced and talented actors such as Emily Watson, Joseph Owens, and Richard Sparks were unable to save this sinking ship. Their performances were underwhelming, which can be attributed to a poorly-written script and weak character development. The dialogue was uninspiring and often felt forced, while the chemistry between the stellar cast was unexpectedly non-existent. This resulted in the characters coming across as one-dimensional and not at all relatable. The fact that none of the actors seemed to have a genuine connection with their respective characters became apparent throughout the movie. Moreover, Timeless Horizon is plagued with inconsistencies and plot holes. It feels like the filmmakers failed to pay attention to even the most basic details in the story. Scientific inaccuracies, unclear timelines, and unexplained character actions only serve to create more confusion and frustration for the viewers. Even in the realm of science fiction, a certain level of cohesion and plausibility is expected, but this film overlooks these essential elements. However, one aspect that could have redeemed this movie was its visuals. Yet, the special effects employed in Timeless Horizon were mediocre at best, and served as another source of disappointment. The CGI seemed rushed, unrealistic, and not in sync with the surroundings. Considering the genre and the film's potential to deeply explore the vast landscapes of space, greater emphasis on the visual elements could have significantly improved the cinematic experience. In conclusion, Timeless Horizon stands out as a perfect example of a wasted opportunity in the realm of science fiction and adventure. With a weak plot, poor character development, unconvincing performances, and sub-par visuals, the movie falls far short of reaching its purported epic status. It is a film that undeniably earns its negative sentiment and serves as a cautionary tale for future filmmakers delving into the exploration of the great beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Buy Photo A shoplifting suspect fleeing from police caused a three-vehicle crash near Fountain Square that killed a woman and left two people in critical condition, Monday, June 8, 2015. (Photo: Kelly Wilkinson/The Star)Buy Photo A theft suspect fleeing police ran a red light in Fountain Square and slammed his SUV into a pickup truck and car Monday morning, killing the 63-year-old woman driving the truck and seriously injuring two others. Matthew Edmonds, 21, Indianapolis, is facing preliminary charges of resisting law enforcement, theft and driving while suspended with a prior conviction in the incident, which began shortly after 8 a.m. at the Walmart in Beech Grove and ended 12 minutes later at Prospect Street and State Avenue. The crash killed Donna Niblock, 63, Indianapolis, who was pronounced dead at Eskenazi Hospital. Her 11-year-old grandson was listed in critical condition Monday at Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health. LaDonna Rogers, 37, Indianapolis, another passenger in the pickup driven by Niblock, was listed in serious condition at Eskenazi Hospital. The driver of the other car was not injured. Details of the theft-in-progress report that prompted Edmonds to flee police were not available Monday. Beech Grove police received the report at 8:07 a.m. A responding officer spotted the suspect's vehicle, a silver Chevy Tahoe, leaving the store parking lot and began to follow it north in the 4600 block of South Emerson Avenue. The Beech Grove officer activated his emergency lights in an attempt to stop Edmonds but, instead of stopping, the vehicle sped off on Emerson. Beech Grove police briefly chased Edmonds — who was driving at a high rate of speed and briefly traveling west in the eastbound lanes of Raymond Street — before calling off the pursuit three minutes later because of safety concerns. As police from Beech Grove chased Edmonds north on Emerson, then west on Raymond, the pursuit moved into the jurisdiction of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. A statement from IMPD said department officers, who share the same police radio frequency as Beech Grove officers, \\"were already aware of the initial theft run at the Walmart and subsequent pursuit headed towards Southeast District.\\" At 8:14 a.m., Beech Grove officials called off the pursuit as Edmond's SUV turned north on Perkins Avenue. At that point, IMPD officers also were instructed by a supervisor not to chase the SUV because of safety concerns. \\"At this point due to children getting onto a school bus on Perkins Avenue, an IMPD supervisor made the determination for IMPD officers to also terminate the vehicle pursuit,\\" the IMPD statement said. Edmonds briefly evaded police after the pursuit was halted, but an IMPD officer on Pleasant Run Parkway soon spotted the SUV. The IMPD officer followed the SUV and provided radio updates to other officers in the area but did not have his siren on and was not traveling at a high rate of speed, said Lt. Richard Riddle, an IMPD spokesman. Riddle said that it appears Edmonds saw the IMPD vehicle as he drove north on State \\"and actually sped up through this intersection\\" of Prospect and State, where he slammed into the pickup truck traveling west on Prospect. His SUV then careened into a sedan stopped at the intersection for a red light. After the collision, Riddle said, Edmonds got out and tried to flee on foot. He was quickly arrested by officers in the area. Edmonds, who listed a Gary address in recent police and court records, previously appeared in court in Marion County on several misdemeanor charges, including battery, criminal mischief and theft. He pleaded guilty in 2013 to a theft charge and was sentenced to probation. Last July, Edmonds was arrested on charges that included criminal mischief and battery resulting in bodily injury. Edmonds agreed to a guilty plea on the criminal mischief charge, while the battery charge was dismissed. He was sentenced to a day in jail and was put on probation. A no contact order also was filed against him in connection with the case. Gilbert Torres said he didn't see the crash Monday, but he heard the crunching metal as the vehicles collided in the intersection. After police arrived, Torres was among the dozens of community members who walked to the crash site to see what happened. \\"I was just a few doors down on Prospect, so we heard the loud boom and all the craziness,\\" Torres said. \\"I just can't believe it. And they said he was shoplifting? This isn't worth that. For a little kid to get hurt over shoplifting, that's crazy, man.\\" Pam Shireman had seen Edmonds fleeing police as she waited at a bus stop. \\"I was standing there waiting for the bus (on Emerson), and all of a sudden I seen that silver Tahoe in the wrong lane, driving like 100 miles per hour into oncoming traffic,\\" she said. \\"Me and the bus driver was praying that he didn't hit anybody head-on. Then we get up here on the bus and see ... it's sad. It's just horrible.\\" Even though police had called off the pursuit, \\"the psychology has already been put in motion\\" in the suspect's mind, said Ellen Deitz Tucker, spokeswoman for PursuitSafety, a national nonprofit working to reduce pursuit deaths and promote law enforcement alternatives to chasing nonviolent suspects. At least one person dies, on average, every day in the United States in police pursuits, according to data from PursuitSafety. Innocent bystanders such as Niblock account for an average of three deaths a week, and one law enforcement officer dies on average every six weeks, Tucker said. Many of those deaths occur after police have suspended chases, she said. Star reporter Jill Disis contributed to this story. Call Star reporter Justin L. Mack at (317) 444-6138.

(Kelly Wilkinson / The Star) When IMPD is involved in pursuits Indianapolis police officers have wide discretion to initiate pursuits in cases ranging from those involving felons to traffic infractions. Although officers do not need permission to initiate a pursuit, a supervisor determines how long a pursuit should continue and when it should be terminated. Before initiating and during the course of any pursuit, the pursuing officer and supervisors must consider the following: Seriousness of the offense. Knowledge of the identity of the pursued suspect(s). Other occupants of vehicle (such as children). Weather and lighting conditions. Road conditions (such as intersections, traffic controls, overhead lighting, curves, hills, construction, etc.). Density of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Locality of pursuit (residential, highway, etc.). Familiarity with area. Nature of pursuit (such as the manner of operation of suspect vehicle, speeding, erratic or reckless driving, etc.). Vehicle's speed.

By Friday, the city's police chief made the decision to declare the store a public nuisance after a summer of high profile incidents. Mayor Buckley cites nearly 500 police calls in just 5 months to the store and says something has to change. \\"I want Wal-mart to be a better corporate partner with us and it's not happening,\\" said Mayor Buckley. \\"They can really be a productive business in our city if they want to be, but we can't continue down this road,\\" he added. It's a road that has seen the store in the news all summer. The first time was in June when two women got into a brawl in the shampoo aisle. Video of the incident went viral.Days later, police were called to the store for a shop-lifter who led them on a chase. During that pursuit, police say the suspect crashed his car and killed a woman, injuring others. This past week, Beech Grove got another shop lifting call after police say two suspects were stopped by security for shoplifting. During questioning, one of the men ran after pulling out a gun and shot himself nearby.Later that same night, according to Mayor Buckley, Beech Grove police were at the Walmart again for another shoplifter who ran. \\"For a period of time, there were not any Beech Grove police officers patrolling the streets of Beech Grove because we were down at Walmart again dealing with an irrelevant shop lifter,\\" said Buckley. Now the store has ten days to address some of its issues, according to the Mayor or they could be fined each time police are called to the store. \\"That store is a real problem,\\" said the mayor. According to a Walmart spokesperson, the company has hired off duty police to patrol the store and implemented a program where low level shoplifting offenses will be handled in house so police don't need to be called. A Walmart spokesperson said the company enjoys great relationships in communities across the country. Mayor Buckley said Beech Grove has not been one of those communities. ||||| The Beech Grove mayor pushed for a public nuisance designation for Wal-Mart after suspected shoplifter Gillace Monroe Samples, 42, fled the store and shot himself at a nearby restaurant. Gillace Monroe Samples, 42, is suspected of shoplifting at Walmart in Beech Grove before running to a nearby restaurant and shooting himself in the head. He remained in critical condition as of Friday afternoon. (Photo: Photo provided by Beech Grove Police Department) Update: Beech Grove police said Monday that 42-year-old Gillace Monroe Samples died over the weekend from his self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Monroe, suspected of shoplifting, had been stopped Thursday by Wal-Mart workers, including an off-duty deputy. Monroe pulled a gun and ran out of the store. He was found shot in the restroom of a nearby restaurant. Earlier: When a man shot himself following an incident at Wal-Mart in Beech Grove, it was the last straw for that town's mayor. He's declared the business a public nuisance. On Thursday morning, 42-year-old Gillace Monroe Samples tried to steal from the store, police said. After being caught by security, Samples waved his gun at employees before running to a nearby restaurant and shooting himself in the head as police closed in. He remained in critical condition at Eskenazi Hospital as of Friday afternoon. The shooting is the latest in a string of high-profile incidents that have been connected to the troubled Wal-Mart store over the last two months, joining a brawl between two women in the store's shampoo aisle and a separate act of shoplifting that ended with a crash that killed a 63-year-old woman. As a public nuisance, Wal-Mart can be assessed fines when officers are needed there. To Beech Grove Mayor Dennis Buckley, it's one of the only remaining options. \\"We're better than that, our community is better than that and I don't want to get a phone call every day saying that somebody pulled a gun at Wal-Mart and has done something out of line,\\" Buckley said. Police said Thursday's incident began around 11 a.m. Samples and another suspect, 42-year-old Johnny Maxey, were caught shoplifting at Wal-Mart, located in a shopping center in the 4600 block of South Emerson Avenue. Two Wal-Mart employees — one an off-duty Marion County Sheriff's Department deputy working as a security guard and another assisting him — escorted the suspects to the store's loss prevention office. That's when Samples pulled out a handgun before fleeing the store, police said. The deputy, assisted by Beech Grove and Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officers, chased Samples. Witnesses helped the officers track down Samples in the restroom of Egg Roll No. 1, a restaurant located just north of Wal-Mart on South Emerson. Officers were moving in to make an arrest when they heard a gunshot, police said. Samples was wanted for parole violation and battery by means of a deadly weapon, and for being a serious violent felon in possession of a firearm, police said. The battery and gun possession charges are connected to a shooting reported in Indianapolis on July 29. Like Buckley, Wal-Mart spokesman Brian Nick expressed frustration with the latest confrontation. He also commended Wal-Mart employees and security for keeping other shoppers safe. \\"We're thankful that our security measures helped identify a dangerous individual who could have caused harm to others in the community,\\" Nick said. The aftermath of previous incidents saw police discussing how frequent runs to Wal-Mart have stretched the department's resources. Between February 2014 and mid-June, Beech Grove police made 1,278 runs to the store resulting in 473 arrests. Officials from both sides met and eventually implemented a restorative justice program at Wal-Mart. The voluntary program, Nick said, is designed to reduce the number of police runs to the store. It gives Wal-Mart associates the ability to offer some shoplifters a chance to opt into a program that results in a fine instead of being arrested. It's usually targeted at people during first-time offenses when police aren't necessary, Nick said. \\"That is something the store will continue to work on with law enforcement, and something that we've seen success with in other parts of the country,\\" he said. While he's pleased with the program's early results, Buckley said he's noticed police activity has increased over the last two weeks. Once the public nuisance designation is finalized, Wal-Mart will be notified and given a 10-day grace period before receiving fines, Buckley said. Then officers will have the option to issue tickets when they're called to the store. Each ticket could carry a 2,500 penalty and court fees. In response to the designation, Nick said Wal-Mart officials will work to keep the store peaceful. Call Star reporter Justin L. Mack at (317) 444-6138. Follow him on Twitter: @justinlmack.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who owns the company that had sold only 700,000 copies of Planet Waves?, using the article: Dylan began 1973 by signing with a new label, David Geffen's Asylum Records (and Island in the UK), when his contract with Columbia Records expired. On his next album, Planet Waves, he used the Band as backing group, while rehearsing for a tour. The album included two versions of \\"Forever Young\\", which became one of his most popular songs. As one critic described it, the song projected \\"something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan\\", and Dylan himself commented: \\"I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental.\\"Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan, a collection of studio outtakes (almost exclusively covers), widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label. In January 1974, Dylan returned to touring after seven years; backed by the Band, he embarked on a North American tour of 40 concerts. A live double album, Before the Flood, was on Asylum Records. Soon, according to Clive Davis, Columbia Records sent word they \\"will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold\\". Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, miffed that while there had been millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour, Geffen had sold only 700,000 copies of Planet Waves. Dylan returned to Columbia Records, which reissued his two Asylum albums. After the tour, Dylan and his wife became estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures, and recorded an album entitled Blood on the Tracks in September 1974. Dylan delayed the release and re-recorded half the songs at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother, David Zimmerman.Released in early 1975, Blood on the Tracks received mixed reviews. In the NME, Nick Kent described \\"the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes.\\" In Rolling Stone, Jon Landau wrote that \\"the record has been made with typical shoddiness.\\" Over the years critics came to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements.

I Am Number Four (film) In 2011, screenwriter Noxon told Collider.com that plans for an imminent sequel were shelved due to the disappointing performance of the first installment at the box office. Options are: (1). no; (2). yes; Is this statement correct \\"is there going to be another i am four movie\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"Is there going to be another I am Number Four movie?\\" is subject to speculation as there has been no definitive answer or confirmation from the movie studios involved. However, based on available information, it seems unlikely that a sequel will be produced in the near future. I Am Number Four is a science fiction action film released in 2011. It is directed by D.J. Caruso and is based on the novel of the same name written by Pittacus Lore. The story revolves around nine alien teenagers who escape their war-torn home planet, Lorien, and seek refuge on Earth. They are pursued by a group of hostile aliens called Mogadorians, who intend to exterminate them. The protagonist, John Smith (played by Alex Pettyfer), possesses unique powers and is one of the nine aliens on the run. In a 2011 interview with screenwriter Marti Noxon, she revealed that plans for a sequel were halted due to the film's underwhelming performance at the box office. The movie received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, which has contributed to the lack of an immediate follow-up. The film was initially planned to be a franchise, as the book series by Pittacus Lore comprises seven novels, providing ample source material for potential sequels. While a sequel is not impossible, several factors make it appear less likely as time passes. The core cast, including Alex Pettyfer, Dianna Agron, and Teresa Palmer, have aged, and it would be challenging to continue the story naturally after a considerable gap in production. Additionally, many members involved in the initial film have moved on to other projects, further complicating the feasibility of a sequel. In conclusion, given the available information, it is unlikely that another I Am Number Four movie will be produced in the near future. Fans of the series should not expect a sequel, as current circumstances strongly suggest that the 2011 film was a standalone adaptation of the novel."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Alps (/ælps/; Italian: Alpi [ˈalpi]; French: Alpes [alp]; German: Alpen [ˈʔalpm̩]; Slovene: Alpe [ˈáːlpɛ]) are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The Caucasus Mountains are higher, and the Urals longer, but both lie partly in Asia. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the French–Italian border, and at 4,810 m (15,781 ft) is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4,000 m (13,123 ft), known as the \\"four-thousanders\\". The altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones. Wildlife such as ibex live in the higher peaks to elevations of 3,400 m (11,155 ft), and plants such as Edelweiss grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations.

Given the question: Information: - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941. - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain. - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force. - Raymond Towers \`\` Ray '' Holmes ( 20 August 1914 -- 27 June 2005 ) was a British fighter pilot who was feted by the press as a war hero who saved Buckingham Palace from being severely damaged by German bombing during the Battle of Britain .

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: This is the most compelling and excellent performance that Robert Taylor ever gave. It even surpasses his wonderful performance as \\"Johnny Eager\\" coming a full 14 years after that film. His looks are still a wonder to see, but he has a maturity now that gives him the edge in this gritty, violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of his breed, a buffalo hunter who kills not for the money but for the pleasure. His wild eyed killing of not only buffalo but human beings, is stunning to watch. He is basically a lonely man, needing the people around him, but they dislike him because of his sociopath behavior. His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger) who is sick of the hunt, and only goes along, because he is a failure at anything else. Along the way Charlie kills a family of Indians and captures the beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie tries to seduce her to no avail, but sees that Sandy is interested in her also. Granger is kind of sad to watch, so fed up with the hunt, longing to go away with the girl and her baby. Lloyd Nolan as the drunken skinner is wonderful with his wise cracks and accordian playing. Russ Tamblyn plays the half breed trying to fit in a white world. The group is an odd mix of good and evil, young and old. In the end Taylor gets spooked by the buffalo, as many hunters before him had, and runs off leaving Sandy with the girl. Upon his return, that night Sandy leaves with the woman, setting Charlie off on a rampage of killing in a quest to get Sandy and have the girl for himself.

Question 1: What are the martial arts techniques for self-defense? Question 2: What is the best martial art to use for self-defense and other practical situations? Why? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1 and Question 2 are related but not the same. Question 1 is asking for various martial arts techniques specifically meant for self-defense, while Question 2 is asking for the best martial art suited for self-defense and practical situations and the reasoning behind it. Regarding Question 1: Martial arts techniques for self-defense can be found across many different disciplines, and the effectiveness of these techniques often depends on the skill and experience of the individual applying them. Some popular martial arts that teach self-defense techniques include Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Krav Maga, and Muay Thai. Here are some key techniques from these martial arts: 1. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: - Rear naked choke: This technique involves attacking the opponent from behind, wrapping one arm around their neck while using the other to hold it in place. By applying pressure with your forearm to the side of the neck, you can quickly put someone to sleep or force them to submit. - Armbar: From various positions, you can isolate an opponent's arm, extending it and applying pressure on the elbow joint by using your hips and legs. This can lead to submission or serious injury to the opponent if they do not give up. - Guard: A position from your back that allows you to control the opponent's movements using your legs, protecting yourself from strikes and setting up other attacks like chokes, joint locks, and sweeps. 2. Krav Maga: - Groin strike: A quick and effective self-defense technique is to target the groin. Using a swift kick or knee, you can cause severe pain and incapacitate an attacker. - Eye gouge: By using your fingers to apply pressure to an attacker's eyes, you can inflict pain and temporarily disorient them, allowing for a possible escape. - Hammer fist strike: Instead of a traditional closed-fist punch, a hammer fist strike uses the bottom of the fist to deliver a powerful blow, which can minimize the risk of injury to your own hand. 3. Muay Thai: - Low kicks: Aiming for an opponent's legs, especially the thigh area, can cause significant pain and weaken their ability to stand and move. Repeated low kicks can eventually lead to an attacker being unable to continue their assault. - Clinch: By controlling an opponent's head and neck, one can land devastating knees to the body and head, breaking their posture and limiting their ability to strike back. - Elbows: Muay Thai incorporates elbow strikes which can prove useful in close-quarters self-defense situations where punches may be less effective. Properly executed elbow strikes can cause significant damage or even knock an opponent out. Regarding Question 2: The best martial art to use for self-defense and practical situations is subjective, as it depends on an individual's personal preferences, physical attributes, and the time and effort they are willing to commit to training. That being said, many people consider Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as an ideal martial art for self-defense and practical situations because of the following reasons: 1. Efficient use of technique and leverage: Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has a core principle of using leverage, timing, and proper technique over pure strength or aggression. This allows smaller or less physically dominant individuals to successfully defend against larger or stronger attackers. 2. Focus on ground fighting: Most real-life confrontations end up on the ground, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has a comprehensive system for ground fighting and submissions, which can effectively neutralize opponents and give practitioners a significant advantage in these situations. 3. Non-lethal: Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu primarily utilizes joint locks and chokes to control or incapacitate an opponent. This allows practitioners to effectively neutralize a threat without causing severe injury, if not necessary, which can be useful in self-defense situations where the use of force must be proportionate to the threat. 4. Stress-tested in competition: Many Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners participate in realistic and competitive sparring, commonly referred to as \\"rolling,\\" which helps them to become comfortable and composed in high-pressure situations. However, it's important to recognize that no single martial art is perfect for every situation or person. Many martial artists benefit from cross-training in multiple disciplines so that they may become well-rounded individuals with a diverse range of skills and tactics to draw upon in self-defense or practical situations. Ultimately, the best martial art for an individual is the one they are most passionate and consistent in learning and practicing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Solve this instance: Command: greater { hop { filter_eq { all_rows ; player ; mitchell duke } ; goals } ; hop { filter_eq { all_rows ; player ; john hutchinson } ; goals } }, interpretation: select the rows whose fixtures record is equal to 1 . there is only one such row in the table . the round record of this unqiue row is final . Student:","completion":"Part #1: Understanding logical operators and their definitions. Usage: In this task, we have the command \\"greater\\" and two \\"hop\\" logical operators. Greater compares two arguments and returns true if the first argument is greater than the second one. Hop returns the value under the header column of the row. Part #2: Breaking down the command and finding relevant rows. Usage: Command: greater { hop { filter_eq { all_rows ; player ; mitchell duke } ; goals }, hop { filter_eq { all_rows ; player ; john hutchinson } ; goals } } We need to compare the goals of two players, Mitchell Duke and John Hutchinson. First, we filter rows by each player's name and then hop to find their goal records. Part #3: Interpreting the command's natural language equivalent. Usage: The natural language interpretation states, \\"Select the rows whose fixtures record is equal to 1. There is only one such row in the table. The round record of this unique row is final.\\" Part #4: Comparing the command with the given interpretation. Usage: In this case, the given command compares the goals of two specific players, while the provided interpretation talks about selecting rows with fixtures record equal to 1 and a round record being final. These two meanings are not appropriate for each other. Conclusion: As the interpretation does not match the command's meaning, the label should be \\"no\\"."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: The mayor who rose from poverty to transform a Georgia town Evelyn Wynn-Dixon, the mayor of Riverdale, Ga., tells NBC News' Maria Shriver how she persevered through homelessness and difficult times to become the successful mayor of an American city.Â By Jay Kernis, Producer, NBC News RIVERDALE, Ga. -- In 1973, Evelyn Wynn-Dixon was standing at the Pryor Street Bridge overlooking Atlanta’s I-75, preparing to jump. She had four babies, no husband, no job and no self-esteem. At the time, she never would have believed what her life would become decades later. If she killed herself, she thought, her children “would be rich” from her insurance policy. “I saw a tractor-trailer comin’. I said, ‘I am not gonna be able to do that.’ So I went home and I had a .22. It had no bullets.” She also tried over-dosing on aspirin and cutting her wrist, without success. After those suicide attempts, she says she heard her late mother’s voice telling her, “School is the answer.” That’s when Wynn-Dixon says she decided to turn her life around. She had been to college, but became pregnant early on and dropped out. So years later, wanting a new life for her children, she earned a nursing certificate, then a bachelor of science, a masters in social work and gerontology, and eventually, a Ph.D. in public health. Many times, she walked miles from her home to her classes, and worked a series of jobs -- cleaning and cooking among them -- to pay tuition and support her children. In 2007, Wynn-Dixon ran for the office of mayor of Riverdale, Ga., a city of around 16,000 people at the edge of Atlanta. She was 58 years old at the time and had no political experience. After a campaign that cost 2,318.57, she was elected. Wynn-Dixon’s first term lasted until 2008, and during her second term, which runs until 2016, she ran unopposed. NBC News' Special Anchor Maria Shriver interviewed the mayor as part of a series of stories covering “The Shriver Report: A Woman’s Nation Pushes Back from the Brink.” The report, co-authored by Shriver and The Center for American Progress, documents the estimated 42 million women across the country—and 28 million dependent children—who live at the edge of poverty and economic disaster. Wynn-Dixon told NBC News that Riverdale needs more white-collar jobs, and she’d like to re-brand the town’s image as a great place to live. So far, as mayor Wynn-Dixon has built a new city hall complex — including a new town hall, courtroom, gym and amphitheater--and cleaned up the town. She ended her first term with a balanced budget, and even a small surplus. Chief of Police Samuel Patterson said that the mayor has encouraged citizens from all walks of life, from children to seniors, to get involved in the life of the town. \\"Dr. Wynn-Dixon has been an absolute ambassador for the city,” Patterson said. “She has opened doors that otherwise would not have been opened, had it not been for her vivacious personality. She has done more for the city in her first term than most of the mayors we’ve had who were her predecessors.\\" And according to mayor pro tem An’cel Davis, her leadership style “brought the city together.\\" \\"She took over when the city was going through turbulent times—crime, changes in demographics, and economic challenges,\\" Davis said. \\"She has sort of a mother personality about her — everybody is 'baby.' She has that mother image.” The mayor’s children are grown now. Two of her sons attended the University of Georgia where they had considerable success as athletes. One later went to Harvard for his MBA. Her daughter, an attorney, is getting her Ph.D. Another son served a nine-year prison sentence, but earned his veterinarian degree while incarcerated. Wynn-Dixon says she’ll run one more time, “If the people will have me.” “My zip code didn’t make me. My size didn’t make me,\\" said Wynn-Dixon, who describes herself as “voluptuously full-figured.\\" \\"It was the fact that I dared to get up. I kept saying, ‘This is not going to defeat me. I’m going to prove to people that I can make it.’” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The news article highlights the inspiring story of Evelyn Wynn-Dixon, who overcame poverty, homelessness, and multiple suicide attempts to eventually become the mayor of Riverdale, Georgia.

They first try to get the cat in a residential home to eat them. When the cat refuses, they attempt various tactics, including pleading and bullying, in order to achieve their goal. Throughout the film, the mice's determination to be eaten creates a chain reaction of events that affect the other characters.

Group G had people over 65 in it, and group Y had people under 65 years old in it. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group had more people that had decreased stamina? Hint: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. The answer is:","completion":"The answer is group G had more people with decreased stamina. This is because group G consists of people over 65 years old, and the paragraph provided mentions that stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age. Additionally, the immune system becomes less efficient and the risk of serious illnesses increases. Since group G includes individuals in this older age range, they are more likely to experience decreased stamina compared to group Y, which consists of people under 65 years old."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
