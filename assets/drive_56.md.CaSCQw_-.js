Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Q: In this task, you are given a set of context paragraph and some supporting facts to answer a question. Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts. Context_1 : Ouija: Origin of Evil is a 2016 American supernatural horror film directed and edited by Mike Flanagan and written by Flanagan and Jeff Howard. The film is a prequel to the 2014 film \\"Ouija\\" and stars Elizabeth Reaser, Annalise Basso, Lulu Wilson, Parker Mack and Henry Thomas. The film's plot focuses on a widow and her family adding a Ouija board to their phony seance business where, unbeknownst to them, they invite a spirit that possesses the youngest daughter. Context_2 : Landslide is the name of two board games about the U.S. presidential elections, where players compete to become the president of the United States. Context_3 : \\"November Spawned a Monster\\" is a song by Morrissey. It was released as a single in 1990. It was written by Morrissey and Clive Langer. It also features one of Morrissey's former colleagues from The Smiths, Andy Rourke. In reaching number 12 in the British chart it was a marked improvement over Morrissey's previous single, \\"Ouija Board, Ouija Board\\", but still failed to chart as high as the singer's first four releases. The track is one of Morrissey's personal favourites, and has been played live many times by the singer. It along with its b-side \\"He Knows I'd Love to See Him\\" appears on the compilation album \\"Bona Drag\\". Context_4 : The ouija ( or ), also known as a spirit board or talking board, is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0–9, the words \\"yes\\", \\"no\\", \\"hello\\" (occasionally), and \\"goodbye\\", along with various symbols and graphics. It uses a small heart-shaped piece of wood or plastic called a planchette. Participants place their fingers on the planchette, and it is moved about the board to spell out words. \\"Ouija\\" is a trademark of Hasbro, Inc., but is often used generically to refer to any talking board. Context_5 : William Fuld (July 24, 1870–February 24, 1927) was an American businessman, inventor, and entrepreneur from Baltimore, Maryland who is best known for his marketing and manufacture of Ouija boards from the 1890s through the 1920s. Fuld is seen as the father of the Ouija board. Though Fuld never claimed to have invented the Ouija board, intense media coverage in the 1920s credited him with it. The misinformation was sustained by his own marketing, and his practice of stamping \\"Original Ouija Board\\" and \\"Inventor\\" on the back of his boards. By the end of his life he would have over 33 patents, trademarks, and copyrights credited to him. Context_6 : Ouija Board (foaled 3 March 2001) is a British Thoroughbred racehorse (named after the ouija board spiritualism device) owned by Edward Stanley, 19th Earl of Derby and trained by Ed Dunlop. In a career spanning four seasons, she won 10 of her 22 races, 7 of them Group 1s, including the Epsom Oaks in 2004 and the Hong Kong Vase in 2005. In 2004, she won the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf and came 2nd to Intercontinental the following year in the same race. In 2006, the Dunlop team took her back to the USA, where she regained her crown in the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf. Ouija Board has amassed over £3 million in prize money. Also, she is only the second horse ever to win Breeders' Cup races in non-consecutive years, along with Da Hoss, who won the Breeders' Cup Mile in 1996 and 1998. Context_7 : Ouija is a 2007 Filipino horror-thriller film from director Topel Lee, his paranormal first feature length, from the screenplay by Aloy Adlawan. The film stars Jolina Magdangal, Iza Calzado, Rhian Ramos and Judy Ann Santos haunted by a spirit they accidentally unleashed while playing an Ouija board. Context_8 : Jap Herron: A Novel Written From The Ouija Board was a novel first published in 1917 claimed to be authored by Mark Twain 7 years after his death. The book was transcribed by Emily Grant Hutchings who claimed to have had the novel dictated to her from beyond the grave by the deceased Mark Twain through use of a Ouija board. Context_9 : Ouija is a 2014 American supernatural horror film directed by Stiles White in his directorial debut, produced by Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Bradley Fuller, and Bennett Schneir and written by Juliet Snowden and White, who previously together wrote \\"The Possession\\". It stars Olivia Cooke, Ana Coto, Daren Kagasoff, Douglas Smith, and Bianca A. Santos as teenagers who have unleashed spirits from a Ouija board. Context_10 : \\"Ouija Board, Ouija Board\\" was a single released by Morrissey in November 1989. The single was poorly received by the music press and the public: its highest chart position was No. 18, making it the first Morrissey single not to reach the British top 10. It appeared along with its B-side \\"Yes, I Am Blind\\" on the compilation album \\"Bona Drag\\". A shorter edit, omitting a verse, appeared on the 2010 reissue of \\"Bona Drag\\". fact_1 : Landslide is the name of two board games about the U.S. presidential elections, where players compete to become the president of the United States. fact_2 : The ouija ( or ), also known as a spirit board or talking board, is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0–9, the words \\"yes\\", \\"no\\", \\"hello\\" (occasionally), and \\"goodbye\\", along with various symbols and graphics. Question: Are both Landslide an Ouija board games? A:","completion":"The task is asking you to answer the given question based on the context paragraphs and supporting facts provided. Guidelines provided: 1. Context paragraphs and facts offer information on Ouija boards and the game Landslide. 2. Use this information to determine if both Landslide and Ouija are board games. Steps to find the answer: 1. From Context_2 and fact_1, we learn that Landslide is a board game about U.S. presidential elections where players compete to become president. 2. From Context_4 and fact_2, we understand that the Ouija board is a flat board used for communicating with spirits, marked with letters, numbers, and words. Using the provided guidelines and information from the context paragraphs and facts, we can conclude that while both Landslide and Ouija boards are types of board, only Landslide is a board game, and the Ouija board is a tool for communicating with spirits and not a game."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts. Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction.

According to the Secret History, Temüjin again offered his friendship to Jamukha, asking him to return to his side. Temüjin had killed the men who betrayed Jamukha, stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army. Jamukha refused the offer of friendship and reunion, saying that there can only be one sun in the sky, and he asked for a noble death. The custom is to die without spilling blood, which is granted by breaking the back. Jamukha requested this form of death, despite the fact that in the past Jamukha had been known to have boiled his opponents' generals alive. Output:","completion":"Part #1: Reading the given passage and construction of a question. Usage: Sample response: \\"What was Temüjin's reason for killing the men who betrayed Jamukha?\\" In this example, we have read the passage and constructed a question related to it. Part #2: Ensuring the question is unambiguous. Usage: Sample response: \\"Why did Jamukha refuse Temüjin's offer of friendship and reunion?\\" This question is clear and precise. There is no ambiguity in interpreting what is being asked. Part #3: The question must be answerable from the passage. Usage: Sample response: \\"How did Jamukha meet his death?\\" The answer to this question can be found in the passage, making it appropriate to ask based on the given information. Part #4: The answer to the question must be unique. Usage: Sample response: \\"What form of death did Jamukha request?\\" The answer is unique and directly found in the passage (\\"granted by breaking the back\\"). Part #5: The answer to the question must be a continuous text span from the paragraph. Usage: Sample response: \\"What did Jamukha say about the possibility of him and Temüjin being friends?\\" The answer to this question is a continuous text span from the paragraph: \\"there can only be one sun in the sky.\\" Part #6: Avoid creating questions that can be answered correctly without understanding the paragraph. Usage: Sample response: \\"In what way did Jamukha and Temüjin's relationship end?\\" This question requires understanding the passage to answer it correctly, as opposed to a trivia-style question that could be answered without context. Part #7: Avoid using the same words or phrases given in the passage. Usage: Sample response: \\"What was Jamukha's stance on accepting Temüjin's proposal for reconciliation?\\" This question avoids directly using the same words of the passage while still asking for information about Jamukha's response to Temüjin's offer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Pearl Jam commenced work on a new album following a year-long break after its full-scale tour in support of Binaural. McCready described the recording environment as \\"a pretty positive one\\" and \\"very intense and spiritual.\\" Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, \\"There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed.\\" Pearl Jam released its seventh album, Riot Act, on November 12, 2002. It included the singles \\"I Am Mine\\" and \\"Save You\\". The album featured a much more folk-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of B3 organist Boom Gaspar on songs such as \\"Love Boat Captain\\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said \\"Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since Vitalogy—a muscular art rock record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours.\\" The track entitled \\"Arc\\" was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs.In 2003, the band embarked on its Riot Act Tour, which included tours in Australia and North America. The band continued its official bootleg program, making every concert from the tour available in CD form through its official website. A total of six bootlegs were made available in record stores: Perth, Tokyo, State College, Pennsylvania, two shows from Madison Square Garden, and Mansfield, Massachusetts. At many shows during the 2003 North American tour, Vedder performed Riot Act's \\"Buhleaguer\\", a commentary on President George W. Bush, with a rubber mask of Bush, wearing it at the beginning of the song and then hanging it on a mic stand to allow him to sing. The band made news when it was reported that several fans left after Vedder had \\"impaled\\" the Bush mask on his mic stand at the band's Denver, Colorado show.In June 2003,... Answer:","completion":"In June 2003, Pearl Jam left their label Epic Records. The band had recorded the single \\"I Am Mine\\" under Epic Records before their departure.

Question: How would Bailey feel afterwards? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: kind B: generous C: rude The answer is:","completion":"B: generous In the given context, Bailey made a scarf for their friend and gave it to them on their birthday. This action of creating a handmade gift and giving it to someone on a special occasion is an expression of thoughtfulness, effort, and selflessness. Bailey has put time and energy into creating something unique and meaningful for their friend, and this behavior aligns closely with the concept of generosity. Generosity encompasses not only the act of giving gifts but also the intention behind the action. It involves putting others' needs and feelings into consideration and heartily giving without expecting anything in return. Bailey's actions in this context clearly demonstrate this quality, as they chose to create a personalized gift and present it to their friend to celebrate their birthday. While kindness (option A) could also be a potential characteristic of Bailey's actions, it is not as specific as the term generous in describing the situation. Kindness is a broader term that involves being considerate, friendly, and helpful to others, and though making a scarf for their friend could be seen as kind, the added context of giving it as a birthday gift leans more towards being generous. As for option C, \\"rude,\\" it is not applicable to the context at all. Rude behavior refers to being impolite, disrespectful, or insensitive towards others, and Bailey's actions in this scenario are quite the opposite. Therefore, out of the three options provided - kind (A), generous (B), and rude (C) - the answer B: generous best describes how Bailey would feel according to the given context. Bailey demonstrated a remarkable level of generosity by creating a heartfelt gift for their friend and presenting it to them on their special day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nic is an obstetrician, and Jules is a housewife who is starting up a landscape design business. Each has given birth to a child using the same sperm donor. The younger child Laser (Josh Hutcherson) wants to find his sperm donor father but has to be 18 to do so. He implores his 18-year-old sister, Joni (Mia Wasikowska), to contact the sperm bank which identifies Paul (Mark Ruffalo) as the donor. The three meet. Joni is impressed by his bohemian lifestyle, and Paul becomes enthusiastic about being in their lives. Joni swears her brother to secrecy as she does not want to upset their mothers. However, Jules and Nic find out and invite Paul over to dinner. When Jules reveals she has a landscape business, Paul asks her to transform his back garden. Jules agrees, although Nic does not like the idea. While working for Paul, Jules likes that he appreciates her work in contrast to Nic who, Jules feels, never supported her career. Jules impulsively kisses Paul one afternoon, and they end up in bed together, beginning an affair. Jules and the kids start spending more time with Paul. Nic believes Paul undermines her authority over the children by, for example, giving Joni a ride on his motorcycleâwhich Nic has forbiddenâand by suggesting she give Joni more freedom. After a heated argument with Jules, Nic suggests they all have dinner at Paul's house to ease the tension. Nic relaxes and for the first time connects with Paul. However, Nic discovers traces of Jules's hair in Paul's bathroom and bedroom. When they return home, Nic confronts Jules. At first, Jules denies it but then admits to the affair.

Morbid Angel is an American death metal band based in Tampa, Florida formed in 1983 by guitarist and sole remaining original member Trey Azagthoth, vocalist and bassist Dallas Ward, and drummer Mike Browning. Widely considered as one of the most influential bands in the genre and important in the transition of death metal from its thrash metal roots, they were one of the first bands to incorporate guttural vocals, up-tempo blast beats, multiple tempo changes and dark atmosphere. They have been described as one of \\"the most influential and emulated bands in death metal\\", alongside Obituary and Cannibal Corpse, and have been cited as an influence by many later bands. They were also the first death metal band to experience mainstream success in connection with being signed to Giant Records in 1992, heavy rotation of their music videos on MTV, and having the music video for the song \\"God of Emptiness\\" shown on an episode of Beavis and Butt-head. Morbid Angel was formed in 1983 in Tampa, Florida by guitarist Trey Azagthoth and drummer/vocalist Mike Browning. The band made their debut in 1987 on the New Renaissance Records record label. They recorded their debut album, Abominations of Desolation, in 1986, but the band was unsatisfied with the final product and it remained unreleased until 1991, printing 10,000 copies. In the early stages of their career the band developed a reputation for \\"gruesome stage antics.\\" In 1986, David Vincent joined the band, replacing Michael Manson and Sterling von Scarborough as vocalist and bassist respectively. Fellow Terrorizer drummer Pete Sandoval soon followed. Their first studio album, Altars of Madness, was released in 1989, and is regarded by many as one of the most important death metal albums of all time. It is also considered the first true death metal album. Music journalist Jason Birchmeier writes that: Few albums struck a chord within the ears and minds of the late-'80s underground metal scene like Morbid Angel's Altars of Madness did at the end of the decade, setting a new precedent for metal bands to reach. With the arguable exception of Chuck Schuldiner's Death, never before had a heavy metal band carried their lightning-fast guitar riffs and equally spellbinding guitar solos into such horrific territory. Venom and Slayer redefined the extent to which a metal band could align itself with all things evil during the beginning of the decade, but Morbid Angel made these two groups sound like children's music compared to the Florida-based group's assaulting death metal sounds and their blasphemous lyrics.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"Morbid Angel is a special band from Florida that started in 1983. They play a type of music called death metal, which can be fast, loud, and scary for some people. This band helped make this kind of music very popular, and many other bands try to sound like them now. They were even on a funny TV show called Beavis and Butt-head! The people who started Morbid Angel are named Trey, Dallas, and Mike. As they made more music, new friends like David and Pete joined them. They made their first big music album in 1989 and it is called Altars of Madness. A lot of people think this album is very important for death metal music because it was the first of its kind. One interesting thing about Morbid Angel is that they sometimes did some weird and scary things on stage during their shows, but they became even more famous because their music was very special and different from other metal bands. They helped make death metal music what it is today and are considered a big influence for many musicians!"},{"prompt":"Joel has just started his first day working as a scientist in a laboratory. The first task he was given is to look at two atoms and to jot down as much information about the two as he can. First, he needs to come up with an identification for these atoms. Since he is new, he decides to keep it professional and simply call the larger of the two atoms \\"atom L\\" and the smaller one \\"atom S\\". Now that he's taken care of that he can get down to work. Which atom's removed valence electron is closer to its own nucleus? Hint: The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. This is particularly easy to see in the alkali metals, where the single valence electron is shielded by all of the inner core electrons.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. - Angels Fall First is the debut studio album by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish . The original 500 - copies limited edition features seven tracks , two of which are not on the regular edition . This edition is highly sought after by collectors and in 2012 a copy was sold for 1137.23 on eBay . The album was released in the US by Century Media in March 2001 . - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. - eBay Inc. (;) is an American multinational corporation and e-commerce company, providing consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales services via the Internet. It is headquartered in San Jose, California. eBay was founded by Pierre Omidyar in 1995, and became a notable success story of the dot-com bubble. Today it is a multibillion-dollar business with operations localized in over 30 countries. - Delain is a Dutch symphonic metal band formed in 2002 by former Within Temptation keyboardist Martijn Westerholt, and Charlotte Wessels. The name of the band comes from the Kingdom of Delain in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\". - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Erno \\"Emppu\\" Matti Juhani Vuorinen (born 24 June 1978) is a Finnish guitarist, most famous for being a founding member and occasional songwriter of the symphonic metal band Nightwish. He is the oldest of five children, having a twin brother and three younger sisters. He started to play guitar as a private study at the age of 12 and since then has played in various bands including Nightwish, Brother Firetribe, Barilari, Almah, and Altaria. - Jukka Antero \\"Julius\\" Nevalainen (born 21 April 1978, Kitee, Finland) is the drummer in the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish and the Finnish progressive metal band Sethian. - The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the tech bubble, the Internet bubble, the dot-com collapse, and the information technology bubble) was a historic speculative bubble covering roughly 19952001 during which stock markets in industrialized nations saw their equity value rise rapidly from growth in the Internet sector and related fields. While the latter part was a boom and bust cycle, the Internet boom is sometimes meant to refer to the steady commercial growth of the Internet with the advent of the World Wide Web, as exemplified by the first release of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, and continuing through the 1990s. - Tarja Soile Susanna Turunen-Cabuli (born August 17, 1977), known professionally as Tarja Turunen or simply Tarja, is a Finnish singer-songwriter.

Women are called the weaker sex, or ,if men want to please them, \\"the fair sex\\". But boys and girls are taught together at schools and universities .There are women who are famous Prime Ministers, scientists and writers. And women live longer than men. A European woman can expect to live until the age of 74, a man only until he is 68. Are women's bodies really weaker? The fastest men can run a mile under 4 minutes. The best women need 4.5 minutes .Women's times are always slower than men's ,but some facts are a surprise. Some of the fastest women swimmers today are teenager girls. One of them swam 400 meters in 4 minutes 21.2 seconds when she was only 16. The first \\"Tarzan\\" in films was an Olympic swimmer ,Johnny Weissmuller. His fastest 400 meters was 4 minutes 59.1 seconds, which is 37.9 seconds slower than a girl 50 years later ! This does not mean that women are catching men up .Conditions are very different now ,and sport is much more serious .It is so serious that some women athletes are given hormone injections. At the Olympics a doctor has to check whether the women athletes are really women or not. It seems sad that sport has such problems. Life can be very complicated when there are two separate sexes!

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"In what year does the passage first mention Rahmon receiving scrutiny?\\" is in \\"The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.\\".

Read this article and answer this question Hoping to build on their home win over the Jets, the Browns flew to Qualcomm Stadium to take on the throwback-clad San Diego Chargers. In the first quarter, things started off close with Chargers kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 29-yard field goal, while Browns kicker Phil Dawson nailed a 37-yarder. In the second quarter, Dawson would get a 20-yard field goal for Cleveland. However, San Diego got the first touchdown of the game, as LB Marques Harris recovered a fumble in the Browns endzone for a touchdown. Dawson would supply the scoring for Cleveland for the rest of the half, as he nailed a 42-yarder and a 30-yarder. In the third quarter, the Chargers gained some momentum, as RB LaDainian Tomlinson, after getting bottled up in the first half, broke out with a 41-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Dawson would get another field goal, which came from 36 yards out. However, San Diego would respond with Tomlinson getting a 7-yard TD run. Cleveland would have Dawson get a 35-yard field goal, yet Tomlinson would get an 8-yard TD run, which was followed by a successful two-point conversion from QB Philip Rivers to WR Vincent Jackson. The Browns would finally get a touchdown, as QB Charlie Frye completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards. Unfortunately, the damage was already done. With the loss, Cleveland would fall to 2-6.

How to calculate btu per square foot<br>Measure your square footage. Measure the square footage of each room you plan to heat or cool and add them together. If you're installing a furnace or central air conditioning system, this typically includes every room. Can we draw the following conclusion? central air conditioning system has a x Options are: + Yes; + It's impossible to say; + No;","completion":"Before I answer the options provided, let me first explain how to calculate BTU per square foot for heating or cooling purposes. In calculating BTU per square foot, one must take into consideration not just the square footage of each room but also the specifics of each space in question. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you determine the BTUs needed for your air conditioning or heating system: 1. Measure the square footage of each room: Using a tape measure, measure the length and width of each room in your home. Multiply the length by the width to determine the square footage of each room. 2. Add up the total square footage: Add together the square footage of all the rooms you plan to heat or cool. This will give you the total square footage for your home. If you're installing a central air conditioning or heating system, typically every room will be included. 3. Determine the insulation level: Assess the insulation level in your home, considering factors like the building's age, construction material, and quality of insulation. Homes with better insulation will require fewer BTUs, while homes with poor insulation will require more. 4. Use a BTU calculator or chart: There are numerous BTU calculators available online or you can use a chart provided by the manufacturer of heating or cooling equipment to determine the approximate BTU per square foot. These calculators often require additional information such as the room's ceiling height, number of occupants, number of windows and doors, and insulation quality. 5. Make adjustments for specific factors: Some factors may require you to adjust the calculated BTU per square foot. For instance, rooms with high ceilings or excessive sunlight may need extra cooling, and you might need to add more BTUs per square foot in those cases. Similarly, for heating purposes, take into account factors such as building materials, climate, and other heat sources. Now, let's address the conclusion and options you provided. Central air conditioning system has a x It seems like there's missing information in this conclusion, possibly relating to the BTU per square foot variable (x). Assuming that \\"x\\" is the BTU per square foot required for the central air conditioning system, the proper conclusion should be: \\"Central air conditioning system has a certain BTU per square foot requirement, which is influenced by various factors such as room size, insulation levels, climate, building materials and other specific considerations.\\" Options are: + Yes: This answer is not a perfect fit since the original conclusion has missing information and needs to be rephrased to accurately depict BTU per square foot requirements. + It's impossible to say: This answer could be fitting only if there's not enough information provided to determine the BTU per square foot requirement for the central air conditioning system in question. + No: This answer can be the right choice if you determine that the conclusion does not accurately depict the necessary information required to calculate BTU per square foot. Based on the detailed explanation and assumption that \\"x\\" represents the BTU per square foot requirement, I would lean towards suggesting the third option, \\"No,\\" as the most suitable, given the provided context. However, with more information and clarity, the appropriate choice may change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The wide spread of social media has changed nearly all parts of teenagers' lives. Changing relationships High school student Elly Cooper from Illinois said social media often reduces face-to-face communication. \\"It makes in-person relationships harder because people give attention to their phones instead of their boyfriends or girlfriends,\\" Cooper said. There's also a greater possibility of things getting lost in translation over social media. \\"If half of your relationship is over social media, you don't really know how the other person is reacting,\\" Sienna Schulte, a junior student from Illinois, said. Yet, some people believe social media has made it easier to start relationships with anyone from anywhere. Beth Kaplan from Illinois met her long-distance friend through social media. He currently lives in Scotland, but they're still able to frequently communicate with one another. \\"I can feel close to someone that I'm talking to via FaceTime,\\" Kaplan said.

Warning: This story contains graphic details The intense manhunt for Luka Rocco Magnotta, wanted in the gruesome Montreal killing of a university student from China, has come to an end at an Internet café in Berlin. Clean-shaven and wearing jeans, sunglasses and a black jacket with a hood, Mr. Magnotta, 29, walked into the Internet Spaetkauf Helin in a working-class neighbourhood of Berlin around 11:45 a.m. Monday and asked to use a computer. He looked familiar to café owner Ulku Sungur and worker Kader Anlayisli. The Canadian murder suspect’s pictures had been plastered on newspapers, television screens and websites around the globe since body parts of Lin Jun, a 33-year-old Chinese national who was studying at Concordia University, were found in Montreal and mailed to political parties in Ottawa last week. Staff at the café noticed Mr. Magnotta was looking at porn. He also appeared to be checking out articles about himself and the international manhunt underway to find him. “We thought he looked familiar, but we couldn’t be sure,” Mr. Sungur said. “In person, he looked a little different.” Mr. Sungur and his worker took to the Internet themselves to check. Once they were fairly certain of his identity, Mr. Anlayisli ran outside to flag down the police, which often patrol Berlin’s Neukoelln district, a neighbourhood with high unemployment and a lot of crime. Around 1:30 p.m., with Mr. Magnotta still surfing online, seven police officers stormed into the café and quickly overpowered the slender Mr. Magnotta. He tried to give police a false name, but the officers weren’t buying it, Captain Guido Busch of the Berlin police said. (You can watch surveillance footage of the arrest here) Mr. Magnotta then gave up the ruse: “You got me,” he said. His arrest drew expressions of relief in Europe, China and here at home. In Montreal, police Commander Ian Lafrenière said investigators “are extremely relieved and happy” about Mr. Magnotta’s arrest. He is expected to appear before a judge in Germany on Tuesday. It’s unclear how long extradition to Canada will take. Mr. Magnotta is facing five charges in Montreal, including first-degree murder, causing an indignity to a body, corrupting morals, using the mail system to deliver “obscene, indecent, immoral or scurrilous” material, and harassing Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Mr. Harper commended police Monday for catching Mr. Magnotta. “Well, I’m obviously pleased that the suspect has been arrested, and I just want to congratulate the police forces on their good work,” the Prime Minister said in London, where he is attending the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Mr. Lin, who was enrolled in computer science and worked part-time at a convenience store, had been in Canada for about a year. Police say his killing and dismemberment was filmed and posted on Internet gore sites. Web viewers mused for days about whether the film was real or not before Mr. Lin’s dismembered body was found and Montreal police began an investigation. The scene of the crime, a second-floor studio apartment overlooking an expressway in Montreal, still contained the marks of violence days after the killing. A double mattress and a crumpled pink sheet were stained with dried blood. Splotches of blood also covered the floor of the fridge. The rental apartment had been the home of Mr. Magnotta. He had moved in three to four months ago, the building’s superintendent said. Mr. Magnotta and the victim knew each other, crossing paths at some point this spring. Acquaintances of Mr. Lin recalled he was looking for love. The last entry on his Facebook page was dated May 11. It included a photo of a park on which he wrote: \\"It's too, too, too, beautiful.\\" The murder of Mr. Lin has provoked widespread shock and anger in China, where many believe the crime was racially motivated. The Chinese embassy in Ottawa has warned citizens living or travelling in Canada to \\"strengthen their personal security\\" in the wake of the deadly attack. Mr. Lin’s death is the second killing of a Chinese student in Canada in just over a year, following last April's murder of York University student Liu Qian, part of which was watched on Skype by her boyfriend back in China. Huang Kankan, Mr. Lin’s former boss at a convenience store in the working-class Montreal neighbourhood of Verdun, said he looks forward to Mr. Magnotta’s trial, and the possibility that justice will be served. Mr. Huang described Mr. Lin as a reliable worker who was usually in good humour. ||||| MANHUNT Luka Rocco Magnotta, the Canadian porn star accused in a gruesome killing and dismemberment, knew how to live underground—so why was he found undisguised, reading stories about himself in a Berlin Internet café? Winston Ross reports. Canada’s so-called Cannibal Killer could have remained on the lam for a long time. Luka Rocco Magnotta successfully fled Montreal—by plane, no less—in advance of a nationwide arrest warrant issued after the one-time male model and low-budget gay porn star allegedly killed his lover, 33-year-old Chinese national Jun Lin. Magnotta made it to Paris, then slipped into Berlin, despite an international manhunt. As far as the authorities knew, he was lurking in the alleyways of France, not Germany. He apparently knew how to cut ties with his family and friends, how to steal identities, how to disguise himself. And it seems that as a resident of the seedy underworld of male prostitution, he could easily finance his flight by selling himself in an industry that doesn’t require much in the way of passports. But in the end, the 29-year-old who is accused of carrying out one of the most barbaric killings in Canada’s history was brought down by his own worst nemesis: Luka Rocco Magnotta. Magnotta’s first problem was that he’d made himself famous long before allegedly dismembering Lin and mailing his body parts to Canada’s highest political offices. Magnotta plastered pictures of his own half-naked body all over the Internet. He may have spread rumors in an attempt to connect himself to child-killer Karla Homolka so that he could come out and publicly denounce them later. He reportedly posted videos of himself killing kittens on the Internet, then boasted to British newspapers that they hadn’t seen anything yet and that humans would be his next victims. By the time Magnotta allegedly carried out that threat, he was already famous, already a household name in Canada. It’s not easy to hide when everyone knows what you look like. “He was using the web to glorify himself,” Montreal Police Cmdr. Ian LaFreniere told The Daily Beast. “This is the same web that brought him down.” The crime itself only magnified his notoriety. Montreal police say Magnotta filmed himself doing all kinds of dastardly things to his victim: slitting his throat, decapitating him, slicing off his arms and legs with a kitchen knife, feeding the flesh to a dog, having sex with the limbless corpse. That alone would warrant the kind of front-page media attention Magnotta seems to crave; allegations that he mailed the body parts to political offices garnered the suspect instant international notoriety. Somehow, he made it to Berlin undetected. And that’s where Luka Rocco Magnotta all but strolled into Potsdamer Platz with the words “Arrest me: I’m an international fugitive” scrawled in blood on his bare chest. When the cops found him, Magnotta was wearing no wig, no skirt—he’s been known to pose as a woman—no disguise of any kind. And if you thought that stupidity couldn’t be topped, consider where the police picked him up: in a bustling Internet cafe. Reading articles about himself. “You got me,” he reportedly told the cops who arrested him. “His biggest problem is that he’s an attention whore,” Washington, D.C., criminal profiler Pat Brown told The Daily Beast. “He’s in these Internet cafes because he’s so excited about what he’s done.” To Brown, that’s one of the more interesting facets of a guy who’s already proved himself to be plenty bizarre. Magnotta’s alleged past as an animal abuser fits the profile of a serial killer, a genre of psychopath that tends to derive the most satisfaction from the murders themselves, not the attention they get as a result. It’s the plotting, the choosing of victims, the technique of the murder that gets a typical serial killer off. And because they enjoy that so much, they take meticulous steps to avoid getting caught, so as to keep killing, to experience that thrill again and again. Montreal police are now reviewing cold cases to see if any could be linked to Magnotta, LaFreniere said. A mass murderer, on the other hand, is all about the notoriety. He plans to make a huge splash with the killing, to take out as many people as possible, to go down in history and probably die in the process. Avoiding prosecution is an afterthought.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason It seems that Magnotta blends the two stereotypes, Brown said. The video, if it is really him, seems to make clear he thoroughly enjoyed himself and drew it out as long as possible. That’s serial-killer stuff. But the self-aggrandizing, the need to get online and read news stories about yourself—that fits the mass-murder profile better. “It’s an odd crossover,” Brown said. “The serial killer enjoys the act of killing, one on one. He doesn’t care whether anybody else knows. He wants you to think he’s Clark Kent, but he’s really Superman.” Another problem for Magnotta, said former FBI profiler Clint Van Zandt, is that the fantasy he appears to have built up about himself—glamorous porn star, gruesome killer, cunning fugitive—doesn’t exactly track with reality. The killing part Magnotta accomplished well, according to police. But what he didn’t seem to account for, Van Zandt told The Daily Beast, is that the crime police say he committed would result in a real international manhunt. “Real cops with real guns were going to find him, real quick,” Van Zandt said. “He had no experience in running or hiding. He finally got to the point where he could act out this fantasy, but with no game plan about how to escape.” Magnotta’s short-lived career at a fugitive was so poorly executed it makes you wonder if he was trying to get caught. Van Zandt wouldn’t go that far, though. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The manhunt for Luka Rocco Magnotta ended at an internet café in Berlin.

Article: When we walked into Papillon Bleu, a Chinese restaurant around the corner from Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal's Old Port, the sole waiter on duty looked surprised to see us. At 7:45 on a Saturday night, at the height of tourist season, just one young white family sat in the dining room. We walked past them to a table in the back, Chopin drifting quietly from the speakers into the certain shade of dim light that only Chinese restaurants seem to have. At our seats, bright yellow napkins, folded into fans, rested on a blue tablecloth next to cutlery . Sometime in the last 18 years of operation, Papillon Bleu stopped bothering with chopsticks. \\"How did you find out about us?\\"our waiter politely asked. I told him that my family used to own a Chinese restaurant that served peanut butter dumplings and I wanted to taste them again. Papillon Bleu came up when I googled\\"Best Peanut Butter Dumplings in Montreal\\". He shook his head and told us that while it might have been the case a few years ago, they had switched peanut butter brands to cut costs. But the significance for me wasn't which brand they used, it was that they served peanut butter dumplings. Commonly known as Hunan dumplings, this specialty exists neither in China, nor anywhere else in North America. Instead, Hunan dumplings are a unique Quebecois tradition, and a slowly dying one, found in the second-generation Chinese family restaurants. Peanut butter dumplings taste exactly how they sound, but also unlike anything else. It is a kind of dumpling that coats your mouth with a distinct store-brand quality, a little too sweet, but buttery, and luxuriously warm, perfectly suited to resist the bone-chilling effects of the Montreal winter.

D: The business is not promising.","completion":"From the given article, we can infer that the restaurant - Papillon Bleu, is not doing promising business. At 7:45 on a Saturday night, during the peak tourist season, only one family was present in the dining room which indicates the business might not be thriving.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other, although there are some minor differences in punctuation and wording. Both statements convey the same primary idea: In 1967, automatic transmission became the standard, while manual transmission, with or without overdrive, was available as an option. The differences in punctuation and phrasing do not significantly alter the message or meaning of the sentences. In the first sentence, the use of semicolons helps separate the main clauses, which are “Automatic transmission became standard” and “manual, with or without overdrive, was an option in 1967.” The semicolon is used to indicate that these two clauses are related but can stand alone as separate sentences. On the other hand, the second sentence uses a comma instead of a semicolon to separate the clauses which is also acceptable but less formal. Regarding the phrasing, there aren't substantial changes but there are two slight differences: 1. The first sentence uses \\"manual\\" whereas the second sentence uses \\"manually.\\" In this context, the use of \\"manual\\" is more appropriate, as it refers to a type of transmission rather than an adverb (which is what \\"manually\\" is). Nonetheless, the intended meaning is still understandable in the second sentence. 2. The second sentence includes an additional comma before \\"with or without overdrive.\\" This aspect is a stylistic choice and does not change the meaning of the sentence. The presence or absence of the comma in this case does not alter the interpretation of the phrase. In summary, despite minor differences in punctuation and phrasing, these two sentences can be considered paraphrases, as both convey the same essential information about the availability of automatic and manual transmission options in 1967."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Now, I have a new situation: Jim and Greg are brothers who both run their own farms, but they rarely see each other due to them living in different states. Greg runs a farm in Texas where he rarely sees rain so he spends much of his day watering his crops. Jim lives in Illinois where it rains much more regularly so he has more time to spend dealing with his farm animals instead of watering his plants. Both men intentionally purchased their farms next to lakes since they have always loved fishing during their free time. The brothers are currently planning a fishing trip together, but they are just debating which lake to travel to. Answer this question please: Will Greg's lake have more or less carbon dioxide than Jim's?","completion":"In general, it is difficult to conclusively determine which lake will have more or less carbon dioxide without taking other factors into account. However, we can infer some possibilities based on the given information. Greg's farm in Texas experiences less rainfall, meaning that there will be less runoff carrying fertilizers from his farm into the adjacent lake. As a result, there is a lower likelihood of nutrient-rich water promoting excessive algae growth in the lake. In the absence of excessive algae, carbon dioxide levels in the water may be more stable, as there will not be an overwhelming amount of algae consuming the carbon dioxide. On the other hand, Jim's farm in Illinois experiences more rainfall, increasing the chances of runoff carrying fertilizers into his adjacent lake. This could potentially lead to excessive algae growth due to the increased nitrogen levels, causing the algae to consume more carbon dioxide from the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue and consume oxygen, creating a dead zone with lower levels of oxygen and possibly higher levels of carbon dioxide. In summary, Greg's lake in Texas would likely have less carbon dioxide than Jim's lake in Illinois, due to lower rainfall causing less runoff carrying fertilizers into the water, leading to a lower likelihood of excessive algae growth and dead zones. However, several other factors, such as the size and depth of the lakes, wind patterns, and the types and amounts of fertilizers used, could also influence the carbon dioxide levels in the lakes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: One night, as Diaz stepped off the train and onto a nearly empty platform, a teenage boy approached and pulled out a knife. \\"He wanted my money, so I just gave him my wallet and told him, 'Here you go '\\" Diaz says. As the teen began to walk away, Diaz told him, \\"Hey, wait a minute. You forgot something. If you're going to be robbing people for the rest of the night, you might as well take my coat to keep you warm.\\" The robber looked at him puzzled, saying, \\"Why are you doing this?\\" Diaz replied, \\"If you're willing to risk your freedom for a few dollars, then you must really need the money. I mean, all I wanted to do was get dinner and if you really want to join me.....\\" Diaz says he and the teen went into a diner and sat in a booth. \\"The manager comes by, the dishwashers come by, the waiters come by to say hi,\\" Diaz says. The kid said, \\"You know everybody here. Do you own this place?\\" \\"No, I just eat here a lot,\\" Dias said. \\"But you're even nice to the dishwasher,\\" he said. Diaz replied, \\"Well, haven't you been taught you should be nice to everybody?\\" \\"Yea, but I didn't think people actually behaved that way,\\" the teen said. When the bill arrived, Diaz said, \\"You're going to have to pay for this bill because you have my money and I can't pay for this. So if you give me my wallet back, I'll gladly treat you.\\" The teen returned it immediately. \\"I gave him 20.... I figure maybe it'll help him.\\" Diaz says he asked for something in return--- the teen's knife--- \\"and he gave it to me.\\" Afterwards, when Diaz told his mother what happened, she said, \\"You're the type of kid that if someone asked you for the time, you gave them your watch.\\" \\"I figure, you know, if you treat people right, you can only hope that they treat you right.

Premise: \\"uh-huh yeah but uh every once in a while i like to watch some of the old movies i watched a Clint Eastwood movie last night\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Occasionally, I enjoy an old movie. \\"?","completion":"If we take the given premise, \\"uh-huh yeah but uh every once in a while I like to watch some of the old movies I watched a Clint Eastwood movie last night,\\" we can analyze its relation to the hypothesis \\"Occasionally, I enjoy an old movie.\\" In order to do this, let us dissect the components of the premise. The premise has two main ideas: 1. The speaker confirms a habit of watching movies from time to time: \\"uh-huh yeah but uh every once in a while I like to watch some of the old movies.\\" 2. The speaker provides an example of a recent scenario where they watched an old movie with Clint Eastwood: \\"I watched a Clint Eastwood movie last night.\\" Now, let's consider the hypothesis, \\"Occasionally, I enjoy an old movie.\\" The hypothesis essentially suggests that the speaker derives pleasure or enjoyment from watching old movies on an intermittent basis. Upon comparison, we can identify clear similarities between the premise and the hypothesis. The first idea in the premise corresponds with the hypothesis as both convey that the speaker watches old movies periodically. While the premise does not explicitly mention the term 'occasionally', the phrase \\"every once in a while\\" conveys a similar message - that the action takes place sporadically rather than regularly. Furthermore, the second idea in the premise offers evidence for the speaker actually engaging in watching old movies, which strengthens the connection between the premise and the hypothesis. This recent experience of watching a Clint Eastwood movie demonstrates the speaker's appreciation for classic films. Although the speaker doesn't directly mention \\"enjoyment\\" in the premise, we can infer this through the context and tone. The voluntary nature of watching old movies, coupled with the speaker's habit of partaking in this activity from time to time, suggests that they derive pleasure or satisfaction from it. In conclusion, given the premise \\"uh-huh yeah but uh every once in a while I like to watch some of the old movies I watched a Clint Eastwood movie last night,\\" it can be reasonably inferred that it entails the hypothesis \\"Occasionally, I enjoy an old movie.\\" Both the premise and hypothesis highlight the speaker's intermittent engagement in watching old movies, with the premise providing a concrete example of this habit through the mention of a Clint Eastwood film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jonah or Jonas is the name given in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh/Old Testament) to a prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel in about the 8th century BCE. He is the eponymous central figure of the Book of Jonah, in which he is called upon by God to travel to Nineveh and warn its residents to repent of their sins or face divine wrath. Instead, Jonah boards a ship to Tarshish. Caught in a storm, he orders the ship's crew to cast him overboard, whereupon he is swallowed by a giant fish. The Book of Jonah (Yonah yvnh) is one of the twelve minor prophets included in the Tanakh. According to one tradition, Jonah was the boy brought back to life by Elijah the prophet in 1 Kings 17. Another tradition holds that he was the son of the woman of Shunem brought back to life by Elisha in 2 Kings 4 and that he is called the \\"son of Amittai\\" (Truth) due to his mother's recognition of Elisha's identity as a prophet in 2 Kings 17:24. The Book of Jonah is read every year, in its original Hebrew and in its entirety, on Yom Kippur - the Day of Atonement, as the Haftarah at the afternoon mincha prayer. According to Rabbi Eliezer, the fish that swallowed Jonah was created in the primordial era and the inside of its mouth was like a synagogue; the fish's eyes were like windows and a pearl inside its mouth provided further illumination. According to the Midrash, while Jonah was inside the fish, it told him that its life was nearly over because soon the Leviathan would eat them both. Jonah promised the fish that he would save them. Following Jonah's directions, the fish swam up alongside the Leviathan and Jonah threatened to leash the Leviathan by its tongue and let the other fish eat it. The Leviathan heard Jonah's threats, saw that he was circumcized, and realized that he was protected by the Lord, so it fled in terror, leaving Jonah and the fish alive. Teshuva - the ability to repent and be forgiven by God - is a prominent idea in Jewish thought. This concept is developed in the Book of Jonah: Jonah, the son of truth (the name of his father \\"Amitai\\" in Hebrew means truth), refuses to ask the people of Nineveh to repent. He seeks the truth only, and not forgiveness. When forced to go, his call is heard loud and clear. The people of Nineveh repent ecstatically, \\"fasting, including the sheep,\\" and the Jewish scripts are critical of this. The Book of Jonah also highlights the sometimes unstable relationship between two religious needs: comfort and truth. What religious needs?","completion":"The religious needs mentioned in the context of the Book of Jonah are comfort and truth. These needs represent two fundamental aspects of religious life and belief. 1. Comfort: Religion often provides a sense of consolation, solace, and support to believers in times of hardship, doubt, or suffering. People may turn to religious beliefs and practices for reassurance and guidance, seeking answers to existential questions and a sense of purpose and meaning in their lives. In the Book of Jonah, the people of Nineveh find comfort in repentance, which helps them avoid divine punishment. 2. Truth: Religion also aims to convey a deeper understanding of reality, revealing divine or spiritual truths that go beyond ordinary human understanding. Religious teachings may offer ethical guidance, cosmological explanations, and insights into the nature of the divine, helping believers discern the ultimate meaning and structure of reality. In the case of Jonah, his status as a prophet and \\"son of truth\\" underscores the importance of conveying God's message to the people of Nineveh. The Book of Jonah showcases the tension between these two religious needs, as Jonah initially resists God's command to preach repentance to the people of Nineveh. The story illustrates the complexity of balancing the need for divine truths and seeking comfort in religious belief and practices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a question about this article: People with prolonged, frequent, or close contact with people with TB are at particularly high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate. A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active (\\"overt\\") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others. If someone does become infected, it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others. What is the answer to this question: About how long will a TB patient receiving effective treatment stay contagious?","completion":"A TB patient receiving effective treatment will stay contagious for about two weeks.

Article: While Nick was on the bus, reading his newspaper, the man sitting next to him suddenly pushed a large envelope into his hands. \\"Here, take this!\\" the man said, stood up and got off the bus before Nick could say a word. Nick sat there, holding the envelope. It felt heavy. There were papers inside, or money perhaps. \\"I'd better hand it over to the police,\\" he thought. There was a police station close to his office. But, as he got off the bus, a man came to him. He seemed to be waiting for something. \\"He wants the envelope,\\" Nick thought. Nick began to walk quickly, and the man hurried after him. Nick started to run, and the man began to run, too. But then, just before he got to the police station, Nick managed to lose the man in the crowds. When he entered the police station, the man was no longer in sight. Inside the police station, Nick handed over the envelope to a policeman in charge. The man opened it. The envelope was full of money, false money. \\"Clearly the man made a mistake,\\" the policeman said. \\"He thought you were one of the gang !\\" Nick felt like a hero.

Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius prosecutor Gerrie Nel wants the South African track star sent for independent psychiatric evaluation, he said Monday, in a move that could delay the athlete's murder trial for a month or more. A psychiatrist testified Monday that Pistorius has an anxiety disorder stemming from his double amputation as an infant and his unstable parents. He's depressed now and feeling guilt from having killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, defense witness Dr. Meryl Vorster said on the stand. Nel responded by comparing the athlete's mental state to post-traumatic stress disorder and saying the law required psychiatric observation. The prosecutor's extremely unusual move is essentially an effort to maneuver the court into considering an insanity or \\"capacity\\" defense even though the athlete's legal team is not mounting one, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said. Phelps, a criminologist and law lecturer at the University of Cape Town, said she had never seen this done before. Pistorius' lead defense lawyer, Barry Roux, is fighting back, saying Nel is oversimplifying the law. The question was left unresolved when court adjourned for the day. Nel is due to submit his application on Tuesday after both sides have finished questioning Vorster. The psychiatrist took the stand Monday morning for the defense, going all the way back to when the disabled sprinter was 11 months old. Pistorius would have experienced the amputation of both of his legs below the knee at that time as a \\"traumatic assault\\" because he was too young to speak or understand what was happening to him, she said in court. 1.

If you live near a water park, you might think about getting a season pass. This way you can go as often as you like. Check to see if there are any water parks around you. Many are indoor facilities. So even if it isn't warm enough where you live to swim outdoors, you can enjoy swimming in a temperature controlled area. The prices are usually good. For example, one ticket to Water World, a water park, is only 5. Some teens like to get a part time job over the summer to make some pocket money. Older teens shouldn't have much trouble finding jobs. An idea is to get some teens together to form your own summer job business. You can walk dogs, bring in the newspapers, feed the cats, collect rubbish, water flowers, etc. Being that it's summer, many people go on vacation and could use someone to look after their houses while they're away. You can also think about other jobs you can do for them. Teens love freedom. Sure you would like to get to such places as the small, movie theaters, the zoo, the beach, picnic, bowling and local amusement park instead of staying home all summer. Then a summer bus pass will be helpful. Check to see if your area has one for you teens. Such a pass costs only 10 for the whole summer.

Teacher:Given a question and a context passage, generate the answer having the word or phrase from the context passage. Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Context: Galaxies are the biggest groups of stars and can contain anywhere from a few million stars to many billions of stars. Every star that is visible in the night sky is part of the Milky Way Galaxy. To the naked eye, the closest major galaxy the Andromeda Galaxy, shown in Figure 1.1 looks like only a dim, fuzzy spot. But that fuzzy spot contains one trillion 1,000,000,000,000 stars! Galaxies are divided into three types according to shape: spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and irregular galaxies. Spiral galaxies spin, so they appear as a rotating disk of stars and dust, with a bulge in the middle, like the Sombrero Galaxy shown in Figure 1.2. Several arms spiral outward in the Pinwheel Galaxy (seen in Figure 1.2) and are appropriately called spiral arms. Spiral galaxies have lots of gas and dust and lots of young stars. The Andromeda Galaxy is a large spiral galaxy similar to the Milky Way. (a) The Sombrero Galaxy is a spiral galaxy that we see from the side so the disk and central bulge are visible. (b) The Pinwheel Galaxy is a spiral galaxy that we see face-on so we can see the spiral arms. Because they contain lots of young stars, spiral arms tend to be blue. Figure 1.3 shows a typical egg-shaped elliptical galaxy. The smallest elliptical galaxies are as small as some globular clusters. Giant elliptical galaxies, on the other hand, can contain over a trillion stars. Elliptical galaxies are reddish to yellowish in color because they contain mostly old stars. Most elliptical galaxies contain very little gas and dust because the gas and dust have already formed into stars. However, some elliptical galaxies, such as the one shown in Figure 1.4, contain lots of dust. Why might some elliptical galaxies contain dust? Is the galaxy in Figure 1.5 a spiral galaxy or an elliptical galaxy? It is neither one! Galaxies that are not clearly elliptical galaxies or spiral galaxies are irregular galaxies. How might an irregular galaxy form? Most irregular galaxies were once spiral or elliptical galaxies that were then deformed either by gravitational attraction to a larger galaxy or by a collision with another galaxy. This galaxy, called NGC 1427A, has nei- ther a spiral nor an elliptical shape. Dwarf galaxies are small galaxies containing only a few million to a few billion stars. Dwarf galaxies are the most common type in the universe. However, because they are relatively small and dim, we dont see as many dwarf galaxies from Earth. Most dwarf galaxies are irregular in shape. However, there are also dwarf elliptical galaxies and dwarf spiral galaxies. Look back at the picture of the elliptical galaxy. In the figure, you can see two dwarf elliptical galaxies that are companions to the Andromeda Galaxy. One is a bright sphere to the left of center, and the other is a long ellipse below and to the right of center. Dwarf galaxies are often found near larger galaxies. They sometimes collide with and merge into their larger neighbors. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: Click image to the left or use the URL below.

The trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression of the disease. The University College London (UCL) team is \\"excited\\", but it urges caution as any long-term benefit is uncertain and the drug needs more testing. \\"There's absolutely no doubt the most important unmet need in Parkinson's is a drug to slow down disease progression, it's unarguable,\\" Prof Tom Foltynie, one of the researchers, told the BBC. In Parkinson's, the brain is progressively damaged and the cells that produce the hormone dopamine are lost. It leads to a tremor, difficulty moving and eventually memory problems. Therapies help manage symptoms by boosting dopamine levels, but the death of the brain continues and the disease gets worse. No drug stops that happening. In the trial, half of patients were given the diabetes drug exenatide and the rest were given a placebo (dummy treatment). All the patients stayed on their usual medication. As expected, those on just their usual medication declined over 48 weeks of treatment. But those given exenatide were stable. And three months after the experimental treatment stopped, those who had been taking exenatide were still better off. Prof Foltynie told the BBC News website: \\"This is the first clinical trial in actual patients with Parkinson's where there has been anything like this size of effect. \\"It gives us confidence exenatide is not just masking symptoms, it's doing something to the underlying disease. \\"We have to be excited and encouraged, but also cautious as we need to replicate these findings.\\" They also need to trial the drug for much longer periods of time. An effective drug would need to hold back the disease for years in order to make a significant difference to patients. Parkinson's progresses slowly and the difference in this 60-week trial was definitely there, but was \\"trivial\\" in terms of the impact on day-to-day life, say the researchers. The drug helps control blood sugar levels in diabetes by acting on a hormone sensor called GLP-1. Those sensors are found in brain cells too. It is thought the drug makes those cells work more efficiently or helps them to survive. It is why the drug is being tested in other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's. David Dexter, the deputy director of research at Parkinson's UK, said: \\"The findings offer hope that drugs like exenatide can slow the course of Parkinson's - â€Šsomething no current treatment can do. \\"Because Parkinson's can progress quite gradually, this study was probably too small and short to tell us whether exenatide can halt the progression of the condition, but it's certainly encouraging and warrants further investigation.\\" Dr Brian Fiske, from the The Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, said: \\"The results from the exenatide studies justify continued testing, but clinicians and patients are urged not to add exenatide to their regimens until more is known about their safety and impact on Parkinson's.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"Okay kiddo, so this is like one of those stories where the good guys find a secret weapon that might help them win.

The medicines we have so far only help with what the monster's already done, but can't really stop him doing more damage. However, some scientific heroes in a place called the University College London have found a medicine that might just slow down the damage. This medicine called exenatide, actually used to help people who have too much sugar in their blood, seemed to keep the monster at bay while they tested it with some people. While this is like a superhero finding a potential new weapon, they're not sure yet if the weapon is safe or how long it can protect for. So, they need to continue testing and experimenting before they can use it to fight the Parkinson's monster. We are still not sure, but there is hope in the air, just like when the sun rises after a dark night."},{"prompt":"Given the following context: In the opinion of Robin Fedden, a diplomat, and later Deputy General Secretary of the National Trust and author of the Trust's first guidebook for Chartwell, the house became \\"the most important country house in Europe\\".

At Chartwell, he developed what Fedden calls, his own \\"little Foreign Office ... the hub of resistance\\". The Chartwell visitors' book, meticulously maintained from 1922, records some 780 house guests, not all of them friends, but all grist to Churchill's mill. An example of the latter was Sir Maurice Hankey, Clerk of the Privy Council, who was Churchill's guest for dinner in April 1936. Hankey subsequently wrote, \\"I do not usually make a note of private conversations but some points arose which gave an indication of the line which Mr Churchill is likely to take in forthcoming debates (on munitions and supply) in Parliament\\".

The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production.

There are several reasons as to why this particular review would influence my decision negatively: 1. Deceptive practices: The reviewer claims that Cingular provided misleading information, stating that they could return the phone for a full refund if needed. This suggests that the company may be employing deceptive practices to make sales. 2. Poor coverage: The reviewer mentions that the phone did not work in their area, indicating that the coverage may be insufficient for at least some potential customers. 3. Activation fees: Even though the phone did not work in the reviewer's area, they were still charged an activation fee after canceling the service. This could be seen as unreasonable and disappointing from a customer's perspective. 4. Customer service issues: The reviewer's experience shows that Cingular was not helpful in resolving the issue, which could reflect overall poor customer service. 5. Amazon's lack of assistance: The reviewer also reports that Amazon was unwilling to provide any reimbursement, which may raise concerns about purchasing the product through this platform. Taking all these factors into account, the negative aspects of the reviewer's experience would discourage me from buying this product and, instead, urge me to look for alternative options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In den letzten Jahren hat die Volksrepublik China eine enorme Nachfrage nach deutschen Automobilen und Industriemaschinen entwickelt, was sich als Katalysator für das Wachstum der deutschen Wirtschaft erwiesen hat. Deutschland, das als Exportland bekannt ist, hat diese Gelegenheit genutzt, um seine Präsenz auf dem chinesischen Markt auszubauen und seine Handelsbeziehungen zu stärken. Angesichts der wachsenden Mittelschicht in China können sich immer mehr Menschen hochwertige Produkte leisten, und deutsche Autos und Maschinen genießen aufgrund ihrer Technologie, Zuverlässigkeit und Qualität einen unvergleichlichen Ruf.

Detroit techno is an offshoot of Chicago house music which developed in the early and mid-1980s. One of the earliest hits was \\"Big Fun\\" by Inner City. Detroit techno developed as the DJ The Electrifying Mojo did his radio program, which fused eclectic sounds into the signature Detroit techno sound. This sound, also influenced by European electronica (Kraftwerk, Art of Noise), Japanese synthpop (Yellow Magic Orchestra), early B-boy (breakdancing) Hip-Hop (Man Parrish, Soul Sonic Force) and Italo disco (Doctor's Cat, Ris, Klein M.B.O.), was further pioneered by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson, known as the Belleville Three. Derrick May a.k.a. \\"MAYDAY\\" and Thomas Barnett released \\"Nude Photo\\" in 1987 on May's label \\"Transmat Records\\", which helped start the Detroit techno music scene. This record was played on Chicago's Hot Mix 5 Radio DJ mix show and in Chicago clubs. A year later, Transmat released \\"Strings of Life\\". Transmat Records also released such as 1988's \\"Wiggin\\". As well, Derrick May had releases on Kool Kat Records and many remixes for underground and mainstream recording artists. Kevin Saunderson's company KMS Records contributed many releases that were as much house music as they were techno. These tracks were well received in Chicago and played on Chicago radio and in clubs.Blake Baxter's 1986 recording, \\"When we Used to Play / Work your Body\\", 1987's \\"Bounce Your Body to the Box\\" and \\"Force Field\\", \\"The Sound / How to Play our Music\\" and \\"the Groove that Won't Stop\\" and a remix of \\"Grooving Without a Doubt\\". In 1988, as house music became more popular among general audiences, Kevin Saunderson's group Inner City with Paris Gray released the 1988 hits \\"Big Fun\\" and \\"Good Life\\", which eventually were picked up by Virgin Records. Each EP / 12 inch single sported remixes by Mike \\"Hitman\\" Wilson and Steve \\"Silk\\" Hurley of Chicago and Derrick \\"Mayday\\" May and Juan Atkins of Detroit.

Please briefly summarize this news article: A Swarm of Startups Are Filling the Uber Void in Austin Nature abhors a vacuum—and so does business. Just three weeks ago, Uber and Lyft ceased operations in Austin, Texas, following a public referendum that imposed what the transportation network companies considered onerous regulations. And now, in what is arguably America’s second-largest hub of tech startup culture, a half-dozen new or previously lesser-known competitors are angling for a taste of the leftovers. “They left a factory overnight with the machines running and the workers standing by,” Joe Liemandt told Austin Business Observer of the sudden opportunity. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Leimandt is part of a team of local tech leaders working to build RideAustin, a nonprofit ride-hailing service that will channel some revenue to charity. RideAustin is still gearing up, and hopes to launch in June. Other alternatives are moving in fast. Boston-based Fasten will launch Austin service on June 1st, backed by 9.1 million in capital. Fare, produced by Phoenix-based Ride Fare, is already operating in Austin, and says it has processed 700 drivers through the first stage of Austin’s required background check. Dallas-based Get Me is already operating in Austin, along with zTrip and Wingz. There’s also Arcade City, which skirts the new regulations (at least, for now) by allowing drivers to negotiate their own rates, and is planning an app based on the Ethereum blockchain. For more on the Austin ride-hailing saga, watch our video: The Austin government is actively helping these new entrants, including by hosting a job fair and running a hotline to connect former Uber and Lyft drivers with new operators. Though losing one city won’t seriously slow down either Uber or Lyft, the rush of alternatives suggests some shortsightedness in their decision to play chicken with city regulators. While a ride-sharing service isn’t necessarily the easiest thing in the world to build, it also clearly doesn’t have the kind of technological moat that makes it irreproducible. The fact that this is Austin, a major hub of the tech business, has further implications. A foothold in the city could give companies a serious platform for going national, particularly with the huge visibility provided by the annual South by Southwest festival. Of course, the next SXSW is still nine months away, and it’s entirely possible Uber and Lyft will cave in and return to Austin by then.","completion":"A while ago, Uber and Lyft stopped working in Austin, Texas because of some new rules they didn't like.

CHAPTER XI WITH DEJAH THORIS As we reached the open the two female guards who had been detailed to watch over Dejah Thoris hurried up and made as though to assume custody of her once more. The poor child shrank against me and I felt her two little hands fold tightly over my arm. Waving the women away, I informed them that Sola would attend the captive hereafter, and I further warned Sarkoja that any more of her cruel attentions bestowed upon Dejah Thoris would result in Sarkoja's sudden and painful demise. My threat was unfortunate and resulted in more harm than good to Dejah Thoris, for, as I learned later, men do not kill women upon Mars, nor women, men. So Sarkoja merely gave us an ugly look and departed to hatch up deviltries against us. I soon found Sola and explained to her that I wished her to guard Dejah Thoris as she had guarded me; that I wished her to find other quarters where they would not be molested by Sarkoja, and I finally informed her that I myself would take up my quarters among the men.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - Coal is burned in a boiler - Steam is produced under pressure - Flows into a turbine - The turbine spins - Creates electricity. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more pressure happens, how will it affect more steam flows into the turbine. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this scenario suggests that an increase in pressure will lead to more steam flowing into the turbine. To thoroughly assess the effects of this supposed perturbation, both directly and indirectly, let's first revisit the details of each step in the process and then examine the consequences of increased pressure on the overall system. 1. Coal is burned in a boiler: The main purpose of the boiler is to produce steam by burning coal. When heat is applied to water, it increases the internal energy and the water molecules eventually turn into steam. 2. Steam is produced under pressure: The pressure inside the boiler ensures that the steam produced has sufficient force to travel across the system and reach the turbine at a necessary rate. Maintaining optimum pressure levels is crucial in the efficiency and effectiveness of steam generation. 3. Steam flows into a turbine: Once the steam is produced under pressure, it flows through pipes and enters the turbine chamber. The high-pressure steam transfers its kinetic energy to the turbine blades, causing them to spin. 4. The turbine spins: As the steam hits the turbine blades, it forces the turbine to rotate, converting the thermal energy from the coal-burning process into mechanical energy. 5. Creates electricity: The spinning turbine is connected to an electric generator, which converts the mechanical energy from the spinning turbine into electrical energy. This electricity is then transmitted to the power grid for distribution to consumers. Now, let's consider the potential consequences of increased pressure in the system, as suggested by the perturbation hypothesis. Direct Effect: The primary direct effect of increased pressure will most likely be an increase in the steam flow rate into the turbine. With more pressure, the steam will have greater force and higher velocity as it enters the turbine chamber. This may lead to the turbine spinning faster, thus generating more electricity. However, this increase might only reach a certain point, as other factors such as the turbine's design and material limitations could restrict the potential benefits of increased pressure. Indirect Effects: Although the increased pressure might seem beneficial from a production standpoint, there are several potential indirect effects that need to be considered. a) Structural integrity: Boilers and turbines are designed to operate within certain pressure limits. Exceeding those limits might cause damage to the equipment and potentially lead to system failure or even dangerous accidents. b) Efficiency: While more pressure initially may lead to an increased flow of steam into the turbine, it could also result in saturation of the steam at higher pressures. Saturated steam is less efficient in transferring energy to the turbine, resulting in reduced overall efficiency of the system. c) Fuel consumption: The burning of more coal to maintain higher pressure might lead to increased fuel consumption, which in turn raises operational costs and contributes to increased greenhouse gas emissions. d) Maintenance: Operating the boiler and turbine under higher pressures could result in increased wear and tear on the equipment, necessitating more frequent and costly maintenance. To summarize, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that increased pressure will result in more steam flowing into the turbine, which might seem beneficial for electricity generation.

Given the question: If a plant requires less water then that plant will survive in a drought, and some plants are extraordinarily tolerant of drought. Given these facts, some vegetation requires less water and can survive what among the following options: - massive damage - enormous damage to homes - Brutal temperatures - Greenhouse gases - If it's dry - prolonged thirst - reduced heat - salinity The answer is:","completion":"Based on the provided information, some vegetation requires less water and can survive prolonged thirst. In the context of the question, a plant requiring less water is indicative of its ability to survive and thrive even in conditions where water is scarce, such as during a drought. Drought-tolerant plants have adaptations that allow them to withstand low moisture levels and maintain their growth and development with minimal water intake. This capability is primarily attributed to the plant's inherent ability to conserve water and efficiently manage its internal resources. Given the list of options to choose from, the one that best corresponds to the survival capabilities of drought-tolerant plants is \\"prolonged thirst.\\" Prolonged thirst, in this case, describes conditions in which there is a lack or insufficiency of water in the environment that lasts for an extended period. This lack of water can create challenges for many plants, as water is a critical component of plant growth and development, and it is necessary for their health and survival. Drought-tolerant plants are equipped with various strategies to conserve water and withstand prolonged thirst. These adaptations may include: 1. Deep and extensive root systems: These roots help the plant access water from deeper underground sources or use moisture stored in the soil more efficiently. 2. Small or specialized leaves: Leaves with reduced surface areas minimize water loss through transpiration, the process by which plants release water into the atmosphere through their leaves. 3. CAM photosynthesis: Drought-tolerant plants, such as cacti and succulents, may use a specialized form of photosynthesis known as Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM), which enables them to open stomata (pores on their leaves) at night instead of during the day. This allows for a reduced rate of water loss and increased water-use efficiency. 4. Drought dormancy: Some plants can enter a state of drought dormancy, reducing their metabolic processes and conserving water until more favorable conditions return. Given these specialized adaptations and characteristics, we can conclude that some vegetation requires less water and can indeed survive the challenges of prolonged thirst. While the other options mentioned, such as massive damage, brutal temperatures, greenhouse gases, and salinity, are all factors that can affect plant life, they do not necessarily relate directly to the water consumption and drought tolerance capabilities of plants as discussed in the primary question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Johnnie had a set of small volumes of English verse, extensively annotated by his own hand, which Stoddard had brought to her early in their acquaintance, leaving it with her more as a gift than as a loan. She kept these little books after all the others had gone back. She had read and reread them--cullings from Chaucer, from Spenser, from the Elizabethan lyrists, the border balladry, fierce, tender, oh, so human--till she knew pages of them by heart, and their vocabulary influenced her own, their imagery tinged all her leisure thoughts. It seemed to her, whenever she debated returning them, that she could not bear it. She would get them out and sit with one of them open in her hands, not reading, but staring at the pages with unseeing eyes, passing her fingers over it, as one strokes a beloved hand, or turning through each book only to find the pencilled words in the margins. She would be giving up part of herself when she took these back. Yet it had to be done, and one miserable morning she made them all into a neat package, intending to carry them to the mill and place them on Stoddard's desk thus early, when nobody would be in the office. Then the children came in; Deanie was half sick; and in the distress of getting the ailing child comfortably into her own bed, Johnnie forgot the books.

Here is an article: BEIJING (AP)  North Korean leader Friday after a secretive five-day visit that produced an affirmation of long-delayed nuclear disarmament talks but no firm dateline for rejoining that process. Kim's armored train crossed the border back into North Korea midmorning after leaving Beijing Thursday following talks with Chinese leaders that touched on the six-nation denuclearization talks stalled since December 2008. \\"Kim said that the DPRK will work with China to create favorable conditions for restarting the six-party talks,\\" the Xinhua News Agency said in a report on his meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao. The visit began Monday and has been shrouded in secrecy in keeping with Kim's reclusive ways. In footage run by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, Kim, 68, who reportedly suffered a stroke in 2008, appeared thin but relatively vigorous in meetings with Chinese President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao, and other officials. Kim, wearing a pea green leisure suit, was shown shaking hands with Chinese leaders at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, in footage apparently shot on Wednesday night. He exchanged comments with Hu in a conference room, then stood and read from a piece of paper at a banquet table and exchanged toasts, wine glass in hand. Other footage showed him visiting a biotechnology firm accompanied by Hu, during an excursion to Beijing's Zhongguancun high-tech zone believed to have happened Thursday morning. The eccentric Kim is known to shun air travel and travels entirely by road and rail. The Korean Central News agency said in a dispatch from Pyongyang that Kim made the \\"unofficial\\" visit starting Monday and ending Friday. Kim was seen in China by journalists several times, although Chinese spokesmen repeatedly refused to confirm his presence in the country. KCNA did not mention a one-on-one meeting with Hu or even a visit to Beijing, where Kim's motorcade was seen Wednesday and Thursday. It's description of the visit as unofficial appeared to explain the lack of formal protocol such as an official welcoming ceremony or the flying of North Korean flags in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Kim has grown ever more dependent on Chinese aid and diplomatic support, while Beijing appears determined to provide whatever support necessary to prevent his impoverished regime's implosion and the potential political chaos that could bring severe unrest to its border. The KCNA report said Kim toured the northeastern cities of Dalian and Tianjin and met with vice premier Li Keqiang and other officials. \\"The leader of the DPRK received a sincere and warm welcome from Chinese people wherever he went in China,\\" KCNA said. \\"Kim Jong Il expressed satisfaction over the result of his visit.\\" This week's visit was Kim's fifth to China since succeeding his father as ruler in 1994, the last being in 2006. South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that Kim told Hu he is ready to return to denuclearization talks, under which North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear programs in return for food and fuel aid. Kim has similar things in past, but usually with attached conditions, such as a long-sought direct dialogue with the United States. Yonhap did not say what, if any, conditions he set this time. North Korea quit the talks, involving China, Russia, the two Koreas, Japan and the U.S., a year ago and then conducted a nuclear test that drew tightened U.N. sanctions. A return to the talks is likely to go hand-in-hand with new aid, including the implementation of economic agreements reached during a visit by Wen to North Korea last year. Xinhua said Wen told Kim the two enjoyed \\"big potential for developing economic and trade cooperation,\\" singling out the need to speed up development of infrastructure along their borders. China, which sent troops to back North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War, already provides most of the aid needed to feed North Korea's malnourished population of 23 million and prop up an economy devastated by natural disasters and chaotic management most recently a currency revaluation that backfired disastrously. Beijing's support for Kim is driven overwhelmingly by its own security concerns, which override any unhappiness it might have over North Korea's nuclear program or rejection of economic reforms, Chinese scholars say. \\"No matter how different its opinions are from those of the North Koreans, and how much unhappiness it has toward them, the Chinese government will not leave North Korea to implode, and it will not let the strategic balance of the Korean peninsula be broken,\\" said Cai Jian, deputy director of the Center for Korean Studies in Shanghai's Fudan University. That, however, comes at the risk of upsetting South Korea, where suspicion is rising that a North Korean torpedo destroyed the naval ship Cheonan in March, killing 46 sailors. North Korea has denied involvement. The timing of Kim's China visit has aroused some complaints among South Korean politicians, who say it shows insensitivity toward the Cheonan victims. South Korean officials have asked that China play a \\"responsible role\\" in the aftermath of the sinking and keep them informed of Kim's activities in China.

However, properly blending coloring oil with chocolate can sometimes be tricky, especially if you want to avoid an uneven or unsightly mixture. This article offers a simple and effective step-by-step approach to ensure perfect results every time you color your chocolate treats. Step 1: Preparing the Coloring Oil The key to achieving a perfectly mixed colorful chocolate is to warm the coloring oil before adding it to the chocolate. This helps in ensuring that both materials are at a reasonable and consistent temperature, which, in turn, helps in creating a smooth and uniform blend. To start, place the tightly sealed coloring oil in a small zip lock bag. Ensure the bottle is securely sealed, as you don't want any water or air to infiltrate the bag and disturb the oil or cause contamination. Additionally, using a zip lock bag ensures that the label on the bottle stays intact and dry, making it easy to identify the color. Step 2: Warming the Coloring Oil To warm the coloring oil, prepare a bowl with warm water. The water should not be too hot or boiling, as it may damage the oil or cause it to overheat. Once you have the appropriate water temperature, place the plastic bag containing the sealed oil bottle in the bowl with warm water. Allow the oil to sit in the water for 10-15 minutes, which should be enough time to achieve the desired warmth. Step 3: Mixing the Coloring Oil with Chocolate After the oil has warmed up, remove the bottle from the plastic bag. Make sure to dry the exterior of the bottle to prevent any water from entering the chocolate. Before adding the oil to your chocolate, the chocolate should also be warmed or slightly melted to enhance its blendability. Once your chocolate is warmed and ready, slowly add a few drops of the coloring oil to the chocolate. Be careful not to introduce too much oil at once, as this may result in an overpowering color or alter the chocolate's consistency. It's essential to work on one color at a time to maintain control over the process and avoid any mistakes or color contamination. Gently stir the chocolate and oil mixture to ensure a consistent and even distribution of color throughout the chocolate. Conclusion: Following these easy steps will help you turn ordinary chocolate into a vibrant and eye-catching treat with the perfect blend of coloring and flavor. With practice, you can expand your color palette and elevate your chocolate-making skills. The next time you're preparing a batch of chocolate goodies, don't hesitate to add some color to make your creations truly stand out."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A mysophobe named Barry Nottingham (Richard Griffiths) agreed to keep that promise when the Bronson family sold their hotel to himâthen built a new hotel instead. Thirty years later, when the story begins, Skeeter is the hotel's handyman while management is held by Kendall (Guy Pearce). Barry's new hotel, the Sunny Vista Nottingham Hotel, is a hit, but he's got plans to build an even more elaborate hotel, one designed around a theme that he's keeping secret. Skeeter's sister and principal of Webster Elementary School, Wendy (Courteney Cox), asks Skeeter to watch her kids, Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling) and Patrick (Jonathan Morgan Heit), while she goes out of town. Skeeter does not know his niece and nephew very well, but agrees. Helping him during the day is Wendy's friend, Jill Hastings (Keri Russell), a teacher who works at the same school as Wendy.

The kids add their own details such as the king giving Sir Fixalot a chance to prove himself, a mermaid based on Jill, and a downpour of gumballs when Fixalot prevails.

Această situație ridică probleme în ceea ce privește concurența loială și sustenabilitatea, deoarece companiile europene sunt supuse unor norme și reglementări stricte care mențin un nivel ridicat de calitate și protecția mediului, în timp ce importurile provenite din alte regiuni nu necesară aderarea la aceleași cerințe. Această discrepanță poate duce la o serie de probleme. În primul rând, acest lucru ar putea avea un impact negativ asupra industriei europene, deoarece companiile europene ar putea fi dezavantajate competitiv în fața concurenței din afara Uniunii. Atunci când consumatorii aleg să cumpere produse importate mai ieftine, datorită faptului că acestea nu sunt fabricate în conformitate cu cele mai ridicate standarde, producătorii europeni pot fi afectați în mod direct. În al doilea rând, acest sistem poate încuraja externalizarea producției și slăbiciunea regulilor de mediu în alte părți ale lumii. Acest lucru ar putea avea un impact negativ asupra mediului și asupra dezvoltării durabile în alte regiuni. Producătorii din țări aflate în afara Uniunii Europene pot alege să profite de diferențele de reglementare și să producă bunuri cu impact ecologic mai mare, eventual poluante, la costuri mai mici datorită lipsa de reglementări similare pe piața lor locală. În al treilea rând, această situație creează un mediu în care consumatorii europeni pot fi induși în eroare. Produsele produse în Europa și cele importate nu sunt întotdeauna etichetate în mod corespunzător pentru a indica originea și nivelul de calitate și protecție a mediului, ceea ce înseamnă că consumatorii nu pot lua întotdeauna decizii informate în ceea ce privește produsele pe care le cumpără. Pentru a aborda aceste probleme, Uniunea Europeană ar trebui să continue să își dezvolte și să își consolideze reglementările în domeniul producției, calității și protecției mediului în ansamblul său, precum și să ia măsuri pentru a asigura transparența și comunicarea corectă a informațiilor către consumatori. Acest lucru ar putea implica implementarea unor standarde și cerințe comune pentru importurile de produse în Uniunea Europeană și adoptarea unui sistem unitar de etichetare și informare a consumatorilor. În concluzie, reglementările și restricțiile de producție în Europa sunt esențiale pentru asigurarea unei concurențe loiale și a unui mediu sustenabil.

Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting. In sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; Chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it. She meets a boy (voice: Jason Marsden) in traditional dress who is alarmed to see her; he tells her to leave and get back across the river before it gets dark. Chihiro runs back to her parents, but they're still eating -- and they've turned into pigs. Strange, dark, ghostly figures appear in all the shops and streets, frightening Chihiro and separating her from the pigs that were her parents.

Given the question: Information: - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body. This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months. While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule. It also affects the underlying bone and cartilage. The diagnosis is made mostly on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms. X-rays and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms. Other diseases that may present similarly include systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia among others. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. A group of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence. RA affects between 0.5 and 1% of adults in the developed... - Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints. Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness. Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints. In some types other organs are also affected. Onset can be gradual or sudden. There are over 100 types of arthritis. The most common forms are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and affects the fingers, knees, and hips. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that often affects the hands and feet. Other types include gout, lupus, fibromyalgia, and septic arthritis. They are all types of rheumatic disease. Treatment may include resting the joint and alternating between applying ice and heat. Weight loss and exercise may also be useful. Pain medications such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used. In some a joint replacement may be useful. Osteoarthritis affects more than 3.8% of people while rheumatoid arthritis affects about 0.24% of people. Gout affects about 1 to 2% of the Western population at some point in their lives. In Australia about 15% of people are affected, while in the United States more than 20% of have a type of arthritis. Overall the disease becomes more common with age. Arthritis is a common reason that people miss work and can result in a decreased quality of life. The term is from Greek \\"arthro-\\" meaning joint and \\"-itis\\" meaning inflammation. - Palindromic rheumatism ( PR ) consists of sudden and rapidly developing attacks of arthritis . There is acute pain , redness , swelling , and disability of one ( usually ) or multiple joints . The interval between recurrent attacks is extremely variable and how long the attack lasts is also variable . There is no joint damage after attacks . - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a medical condition characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include feeling tired to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory. Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present. The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors with half the risk attributed to each. The condition runs in families and many genes are believed to be involved. Environmental factors may include psychological stress, trauma, and certain infections. The pain appears to result from processes in the central nervous system and the condition is referred to as a \\"central sensitization syndrome\\". Fibromyalgia is recognized as a disorder by the US National Institutes of Health and the American College of Rheumatology. There is no specific diagnostic test. Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes and verifying that a set number of symptoms are present. The treatment of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage. Fibromyalgia is estimated to affect 28% of the population. Females are affected about twice as often as males. Rates appear... - Septic arthritis, also known as infectious arthritis or joint infection, is the purulent invasion of a joint by an infectious agent which produces arthritis. People with artificial joints are more at risk than the general population but have slightly different symptoms, are infected with different organisms and require different treatment. Septic arthritis is considered a medical emergency. If untreated, it may destroy the joint in a period of days. The infection may also spread to other parts of the body. - Replacement arthroplasty (from Greek \\"arthron\\", joint, limb, articulate, + \\"plassein\\", to form, mould, forge, feign, make an image of), or joint replacement surgery, is a procedure of orthopedic surgery in which an arthritic or dysfunctional joint surface is replaced with an orthopedic prosthesis. Joint replacement is considered as a treatment when severe joint pain or dysfunction is not alleviated by less-invasive therapies. During the latter half of the 20th century, rheumasurgery developed as a subspecialty focused on these and a few other procedures in patients with rheumatic diseases. - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Initially, symptoms may occur only following exercise, but over time may become constant. Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and when the back is affected weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are those near the ends of the fingers, at the base of the thumb, neck, lower back, knee, and hips. Joints on one side of the body are often more affected than those on the other. Usually the symptoms come on over years. It can affect work and normal daily activities. Unlike other types of arthritis, only the joints are typically affected. Causes include previous joint injury, abnormal joint or limb development, and inherited factors. Risk is greater in those who are overweight, have one leg of a different length, and have jobs that result in high levels of joint stress. Osteoarthritis is believed to be caused by mechanical stress on the joint and low grade inflammatory processes. It develops as cartilage is lost and the underlying bone becomes affected. As pain may make it difficult to exercise, muscle loss may occur. Diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms, with medical imaging and other tests occasionally used to either support or rule out other problems. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, which is primarily an inflammatory condition, in osteoarthritis, the joints do not typically become hot or red. Treatment includes exercise, efforts to decrease joint stress, support groups, and pain medications. Efforts to decrease joint stress include resting and the use of a cane. Weight loss may help in those who are overweight. Pain medications may include paracetamol (acetaminophen) as well as NSAIDs such as naproxen or ibuprofen. Long-term opioid use is generally discouraged due to lack of information on benefits as well as risks of addiction and other side effects. If...

So it is only natural that most moms and dads will try just about anything, including spending a lot of money -to keep an attack at bay. Trouble is, more than half of parents are trying strategies that simply do not work and wasting hundreds of dollars in the process. According to Dr. Machael Cabana, a pediatrician at the prefix = st1 /UniversityofMichigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, who led the study, one of the most common mistakes was to buy mattress cover to protect against dust mites for a child whose asthma instead was made by plant pollen . Many of those parents then neglected to do what would have helped a lot more; shut the windows to keep pollen out. Another was using a humidifier for a child who was allergic to dust mites; a humidifier tends to be a place where dust mites like to breed. With those allergies, a dehumidifier works better. Worst of all was the number of smokers with asthmatic children who didn't even try to quit or at least limit themselves to smoking outdoors rather than just moving to another room or the garage. Many smoking parents purchased expensive air filters that have what Cabana called \\" questionable utility. \\" Part of the problem, Dr. Caban and his colleagues believe, is that parents are bombarded by television ads that encourage them to buy products such as air and carpet fresheners, ionizers and other remedies that are often expensive but medically unnecessary. And doctors may not always take the time, or have the time, to explain to parents what will and won't work in their child's particular case. For example, allergies are usually a problem for older children with asthma, while kids 5 and younger more frequently have trouble with viral repiratory infections. So make sure you understand what the cause of your child's asthma really is. Which sentence best explains why TV ads products bombard parents? A) TV ads are obliged to make sure parents understand all terms of their introductory offers. B) TV ads want to be sure that parents understand the benefits of very effective medical aids.

Answer the above question based on the context below: When Scranton agreed to take on Steamtown, U.S.A., it was estimated that the museum and excursion business would attract 200,000 to 400,000 visitors to the city every year. In anticipation of this economic boon, the city and a private developer spent 13 million to renovate the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W) station and transform it into a Hilton hotel, at a time when the unemployment rate in the city was 13 percent. Only 60,000 visitors showed up at Steamtown in 1987, and the 1988 excursions were canceled. After only three years, it was 2.2 million in debt and facing bankruptcy. Part of the problem was the cost of restoration of the new property and the deteriorating equipment. In addition, while the tourists in Vermont had enjoyed the sights of cornfields, farms, covered bridges, a waterfall and a gorge on a Steamtown excursion, the Scranton trip to Moscow, Pennsylvania, cut through one of the nation's largest junkyards, an eyesore described by Ralph Nader as \\"the eighth wonder of the world\\".In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, under the urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the spending of 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of 66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? How do Outback Steakhouses prepare and cook their steaks? How do Outback Steakhouses prepare their steaks?","completion":"While both questions deal with the preparation of steaks at Outback Steakhouses, they do differ in the scope of the information being sought. 1. \\"How do Outback Steakhouses prepare and cook their steaks?\\" This question is asking for a detailed and comprehensive explanation of both the preparation process and the cooking methods used for steaks at Outback Steakhouses. This covers aspects such as seasoning, marinating, the choice of cuts, and cooking temperatures, as well as any other factors that contribute to the final product. To answer this question, let's first look at the preparation process: Outback Steakhouse is known for its signature steaks, which typically come in various cuts including rib-eye, filet, New York strip, and sirloin. The preparation process starts with selecting high-quality cuts of meat, usually sourced from trusted suppliers to ensure the best possible taste and texture. The steaks are then aged to enhance their flavor and tenderness. During the preparation stage, the steaks are seasoned using the restaurant's proprietary blend of 17 spices, which is a closely-guarded secret. This spice blend provides the unique and distinctive flavor Outback Steakhouse is known for. The steaks can also be marinated, if necessary, in a special marinade tailored to each specific cut of meat. Now, let's discuss the cooking process: Outback Steakhouses use a combination of grilling and broiling to cook their steaks. This method sears in the flavors while ensuring that the steaks are cooked to the desired level of doneness. The restaurant uses concept flame grills, which are specifically designed for high-heat cooking. These grills can reach temperatures of up to 650°F (343°C), which allows for a perfect sear and crust on the outside of the steak while maintaining tenderness on the inside. Customers can request their preferred level of doneness, ranging from rare to well-done, and the steaks are cooked accordingly. The cooking times and temperatures vary depending on factors like the thickness of the steak and the desired level of doneness, but they generally use consistent guidelines to achieve the expected results. 2. \\"How do Outback Steakhouses prepare their steaks?\\" This question is focused on the preparation process and does not explicitly inquire about the cooking methods. It seeks information on factors such as seasoning, the choice of cuts, and any other steps that take place before the actual cooking process begins. To answer this question, a detailed explanation would cover the selection of high-quality cuts of meat and the aging process that enhances the flavor and tenderness of the steaks. Additionally, the answer would mention Outback Steakhouse's proprietary blend of 17 spices used for seasoning and any marination process tailored to specific cuts of meat. In summary, while both questions revolve around the steaks served at Outback Steakhouses, the first question asks for a more comprehensive response that includes both preparation and cooking methods, whereas the second question explicitly focuses on the preparation stage only."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jack Ponti, of Cazzy Dog Management, had helped Pru produce a demo tape to secure the record deal. Lott had noted Pru's potential as an artist through her lyrics. He worked closely with her to match her songwriting to the most appropriate sound, serving as the executive producer for her debut studio album Pru.Prior to securing a record deal, Pru had found inspiration for her music in artists such as Cassandra Wilson and Dianne Reeves. She wrote song lyrics and poetry while attending high school and then Texas Southern University, coupling her lyrics with the music of other artists such as Michael Jackson, Rachelle Ferrell, Sade, Naughty by Nature, the Isley Brothers, and Miles Davis. While discussing her approach to songwriting, Pru elaborated: \\"From a word, I can get a whole picture, a visual. The song becomes a poem, almost like a thesis.\\" She considered her music as a form of poetry, citing the album track \\"Hazy Shades\\" as an example of a poem turned into a song.Pru stated that she wanted her songs to bring variety to contemporary R&B, and described the material as the opposite of the formulaic music typically found on radio.

Truck and his partner Jerry Barnes go to collect their bounty from Nate Dinwiddie, a bail bondsman, who refers them to Fogarty, a bail bondsman after a pimp who skipped bail named Gator. The two visit Dorinda, who runs Gator's stable of prostitutes. Truck and Jerry wait for Gator to visit, and chase him, but Gator escapes. A tip from Truck's friend Duke allows them to locate Gator again, and kill Gator when he attempts to shoot Truck. Dorinda threatens Gator's former whores to keep them in line. Dorinda offers Gator's competing pimps a deal: whoever kills Truck gets to replace Gator while she runs the stable. The only pimp interested in the violence is Harvard Blue. Truck survives several ambushes by Blue's goons. When Blue points out that Dorinda will not be able to deal with Truck, they agree to share the cost of getting rid of Truck, and Blue will take over more control of Gator's stable. Blue's men force Nate to call Truck and tell him that there is a big job. Truck does not feel sober enough after a night of partying, so he calls Jerry, who dies in Blue's ambush. Nate warns Truck of the hit out on him. Truck frames Annie for shoplifting, and the police arrest her. Truck visits Nate again in the hospital. Truck gives Nate Jerry's gun for protection, and then they shoot Blue's goons when they burst in. Blue flees, but Truck shoots him. Blue dies a few minutes later in the driver's seat of his car. Truck confronts Dorinda and more goons at her house, and kills her when she reaches for a gun. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Nate Dinwiddie"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My next class, Spanish, scared me. As the second bell rang in the hallway, I ran to the door of the classroom. At the door, a hand reached out and shook mine firmly. I looked up. A man smiled and introduced himself as Profe, which means teacher or professor in Spanish. Right away, his warm smile and welcoming words eased my fears. I enjoyed his classes a great deal because I learned more than just Spanish. I admit I only speak a little Spanish. But I try to live out the life lessons I learned from Profe every day. \\"Everyone is worth your time. \\" Profe stood outside his classroom door every day before and after class. During lunch, his room was always filled with students. He would stay after school to listen to and chat with students. He taught me that every person is special. \\"Don't fear the difficulties.\\" One time, I ran into his class crying. My friends had _ me, and I wasn't even sure why they always left me alone. Profe told me, \\"Linda, life gives you ashes . But learning its lessons will turn those ashes to jewels.

We want to find out how many toys (d) we have. Now, we have this given information: We have -568 toys in one group and take away 1710 more toys, and that same amount is equal to -758 toys in another group. Let's solve this to find d (the number of toys we have) step-by-step: 1. First, let's add 758*d to both sides of the equation: -568*d + 758*d - 1710 = -758*d + 758*d This simplifies to: 190*d - 1710 = 0 2. Now, let's add 1710 to both sides of the equation: 190*d - 1710 + 1710 = 0 + 1710 This simplifies to: 190*d = 1710 3. Finally, let's divide both sides of the equation by 190: 190*d / 190 = 1710 / 190 This simplifies to: d = 9 So, we found out that we have 9 toys (d=9).

Today I am going to tell you something about manners in different countries. I think you already know that people in different countries usually have different ways of doing things. Something that is rude in one country may be quite polite in another. For example, in Britain you mustn't lift your bowl to your mouth when you are having liquid food. That is considered bad manners in Britain. But in Japan you needn't worry about making a noise when you drink something. It shows that you are enjoying it. In Britain we try not to put our hands on the table at all during a meal. In Mexico, however, guests are expected to keep their hands on the table _ a meal. In Arabic countries we must be careful with our hands. You see, in Arabic countries you mustn't eat with your left hand. This is considered to be very impolite.

Please answer the following question: In his lifetime, Ray had done a number of things for which he was not proud, things he'd like to see just as well stuffed down a dark hole. Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more. Conflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation. Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings. People liked to be listened to. The illusion of having a voice was almost as good as actually having one. Isn't that why people still bothered to go to the polls on election day and vote?

Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

Answer the following question: Around three forty-five on a rainy Saturday morning, I was woken up by the sound of my pager beeping. As a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, I can never count on a full night of sleep. I pulled myself out of bed and went toward the desk to grab my radio. Our crew was being sent to a nearby home where a man was in cardiac arrest . We found the man lying on the kitchen floor with his wife beside him. We rushed the patient to the hospital, but despite our efforts, we were unable to save his life. In my line of life, I rarely get any recognition from the patients we treat, or from their loved ones. But that night, a man's wife approached us, and through her tears, whispered, \\"Thank you.\\" Then she hugged each of us. She knew we answered her late-night call for help, even though the ending was not positive. There is something deeply rewarding about helping people in these circumstances. Sometimes, I'm able to make their worst day a bit better: like seeing the tears of an injured child turn into a smile when I gave him an interesting toy; or watching a terrified mother's screams turn into tears of joy when she realized her baby was going to be fine. Experiences like these allow me to see the impact my work has on others. At the same time, I also know the effect _ has had on my own life. As a teenager, I felt awkward when my dad hugged me and said, \\" I love you, my dear son.\\" I was equally uncomfortable and responded, \\"I love you.\\" But then I imagined him lying on the kitchen floor that rainy night and realized that my opportunity to say those three words could---at any moment---be taken away forever.

Here is a news article: And as technology increasingly allows doctors to diagnose problems in a developing fetus, the study underscores remaining risks and hurdles, including developing less-invasive techniques to avoid creating other problems for babies or mothers. The spina bifida procedure was considered beneficial enough that an independent safety monitoring board stopped the study early so babies scheduled to receive surgery after birth could have access to prenatal surgery. But there were medical downsides for the women and infants: greater likelihood of being born several weeks earlier than the postnatal group, related breathing problems, and thinning or tearing at women’s surgical incisions, requiring Caesarean sections for later births. Photo “While this is a very promising and quite exciting result,” said a study author, Dr. Diana Farmer, surgeon in chief at the Benioff Children’s Hospital at the University of California, San Francisco, “not all the patients were helped here, and there are significant risks. This procedure is not for everyone.” Conducting the study was itself challenging. Prenatal spina bifida surgery gained attention in the late 1990s when some medical centers, like Vanderbilt University, began performing it. A photograph in which a fetus’s hand appeared to be gripping the finger of a surgeon who had lifted the hand out of the womb was circulated by opponents of abortion rights, further raising the profile. Leading experts suggested a clinical trial to determine if prenatal surgery was better than postnatal. They insisted on an unusual agreement: that all but three hospitals, in Philadelphia, San Francisco and Nashville, stop doing the procedure. “There were lots of places that wanted to do it” amid pressure from eager patients, said Dr. Michael Harrison, who pioneered fetal surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, and was a principal investigator for the spina bifida trial before retiring. “But we wanted to make sure it wouldn’t become a freak show. And if you offer treatment outside the trial, you’ll never have a trial because no mother would agree to flip a coin.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ultimately the other hospitals acceded. One reason spina bifida researchers wanted a trial was the experience with prenatal surgery for a condition in which the diaphragm has life-threatening abnormalities. After early efforts to repair the condition prenatally, “we thought we were heroes,” Dr. Harrison said, but realized it worked only for milder cases. Another prenatal approach, forcing the lungs to grow, worked, but caused significantly premature births, making it no better than postnatal treatment, he said. He added that prenatal techniques had improved, becoming less harmful. Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

The spina bifida study involved the most severe form, myelomeningocele (MY-ell-oh-men-NING-guh-seal), in which the spine does not close properly and the spinal cord protrudes. Children may experience lower-body paralysis, fluid on the brain, bladder problems and learning disabilities. About one in 3,000 children have that form, said Dr. Alan Guttmacher, director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which financed and helped conduct the study. Many babies now receive surgery to close the spinal opening after birth, but nerve damage from the spinal cord exposure to amniotic fluid remains. Also, the brainstem may be pulled into the spinal column. Excess fluid in the brain may require draining with implanted shunts, which can lead to infection or need repeated surgical replacement. In the study, about 80 babies were randomly selected for surgery after birth; another 80 had the spinal opening surgically closed in utero, between 19 and 26 weeks of pregnancy. Two in each group died. Photo Before surgery, babies in the prenatal group had more severe spinal lesions than the postnatal group, but more in the prenatal group had better results, said a co-author, Dr. Scott Adzick, chief of pediatric surgery at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Those who received prenatal surgery were half as likely to have a shunt, and eight times as likely to have a normally positioned brainstem. There was “much better motor function of the legs,” Dr. Adzick said, and at 30 months old, nearly twice as many walked without crutches or orthotics. Although they were born at 34 weeks of pregnancy on average, compared with 37 weeks for the postnatal group, there was no difference in cognitive development, said Dr. Catherine Spong, chief of pregnancy and perinatology at the child health institute. Dr. Adzick said prenatal surgery may “stop exposure of the developing spinal cord and perhaps avert further neurological damage” or stop the leak of spinal fluid that causes brainstem problems. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Results were dramatic for Tyson Thomas, of Stansbury Park, Utah, now 22 months old. His mother, Jessica Thomas, a study participant, said doctors had described his brain malformation as “the worst they had ever seen” and said “it would be likely that he wouldn’t be able to breathe on his own.” Since birth at 35 weeks gestation, she said, Tyson breathes independently, shows no brainstem malformation and is starting to talk. Bladder nerve damage will require him to urinate through catheters all his life. He now uses a walker and a foot brace, but is “getting really close to walking” on his own, said Ms. Thomas, a nurse. Researchers will follow the children from ages 6 to 9 to see if benefits continue. Several experts said they would now mention prenatal surgery as one option for some women. But since many women were excluded from the study, including those who were severely obese or whose babies’ conditions did not fit certain specifications, many may be ineligible. The study should not propel surgeons to “run around and start doing this” for other conditions, said Dr. Terry Buchmiller, a fetal medicine expert at Children’s Hospital Boston who was not involved in the research. “I can go in utero right now and fix a cleft lip, but I don’t think anybody is saying we ought to do that, because of the risk.” But she called the study “a wonderful, almost several-decade journey of trying to improve the outcomes of a debilitating condition,” adding, “This looks to be potentially life-changing.” ||||| A Birth-Defect Breakthrough: Prenatal Spinal Surgery It's a landmark in the controversial, 30-year-old field of fetal surgery: Surgeons are reporting success in treating a common, serious birth defect called spina bifida — before birth. Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Tara and Jake Hallman Courtesy of Tara and Jake Hallman Spina bifida is a hole in the spine that sometimes allows a loop of the naked spinal cord to protrude outside the body. Such neural-tube defects are down 30 percent because more expectant mothers are taking folic acid pills and dietary supplements. But about 1,500 babies are born with spina bifida every year, and many are destined to have severe lifelong disabilities. A new study, published online in the New England Journal of Medicine, shows that repairing the most severe form of spina bifida during pregnancy can reduce the paralysis and brain damage that often result when the defect isn't corrected until after birth. The surgery is delicate and risky for both mother and fetus. Doctors must make a three-inch incision in the mother's uterus to expose the fetus, which is typically about four inches long at this stage. They then put the exposed piece of spinal cord — between the size of a raisin and an almond — back where it belongs, and suture layers of tissue to keep it in place and prevent cerebrospinal fluid from leaking out. The study of 183 pregnancies shows that children who had the spinal operation in utero were twice as likely to walk unaided later. At age 3, 42 percent of those who had the prenatal operation were walking by themselves versus 21 percent of those who had the surgery after birth. This is the first time that fetal surgery has ever been attempted and validated for what we think of as a non-fatal birth defect. Brett Hallman is in the lucky group. When he was a 25-week fetus, he was the 55th patient who had fetal surgery for severe spina bifida at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Brett's mother, Tara Hallman, says she and her husband Jake knew the operation was a success months later, when Brett smiled, sat up and crawled on schedule. \\"When he walked at 17 months without any braces — without anything — it just took my breath away,\\" Brett's mom says. A Landmark Study But doctors who treat spina bifida say there's something even more important: Fetal surgery reduces a child's need for a lifelong shunt — a tube to carry cerebrospinal fluid from the brain to the abdomen. Without the shunt, fluid can build up, causing devastating brain damage or death. More than 80 percent of the children who had the surgery after birth needed shunts, compared to 40 percent among those operated on prenatally. Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Tara and Jake Hallman Courtesy of Tara and Jake Hallman \\"From a medical point of view — even though walking is quite nice — for the long-term overall outlook for these children, being free of a shunt is probably the single most important aspect,\\" says Diana Farmer, a study coauthor and chief of pediatric surgery at the University of California at San Francisco. Farmer says the new study is a landmark for the field. \\"This is the first time that fetal surgery has ever been attempted and validated for what we think of as a non-fatal birth defect,\\" Farmer says. Since surgeons at UCSF first did fetal surgery three decades ago, the field has been controversial. \\"People thought it was quite a heretical thing to do, and quite risky for women,\\" farmer says. \\"Prior to this, we only considered fetal surgery in a circumstance where either the fetus would not survive pregnancy or the baby would be likely to die soon after birth.\\" But she thinks the tide is beginning to turn — partly because other procedures, such as donation of part of a liver from a living relative, \\"have demonstrated that it is ethically reasonable in certain circumstances for someone to undergo a medical procedure for altruism, essentially — to help someone else.\\" 'Not A Cure' But Scott Adzick of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, lead author of the new study, stresses that fetal surgery for spina bifida \\"is not a cure. We think that we can help kids.\\" There were some downsides: Nearly four out of five babies in the fetal surgery group were delivered prematurely, compared to 15 percent among those who got the operation after birth. So the fetal surgery group had more respiratory distress and other complications of prematurity. But there were no more deaths in one group versus the other. One of the biggest risks is to the moms. Surgery weakens the uterus, which could cause a disastrous uterine rupture if the woman goes into labor, though this didn't happen during the study. The uterine incision also means that all subsequent babies will have to be born by caesarean section. And as Tara Hallman testifies, even the most successful outcomes of fetal surgery aren't perfect. Although Brett is now an active 7-year-old who swims and plays other sports, he has to work to keep up physically.

Spina bifida is a birth defect where a hole in the spine allows a loop of the naked spinal cord to protrude outside the body. The study of 183 pregnancies demonstrates that children who had the spinal operation in utero were twice as likely to walk unaided later in life. Fetal surgery also reduces a child's need for a lifelong shunt—a tube carrying cerebrospinal fluid from the brain to the abdomen—without which fluid build-up could cause devastating brain damage or death. The risks involved in the procedure include premature birth and a weakened uterus in the mother, necessitating caesarean births for all subsequent children."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the sentence \\"Political science is a late arrival in terms of social sciences[citation needed].\\" answer the question \\"Where did the ideas of political science begin?\\"","completion":"No, the sentence \\"Political science is a late arrival in terms of social sciences[citation needed].\\" does not answer the question \\"Where did the ideas of political science begin?\\" The sentence only provides information about the relative development of political science compared to other social sciences but does not offer any details regarding its origins. To answer the question, a more thorough explanation of the historical development and the roots of political ideas is needed. The origin of political science can be traced back to ancient civilizations, particularly to the works of Greek philosophers such as Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle. These early philosophers have contributed much to the development of political thought and theories. Throughout history, there have been numerous political thinkers who have developed and expanded on these early ideas, leading to the multifaceted subject we know as political science today. Ancient and classical political thought Political science began in ancient Greece around the 5th century BCE with the development of political philosophy. Socrates, considered by many as the father of political philosophy, engaged in dialogues questioning the nature of society, law, and politics. Plato, Socrates' student, wrote dialogues like \\"The Republic,\\" in which he introduced the concept of a philosopher-king and expounded on the nature of justice, political systems, and ideal states. Aristotle, a student of Plato, wrote \\"Politics,\\" a treatise where he examined the concept of state, emphasizing natural law, the ideals of democracy and oligarchy, and the importance of the middle class in maintaining balance within a political system. Medieval political thought During the medieval period, political thought was largely influenced by Christianity and its teachings. Key figures like St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas have incorporated Christian perspectives into their political philosophies. St. Augustine's \\"City of God\\" discussed the duality of the earthly city (the temporal realm) and the heavenly city (eternal divine realm) and further explored the role of government in maintaining the earthly city. St. Thomas Aquinas, another prominent medieval political philosopher, drew upon the works of Aristotle and integrated natural law into Christian thought in his \\"Summa Theologiae.\\" Renaissance political thought During the Renaissance in Europe, a renewed interest in the ancient Greek and Roman writings led to new interpretations of political ideas. Niccolo Machiavelli, an Italian diplomat and political theorist, challenged conventional political thought with \\"The Prince,\\" which advocated for the pragmatic and ruthless pursuit of power by political leaders. Additionally, Thomas More's \\"Utopia\\" explored the concept of an ideal society, examining the relationship between social equality, property, and political power. Enlightenment political thought The Enlightenment was an intellectual movement in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries that emphasized the power of reason and empirical evidence in understanding the world. Political thinkers from this period, often known as the \\"philosophes\\", advocated for separation of powers, constitutionalism, and the rule of law, laying the foundation for modern democracies. Notable figures include John Locke, who defended the concept of a social contract between the government and the governed in his \\"Two Treatises of Government;\\" Montesquieu, who highlighted the importance of separation of powers in \\"The Spirit of the Laws;\\" and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who explored the relationship between individual liberty and political authority in \\"The Social Contract.\\" Contemporary political science Modern political science has evolved from these earlier political thoughts, incorporating empirical and theoretical analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of political systems, political behavior, political theories, and international relations. It draws upon multiple approaches, including historical analysis, comparative politics, quantitative and qualitative methodologies, to investigate and explain political phenomena. Major contributions have come from philosophers and theorists like John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, Thomas Hobbes, Max Weber, John Maynard Keynes, and Hannah Arendt, among others. In conclusion, the ideas of political science originated in ancient Greece and were expanded upon by political thinkers throughout history, spanning various cultures and time periods. The development of political thought and the origins of political science encompass a diverse and rich tapestry of intellectual contributions from the ancient world to the present-day global context."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Today, we are going to learn about something important happening at a hospital called Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. This hospital is in a city called Aberdeen, which is in a country called Scotland. Hospitals are places where we go when we're feeling sick or when we need a doctor to help us feel better. We trust hospitals to take good care of us when we need them. That's why it is important for the people in charge of hospitals to make sure they are doing the best job possible. At the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, there is going to be a special check-up. No, it's not like the ones we get when we visit the doctor. It's a check-up on the hospital's own care for their patients. This check-up is called an \\"independent review.\\" This means that a group of people from outside the hospital will visit and see how well the hospital is taking care of people who are not feeling well. These special visitors will look at lots of different parts of the hospital. They'll talk to the doctors and nurses and other people who work there. They might even talk to some of the patients, who are people staying in the hospital because they're sick. The visitors will ask questions and learn about how the hospital is working to help the patients feel better. After the special visitors have finished looking at everything, they will give some helpful advice. They might say, \\"Great job!\\" Lots of things are going really well, and the hospital should keep doing them. They might also say, \\"Here are some things you can improve.\\" This means they noticed some things that the hospital could be doing even better to help take care of patients. This independent review is a good thing because it helps make sure that the hospital is doing the best it can to take care of people who feel sick.

At the orphanage, the girl, like all the children there, was taught to read and write. While she was studying at the orphanage, she learned something else-to be independent . At twenty-one, she left the orphanage and began to work as a secretary. And then, in 1975, while she was still working as an ordinary secretary, something special happened. She entered the Miss Hong Kong Competition and won it. This was the turning point in her life. Now her name, Mary Cheung, was known to everybody. Mary entered the competition because she wanted to show that orphanage girls could be something. Winning the competition gave her the chance to start a new life. This led her first into television and then into business as a manager. When she was working as a manager, she had trouble with her reports. \\"My English just wasn't good enough.\\" she says. Luckily, she had a boyfriend (who later became her husband) to help her. Mary studied management at Hong Kong Polytechnic and graduated in 1980. She started her own business in 1985.

Berg village dealt with many traffic casualties because of narrower streets and lanes, While Hill village had wide streets, more traffic signals and a greater number of cyclists. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village is managing traffic more efficiently? Hint: Turner et al (2006) derived crash prediction models for this report’s predecessor and found a pronounced ‘safety in numbers’ effect in the models. Using the crash prediction model for mid-block locations, generic motorist and cyclist volumes can be used to demonstrate the impacts on the expected crash rate of varying motor vehicle and cycle volumes. As shown in figure 2.20, an increase in the proportion of cyclists to the overall traffic volume causes an increase in expected crashes at mid-block locations, but the crash rate increases at a decreasing rate. That is to say, the crash rate per cyclist goes down as the cycle volume increases. A:","completion":"According to the given information, Hill Village manages traffic more efficiently. This conclusion is based on the following factors: 1. Wider Streets - Hill Village has wider streets compared to Berry Village. Wider streets allow for better traffic flow and reduce congestion. This factor contributes positively to traffic management, as it facilitates smoother movement and reduces the chances of collisions between vehicles, including bicycles. 2. More Traffic Signals - Hill Village has a greater number of traffic signals than Berg Village, which means that the flow of traffic is better regulated. Traffic signals help in the orderly movement of vehicles and ensure the proper allocation of right of way. This reduces the chances of accidents and contributes to the efficiency of traffic management. 3. Safety in Numbers Effect - According to Turner et al. (2006), there's a 'safety in numbers' effect in crash prediction models. This means that the crash rate per cyclist decreases when the number of cyclists increases. Hill Village has a greater number of cyclists compared to Berg Village, which suggests that the crash rate per cyclist is lower in Hill Village. 4. Crash Rate Increases at a Decreasing Rate - The crash prediction model for mid-block locations, as mentioned in the hint, shows that an increase in the proportion of cyclists to the overall traffic volume causes an increase in expected crashes, but the crash rate increases at a decreasing rate. This means that as the number of cyclists increases, the risk of each cyclist being involved in an accident decreases. Considering these factors, we can conclude that Hill Village is managing traffic more efficiently than Berg Village. The wider streets, increased number of traffic signals, and the involved safety in numbers effect all contribute to better traffic management and lower crash rates per cyclist in Hill Village."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person who asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" are completely different? is inside the article: Soon after composing \\"Halo\\", Tedder worked with Kelly Clarkson on her fourth studio album, All I Ever Wanted (2009), for which they wrote \\"Already Gone\\" together. When the song came out, critics noted a resemblance to Beyoncé's \\"Halo\\". Clarkson, however, initially stated that she was unaware of any similarities between the two songs. She eventually realized their resemblance when she listened to both recordings closely; the similarities are most notable in the backing tracks, which in both cases feature a melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps. Clarkson tried to prevent \\"Already Gone\\" from being included on All I Ever Wanted, but it was impossible to make last minute changes, as her album was already being printed when I Am... Sasha Fierce was released.

Here is a goal: How to use a mold release product Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"Using a mold release product correctly is essential to ensure efficient removal of molded objects without damaging the mold or the finished product while maintaining the quality of the object. Here is a detailed, step-by-step guide to using mold release products effectively. There are different types of mold release products, so first, determine which mold release product suits your project best. The steps below are applicable for most mold release products, including spray-based and liquid-based products. 1. Choose the appropriate mold release product: As mentioned above, there are different types of mold release products available, such as wax-based, silicone-based, and PTFE-based mold release agents. Each type has specific applications and advantages. Wax-based mold releases are perfect for epoxy, polyester, and urethane resins. Silicone-based mold release products work well with silicone rubber, polyurethane rubber, and various types of resins. PTFE-based mold releases offer a non-stick surface for most adhesives and plastics. Research the properties of each type and select the one that best fits your needs. 2. Prepare the mold: Before applying the release agent, clean the mold thoroughly. Ensure that the mold surface is free of debris, dust, and contaminants. Any foreign matter in the mold will be directly transferred to your finished product, reducing its quality. You can use soap and water or a mold cleaner to clean the mold, and then thoroughly dry it. If it's a new mold, make sure it's properly cured before use. 3. Shake the release agent container: If you're using a mold release spray, shake the container well before use. This ensures that all components of the mold release are mixed evenly and will provide a uniform coating on the mold's surface. 4. Apply the mold release product: Follow the manufacturer's instructions when applying the mold release product to the mold surface. Usually, mold release agents can be sprayed or brushed onto the mold. - If you're using a spray release agent, hold the container approximately 12 inches away from the mold surface and spray a thin, even layer. Apply the product in a sweeping motion to maintain consistent coverage. Make sure to cover the entire mold surface, focusing on intricate details or areas that might potentially be difficult to release. - If you're using a liquid-based mold release product, use a clean, soft cloth or sponge to apply it to the mold surface. Spread the product uniformly across the surface, ensuring that every area is covered. For deep undercuts and tight corners, use a brush to apply mold release. 5. Allow the mold release to dry: Depending on the mold release product type, you may need to wait for it to dry before using the mold. Read the manufacturer's instructions to determine the drying time. 6. Apply additional layers (optional): Depending on the complexity of the object being molded and the mold release product type, multiple layers of mold release may be needed. In this case, repeat the application process as stated in steps 4 and 5, allowing each layer to dry before applying the next one. 7. Pour or inject your molding material: Once the mold release has been properly applied and dried, you can pour or inject your chosen molding material into the mold. Follow the instructions for your specific casting material to ensure success. 8. Allow the material to cure: After pouring or injecting, allow the casting material to cure according to the manufacturer's instructions. 9. Remove the molded object: Once the material has cured, gently remove the molded object from the mold. The mold release product should make it easy to demold without damaging the mold or the finished product. 10. Cleaning and maintenance: After removing the molded object, clean the mold to remove any residual material and mold release. Inspect the mold for any damage or wear and store it appropriately. By following these steps, you will be able to use a mold release product effectively, ensuring the successful molding process and extending the useful life of your molds."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, we can't be sure if he enjoyed gardening in his spare time or not."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. In sub-Saharan Africa there are two predominant groups of antelope present. The first group of antelope, group A, have long necks and strong teeth. The second group of antelope, group B, have shorter necks and weaker teeth. Because of their longer necks and stronger teeth, the antelope from group A are more easily able to pick fruit and leaves from the tall trees in the region compared to antelope from group B. Which group of antelope is more adapted to the environment? The answer is:","completion":"The group A of antelope, with long necks and strong teeth, is more adapted to the environment in sub-Saharan Africa. This is because their longer necks and stronger teeth enable them to more easily reach and consume fruit and leaves from tall trees in the region, providing them with better access to food resources. This advantage increases their chances of survival and reproduction compared to group B, with shorter necks and weaker teeth, which would struggle to access the same food resources. As a result, through the process of natural selection, the beneficial traits of group A would likely become more common in the population over time, while the less advantageous traits of group B become more rare."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Cyrano de Bergerac Context: Cyrano de Bergerac is a Parisian poet and swashbuckler with a large nose of which he is self-conscious, but pretends to be proud. He is madly in love with his \\"friendly cousin\\" (they were not actually related as cousins), the beautiful Roxane; however, he does not believe she will requite his love because he considers himself physically unattractive, because of his over large nose. Soon, he finds that Roxane has become infatuated with Christian de Neuvillette, a dashing new recruit to the Cadets de Gascogne, the military unit in which Cyrano is serving. Christian however, despite his good looks, is tongue-tied when speaking with women. Seeing an opportunity to vicariously declare his love for Roxane, he decides to aid Christian, who does not know how to court a woman and gain her love. Cyrano aids Christian, writing love letters and poems describing the very emotions that Cyrano himself feels for Roxane. Roxane begins to appreciate Christian, not only for his good looks but also his apparent eloquence. She eventually falls in love with him and they contract a secret marriage in order to thwart the plans of the Comte de Guiche, an arrogant nobleman who is himself a frustrated wooer of Roxane. In revenge, De Guiche summons Christian to fight in the war against the Spanish. The war is harsh and brutal: the Cadets de Gascogne are starving. Cyrano escapes over enemy lines each morning to deliver a love letter written by Cyrano himself but signed with Christian's name, sent to Roxane. Christian, at this time, is completely unaware of Cyrano's doings on his behalf. The love letters Cyrano writes eventually draw Roxane out from the city of Paris to the war front. She had come to visit Christian, the supposed romantic poet. Apparently, she admitted that she would rather love an ugly, but great poet, than a handsome, dimwitted fellow. Christian, realising his mistake, tries to find out whether Roxane loves him or Cyrano, and asks Cyrano to find out. However, during the battle that follows Roxane's visit, Christian is... A:","completion":"In the movie and play \\"Cyrano de Bergerac,\\" Cyrano befriends Christian de Neuvillette. Christian is a handsome new recruit to the Cadets de Gascogne, the same military unit in which Cyrano is serving. Christian finds himself in love with Roxane, who is also Cyrano's distant cousin and the object of his affection. Unfortunately, Christian struggles to express himself eloquently and is unable to articulate his love for Roxane due to his lack of skill in speaking with women. Recognizing the opportunity to declare his love for Roxane indirectly, Cyrano offers to help Christian woo her by providing him with eloquent love letters and poems that express the deep emotions Cyrano himself feels for Roxane. This allows Christian to court Roxane more effectively, and she falls in love with him, believing that he is the romantic, skilled poet behind the heartfelt words. The two even secretly marry to prevent Roxane from being forced into a relationship with the Comte de Guiche, a nobleman who desires her as well. As the story continues, Christian is summoned to fight in a war against the Spanish forces, and the situation becomes desperate for the Cadets de Gascogne. Nevertheless, Cyrano continues to support Christian's relationship with Roxane by secretly delivering love letters each day under Christian's name, unbeknownst to Christian. Roxane eventually visits the war front after being moved by the love letters she believes are from Christian. However, during her visit, Roxane admits that she would rather love an ugly but talented poet than a handsome man who is not so gifted with words. Realizing that Roxane may have fallen in love with Cyrano's words and not his own persona, Christian urges Cyrano to find out who Roxane truly loves. Tragically, before they can resolve the matter, Christian is killed in battle, leaving Cyrano and Roxane to eventually come to terms with the truth behind the letters and their feelings for each other. Thus, Cyrano befriends Christian de Neuvillette throughout the story, offering his poetic talents to help Christian win Roxane's heart, despite his own deep love for her. This friendship is marked by Cyrano's self-sacrifice and love, even though it comes at the cost of his own happiness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create.

Here is a news article: Within the first few minutes of the sibling dramedy “The Skeleton Twins,” there’s a phone call from a hospital informing a woman (Kristen Wiig) that her brother (Bill Hader) has just tried to slit his wrists. The news is so upsetting to her that it derails her own plans to swallow a handful of sleeping pills. That’s your first sign that this isn’t just another skit by the “Saturday Night Live” veterans. Though there are moments of silliness that remind you of the goofy, quicksilver brilliance of these former sketch-comedy whiz kids, the movie is a serious and surprisingly affecting meditation on family and the legacy of self- destruction. Why have Milo (Hader) and Maggie (Wiig) tried to kill themselves on this same night, a continent apart? (He’s in Los Angeles, she’s in Nyack, N.Y.) It isn’t just because their father did himself in when they were young. They also share a kind of cosmic connection that only close siblings can. “The Skeleton Twins” — which takes its title from a pair of his-and-hers Day of the Dead toys that Milo and Maggie played with when they were kids — is a poetic evocation of a shared morbidity that spans time and space. Not just a morbidity, but an instinct to save each other, even when — maybe especially when — the other’s darkest secrets have made him or her unreachable. That bond is illuminated on screen by the real-life friendship of the lead actors, who bring an at-times frighteningly believable brother-sister dynamic to the sharply told tale (written by Mark Heyman and director Craig Johnson). Their relationship veers from painfully awkward tension to moments of giddily intense emotional intimacy. Siblings Milo (Bill Hader) and Maggie (Kristen Wiig) reunite for the first time in a decade after Milo’s suicide attempt in “The Skeleton Twins.” (Roadside Attractions) When the film opens, Milo, a gay failed actor, and Maggie, a married dental hygienist, haven’t spoken in 10 years. After Milo gets out of the hospital, Maggie’s invitation to her brother to temporarily move in with her and her husband, Lance (Luke Wilson), an amiable doofus who calls people “amigo,” seems at first like a terrible idea. Milo is a caustically funny club-crawling negaholic, while Maggie and Lance lead quiet suburban lives of streaming Netflix comedies and commuting. At the same time, there are moments when their differences melt away, as when Milo leads Maggie in a delightfully silly duet of lip-syncing to Starship’s cheese-tastic 1987 power ballad “ Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now.” But the movie is more than a showcase for Wiig and Hader’s chemistry. Over the course of the tale, metaphorical skeletons, in the form of old relationships, come dancing out of both Maggie and Milo’s closets. Though these ghosts partly explain — and partly deepen the mystery of — the characters’ self-destructive impulses, they are essentially distractions. The central focus of the film remains Milo and Maggie’s journey, even when the wakes of other, more heavily freighted vessels swerve dangerously across their path, threatening to capsize the siblings’ little lifeboat. “The Skeleton Twins” is a small, closely observed chamber piece. That doesn’t mean it’s trivial. It’s an ample vessel for Wiig and Hader’s talents and tastes, which tend more toward the odd but telling detail than to outsize farce. The actors have an obvious rapport. It’s deep enough to evoke the ties, entanglements and bloodletting of a real kinship. But Wiig and Hader’s instincts as entertainers are keen enough to know when to stop cutting. The humor and the poignancy of “The Skeleton Twins” come not from what Maggie and Milo have suffered — or inflicted on each other — but what they have together survived. ★ ★ ★ ½ R. At area theaters.

Surprisingly moving for a film assembled from such familiar scenes, Craig Johnson's The Skeleton Twins mushes together queasy/quirky indie family drama with the beats of a romantic comedy. You know the outline just from eyeballing the poster: Kristen Wiig's Maggie and Bill Hader's Milo find their way toward loving each other after a wary start. Then, not long after they've found each other, and after Johnson has stopped positioning them on the far opposite sides of the frame, and after we've had the chance to relish their giddy togetherness, backstory must rip them apart. They negotiate their moods, their pride, and their past in what feels like real time. See also: Our interview with Bill Hader What's singular here isn't that the stars are playing brother and sister, or that they stir such sublime and anxious joy from each other. It's that the real love story isn't even between the damaged-but-lovable characters. It's between two profoundly depressed people and life itself. Most of the laughs come from well-observed human behavior: Milo moves into the home of his estranged sister Maggie, where he studies the cracks in her marriage to a nice guy (Luke Wilson) neither respects. The best scenes come as the siblings discover how to be around each other — and get close to discovering how to be, period. Getting high on nitrous oxide sets the siblings into confessions and fart-dancing on the floor of a dentist's office, and the scene is long and nourishing, stirring that feeling of raw, unguarded safety you might share with the people who have known you best and longest. Even the obligatory out-of-nowhere musical number has the power to seize viewers' guts. To haul Maggie out of the foulest of moods, Milo lip-syncs to the only god-awful '80s synth-pop hit that hasn't yet been mined for a nostalgic movie moment. (But it was in Mannequin.) Director Johnson and his cast hit a chord of feeling more complex than those on the soundtrack. Milo's funny as he fake-sings, but also annoying, and when the chorus hits, Maggie — furious, unwilling to crack — refuses to join him. Johnson lets the full song play out, and we witness the characters negotiate their moods, their pride, their present, and their past in what feels like real time. Not everything is so shrewdly judged. Hader's Milo is gay, and the character is dramatic and performative, but I still doubt he would bust into Maggie's bedroom — where she's sleeping with the husband who just met Milo a day or so before — and carp drunkenly about his failure to find \\"cock\\" in his hometown bar. (Also dispiriting: Milo, given a job clearing brush at a dam, chirps, \\"Do I get a sexy outfit?\\") Still, The Skeleton Twins confirms the good sense of Kristen Wiig. Rather than go bigger and bigger in sequels and studio comedies, she goes deeper into character. Her Maggie holds her face blank, not trusting the world to know anything of her except her occasional rages. Tenderly, exhibiting a rare understanding of prickly nervousness, Wiig reveals the uncertain soul trembling beneath the impassive mask. Skeleton Twins isn't perfect, but it cuts to the bone. ||||| One song kept playing through my mind as I watched \\"The Skeleton Twins,\\" an introspective indie drama starring the very exciting post-\\"Saturday Night Live\\" Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader as siblings damaged by their father's death. \\"Suicide Is Painless,\\" the Johnny Mandel classic that was \\"MASH's\\" indelible and ironic musical anchor, is very much the sensibility that director Craig Johnson confers on his film — emotionally authentic, atypical in the way it looks at suicide and its ripple effects. \\"It brings on many changes ... .\\" Deftly weaving humor and sweetness in with the pathos, Johnson and Mark Heyman's screenplay won the coveted Waldo Salt screenwriting award at the Sundance Film Festival in January. But it is what Hader and Wiig do with the words that make this one of the better movies to come along this year. The pair, who specialized in over-the-top nonsense on \\"SNL,\\" till the terrifying terrain of adults who lost their father to suicide when they were young with such eloquent grace that it speaks volumes about the depth of their talent. It would be a loss if comedy were to lose them entirely, and from the look of their future commitments there is nothing to fear, but \\"The Skeleton Twins\\" makes you glad they're taking on life's weightier issues too. For Johnson, it's an impressive step up from his first feature, \\"True Adolescents\\" (2009), which caught the filmmaker, as well as the movie's main character, played by Mark Duplass, still in the midst of finding himself. \\"Skeleton Twins\\" is all grown up, though Maggie (Wiig) and Milo (Hader) are definitely cases of arrested development, their emotional growth stunted by Dad's death in vastly different ways. Roadside Attractions Bill Hader, left, and Kristen Wiig in \\"The Skeleton Twins.\\" Bill Hader, left, and Kristen Wiig in \\"The Skeleton Twins.\\" (Roadside Attractions) As the film opens, they are both contemplating their own methods of acting out that lethal legacy. It's a provocative way to establish the point that the twins have been floundering in life for a long time. Milo comes closer to succeeding at ending it all. His inability to cope with his downward spiral as a failing actor in Los Angeles puts him in the hospital. The call from the nurse means the handful of pills Maggie has will go back in the bottle for now. The crisis serves to reconnect them after a decades-long estrangement. Maggie's invitation for Milo to come live with her for a while sets in motion the film's examination of the complexities of siblings' affection for and disaffection with each other. This is as central to the film as the idea of suicide. Wiig's ability to let sorrow settle into her eyes and, like a tear, just hang there, gets a workout here. Hader's gift of mood-shifting, flipping through emotions like pages of a book he barely finds interesting, carries one scene after another. \\"Twins\\" is serious about its subject. Yet Hader's truly inspired lip-sync of Starship's \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\\" is funny without being frivolous. The twins grew up in the 1980s, and the music from that time frames their lives. The fact that Maggie still lives in their hometown, somewhere in the bucolic Hudson Valley, is not accidental either, and wonderfully shot by director of photography Reed Morano, by the way. The subtext is that they must untangle the past before they can move forward. Milo is gay, but like everything else about the film, the way it factors in is unexpected. There are flashbacks that show Milo and Maggie playing dressup as children. The way she carefully applies lipstick on her dress-wearing brother suggests acceptance by the family wasn't among his issues. Milo's stop by the local bookshop owned by his former English teacher Rich (Ty Burrell) begins to give us the shape and source of his pain. Maggie's married to an easygoing former jock, Lance (Luke Wilson). He's sweet, uncomplicated, thinks they're trying for kids, while the birth-control pills are hidden in a drawer and Maggie's getting in over her head with her hunky scuba-diving instructor Billy (Boyd Holbrook). On one level, Maggie and Milo keep circling around the idea that perhaps, like their dad, it would just be easier to end it all rather than deal with the difficulties of reality. But on another level, they are as engaged in figuring out if — and how — they can repair their damaged relationship. Twins are bound more tightly than most siblings, and time and again Johnson uses that bond to break down the idea of living versus not, loving versus not. The question is whether, like the Mandel song, Milo and Maggie can \\"take or leave\\" suicide as they please. \\"The Skeleton Twins\\" answers it beautifully. ------------ 'The Skeleton Twins' MPAA rating: R for language, some sexuality and drug use Running time: 1 hour, 32 minutes Playing: ArcLight, Hollywood and Pasadena; Landmark Theatres, West Los Angeles ||||| When estranged twins Maggie (Kristen Wiig) and Milo (Bill Hader) feel they're at the end of their ropes, an unexpected reunion forces them to confront why their lives went so wrong.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What is Proto-Iranian to all Iranian languages?\\" Context: \\"All Iranian languages are descended from a common ancestor, Proto-Iranian. In turn, and together with Proto-Indo-Aryan and the Nuristani languages, Proto-Iranian descends from a common ancestor Proto-Indo-Iranian. The Indo-Iranian languages are thought to have originated in Central Asia. The Andronovo culture is the suggested candidate for the common Indo-Iranian culture ca. 2000 BC.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Proto-Iranian serves as the ancestral linguistic stage for all Iranian languages, which constitutes a significant branch of the Indo-European language family. Being the common predecessor, Proto-Iranian contains the linguistic basis and elements that eventually evolved into the distinct Iranian languages spoken today. This common ancestral language was in existence from around the early 2nd millennium BC and provided the foundation for the evolution and diversification of numerous modern Iranian languages. In the broader linguistic context, Proto-Iranian is a descendant of the even more ancient Proto-Indo-Iranian language. Proto-Indo-Iranian, as the name implies, is the common ancestor of not only the Iranian languages but also the Indo-Aryan languages and the Nuristani languages. This shared origin reveals the deep historical connections between these groups of languages, as well as their respective speakers. It is widely believed that the origins of the Indo-Iranian languages, including Proto-Iranian, can be traced back to Central Asia. One of the primary reasons for this conclusion is the presence of the Andronovo culture, which emerged around 2000 BC. As a culturally and linguistically significant society, the Andronovo culture is often considered the most plausible candidate for the common Indo-Iranian culture. The Andronovo culture encompassed a vast area of present-day Central Asia, spanning from the Ural Mountains in the west to modern-day Kazakhstan and the western parts of Siberia in the east. This area is crucial for understanding the development and spread of the Indo-Iranian languages, as it provides important archaeological and anthropological evidence about the society from which these languages emerged. Through the analysis of artifacts, burial sites, and other cultural remains, researchers are able to piece together aspects of the Andronovo culture, including the potential linguistic roots of Proto-Iranian and other related languages. As the Proto-Iranian language evolved and diversified, distinct Iranian languages began to emerge, spreading across vast territories. These languages, such as Old Persian, Avestan, Parthian, Middle Persian, and many others, were spoken by various Iranian peoples in different regions, forming the foundation of the rich linguistic tapestry of the Iranian language family. Over time, these ancient Iranian languages further developed and branched out, giving rise to the diverse group of modern Iranian languages we know today. This group includes widely spoken languages like Persian, Kurdish, Pashto, and Balochi, as well as numerous other regional languages and dialects. In conclusion, Proto-Iranian lies at the heart of the Iranian languages' historical and linguistic evolution. As the common ancestor for all Iranian languages, Proto-Iranian is an invaluable linguistic link that connects these languages with their Indo-European roots and illuminates the significance of the Andronovo culture in the emergence and development of the Iranian language family. Understanding the origins and early history of Proto-Iranian enriches our comprehension of Iranian languages' intricate lineage and the complex historical interactions that have shaped the linguistic landscape of the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Process: - An enzyme in saliva begins to break down carbohydrates - Food is squeezed down the esophagus when you swallow - Acid and enzyme in the stomach break the food down - Releases nutrients - Food then pumped into small intestine - Fluid and enzymes from liver and pancreas pumped into small intestine - Help break food into smallest molecules - Nutrients pass through wall of small intestine - Nutrients absorbed into blood stream - Unused materials passed into large intestine to become fecal matter. Question: suppose food breaks down food too fast happens, how will it affect MORE food being digested. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","completion":"B: Less The process of digestion involves a complex series of enzymatic reactions and mechanical processes that break down food into small molecules that can be absorbed by our bodies. If food is broken down too quickly, it might not spend enough time in certain parts of the digestive system—like the small intestine, which is where most nutrient absorption occurs. For instance, the process that breaks down food in the stomach using acid and enzymes is designed to take a certain amount of time to ensure that the food is adequately broken down before it is sent on to the next stage of digestion. If this process is speeded up and food moves more quickly into the small intestine, it may not be broken down sufficiently for the small intestine to absorb the nutrients efficiently, that could potentially lead to less nutrients being absorbed overall. The small intestine also needs time to do its work in breaking down the food further through the aid of enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver. If food moves through too quickly, again, the necessary digestive and absorptive work may not be completed properly, potentially resulting in malabsorption of nutrients. Also, the large intestine performs the task of absorbing water and electrolytes from the undigested food, forming fecal matter. If the food passes too quickly to this stage, diarrhea may occur because the large intestine doesn't have enough time to absorb the requisite amount of water. In summary, a faster rate of food breakdown can lead to less efficient absorption of nutrients in the digestive system, which implies that more food would need to be consumed to get the same level of nutrient absorption. Hence, the answer would be less food being effectively digested if the digestion process occurs too rapidly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sentence provided does not give a valid answer to the question \\"What class is the Hexapoda ranked?\\" The sentence talks about how traditional morphology-based or appearance-based systematics have usually given Hexapoda the rank of 'superclass,' not 'class.' The ranking of 'superclass' and 'class' are two different things in the taxonomic hierarchy (the biological system of classifying organisms). The taxonomic hierarchy is divided into several categories, often exemplified by the mnemonic \\"Did King Phillip Came Over For Good Soup?\\", representing Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species. In this hierarchy, 'superclass' is a higher rank than 'class'. Therefore, knowing that Hexapoda is a superclass does not give information about what class it belongs to.

However, these are groups or subsets within the superclass Hexapoda, not the classifications of Hexapoda within the 'class' category of the taxonomic hierarchy. So, in the context of this question, the information provided in the sentence does not answer what class Hexapoda is ranked under. There is no mention of any 'class' that Hexapoda might belong to, as the sentence primarily focuses on its rank as a superclass and the groups found within this superclass. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is option (b). No - the sentence does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"What class is the Hexapoda ranked?\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In order to write a negative review, I will focus on the weak points of the movie, such as the plot, character development, and visuals. Step 3: Write the review. \\"The Emoji Movie\\" is a disappointing attempt at capturing the essence of a digital age phenomenon. The movie's plotline is not only unimaginative but also painfully predictable. The protagonist, Gene, an emoji with the ability to express multiple emotions, embarks on a quest for self-acceptance and identity. The narrative could have been a thoughtful exploration of fitting into a digital world; however, it falls short as it's plagued by cliches and unoriginal sequences. The character development, or lack thereof, further contributes to the downfall of this animated film. The characters remain one-dimensional and unrelatable throughout the movie, and their actions lack any emotional depth. The introduction of a romantic subplot does little to save the movie, as it feels forced and unnatural.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Information: - An oxide is a chemical compound that contains at least one oxygen atom and one other element in its chemical formula. \\"Oxide\\" itself is the dianion of oxygen, an O atom. Metal oxides thus typically contain an anion of oxygen in the oxidation state of 2. Most of the Earth's crust consists of solid oxides, the result of elements being oxidized by the oxygen in air or in water. Hydrocarbon combustion affords the two principal carbon oxides: carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Even materials considered pure elements often develop an oxide coating. For example, aluminium foil develops a thin skin of AlO (called a passivation layer) that protects the foil from further corrosion. Individual elements can often form multiple oxides, each containing different amounts of the element and oxygen. In some cases these are distinguished by specifying the number of atoms as in carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and in other cases by specifying the element's oxidation number, as in iron(II) oxide and iron(III) oxide. Certain elements can form many different oxides, such those of nitrogen. - Koskullskulle is a locality situated in Gällivare Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 874 inhabitants in 2010. - Magnetite is a mineral and one of the main iron ores. With the chemical formula FeO, it is one of the oxides of iron. Magnetite is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself. It is the most magnetic of all the naturally-occurring minerals on Earth. Naturally-magnetized pieces of magnetite, called lodestone, will attract small pieces of iron, which is how ancient peoples first discovered the property of magnetism. Today it is mined as iron ore. - The polar night occurs when the night lasts for more than 24 hours. This occurs only inside the polar circles. The opposite phenomenon, the polar day, or midnight sun, occurs when the Sun stays above the horizon for more than 24 hours. \\"Night\\" is understood as the center of the Sun being below a free horizon. Since the atmosphere bends the rays of the Sun, the polar day is longer than the polar night, and the area that is affected by polar night is somewhat smaller than the area of midnight sun. The polar circle is located at a latitude between these two areas, at the latitude of approximately 66.5 degrees. In the most northern city of Sweden, Kiruna, at 67°51'N, the polar night lasts for around 28 twenty-four-hour periods, while the midnight sun lasts around 50 twenty-four-hour periods. - Hematite, also spelled as haematite, is the mineral form of iron(III) oxide (FeO), one of several iron oxides. Hematite crystallizes in the rhombohedral lattice system, and it has the same crystal structure as ilmenite and corundum. Hematite and ilmenite form a complete solid solution at temperatures above . - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Luleå (Lule Sami \\"Luleju\\") is a city on the coast of northern Sweden, and the capital of Norrbotten County, the northernmost county in Sweden. Luleå has about 75,000 inhabitants and is the seat of Luleå Municipality (with a total population of 75,921). - Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (72.4% Fe), hematite (69.9% Fe), goethite (62.9% Fe), limonite or siderite (48.2% Fe). - Luleå Municipality is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Luleå, which is also the county seat of Norrbotten County. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The Main Line Through Upper Norrland is a long railway line between Bräcke, Jämtland County and Boden, Norrbotten County in Sweden. For military and regional policy reasons, it was built in very sparsely populated areas, far away from the more densely populated coast. The line has several branches to settlements on the coast, the ones to Umeå and Luleå being considered part of the line itself. Today the three largest settlements along the line are Boden (pop 18800), Älvsbyn (pop 5500) and Vännäs (pop 4100). - Iore, often stylized IORE, is a class of 34 electric locomotives built by Adtranz and its successor Bombardier Transportation for the Swedish mining company LKAB's railway division Malmtrafik. The class is a variation of Adtranz's Octeon modular product platform, thus related to Bombardier's later TRAXX platform. The locomotives haul iron ore freight trains on the Iron Ore Line and Ofoten Line in Sweden and Norway, respectively. The 68-car trains are hauled by two single-ended CoCo locomotives, each with a power output of . Each operates with tractive effort and has a maximum speed of . Delivery of the first series of 18 locomotives was made from 2000 to 2004, and they replaced some of the aging Dm3 and El 15 units. In 2007, eight more vehicles (4 double units) were ordered, with production to be completed by 2011, by which time, another four double units were ordered. These units are scheduled to be delivered from 2013 to 2014. - Iron is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from ) and atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. Its abundance in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production by fusion in high-mass stars, where it is the last element to be produced with release of energy before the violent collapse of a supernova, which scatters the iron into space. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - A mineral is a naturally occurring chemical compound, usually of crystalline form and abiogenic in origin. A mineral has one specific chemical composition, whereas a rock can be an aggregate of different minerals or mineraloids. The study of minerals is called mineralogy. - Northern or North Sami (disapproved exonym Lappish or Lapp), sometimes also simply referred to as Sami, is the most widely spoken of all Sami languages. The area where Northern Sami is spoken covers the northern parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland. The number of Northern Sami speakers is estimated to be somewhere between 15,000 and 25,000. About 2,000 of these live in Finland and between 5,000 and 6,000 in Sweden. - The Sami people (also Sámi or Saami, traditionally known in English as Lapps or Laplanders) are an indigenous Finno-Ugric people inhabiting the Arctic area of Sápmi, which today encompasses parts of far northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Kola Peninsula of Russia. The Sami are the only indigenous people of Scandinavia recognized and protected under the international conventions of indigenous peoples, and are hence the northernmost indigenous people of Europe. Sami ancestral lands are not well-defined. Their traditional languages are the Sami languages and are classified as a branch of the Uralic language family. - Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag (LKAB) is a Swedish mining company. The company mines iron ore at Kiruna and at Malmberget in northern Sweden. The company was established in 1890, and has been 100% state-owned since the 1950s. The iron ore is processed to pellets and sinter fines, which are transported by Iore trains (Malmbanan) to the harbours at Narvik and Luleå and to the steelmill at Luleå (SSAB). - Svappavaara is a locality situated in Kiruna Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 417 inhabitants in 2010. It is a mining village. Mining was started around 1650. Large scale iron mining started in 1965. The mine was closed in 1983, but enrichment of iron ore from the mine at Kiruna is still going on. The mine is owned by LKAB, and there is an ongoing project to open it again for production around year 2015. - Narvik is located on the shores of the Ofotfjorden. The municipality is part of the traditional district of Ofoten of Northern Norway, inside the Arctic Circle. The municipality of Narvik borders the municipality of Ballangen to the southwest, Evenes to the northwest, Bardu, Gratangen, Lavangen and Skånland (in Troms county) to the north, and Norrbotten County (Lapland) in Sweden to the south and east. - Limonite is an iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition. The generic formula is frequently written as FeO(OH)·nHO, although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely. Limonite is one of the two principal iron ores, the other being hematite, and has been mined for the production of iron since at least 2500 BCE. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Goethite (FeO(OH)), named after the German polymath and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (17491832), an iron bearing hydroxide mineral of the diaspore group, is found in soil and other low-temperature environments. Goethite has been well known since ancient times for its use as a pigment (brown ochre). Evidence has been found of its use in paint pigment samples taken from the caves of Lascaux in France. It was first described in 1806 based on samples found in the Hollertszug Mine in Herdorf, Germany. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Kiirunavaara ( Northern Sami : Gironvárri or Kierunavaara ) is a mountain in Kiruna , Sweden that contains one of the largest and richest bodies of iron ore in the world . The presence of iron in the area was known already in the mid- 17th century , but at this early time communication lines to this northerly region were quite insufficient to permit any major exploitation . Only with the construction of a railway , the Iron Ore Line and the ports of Narvik and Luleå at the end of the 19th century did commercial mining become a realistic proposition . The Swedish mining company LKAB ( Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag ) has been mining the mountain since the beginning of the 20th century . The mining area around Kiruna and Malmberget and the iron port and steelworks at Luleå made Norrbotten County one of the first , and most prominent , regions of heavy industry in Sweden , and the wider region has remained at the forefront of mining and steel smelting and alloying technology . - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen.

The largest shareholders are Industrivärden and the Government of Finland. - An ore is a type of rock that contains sufficient minerals with important elements including metals that can be economically extracted from the rock. The ores are extracted from the earth through mining; they are then refined (often via smelting) to extract the valuable element, or elements. - A metal (from Greek \\"métallon\\", \\"mine, quarry, metal\\") is a material (an element, compound, or alloy) that is typically hard, opaque, shiny, and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. Metals are generally malleable that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire). About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals, the others are nonmetals or metalloids. Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms. - Luossavaara (Northern Sami: \\"Luossavárri\\") is a mountain in Kiruna, Sweden. It is the site of a now-inactive iron ore mine formerly operated by the Swedish mining company LKAB. Today it has a ski lift and slope, as well as a hiking path called \\"Midnattsolstigen\\" (the Midnight Sun Trail). - Iron oxides are chemical compounds composed of iron and oxygen. All together, there are sixteen known iron oxides and oxyhydroxides. - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. - The Ofoten Line is a railway line in Narvik, Norway. It runs from the Port of Narvik to Riksgränsen on the NorwaySweden border, where the line continues as the Ore Line via Kiruna and Gällivare to Luleå. The Ofoten Line is single track, electrified at and has seven stations. The line only connects to the rest of the Norwegian railway network via Sweden. The main traffic is up to twelve daily freight trains operated by Malmtrafik that haul iron ore from Sweden to Narvik. In addition, CargoNet operates container trains, branded as the Arctic Rail Express (ARE), and SJ operates passenger trains, including a night train to Stockholm. The Ofoten Line is also part of the Northern East West Freight Corridor, which hauls containers from China and India to North America. - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. - The city's vicinity shares a long history with the indigenous Sami people, with evidence of at least 6000 years of settlement. The city of Kiruna was founded in 1900 and quickly became a major centre of iron ore extraction and mining industry. During World War II, large quantities of iron were transported from Kiruna by rail to the east coast, and further down to be sold to Germany. Due to Kiruna's position north of the Arctic Circle the city experiences both midnight sun and polar night throughout the year as well as a very cold climate, even by Scandinavian standards. - Siderite is a mineral composed of iron(II) carbonate (FeCO). It takes its name from the Greek word \\"sideros,\\" iron. It is a valuable iron mineral, since it is 48% iron and contains no sulfur or phosphorus. Zinc, magnesium and manganese commonly substitute for the iron resulting in the siderite-smithsonite, siderite-magnesite and siderite-rhodochrosite solid solution series. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition. - Sami is a group of Uralic languages spoken by the Sami people in Northern Europe (in parts of northern Finland, Norway, Sweden and extreme northwestern Russia). There are, depending on the nature and terms of division, ten or more Sami languages. Several names are used for the Sami languages: \\"Saami\\", \\"Sámi\\", \\"Saame\\", \\"Samic\\", \\"kukhulas\\", as well as the exonyms \\"Lappish\\" and \\"Lappic\\". The last two, along with the term \\"Lapp\\", are now often considered derogatory. - Gällivare (or ) is a locality and the seat of Gällivare Municipality in Norrbotten County, province of Lapland, Sweden with 8,449 inhabitants in 2010. The town was founded in the 17th century. Together with nearby towns Malmberget and Koskullskulle it forms a conurbation with some 15,000 inhabitants. This conurbation is the second northernmost significant urban area of Sweden after Kiruna. - The midnight sun is a natural phenomenon that occurs in the summer months in places north of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle, when the sun remains visible at the local midnight. Around the summer solstice (approximately 21 June in the Northern Hemisphere and 22 December in the Southern Hemisphere) the sun is visible for the full 24 hours, given fair weather. The number of days per year with potential midnight sun increases the farther towards either pole one goes. Although approximately defined by the polar circles, in practice the midnight sun can be seen as much as 55 miles (90 km) outside the polar circle, as described below, and the exact latitudes of the farthest reaches of midnight sun depend on topography and vary slightly year-to-year. - Malmberget (\\"The Ore Mountain\\") is a locality and mining town situated in Gällivare Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 5,590 inhabitants in 2010. It is situated 5 kilometres from the municipal seat Gällivare. - The Iron Ore Line is a long railway line between Riksgränsen and Boden in Norrbotten County, Sweden.

The annual report serves several important purposes: 1. Transparency: By presenting the annual report before the Parliament, the UPSC ensures that its working, functioning and performance remain accessible for public scrutiny. This promotes transparency in the recruitment process for government services. 2. Accountability: The submission of the annual report makes the UPSC accountable to the President and the Parliament, providing an opportunity for evaluation, discussion, and improvement, if needed. 3. Performance Review: The report serves as a tool for the President, Parliament members, and other stakeholders to review the UPSC's performance during the year. This may lead to suggestions for improvement and help identify areas where the UPSC can upgrade its methods or technology for the benefit of aspiring government officials and the administration as a whole. 4. Monitoring and Evaluation: The annual report facilitates monitoring and evaluation of the UPSC's role in maintaining the quality, integrity, and merit-based selection of candidates for various government services. This is crucial in upholding high standards within the government's administrative framework. In conclusion, the Union Public Service Commission submits an annual report on its work to the President of India, who then presents it before the Parliament. This process is crucial in ensuring transparency, accountability, and effective functioning of the UPSC, leading to the recruitment of competent and efficient government officials, and thereby contributing to the overall effectiveness and welfare of the nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When did the students do the first self portrait?

Article:The BBC understands Apple removed the products as part of a wider switch to favour smart home devices compatible with its own HomeKit platform. However, Apple continues to sell the Thermostat in the UK and across Europe. Nest is owned by Google, which is developing rival technologies to link \\"internet of things\\" kit together. The search firm announced in May that it was working on Weave - a library of common commands - and Brillo - an Android-based operating system for IoT machines. Nest's Thermostat can already be controlled via its own iPhone or Android app. The division also promotes its own \\"Works with Nest\\" programme, which allows third-party products to communicate with the devices. Mercedes, LG, Whirlpool and Philips are among firms that have taken advantage of the access this grants to Nest's application programme interfaces (APIs) - the code that controls how different software programmes interact with each other. By contrast, Apple is promoting HomeKit - its own platform that lets users control and co-ordinate the use of smart home devices via its voice-activated virtual assistant Siri. The firm requires accessory-makers to prove they have adopted tough encryption standards before it will certify them, and has designed the system to limit the collection of data about who used what and when. \\"HomeKit introduces a new way for you to control supported devices in your home... and we've taken great care to make sure that the convenience this enables doesn't come at the expense of your privacy,\\" Apple's website states. The first products to support the standard began going on sale recently, including a thermostat made by Ecobee and a light dimmer switch from Lutron. A spokesman for Apple declined to comment about its US sales restrictions, which were first reported by Mashable. Nest's Protect smoke and carbon monoxide detector has also been removed from sale. But a spokesman for the firm said it expected Apple to stock a next-generation version soon, despite the fact it would not be HomeKit certified. This may be because there are no similar alarms yet available for Apple's platform. In an interview before Apple's move, Nest's chief executive told the BBC he was confident his firm was already doing enough to protect people's privacy. \\"We're taking very much a cross-platform approach,\\" said Tony Fadell. \\"Through the Works with Nest programme and the protocols that we use inside, it's going to be a very robust thing. \\"At the end of the day though, customers do not buy platforms, they buy products first and foremost. \\"So, anybody who is selling a product-like platform or trying to convert you on a platform, they're not going to be successful because that's not where customers start.\\" Read more of Tony Fadell's interview with the BBC Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"Apple removed some products from their stores because they want to focus on smart home devices that work well with their own system called HomeKit.

Adam's daughter informs him she wants a Simdoll, a lifelike, life-sized doll that acts almost human. The parents notice that the elderly family dog is not well, and express concern about it dying and how sad their daughter would be. It can be replaced by Repet, an animal cloning service, but Adam doesn't trust clones. Cloning knowledge is held by the multinational corporation Replacement Technologies. Human cloning is technically possible, but illegal. Adam thinks his daughter should just learn to accept death as a part of life, rather than being cushioned from it.Arriving at his helicopter piloting business, he and his partner Hank Morgan (Michael Rapaport) learn they are to transport Replacement Technologies CEO Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn). Oddly, the CEO's staff requires the pilots to sign several forms, as well as a small blood test and an eye screening, before the flight can be undertaken. Bemused, the pilots submit to the tests. Adam's wife calls with the news that the dog was so ill it had to be put down, and begs him to get a Repet for their daughter.

It was founded in 1825 by Aaron Arnold (1794?-1876), an emigrant from Great Britain, as a small dry goods store on Pine Street in New York City. In 1857 the store moved into a five-story white marble dry goods palace known as the Marble House. During the Civil War Arnold, Constable was one of the first stores to issue charge bills of credit to its customers each month instead of on a bi-annual basis. Recognized as an emporium for high-quality fashions, the store soon outgrew the Marble House and erected a cast-iron building on Broadway and Nineteenth Street in 1869; this “Palace of Trade” expanded over the years until it was necessary to move into a larger space in 1914.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: To calculate mass from volume, you must know the density of the object. Different materials have different densities. Consider a sphere made of styrofoam, for example, and compare its weight to a sphere the same size made of iron. Iron has a much greater density and will therefore have a greater mass. You can find densities of many solid materials by looking up density tables online, in textbooks or in other industry catalogs. For example, here are the recorded densities of some solid materials: Aluminum = 2700 kg/m3 Butter = 870 kg/m3 Lead = 11,350 kg/m3 Pressed wood = 190 kg/m3 The units you used in calculating volume must match the volume units in the density measurement. If they do not, then you must convert them. All of the examples in the previous section resulted in volumes measured in cubic centimeters. However, the cited density table provides densities based on cubic meters. Because there are 100 centimeters in a meter, there are 106 cubic centimeters in a cubic meter. Divide the given densities by 106 to represent the density in units of kg/cm3. (You can do this most easily by just moving the decimal point 6 spaces to the left.) For the four sample materials, the converted densities are as follows: Aluminum = 2700 kg/m3 = 0.0027 kg/cm3 Butter = 870 kg/m3 = 0.00087 kg/cm3 Lead = 11,350 kg/m3 = 0.01135 kg/cm3 Pressed wood = 190 kg/m3 = 0.00019 kg/cm3 Recall that the formula for density is Density=MassVolume{displaystyle {text{Density}}={frac {text{Mass}}{text{Volume}}}}. Rearranging this to find the mass, the equation becomes Density∗Volume=Mass{displaystyle {text{Density}}*{text{Volume}}={text{Mass}}}. Using the four sample materials, aluminum, butter, lead and pressed wood, find the mass of a sphere that has a volume of 500 cm3. Aluminum:500 cm3∗0.0027kgcm3=1.35 kg{displaystyle {text{Aluminum}}:500{text{ cm}}^{3}*0.0027{frac {text{kg}}{{text{cm}}^{3}}}=1.35{text{ kg}}} Butter:500 cm3∗0.00087kgcm3=0.435 kg{displaystyle {text{Butter}}:500{text{ cm}}^{3}*0.00087{frac {text{kg}}{{text{cm}}^{3}}}=0.435{text{ kg}}} Lead:500 cm3∗0.01135kgcm3=5.675 kg{displaystyle {text{Lead}}:500{text{ cm}}^{3}*0.01135{frac {text{kg}}{{text{cm}}^{3}}}=5.675{text{ kg}}} Pressed wood:500 cm3∗0.00019kgcm3=0.095 kg{displaystyle {text{Pressed wood}}:500{text{ cm}}^{3}*0.00019{frac {text{kg}}{{text{cm}}^{3}}}=0.095{text{ kg}}} Summary:","completion":"The article explains how to calculate mass from volume by knowing the density of an object, providing examples with various solid materials and demonstrating the process of finding the mass of a sphere with a specific volume."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, Gojoe provides far more than just beautiful images (as does MUSA... don't which to imply a contrast) - it's second greatest strength is superb acting, and a fascinating story with some very dark philosophy. I must admit to being quite unsure what the point was it was trying to make in the end, but it definitely provokes some thoughts along the way. Vague ones, but definitely thoughts :p One department in which the film could have been better is the action. There's a tremendous amount of bloodletting in the film, but the action is all filmed with hyperkinetic close-ups, and frequently obscured by objects in the foreground. It does create some very intense and impressive visuals, but it would have been nice to see some more actual moves, something to make it more believable that the villains could just wade through entire armies laying waste to everyone. Still, the film is definitely one of the most interesting and most beautiful films I've seen for quite some time. Recommended!","completion":"The sentiment of the given review is decidedly positive but it's nuanced and not universally glowing. The reviewer begins by expressing their appreciation for beautiful films and innovative cinematography, which is a strong positive sentiment in favor of the film in question. The reviewer suggests that the film 'Gojoe' is, for the most part, able to sustain their interest due to its remarkable cinematography, comparing it favorable to another film, 'MUSA', which is assumed to be held in high esteem in this context. Further, the review emphasizes the strengths of the film by mentioning its \\"superb acting\\" and a \\"fascinating story with some very dark philosophy\\", thereby showing the reviewer's enthusiasm and appreciation, indicating positive sentiment. However, mixed sentiment is demonstrated when the reviewer discusses the narrative of the film. They seemed to be perplexed by the final point the film was trying to convey, though the fact that it provoked thoughts in them implies slightly more favorable than unfavorable sentiment to the film's storytelling. Moving forward, the review expresses dissatisfaction over the action sequences in the film, criticizing the hyperkinetic close-ups and obscured visuals. This shows a negative sentiment towards the way the action was presented in the film. This bit of criticism indicates that although the reviewer has a predominantly positive view of the film, it's not without its perceived flaws. Finally, the overall sentiment of the review is decisively summed up in the concluding part where the reviewer states that the film is \\"one of the most interesting and most beautiful films\\" they've seen in quite some time, and ends with a recommendation. This is a direct expression of positive sentiment toward the film. To summarize, the sentiment in the review is majorly positive, with high praises in terms of cinematography, acting, storytelling, as well as an overall recommendation. This, however, does not overshadow the criticisms the reviewer has for confusing messaging and the delivery of the action sequences, showing nuanced and balanced sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the review and justifications for the negative sentiment: 1. The review starts with \\"This is hands down the worst service in uptown.\\" The use of the word \\"worst\\" immediately establishes a negative tone. 2. The reviewer mentions long wait times for service, supported by claims that the issue occurred \\"every single time\\" they visited the establishment. The repeated mention of this issue underlines the reviewer's dissatisfaction. 3. The reviewer acknowledges that the bar is sometimes their only option because they work in the building, implying that the visits were not driven by personal preference or enjoyment. 4. Throughout the review, the author lists specific issues related to staffing, such as a single bartender on a busy night, and waiting over an hour for to-go orders. These examples further emphasize their negative experience. 5. The reviewer also mentions issues with the outdoor seating area having inadequate wait staff, which contributes to the negative sentiment. 6. The review ends with a warning to potential customers: \\"Save your money but more importantly save your time.\\" This summary statement clearly encourages readers to avoid the establishment, reinforcing the negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: Dozens of Labour MPs employ staff on zero-hours contracts — despite Ed Miliband claiming they have 'no place in the 21st century'. Official figures from Parliament's expenses watchdog show 36 Labour MPs employed staff on the casual contracts last year. Some of Mr Miliband's closest allies in the Labour Party have used the contracts – including his election campaign co-ordinator Lucy Powell and parliamentary bag carrier Karen Buck – who has six staff on the contracts. Ed Miliband claimed zero-hours contracts have 'no place in the 21st century' - even though 36 Labour MPs employ staff on them. Mr Miliband has repeatedly criticised zero-hours contracts and companies using them. Just last week he said: 'If you are working regular hours then you should get a regular contract.' Zerohours contracts allow a company to vary the number of hours staff can work each week or month between full-time and none at all. Labour has insisted it is not 'exploiting' workers and the casual contracts were typically of those used to take on interns part-time. But the revelation is an embarrassment for Mr Miliband, who has vowed to tackle the 'epidemic' of zero-hours contracts if Labour wins power. Last year, Mr Miliband slammed the high street giant Sports Direct, owned by Newcastle United chief Mike Ashley. He said: 'Sports Direct has predictable turnover, it is a modern company with stores on many high streets and, judging by its success, where many people shop,' he will say. 'But for too many of its employees, Sports Direct is a bad place to work. This is not about exceptional use of zero-hours contracts for short-term or seasonal work … This is the way Sports Direct employs the vast majority of its workforce. These Victorian practices have no place in the 21st century.' Last year Mr Miliband hit out at the high street chain Sports Direct for employing its staff on zero hours contracts. Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley has come under fire from politicians and union bosses for employing thousands of workers on zero-hours contracts. Last year it emerged even the shadow chancellor Ed Balls employed four staff on zero-hours contracts. Several Labour-run councils also employ staff on zero hours, including Doncaster Council, the authority in Mr Miliband's constituency which admitted employing 300 people on the contracts. Freedom of Information inquiries show that in 2013, Derby Council employed 1,333 people on the contracts, Gateshead 1,285 and Bury 3,418. All are run by Labour. Conservative MP Julian Smith MP told MailOnline the figures exposed the 'same old do-as-we-say-not-as-we-do hypocrisy from the Labour Party'. He said: ‘Ed Miliband might say he’s against zero hours contracts but his MPs ignore him and use them anyway. They are in chaos. ‘They have no long-term economic plan and can’t be trusted to keep any of their promises.’ Highlights:","completion":"1.

Two eggs are laid and incubated for about 17 days. When they hatch, the squabs are fed by both parents on \\"pigeon's milk\\", a thick secretion high in protein produced by the crop. Squabs grow rapidly, but are slow to fledge and are ready to leave the nest at 26 to 30 days weighing about 500 g (18 oz). By this time, the adult pigeons will have laid and be incubating another pair of eggs and a prolific pair should produce two squabs every four weeks during a breeding season lasting several months. Question: How often are pigeons able to breed for the consumption process ?","completion":"Pigeons are able to breed quite frequently for the consumption process. A prolific pair of pigeons can produce two squabs every four weeks during a breeding season that lasts several months. This consistent breeding cycle allows for a continuous supply of squabs for consumption purposes. The breeding process begins with the female pigeon laying two eggs, which are then incubated by both parents for approximately 17 days. Once the squabs hatch, they are fed \\"pigeon's milk,\\" a thick, protein-rich secretion produced by both parents' crop for nourishment. The squabs grow rapidly but take a relatively longer time to fledge when compared to other bird species. At 26 to 30 days old, the squabs are ready to leave the nest, weighing around 500 grams (18 oz). By this time, the adult pigeons would have laid another pair of eggs and begun the incubation process again. This cycle repeats itself throughout the breeding season, ensuring a steady production of squabs for consumption. It is essential to note that the consistent production of squabs relies on proper care and management of the breeding pigeons, including providing them with a suitable environment, adequate nutrition, and appropriate husbandry practices. Regular monitoring of the pigeons and their offspring can also help maintain a healthy and productive breeding operation, ensuring a continuous supply of squabs for the consumption process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the questions at the end based on the text. CHAPTER XIII. THE HOUSE ON THE HILL There was a little unfailing spring, always icy cold and crystal pure, in a certain birch-screened hollow of Rainbow Valley in the lower corner near the marsh. Not a great many people knew of its existence. The manse and Ingleside children knew, of course, as they knew everything else about the magic valley. Occasionally they went there to get a drink, and it figured in many of their plays as a fountain of old romance. Anne knew of it and loved it because it somehow reminded her of the beloved Dryad's Bubble at Green Gables. Rosemary West knew of it; it was her fountain of romance, too. Eighteen years ago she had sat behind it one spring twilight and heard young Martin Crawford stammer out a confession of fervent, boyish love. She had whispered her own secret in return, and they had kissed and promised by the wild wood spring. They had never stood together by it again--Martin had sailed on his fatal voyage soon after; but to Rosemary West it was always a sacred spot, hallowed by that immortal hour of youth and love. Whenever she passed near it she turned aside to hold a secret tryst with an old dream--a dream from which the pain had long gone, leaving only its unforgettable sweetness. The spring was a hidden thing. You might have passed within ten feet of it and never have suspected its existence. Two generations past a huge old pine had fallen almost across it. Nothing was left of the tree but its crumbling trunk out of which the ferns grew thickly, making a green roof and a lacy screen for the water. A maple-tree grew beside it with a curiously gnarled and twisted trunk, creeping along the ground for a little way before shooting up into the air, and so forming a quaint seat; and September had flung a scarf of pale smoke-blue asters around the hollow. 1. who kissed Rosemary? 2. where did they kiss? 3. where did Martin go after? 4. did he survive it? 5.

He amassed a fortune of 1.3 billion dollars during his career but instead of keeping the money and living like an emperor, he decided to give it all away. All of his fortune will be spent on helping poor Chinese students get a better education. And Yu isn't the only super-rich person in China who has this spirit of giving. Chen Guangbiao, a Jiangsu recycling tycoon, has given millions of dollars to charity and promises to give all of his money to charity when he dies. Yu and Chen are among the many businessmen who have become prosperous during China's economic rise. An American business magazine, Forbes, estimates that there are 117 billionaires in China and hundreds of thousands of millionaires. What sets Yu and Chen apart from the rest, though, is their tremendous generosity(,) when it comes to donating money to charity. Last week Bill Gates and Warren Buffett came to Beijing. Gates and Buffett, two of the world's richest men, are also the world's biggest philanthropists. They invited fifty of China's richest people to have dinner with them and talk about the spirit of giving. At first, only a few people accepted their invitation. It seemed some of the invited guests were afraid that Buffett and Gates were going to pressure them into giving their wealth to charity.

The country of Hinland reduced taxation hoping it would mean more money for government spending. On the other hand, Silvania, a southern country increased taxation hoping they would increase collection amounts. The problem was that Silvanian people increased taxation above the critical rate. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country experienced an increase in government revenue?","completion":"To answer the question, let's examine the information provided in the paragraph: 1. Hinland reduced taxation hoping for more money for government spending. 2. Silvania increased taxation hoping to increase collection amounts. 3. Silvania increased taxation above the critical rate. Step 1: Analyze Hinland's situation Hinland reduced taxation, which implies that they hoped for increased economic growth and that people would have more money to spend resulting in higher taxable income. This would lead to more revenue for the government. Step 2: Analyze Silvania's situation Silvania increased taxation to increase revenue. However, it is mentioned that they increased the taxation above the critical rate. The critical rate is a point where further increases in taxation actually lead to a decrease in revenue, as people may be discouraged from working or look for ways to avoid high taxes. Step 3: Compare the two countries Comparing both scenarios, it can be inferred that Hinland's approach might have a positive impact on government revenue, while Silvania's approach is likely to have a negative impact due to the increased taxation above the critical rate. Step 4: Answer the question Based on the information provided and our analysis, Hinland would be the country that experienced an increase in government revenue."},{"prompt":"Q: Question: What country is the largest stalagmite?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I heard that Lee spent all of Remy's money on a gift for them. And I was wondering How would Remy feel as a result? Answer:","completion":"It is difficult to accurately predict individual emotions, as each person reacts differently to situations depending on various factors such as their individual personality, upbringing, and past experiences. However, we can analyze some potential ways Remy might feel as an outcome of Lee's actions and the reasons behind these emotions. 1. Appreciative: Remy might feel appreciative and grateful if Lee's intentions were genuine, and the gift was thoughtfully chosen to bring happiness or to fulfill a genuine need or desire for them. In this case, even though Lee spent all of Remy's money, Remy might still recognize and value the effort Lee put into selecting and buying the gift. 2. Overwhelmed: Remy might feel overwhelmed by the expenditure and the grandness of the gift. The pressure to reciprocate with a similarly expensive gesture or feeling undeserving of such an extravagant gift could lead to anxiety and apprehension. 3. Conflicted: Remy might experience mixed feelings about Lee's actions. On one hand, they would appreciate the thought and affection behind the gift, but on the other hand, they could be concerned about the financial implications of spending all their money. 4. Frustrated: If Remy perceives that their money could have been better spent on more important or pressing needs, they might feel frustrated with Lee's decision to spend it all on a single gift, especially if there was no prior discussion or agreement on the matter. 5. Disrespected: In some cases, Remy might see Lee's actions as a disregard for their financial autonomy and disrespect for their personal boundaries. Spending all of someone's money without their consent could be seen as a breach of trust. 6. Anxious: Remy may feel anxious about their financial situation, especially if they did not have a backup plan or emergency fund. The draining of their resources could create a tremendous amount of stress and worry about future expenses. In conclusion, Remy's feelings as a result of Lee spending all their money on a gift could range from appreciative and grateful to overwhelmed, conflicted, frustrated, disrespected, and anxious. Understanding the specific context of their relationship, the thoughtfulness of the gift, and Remy's personal values and beliefs would be essential in determining their emotions more accurately. Communication between Lee and Remy would play a significant role in clarifying intentions and addressing any issues that have arisen from this situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The deputy director for operations mentioned the Delta flight and concluded that \\"that would be the fourth possible hijack.\\" At 9:49, the commander of NORAD directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations, fully armed. At 9:59, an Air Force lieutenant colonel working in the White House Military Office joined the conference and stated he had just talked to Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. The White House requested (1) the implementation of continuity of government measures, (2) fighter escorts for Air Force One, and (3) a fighter combat air patrol over Washington, D.C. By 10:03, when United 93 crashed in Pennsylvania, there had been no mention of its hijacking and the FAA had not yet been added to the teleconference. The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: \\"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\\" The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening. The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes, while the children continued reading. He then returned to a holding room shortly before 9:15, where he was briefed by staff and saw television coverage. He next spoke to Vice President Cheney, Dr. Rice, New York Governor George Pataki, and FBI Director Robert Mueller. He decided to make a brief statement from the school before leaving for the airport. The Secret Service told us they were anxious to move the President to a safer location, but did not think it imperative for him to run out the door. Between 9:15 and 9:30, the staff was busy arranging a return to Washington, while the President consulted his senior advisers about his remarks. No one in the traveling party had any information during this time that other aircraft were hijacked or missing. Staff was in contact with the White House Situation Room, but as far as we could determine, no one with the President was in contact with the Pentagon.

Question: - The saliva breaks down the chemicals in the food a bit, which helps make the food mushy and easy to swallow - Your tongue helps out, pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth - The esophagus moves food from the back of your throat to your stomach - Strong muscles in the walls of the stomach and gastric juices break down food in your stomach What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the digestive process, after the food has been broken down in the stomach, is the absorption of nutrients and elimination of waste through the small intestine, large intestine, and rectum. Here's an overview of these final steps: 1. Small Intestine: Once the food has been mixed with gastric juices and turned into a semi-liquid substance called chyme, it moves to the small intestine. The small intestine is where the major part of digestion and most of the absorption of nutrients occurs. It is divided into three sections: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. In the duodenum, enzymes and bile from the pancreas and gallbladder help break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. As the chyme moves through the jejunum and ileum, different types of nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream through tiny hair-like structures called villi. 2. Large Intestine (Colon): After the small intestine has absorbed most of the nutrients, the remaining undigested food, water, and waste products move into the large intestine. Its primary function is to absorb water and electrolytes to form feces. The colon is divided into four main parts: the ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon. As the feces move through the colon, the water gets reabsorbed, and the feces become more solid. 3. Rectum and Anus: The rectum is the last part of the large intestine, where the feces are temporarily stored. When the rectal muscles sense that it's full, the need to defecate arises. The feces then move through the anal canal and exit the body through the anus, which is controlled by the internal and external anal sphincters. These sphincters help to regulate the release of feces during the process of defecation. In summary, the last step of the digestive process involves the small intestine's absorption of nutrients, the large intestine's absorption of water and electrolytes, and the rectum's storage and elimination of fecal waste through the anus."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Article: John liked to wear his hair very long.

Write highlights for this article: It takes seven minutes to execute a death row inmate, according to the state of Texas. Mike Graczyk poses outside the Texas death chamber prior to an execution in January. At that rate, Mike Graczyk has spent about 40 hours of his life watching men -- and a few women -- die. Graczyk, a correspondent for The Associated Press, is believed to hold a macabre record. He's almost certainly watched more executions than anyone else in the United States. \\"I can't possibly imagine there's been someone present at more than Mike,\\" said Michelle Lyons, the spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, which uses lethal injection at its execution chamber in Huntsville. Since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, no state has executed more inmates than Texas. And no one has witnessed more of them than Graczyk. He's on the witness list for 315 of the state's 439 executions -- more than any other reporter, prison employee or chaplain -- and no records were kept for another 80. Interactive map: See how Texas compares with other states ». In his early days, he kept count. But he eventually stopped. He didn't want to know. \\"In one circle, I was perceived as putting notches on my gun belt,\\" the 59-year-old reporter said. \\"I didn't like that.\\" Prison regulations in Texas require The Associated Press to be given one of the five designated media witness passes for each execution. Graczyk works in the AP's Houston bureau -- it's closest to the state's execution chamber in Huntsville. Since the early 1980s, he's made the hourlong drive north almost every time an inmate has faced the needle. The first was March 13, 1984, for the execution of James \\"Cowboy\\" Autry, convicted of shooting a female store clerk between the eyes with a .38-caliber revolver while arguing over a six-pack of beer. She died, along with a former Catholic priest that Autry killed at the crime scene. \\"The first time definitely leaves an impression on you,\\" Graczyk said. There are others that stand out along the way. Graczyk remembers Bob Black, convicted of killing his wife and trying to collect the insurance money. \\"I walked into the death house, and he was strapped to the table and he said, 'Hey Mike, how are you doing?' It threw me for a loop.\\" Graczyk said it's normal for him to know the name of the condemned and not uncommon for the reverse to be true. There have been others who greeted Graczyk by name with a needle in their arm. Once, while waiting to be let into the death house, a prisoner phoned him in the media holding area. It was the inmate whose execution Graczyk was about to witness. \\"He said, 'I just wanted to call and make sure you were OK.' I was flabbergasted.\\" Over the years, the inmate's name has slipped from Graczyk's memory, but not the unexpected phone conversation. \\"I don't think he had any family to call,\\" he said. There was Ponchai Wilkerson, who once nearly escaped from death row and, years later, coughed up a handcuff key as he lay dying from his injection. There was the \\"Candy Man,\\" Ronald Clark O'Bryan -- convicted of poisoning his child's Halloween candy with cyanide -- and the gauntlet of college students wearing Halloween masks who showed up to cheer. And Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman executed in Texas since the 1800s. He remembers a network correspondent crying after her death -- and another blow-drying his hair. Of the entire death chamber ritual, Graczyk said, it's the final statements that stick in his mind. Some have been confessions. Others were denials. Poetry. Prayers. Bible verses. Curses. Emotions ranging from defiance to resignation. There was Jonathan Nobles, an electrician who stabbed two people to death. He sang \\"Silent Night.\\" \\"Ever since then, I think of him on Christmas or Christmas Eve when I'm in church,\\" Graczyk said. \\"That's the kind of thing that haunts you.\\" The person who may come closest to Graczyk's status also felt things that haunted him. Don Reid, a writer for the AP and, before that, a Texas newspaper, witnessed 189 executions in the 1960s, when Texas still strapped inmates to \\"Old Sparky,\\" the nickname for the state's electric chair. The experience changed Reid, who died in 1981, from a supporter of the death penalty to an opponent. He wrote a book, \\"Have a Seat, Please,\\" chronicling that transformation. Graczyk said he doesn't worry about the mental toll of watching so many deaths. His bosses with the AP have offered counseling. He's declined. \\"To see someone go to sleep -- not to sound insensitive -- but the carnage at the murder scene is harder than what you see in the death house in Huntsville,\\" he said. Over a 25-year career, Graczyk said, the executions have only been a small portion of his work. He finds balance in those other stories. As a journalist, Graczyk never answers the question when friends ask his own views on the death penalty. \\"I'm not sure I really know,\\" he said. But as long as Texas keeps executing people, Graczyk said, it's important that he keep showing up. The next execution in Huntsville was scheduled for Thursday before the condemned, convicted murderer Kenneth Mosley, was granted a reprieve until September. If the execution goes ahead then, Graczyk plans to make the drive. \\"I would hate for the state of Texas to take someone's life and no one be there,\\" he said. CNN's Doug Gross contributed to this report.","completion":"Highlights: 1. It takes seven minutes to execute a death row inmate in the state of Texas. 2.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. – they test maximum performance and habitual performance; Make this proper case.","completion":"Maximum Performance and Habitual Performance Testing: Exploring the Key Differences and Benefits In the field of performance testing and assessment, two primary types of performance are often analyzed: maximum performance and habitual performance. Although both types of performance aim to evaluate an individual's or a team's capabilities and efficiency, they differ in their focus, methodology, and application. This detailed analysis of maximum performance and habitual performance will illustrate the distinctions and importance of each type of testing, as well as the benefits they offer. 1. Maximum Performance: Maximum performance testing, as the name implies, measures the highest level of an individual's or a team's performance in a specific skill or task. This type of testing is commonly used in situations where the stakes are high, and optimal performance is crucial. Examples of maximum performance testing include standardized tests like the SAT, competitive sports, and demanding job assignments that require exceptional ability and knowledge. The key benefits of maximum performance testing are: a. Identifying top performers: By evaluating individuals and teams at their highest levels of performance, maximum performance testing allows for the identification of the best performers in a specific field. This information can be vital for talent acquisition and development, as well as for determining promotion eligibility. b. Setting performance benchmarks: Maximum performance testing allows organizations to establish high standards of performance and set benchmarks that can help drive improvements and growth. These benchmarks can motivate individuals and teams to push their limits and achieve excellence. c. Facilitating comparisons: Conducting maximum performance tests enables comparisons between individuals, teams, and organizations, which can help identify areas of strength and weakness. This information can be used to improve training programs, resource allocation, and overall competitiveness. 2. Habitual Performance: Habitual performance testing, on the other hand, evaluates an individual's or a team's typical or average performance over an extended period. This type of testing aims to find out how individuals or teams perform under normal circumstances, without the pressure of peak performance expectation. Habitual performance tests often use observation and feedback from peers, managers, or coaches and can include performance reviews, employee evaluations, and progress reports in various fields. The key benefits of habitual performance testing are: a. Understanding baseline performance: Habitual performance testing provides insights into the everyday performance levels of individuals and teams, giving a clearer understanding of baseline capabilities. This information can help organizations make informed decisions about resource allocation, training needs, and workload distribution. b. Identifying areas for improvement: By regularly evaluating habitual performance, organizations can identify specific areas where individuals and teams need to improve, leading to targeted interventions that can enhance overall performance. c. Monitoring progress and development: Habitual performance testing enables organizations to track the progress and development of individuals and teams over time. This continuous monitoring can be crucial for employee development, as it can identify both improvements and declines in performance, providing feedback to support growth and prevent stagnation. In summary, maximum performance and habitual performance testing each offer unique insights and benefits when evaluating an individual's or a team's abilities and efficiency. Maximum performance testing seeks to identify the highest level of potential and accomplishment, setting benchmarks for excellence and comparison. Habitual performance testing, by contrast, focuses on everyday performance, allowing for a better understanding of baseline capabilities, targeted improvements, and long-term progress. By effectively utilizing both types of testing, organizations can optimize the development and performance of individuals and teams alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a text based on this summary: serum hepatitis b virus found to be predictor of liver cancer Text:","completion":"Title: Serum Hepatitis B Virus as a Significant Predictor of Liver Cancer - A Comprehensive Overview Introduction Liver cancer has become a major health concern in numerous countries, where there is an increasing incidence of cancer-related deaths. Among various risk factors associated with liver cancer, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an established primary factor. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of serum hepatitis B virus as a predictor of liver cancer. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the relationship between serum hepatitis B virus and liver cancer development, with a focus on recent research findings. Serum Hepatitis B Virus Infection and Its Impact on Liver Health Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a blood-borne virus that predominantly targets liver cells, causing both acute and chronic liver infections. The virus spreads through contact with infected blood, sexual intercourse with an infected person, and from an infected mother to her newborn during childbirth. While most adults recover fully from acute HBV infection, some individuals develop chronic infection, which can lead to severe liver diseases such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Serum hepatitis B virus (SHBV) refers to the presence of HBV in a person's blood. Elevated levels of SHBV are an indication of active viral replication and inflammation of the liver. Prolonged inflammation can lead to the development of liver cirrhosis and eventually liver cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In fact, chronic HBV infection accounts for up to 50% of liver cancer cases worldwide. This highlights the significant impact of serum hepatitis B virus infection on liver health. Serum Hepatitis B Virus as a Predictor of Liver Cancer The associations between SHBV and liver cancer have been established through numerous epidemiological and clinical studies. Recent research has identified specific markers within serum hepatitis B virus that can help predict the risk of developing liver cancer among individuals with chronic HBV infection. These markers include: 1. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): A higher level of HBsAg in the serum indicates a greater likelihood of developing liver cancer. HBsAg level is useful in determining the stage of HBV infection and monitoring disease progression. 2. Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg): The presence of HBeAg in serum is associated with high levels of viral replication and increased risk of liver cancer. HBeAg-negative individuals with chronic HBV infection have a lower risk of developing liver cancer than HBeAg-positive individuals. 3. HBV DNA level: High levels of HBV DNA in the serum are indicative of active viral replication and increased liver cancer risk. HBV DNA quantitation is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of antiviral therapy and guiding clinical management. 4. Genotypes and mutations: Specific HBV genotypes and mutations within the HBV genome are associated with an increased risk of liver cancer. For instance, genotype C is more likely to progress to liver cancer than genotype A. Additionally, mutations in the basal core promoter region and preS region of HBV DNA are associated with higher HCC risk. Given the strong associations between serum hepatitis B virus markers and liver cancer development, it is crucial to closely monitor individuals with chronic HBV infection for these markers to enable early detection and intervention, ultimately reducing the risk of liver cancer. Conclusion In conclusion, serum hepatitis B virus has emerged as a significant predictor of liver cancer among patients with chronic HBV infection. By closely monitoring the specific serological markers associated with HBV, healthcare professionals can more accurately predict the risk of liver cancer in these patients and tailor their treatment accordingly. Early identification and management of high-risk individuals could improve survival rates and reduce the burden of liver cancer in the affected population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"78 Text Box 4.2: Government Saving When Reducing Publicly Held\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Economical results of reduction by the Government public held.\\" true?","completion":"The statement provided - \\"78 Text Box 4.2: Government Saving When Reducing Publicly Held\\" - is not a coherent premise, as it seems to be an excerpt, possibly from a different context. The hypothesis provided, \\"Economical results of reduction by the Government public held,\\" is also not entirely clear, and the grammar makes it difficult to establish a precise meaning. However, if we attempt to make sense of this hypothesis, it can be rephrased as, \\"Does the reduction in publicly held government debt lead to economical outcomes?\\" With that clarity, let's discuss the potential economic results of such actions by the government. Reducing publicly held government debt can have several economic consequences. Publicly held government debts are usually bonds or securities sold by the government to finance its budgetary needs. When a government aims to reduce its publicly held debt, it has to either buy back those securities or refrain from issuing new ones and rely more on revenue from taxes or other sources. Some possible economic outcomes of reducing publicly held government debt are: 1. Interest rate fluctuations: Reducing publicly held debt may decrease the demand for borrowing in the economy, leading to a decline in interest rates. Lower interest rates can encourage borrowing and investment from individuals and businesses, as well as reduce the cost of servicing the debt. 2. Fiscal space: A reduction in publicly held government debt can create fiscal space, allowing the government to undertake expansionary fiscal policies, e.g., increased public spending or tax cuts, to stimulate economic growth without increasing its debt burden. 3. Confidence boost: A lower debt-to-GDP ratio (resulting from debt reduction) can enhance investor confidence in a country's economy. Increased confidence may lead to higher investment in the country, both domestic and foreign, potentially driving economic growth. 4. Reduced crowding out effect: By decreasing publicly held debt, the government might reduce the crowding-out effect, meaning it is not competing with the private sector for funds by issuing bonds. This outcome can free up funds for private investment, which can contribute to economic growth. 5. Limited resources for social programs: Reduction in publicly held government debt could also mean that the government has fewer resources to fund social programs or undergo infrastructure development. Limiting funds for such social support could affect vulnerable sections of the population, impeding inclusive economic growth. 6. Austerity measures: To reduce public debt, the government might implement austerity policies, consisting of budget cuts or tax increases. While these policies can reduce government debt, they may also have profound social and economic consequences, such as reduced household incomes or a decline in public services. In conclusion, the hypothesis that reducing publicly held government debt could lead to economical outcomes holds some merit. Depending on how governments manage debt reduction, it can result in a spectrum of economic outcomes—both positive and negative. Contextual factors, such as the country's economic state and fiscal policies, play a substantial role in determining the consequences of debt reduction efforts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who writes songs with Terry? Songwriter Terry Trindale is attracted to Consuelo Croyden, a woman he sees nightly at a Palm Beach casino. He finally works up the courage to approach her and express his feelings, but she rebuffs his advances. When he later accrues a 3,200 gambling debt to her, Consuelo agrees to hire him as her secretary to work off what he owes her. One of Terry's duties is to assume the role of her fiancé in order to discourage the insistent attention of Tony Barling, to whom Consuelo once was engaged, and to keep her from succumbing to her former beau's charms. Tony refuses to believe she loves someone else, and, when he recognizes Terry from the casino, his suspicions are aroused, despite Terry's outward displays of affection for Consuelo. Tony convinces her to join him on a friend's yacht, but Terry reminds her of his responsibility, and keeps her from going. Four weeks later, Consuelo finds herself still saddled with Terry, who has refused to accompany his songwriting partner Chappie Champagne to New York City to promote their latest tune. Consuelo insists she no longer has any interest in Tony, and offers to cancel the rest of Terry's debt so he can join Chappie. Terry departs, and moments later, Consuelo receives a call from Tony and invites him to the house. Instead, it is Terry, who had disguised his voice, who arrives, and he berates Consuelo for her lack of self-control.

Screen freezes after several minutes of use. Nevertheless Factory Depot still sells them like someone mentioned in their review earlier secondhand. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?","completion":"This review portrays the product in an unflattering light, as it emphasizes a number of negative aspects related to the SanDisk item in question. Below are a few key points from the review that contribute to this unfavorable depiction: 1. Product Recall: The reviewer states that the item in question was recalled due to general malfunction, which raises concerns about the product's safety and functionality. A product recall indicates that there have been significant issues identified by the manufacturer, leading to a considerable loss of consumer trust in the product. This is undoubtedly a damaging aspect of the review. 2. Screen Freeze: The reviewer mentions that the screen freezes after several minutes of use, which highlights a specific problem with the product that may affect its overall performance and utility for the user. A device that frequently freezes limits the user's ability to efficiently access and use the product, ultimately detracting from its value and appeal. 3. Secondhand Sales: The review brings up the fact that Factory Depot continues to sell the recalled product through secondhand sales, which may not only be ethically questionable but also potentially misleading to customers who may be unaware of the recall. This can create a sense of distrust towards the seller and the product itself, further tarnishing the image of the item in question. 4. Reference to Negative Reviews: The reviewer also refers to a negative review mentioned by another user earlier, which insinuates that this is not an isolated issue and has affected other users as well. This creates the impression that the product's flaws are widespread and well-known, supporting the unflattering portrayal. In conclusion, given the various issues presented in the review, it clearly paints the product in an unflattering light. Such reviews can negatively affect the product's reputation, leading to potential customers hesitating or deciding against purchasing the item. To restore trust in the product, it would be important for the manufacturer to address these issues and ensure transparency and effective communication with customers regarding any necessary recalls, updates, or improvements."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Title: Takes a lot of abuse Review: First of all, despite some comments here that would lead you to believe otherwise, this is NOT a gas grill.

Question: suppose more eggs fertilized happens, how will it affect blood is filtered through liver. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"C: no effect Step 1: Understand the process The liver's primary function is to filter the blood, detoxify harmful substances, and produce energy. The process described (blood being sent to the liver, being treated with chemicals and proteins, cleaned, producing energy, and exiting the liver) is a general overview of this function. Step 2: Understand the situation The situation involves an increase in the number of fertilized eggs, which are the result of a sperm cell successfully combining with an egg cell during reproduction. These fertilized eggs will eventually form embryos and develop into new organisms. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between fertilized eggs and liver function An increase in fertilized eggs might lead to an increased demand for nutrients and energy to support the growth and development of the embryos or organisms. However, this change is not directly related to the liver's function of filtering blood and detoxifying substances. The liver will continue to perform its primary function regardless of the number of fertilized eggs present in the body.

Context: Dara and Jody sat on the sun-scorched concrete with their backs against the bus shelter. They were sharing an apple, one of those tart green ones, and as Dara took her turn gnashing into it, Jody gagged and vomited up some peel. 'Shit, are you okay?' Dara asked, rubbing Jody's back. 'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did. They were both in Year 11, and had only become friends three months earlier. They were from totally different scenes at school, but one maths lesson had changed all that. Jody had borrowed someone's correction fluid -- in fact it was Mr Dickinson, the teacher's correction fluid -- but it was borrowed from someone who'd borrowed it from him. At the end of the lesson Jody was packing her stuff up and didn't know what to do with the bottle of white-out, so she tossed it out the window of the classroom. Dara had seen her do it, and thought it was just so cool.

They may wander around the town, exploring new places and embarking on adventures together, all the while deepening their friendship. As the day progresses, Dara's anxiety about wagging school for the first time begins to subside, replaced with feelings of elation and freedom. They may find a new appreciation for the world around them and engage in discussions about their lives, their interests, and their aspirations. The girls might share more laughter and memorable moments throughout the day, and even grab some food from a nearby café or food stand – perhaps avoiding apples to prevent another bout of laughter. As their bond strengthens, they realize that their differences in social circles at school don't matter because they share a genuine connection. As the day comes to an end, Dara and Jody might make plans for future adventures and outings together. They might discuss how their friendship began in the math class, and the hilarious, somewhat rebellious act of throwing the correction fluid out the window that brought them together. Reflecting on this moment emphasizes the fact that sometimes, the most unexpected events can lead to the most cherished friendships. Eventually, the girls will have to return to school, facing the potential consequences of their absence.

Kevin had become the victim of mail theft several times but Hunter never did because Kevin did not have a secure mailbox. Despite living in the same neighborhood and experiencing similar risks, the two friends had different experiences with mail security. Kevin's mailbox was an old-fashioned, basic model. An open slot in the front allowed the mail to be inserted easily, but it also made it accessible to anyone walking by. The mailbox did not have any lock or mechanism that would keep the mail secure. It was mounted directly onto the wall of their house near the street, making it even more tempting to would-be thieves. On the other hand, Hunter invested in a secure mailbox to preserve the integrity of his mail. His mailbox was crafted from a sturdy material, making it difficult to break into or damage. It had a slot for mail delivery but also boasted a sturdy lock, which ensured that only Hunter and his family could access their mail. This added level of security deterred mail thieves, as the mailbox did not present an easy target. Over the course of a few years, Kevin's insecurity became apparent, and his mailbox started to become a frequent target for mail thieves. His confidential and important documents would regularly go missing, and he also suffered from the annoyance of stolen packages or gifts. Mail theft had become a significant issue for Kevin, causing a great deal of stress and resulting in the loss of both time and money. He often found himself contacting companies for replacements of stolen items and dealing with credit card companies to cancel fraudulent charges made with intercepted sensitive information. Hunter, on the other hand, had a worry-free experience with his mail. The extra security measures he had taken by installing a secure mailbox kept his personal information and packages safe. He never had to deal with stolen mail or the stress that accompanied it. Eventually, Kevin decided to follow Hunter's example and invest in a secure mailbox. Once he made the upgrade, he noticed an immediate decrease in mail theft incidences. His important documents remained safely in the locked mailbox, and he no longer had to deal with the inconvenience and stress caused by stolen mail.

Immigration is when people move from one country to another, because they want to live in a different place. This can happen for lots of reasons!

One team is called the Republicans, and the other team is called the Democrats. The Republicans are also called the GOP. Right now, the GOP is talking about immigration. But instead of coming up with new ideas to help people, they are using fear. Fear is when you are scared of something, like being afraid of the dark. So, why are they using fear? Well, sometimes people think that when people from different countries come, they might take their jobs or change their way of life. The GOP is making people worry about these things, instead of trying to think of ways to make everyone feel welcome and happy. We need good ideas to help people who are moving to America, so they can have a great life and be a part of our big family. But right now, the GOP isn't doing that.

Explanation: The story includes details that relate to one or more of the three defined scenarios, creating a context for understanding the characters' thoughts and actions. Part 4: Distractor sentences Usage: \\"Jack entered the sunroom. Mia entered the sunroom.\\" Explanation: These sentences describe the characters' actions but do not directly relate to the question about the object's location. They are included to add complexity to the story and potentially confuse the reader. Sample response: Mia will look for the eggplant in the blue_pantry. Explanation: This answer meets the criteria because it considers the scenario of belief not matching reality. Mia does not know about the new location (red_envelope), so she will look for the eggplant in its original location (blue_pantry)."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The infamous hoarders' house - dubbed Australia's most squalid - is being sold by the NSW Sheriff's Office to recoup the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on clearing the mountains of rubbish collected on the property, it has been revealed. It has also emerged that whoever buys the free-standing home at 19 Boonara Avenue in Bondi, just a few hundred metres from the world famous beach - may also have to pay to evict the current owners, who have previously refused to clear up the junk or move out to allow council inspectors inside. Debt collectors, on behalf of Waverley Council, have arranged to sell the home - which remarkably could fetch at least 2 million in the hope of recovering the 180,000 the Bobolas family owes for the clean up costs. Scroll down for video. Liana Bobolas, pictured here in April sitting beside her piles of trash, is one of three owners being forced to sell the squalid Bondi house. After amassing an enormous debt to the local council, the notorious family are being forced to sell their garbage-strewn property. Amazingly, the house is expected to go under the hammer for about 2 million, however the new owner will be required to apply for a court order to evict the family. The new owners will have to apply for to the Supreme Court for a writ of possession to evict them, which can take four weeks, according to The Daily Telegraph. A spokesperson for Justice NSW said 'after the sheriff receives the writ, they give the occupants 30 days to vacate the premises. If they do not vacate willingly, the sheriff has the power to force an eviction.' Neighbours who have have lived beside the squalid house have voiced their relief at the news. 'I can't believe it. We have just bought a house here and moved in on Saturday. That's fantastic for the whole street,' Yael Super told The Telegraph. If Mary Bobolas and her daughters Liana and Elena can recover the debt by February 17, they will keep the house, but otherwise the family will be given the remainder of the profits after the debts have been cleared. The Californian-style home, which has been listed for auction with Raine & Horne Double Bay agent Ric Serrao, has been marketed as 'one of the suburbs most desirable streets'. The 550sqm block of land, which is within walking distance to the beach, 'offers plenty of scope to build you dream home (subject to council approval),' according to the real estate's advertisement. The Californian-style home, which has been listed for auction with Raine & Horne Double Bay agent Ric Serrao, has been marketed as 'one of the suburbs most desirable streets' The owners of the property - Mary, Elena and Liana Bobolas - have been the centre of controversy over the past few decades as Waverley Council and furious neighbours have battled to get them to clean up their yard. Neighbours who have have lived beside the squalid house have voiced their relief at the news the family are being evicted. The estimated price range for the property is between 1,792,720 and 2,494,373, according to RP Data. Waverley Council have set a date to demolish the garage and remove the piles of garbage that surround the house. The Bobolas have resisted all offers to connect them with support services, and adamantly defended council clean-ups in court. The owners of the property - Mary, Elena and Liana Bobolas - have been the centre of controversy over the past few decades as Waverley Council and furious neighbours have battled to get them to clean up their yard. More than 350,000 of ratepayers money has been spent in a bid to control the piles of rubbish in and outside the Bondi property. With empty glass bottles, cardboard boxes, discarded appliances and pieces of old wooden furniture piled high outside the home, it has not been lived in by its occupants for years. If Mary Bobolas and her daughters Liana and Elena can recover the debt by February 17, they will keep the house. The estimated price range for the property is between 1,792,720 and 2,494,373, according to RP Data. A ginger cat has made a home for itself among the piles of cardboard boxes and old plastic containers. The property has caused trouble for infuriated neighbours who have to deal with the stench and the sight of rubbish inexplicably piled up in every spare space outside and presumably inside this home. The council cleaned the property in mid-2014, but some neighbours said the house was as bad as they'd ever seen it, describing it as 'sickening' and 'filth'. Another woman who has lived next door to the rotting property - which has trees growing through the roof and holes in the walls - for the past 15 years said 'they haven't lived inside the house for years', and she believed there was no running water or electricity. More than 350,000 of ratepayers money has been spent in a bid to control the piles of rubbish in and outside the Bondi property. The street is one of the most expensive in Bondi, located just a kilometre from the iconic Bondi Beach.

But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable. What can I do?” We spent some time discussing what she could do, and (even though I didn’t want to take the time to do it) I asked her if she would like a mentor — me?

Mia was known for her kindness, determination, and her passion for swimming. The town boasted beautiful beaches that were frequented by people far and wide due to their picturesque beauty and gentle waves that calmed the soul. Swimming had always been a big part of Mia's life. She learned to swim at a very young age and would often spend her days exploring the many secret coves and hidden underwater gems around Marisville. Mia's parents recognized her uncanny affinity for swimming and made sure to nurture her talent by enrolling her in various swimming classes and competitions. As Mia grew older, her love for swimming continued to flourish, and soon she started dreaming of becoming a professional swimmer. One summer day, as Mia prepared herself for yet another day of practice at Marisville's beach, she had an unexpected encounter. As she was strolling along the shoreline, a stunning seashell caught her eye. Unlike the other shells she had collected over the years, this one was particularly beautiful. Its spiral shape and iridescent colors seemed to shimmer and dance under the sunlight, leaving Mia absolutely mesmerized. Feeling a sense of deep connection with the seashell, Mia picked it up and decided to take it home. She felt this was more than an ordinary seashell; it felt almost as though it was destined to be with her for a purpose. She carefully placed the shell in her bag and continued her walk to the beach. Later that day, as Mia returned to her cozy little cottage after rigorous swimming practice, she decided to place the seashell on her bookshelf where her other prized trinkets resided. As days turned into weeks and weeks to months, Mia found herself more and more drawn to the shell. It became her constant companion, lending her a sense of comfort and solace that she had never experienced before with any other object. One day, Mia had the sudden urge to take the seashell with her to the beach. At first, she couldn't quite understand why she felt this way, but the pull of the seashell was simply too strong to ignore. Carrying the seashell in her hand, Mia felt its energy guiding her towards a part of the beach she had never explored before. As she approached a hidden alcove, she noticed a pod of dolphins swimming gracefully in the distance. Their playful demeanor and harmonious movements captivated Mia's heart. To her astonishment, the dolphins seemed to be moving in tandem with the waves, creating heavenly symphony of water and life. That was when it hit her - the seashell was not just a beautiful piece of nature's art but a talisman meant to guide her towards her true destiny. Filled with renewed determination, Mia decided to pursue a new path - a path that would combine her love for swimming and the ocean's magical allure. She began training in synchronizing her swimming with the natural rhythms and patterns of the sea and its creatures. Through persistent practice and dedication, Mia eventually developed a unique swimming technique that seemed almost otherworldly in its beauty. Mia's newfound talent caught the attention of the world-renowned synchronized swimming team, The Oceanic Seraphs. Following an awe-inspiring audition, Mia was invited to join their ranks. Thrilled and honored to be part of such an elite group, she felt a profound connection between the mysterious seashell and her newfound success. Embracing her destiny and stepping into a world she had never dreamed possible, Mia became a prominent figure in the world of aquatic sports. She quickly gained recognition and prestige for her unique talents, enchanting audiences wherever she went.

Answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House. The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports. But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office. Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers. \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded. \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added. The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea. Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\" Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs.

After a few years of peace, the Ottoman Empire attacked the Habsburg Empire again. The Turks almost captured the Empire's capital of Vienna, but king of Poland John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna, which shook the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , joined by the Venetian Republic and Poland in 1684 and the Tsardom of Russia in 1686. Ottomans suffered two decisive defeats against the Holy Roman Empire: the second Battle of Mohács in 1687 and the Battle of Zenta a decade later, in 1697. On the smaller Polish front, after the battles of 1683 , Sobieski, after his proposal for the League to state a major coordinated offensive, undertook a rather unsuccessful offensive in Moldavia in 1686, with the Ottomans refusing a major engagement and harassing the army. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldavia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories. The last battle of the campaign was the Battle of Podhajce in 1698, where Polish hetman Feliks Kazimierz Potocki defeated the Ottoman incursion into the Commonwealth. The League won the war in 1699 and forced the Ottoman Empire to sign the Treaty of Karlowitz. The Ottomans lost much of their European possessions, with Podolia returned to Poland.

Ahmed Dogan, leader of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) was unharmed and the unidentified man was wrestled to the ground by security guards. The incident happened on Saturday at a party congress in the capital Sofia. Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said the attacker, himself an ethnic Turk, tried to fire two shots but \\"most likely the gun misfired\\". Early reports suggested the weapon was a gun, but it was later confirmed to be a gas pistol - a non-lethal weapon used largely for self-defence which does not fire bullets but which can cause serious injuries if fired from close range. Mr Tsetanov also said the assailant had a criminal record for drugs possession, robberies and hooliganism. Police arrested the attacker, a 25-year-old from the Black Sea town of Burgas, who was also carrying two knives. The liberal MRF party represents ethnic Turks and other Muslims, who make up about 12% of Bulgaria's population of about seven million. Mr Dogan, 58, has led the party for almost 25 years. He returned to the party conference a few hours after the attack and was given a standing ovation. President Rosen Plevneliev said in a statement: \\"Bulgarian society is traditionally known for its tolerance, mutual acceptance and respect between different ethnic groups and religions. \\"Such an act is unacceptable in a democratic state.\\" Attacks on politicians are rare in Bulgaria, but in 1996, former Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov was found shot dead near his home in Sofia. ||||| Gas-pistol attack on Bulgaria politician fails SOFIA — A Bulgarian ethnic party leader emerged unharmed after a dramatic attack by a man armed with a gas pistol, who pointed the weapon at his head after rushing to the stage during a televised political speech. Veteran Turkish minority party leader Ahmed Dogan was addressing delegates of his Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) party on Saturday when the young attacker, dressed in black, pulled out the non-lethal weapon and pointed it at his head, video footage showed. Visibly stunned at first, Dogan then flung the attacker's arm away before a shot could be fired. The man tried to point the gun once again but it \\"seems to have been misfired\\", said Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov. Both men fell to the ground in the ensuing scuffle. A handful of conference delegates rushed to the stage and severely kicked the assailant. Television footage showed the man's bloodied face as police dragged him away. He was later identified as a 25-year-old ethnic Turk from the eastern city of Burgas, who already had a police record for drugs, robberies and hooliganism. The man had two knives as well as the gas pistol, police chief Valery Yordanov said. Experts who later examined the gun confirmed that it was non-lethal. The three bullets loaded in it could not have threatened Dogan's life even if properly fired, Yordanov said, adding that the man would likely face a charge of grave hooliganism rather than attempted manslaughter. Gas pistols are mainly used for self defence and fire tear gas cartridges. Dogan reappeared in the hall several hours later to a standing ovation from several thousand delegates. He announced his resignation, which had been widely expected at his party's national conference in Sofia regardless of the attack. \\"This time my decision is categorical!\\" Dogan said, proposing that his deputy Lyutvi Mestan replace him as head of the MRF party. Dogan, 58, has led the MRF since its formation 23 years ago. Backed mainly by Bulgaria's 10 percent ethnic Turk minority, the controversial veteran politician has played a key role in Bulgaria's post-communist transition. Dogan's ability to control his voters ensured the liberal MRF's participation in two successive coalition governments between 2001 and 2009. The MRF is now in opposition to the right-wing government of Prime Minister Boyko Borisov. Dogan's interrupted address, read out later in his presence by another MRF member, claimed that a recent \\"demonisation\\" of his image was detrimental to the party ahead of general elections in July. He urged delegates to support Mestan's candidacy and to make \\"a common effort to change public opinion about the MRF and its leader\\". Dogan lashed out at the premier, accusing him of seeking to \\"replace democracy with dictatorship\\" by stifling the market economy and controlling the media. Dogan has prided himself for his role in maintaining Bulgaria's ethnic peace while ethnic conflicts raged in the country's Balkan neighbours in the 1990s. The Turkish minority, which was subjected to drastic assimilation policies under communism, won key rights under his leadership including free religious expression, political representation in parliament, Turkish classes in schools and Turkish-language news broadcasts on state television. Dogan's political versatility and diverse coalitions with conservatives, liberals and socialists (ex-communists) over the years however attracted criticism from all sides, mostly for his authoritarian ways, political arrogance and alleged corruption. Revelations that he had collaborated with the communist police before turning against the political regime and being imprisoned in 1985 also alienated many of his supporters. Copyright © 2013 AFP.

Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Possible answers: [+] negative [+] positive TEXT:People tried to make me believe that the premise of this rubbishy supernatural horror/thriller was inspired by the actual last words spoken by an authentic serial killer (whose name escapes me at the moment). Whilst awaiting his execution in the electric chair, he claimed that his soul would return to life and continue to go on a never-ending murder spree. It's not a highly original idea to revolve a horror film on, by the way. Other low-budget turkeys implemented the exact same basic premise, like \\"House 3\\", \\"Shocker\\" and \\"Ghost in the Machine\\". Anyway, \\"The First Power\\" (a.k.a \\"Pentagram\\") isn't a completely terrible effort, but the script overly reverts to clichés and lacks genuine thrills. The film starts off as an okay, albeit mundane serial killer flick in which obsessive cop-hero Lou Diamond Philips pursues a maniac who carves bloody pentagrams into the chests of his victims. He receives unexpected help from a spiritual medium, played by the gorgeous and underrated Tracy Griffith. She leads him to the killer but also begs not to execute him, as that would result in an even bigger catastrophe! Thanks to Tess' helpful hints, Detective Logan quickly captures the killer and celebrates his death penalty, but Patrick Channing made a pact with Satan Himself and returns to the rotten streets of California to do some more killing. \\"The First Power\\" gets pretty bad once the murderer reincarnates as a vengeful spirit. Instead of using his newly gained satanic powers to wipe out the entire world (that's what I would do in his position), Channing simply prefers to play cat and mouse games with his nemesis the copper. He annoyingly calls him \\"Buddy-Boy\\" all the time and possesses the bodies of Logan's friends and colleagues in order to trick him. Even though never really boring or poorly realized, it's a very weak film to endure, mostly because you constantly get the feeling of déjà-vu. Writer/director Robert Resnikoff shamelessly uses every dreadful cliché (the killer got sexually abused as a child) and even the players' lines can easily be predicted. As soon as Griffith explains she's able to predict the future, you just know that, somewhere at some point in the film, she's going to say the ridiculously overused line \\"I tell people who to live their lives, but my own life is a mess\\". Yawn. Lou Diamond Philips' performance is adequate enough, but it's rather difficult to take that youthful rebel of \\"La Bamba\\" and \\"Stand And Deliver\\" serious as a tough copper. There also are decent supportive roles for Mykelti Williamson (\\"Forrest Gump\\"), Carmen Argenziano (\\"When a Stranger Calls\\") and B-movie horror legend David Gale (\\"Re-Animator\\") appears in a minuscule cameo at the very beginning of the film.","completion":"The sentiment of the given text can be classified as negative.

Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process is conception, which involves the fertilization of an egg by a sperm. Conception typically occurs during the fertile window of a woman's menstrual cycle, when the egg is released from the ovary during ovulation and is available to be fertilized by sperm. The sperm reaches the egg by swimming through the woman's reproductive tract, after being deposited in the vagina during sexual intercourse or other assisted reproductive techniques such as intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF). When a sperm penetrates the outer layer of the egg, it triggers a series of chemical reactions that prevent other sperm from entering the egg. This fusion of sperm and egg creates a single-celled entity known as a zygote, which contains a complete set of genetic information (23 pairs of chromosomes) from both the mother and the father. The zygote then begins to divide and multiply, creating an early-stage embryo known as a blastocyst. This process, called cleavage, takes place as the zygote travels down the fallopian tube towards the uterus. Once it reaches the uterus, the blastocyst embeds itself into the uterine lining in a process called implantation, which establishes the connection between the developing embryo and the mother's blood supply for nourishment and waste removal. As the embryo develops, it forms layers of cells that will give rise to the different tissues and organs of the body. During the first 8-10 weeks of pregnancy, the embryo undergoes a period of rapid growth and differentiation, which is a crucial time for the formation of essential structures such as the brain, spinal cord, and heart. From this point onwards, the developing organism is referred to as a fetus. Throughout the remainder of pregnancy, which lasts approximately 40 weeks from the first day of the woman's last menstrual period, the fetus continues to grow and mature. By the end of the second trimester, the fetus has developed most of its organs and systems, and it begins to gain weight rapidly in the third trimester as it prepares for life outside the womb. When the fetus is fully developed, and the mother's body is ready for childbirth, labor contractions begin. These contractions help to dilate the cervix, allowing the baby to pass through the birth canal and into the world. The process of childbirth can vary in duration and intensity but ultimately results in the birth of a new human being. As the baby grows, it develops physically, mentally, and emotionally, eventually reaching adulthood. The adult human then has the ability to reproduce and continue the human life cycle by mating with another adult. This ongoing cycle of conception, development, birth, growth, and reproduction ensures the survival and continuation of the human species."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Given the following context: The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H.

Close to battlefields, those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the American Battle Monuments Commission, the German War Graves Commission, and Le Souvenir français. Many of these graveyards also have central monuments to the missing or unidentified dead, such as the Menin Gate memorial and the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme. In 1915 John McCrae, a Canadian army doctor, wrote the poem In Flanders Fields as a salute to those who perished in the Great War. Published in Punch on 8 December 1915, it is still recited today, especially on Remembrance Day and Memorial Day. National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, is a memorial dedicated to all Americans who served in World War I. The Liberty Memorial was dedicated on 1 November 1921, when the supreme Allied commanders spoke to a crowd of more than 100,000 people. The UK Government has budgeted substantial resources to the commemoration of the war during the period 2014 to 2018. The lead body is the Imperial War Museum. On 3 August 2014, French President Francois Hollande and German President Joachim Gauck together marked the centenary of Germany's declaration of war on France by laying the first stone of a memorial in Vieil Armand, known in German as Hartmannswillerkopf, for French and German soldiers killed in the war.

Many of you who have listened to Stuart on Bad Voltage, seen him speak, worked with him, or socialized with him will know him for his larger than life personality. He is funny, warm, and passionate about his family, friends, and technology. He is opinionated, and many of you will know him for the amusing, insightful, and tremendously articulate way in which he expresses his views. He is remarkably talented and has an incredible level of insight and perspective. He is not just a brilliant programmer and software architect, but he has a deft knowledge and understanding of people, how they work together, and the driving forces behind human interaction. What I have always admired is that while bombastic in his views, he is always open to fresh ideas and new perspectives. For him life is a journey and new ways of looking at the road are truly thrilling for him. As I have grown as a person in my career, with my family, and particularly when moving to America, he has always supported yet challenged me. He is one of those rare friends that can enthusiastically validate great steps forward yet, with the same enthusiasm, illustrate mistakes too.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Eye contact is important when you are listening. If you give your friend the impression you aren't interested and are distracted, they may never open up to you again. When it comes to being a good listener, it’s important for you to have eye contact with the other person. When someone is talking to you, focus directly on their eyes so that they will know with certainty that you are absorbing every single word. Even if the topic is not interesting to you, at least respect and truly listen to what the speaker has to say. Don't stare off in space. Focus your eyes, ears and your thoughts only on him/her and become a good listener. Don't concentrate on thinking about what you will say next, but instead, focus fully on what the other person is saying. (Remember that it's about the person, not you.) If you want to be a good listener, then it's important for you to create a conducive physical and mental space. Remove all distractions and confer all of your attention to the person who has something to say to you. Turn off communication devices (including cell phones) and arrange to talk in a place with no distractions. Once you are face-to-face, quiet your mind and pay attention to what the other person is telling.Show them that you are helpful. Pick a place that is free of distractions or other people who might grab your attention. If you go to a coffee shop, make sure you're focused on the person who is speaking, not the interesting characters who walk in and out of the door. If you're talking in a public place like a restaurant or a cafe, avoid sitting near a television that's on. Even if you're determined to give the person all of your attention, it can be tempting to take a quick look at the television, especially if your favorite team is playing. Nodding your head will indicate that you understand what the speaker is saying, and will encourage them to continue. Adopting body postures, positions and movements that are similar to the speaker (mirroring) will enable the speaker to relax and open up more. Try looking straight into their eyes. Not only does this show you are listening, but it shows you take real interest in what they are saying. Another way to have encouraging body language is to turn your body toward the speaker. If you're turned away from the speaker, then it may look like you're itching to leave. If you cross your legs, for example, cross your leg toward the speaker instead of away. Don't cross your arms over your chest, either. This will make you appear standoffish or skeptical even if you don't actually feel that way. Active listening involves the entire body and face — both yours and that of the speaker. You can be quiet while still making it clear that you are hanging on to every word that the speaker is telling you. Here's how you can make the most of the situation by being an active listener: Your words: Though you don't have to say, \\"Mmhmm,\\" \\"I see,\\" or \\"Right,\\" every five seconds or it will begin to get annoying, you can throw in an encouraging phrase here and there to show that you're paying attention.If that person whom you are talking to really means something to you,then you will surely pay attention and help them sort out their problem if there is any. Your expression: Look interested and meet the gaze of the speaker from time to time. Do not overwhelm the speaker by staring intently, but do reflect friendliness and openness to what you are listening to. Read between the lines: Always be alert for things that have been left unsaid and for cues that can help you gauge the speaker's true feelings. Watch the facial and body expressions of the \\"teller\\" to try to gather all information you can, not just from the words. Imagine what kind of state of mind would have made you acquire such expressions, body language and volume. Speak at approximately the same energy level as the other person. This way, they will know that the message is getting through and that there is no need to repeat. Be patient and willing to just listen, without giving any advice. Try to repeat what the other person is saying to confirm the exact meaning. Sometimes words can mean two different things. The best way to confirm and avoid misunderstanding between the conversationalists is to repeat what the other person is saying so that the other person knows you were listening and both of you have the same idea. Consider their circumstances. If they are a sensitive person, don't give them \\"tough love.\\" Summary:","completion":"To be a good listener, make eye contact, pay attention, and show that you care by nodding and using encouraging body language in a distraction-free environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An office established in 1900 and modified in 1907, the mayor of Honolulu is elected by universal suffrage of residents of Honolulu to no more than two four-year terms. The mayor of Honolulu is one of only two officers elected countywide; the other is the prosecuting attorney. The Mayor of Honolulu is the successor of the Royal Governors of Oahu of the Kingdom of Hawaii. - The Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii, concurrently the Secretary of State of Hawaii, is the assistant chief executive of that U.S. state and its various agencies and departments, as provided in the Hawaii State Constitution Article V, Sections 2 though 6. The Lieutenant Governor is elected by popular suffrage of residents of the state on the same ticket as the Governor of Hawaii. The Lieutenant Governor becomes acting Governor upon the absence of the Governor from the state, or if the Governor becomes disabled from duty. Historically, Lieutenant Governors were members of either the Hawaii Democratic Party or Hawaii Republican Party. - The Governor of Hawaii is the chief executive of the state of Hawaii and its various agencies and departments, as provided in the Hawaii State Constitution Article V, Sections 1 through 6. It is a directly elected position, votes being cast by popular suffrage of residents of the state. The governor is responsible for enforcing laws passed by the Hawaii State Legislature and upholding rulings of the Hawaii State Judiciary. The role includes being commander-in-chief of the armed forces of Hawaii and having the power to use those forces to execute laws, suppress insurrection and violence and repel invasion. The Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii becomes acting governor upon the governor's absence from the state or if the governor is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office. Historically, the Governor of Hawaii has been from either the Democratic Party of Hawaii or Hawaii Republican Party. - Hawaii is the 50th and most recent state to have joined the United States of America, having received statehood on August 21, 1959. Hawaii is the only U.S. state located in Oceania and the only one composed entirely of islands. It is the northernmost island group in Polynesia, occupying most of an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean.

Along with the rest of the Hawaiian Islands, Oahu is one of the largest and northernmost islands of Polynesia. - The concept of universal suffrage, also known as general suffrage or common suffrage, consists of the right to vote of all except a small number of adult citizens (or subjects). As minors are generally excluded, the concept is frequently described as \\"universal adult suffrage\\". Many countries make an exception for small numbers of adults that are considered mentally incapable of voting. Other countries also exclude people convicted of serious crimes or people in jail, but this is considered a violation of a basic human right in an increasing number of countries. In some countries, including the United States, it is very difficult and expensive for convicted criminals to regain this right even after having served their jail sentence. In any case, where universal suffrage exists, the right to vote is not restricted by race, sex, belief, wealth, or social status. - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish.

Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely. After reading the above, is \\"A change in Sudanese regime and less support for Bin Laden\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What was the assassination of President Hosni Mubarak a tipping point for?\\"?","completion":"Yes, for a five-year-old: the assassination attempt on President Hosni Mubarak was a tipping point for a change in the Sudanese regime and less support for Bin Laden.

Given the background: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. and the situation: A team of scientists studied two groups of mice. Group C was exposed to carcinogens, while group N was not. Answer the following question: Which group of mice had more cells to divide out of control?","completion":"Given the background information and the situation, we can analyze the two groups of mice to determine which group had more cells dividing out of control. Step 1: Identify the groups exposed to carcinogens and not exposed to carcinogens. - Group C: Exposed to carcinogens - Group N: Not exposed to carcinogens Step 2: Understand the impact of carcinogens - From the background information, carcinogens can cause cancer by leading to mutations in the genes that control the cell cycle. Step 3: Determine the group more likely to have uncontrolled cell division - Since carcinogens can cause mutations that lead to uncontrolled cell division, Group C (exposed to carcinogens) would be more likely to have the cells dividing out of control. Justification: Based on the information provided, Group C, which was exposed to carcinogens, had a higher likelihood of mutations occurring in their genes that control the cell cycle. Because of this, Group C would likely have more cells dividing out of control compared to Group N, which was not exposed to carcinogens."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Information: - Central Italy (or just ) is one of the five official statistical regions of Italy used by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), a first level NUTS region and a European Parliament constituency. - The Holy Roman Emperor (historically \\"\\" \\"Emperor of the Romans\\") was the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. From an autocracy in Carolingian times the title evolved into an elected monarchy chosen by the Prince-electors. Until the Reformation the Emperor elect (\\"imperator electus\\") was required to be crowned by the Pope before assuming the imperial title. - Florence is the capital city of the Italian region of Tuscany and of the Metropolitan City of Florence. It is the most populous city in Tuscany, with 383,083 inhabitants, expanding to over 1,520,000 in the metropolitan area. - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of... - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water. - Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945.

Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union. - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions. - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.

The treaty followed the earlier Treaty of Utrecht of 11 April 1713, which ended hostilities between France and Spain, on the one hand, and Britain and the Dutch Republic, on the other hand. A third treaty at Baden was required to end the hostilities between France and the Holy Roman Empire. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history.

Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\". - Tervuren is a municipality in the province of Flemish Brabant, in Flanders, Belgium.

The treaty followed the armistice of Leoben (18 April 1797), which had been forced on the Habsburgs by Napoleon's victorious campaign in Italy. It definitively ended the War of the First Coalition and left Great Britain fighting alone against revolutionary France. - French Guiana (pronounced or ), officially called Guiana, is an overseas department and region of France, located on the north Atlantic coast of South America in the Guyanas.

The dynastic capital was Vienna, except from 1583 to 1611, when it was moved to Prague. From 1804 to 1867 the Habsburg Monarchy was formally unified as the Austrian Empire, and from 1867 to 1918 as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean.

The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs between 1438 and 1740. The house also produced emperors and kings of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Kingdom of England (\\"Jure uxoris\\" King), Kingdom of France (Queen consort), Kingdom of Germany, Kingdom of Hungary, Kingdom of Croatia, Second Mexican Empire, Kingdom of Ireland (\\"Jure uxoris\\" King), Kingdom of Portugal, and Habsburg Spain, as well as rulers of several Dutch and Italian principalities. From the sixteenth century, following the reign of Charles V, the dynasty was split between its Austrian and Spanish branches. Although they ruled distinct territories, they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried. - The Southern Netherlands, also called the Catholic Netherlands, was the part of the Low Countries largely controlled by Spain (15561714), later Austria (171494), and occupied then annexed by France (17941814). The region also included a number of smaller states that were never ruled by Spain or Austria: the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, the Imperial Abbey of Stavelot-Malmedy, the County of Bouillon, the County of Horne and the Princely Abbey of Thorn. The Southern Netherlands were part of the Holy Roman Empire until the whole area was annexed by Revolutionary France. - The prince-electors (or simply electors) of the Holy Roman Empire ((), pl. \\"Kurfürsten\\", ) were the members of the electoral college of the Holy Roman Empire. - Annexation (Latin \\"ad\\", to, and \\"nexus\\", joining) is the political transition of land from the control of one entity to another. It is also the incorporation of unclaimed land into a state's sovereignty, which is in most cases legitimate. In international law it is the forcible transition of one state's territory by another state or the legal process by which a city acquires land. Usually, it is implied that the territory and population being annexed is the smaller, more peripheral, and weaker of the two merging entities, barring physical size. It can also imply a certain measure of coercion, expansionism or unilateralism on the part of the stronger of the merging entities. Because of this, more positive euphemisms like political union/unification or reunification are sometimes seen in discourse. Annexation differs from cession and amalgamation, because unlike cession where territory is given or sold through treaty, or amalgamation (where the authorities of both sides are asked if they agree with the merge), annexation is a unilateral act where territory is seized and held by one state and legitimized via general recognition by the other international bodies (i.e. countries and intergovernmental organisations). During World War II, the use of annexation deprived whole populations of the safeguards provided by international laws governing military occupations. The authors of the Fourth Geneva Convention made a point of \\"giving these rules an absolute character\\", thus making it much more difficult for a state to bypass international law through the use of annexation. - Central Europe lies between Eastern Europe and Western Europe. The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity. Central Europe is going through a phase of \\"strategic awakening\\", with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope or V4.

Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. - MILAN (\\"milan(e)\\" is French for kite) is a European anti-tank guided missile. Design of the MILAN started in 1962, it was ready for trials in 1971, and was accepted for service in 1972. It is a wire guided SACLOS (semi-automatic command to line-of-sight) missile, which means the sight of the launch unit has to be aimed at the target to guide the missile. The MILAN can be equipped with a MIRA or MILIS thermal sight to give it night-firing ability. - Lunéville (; German, obsolete: ) is a commune in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department in France. - Parma is a city in the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna famous for its prosciutto (ham), cheese, architecture, music and surrounding countryside. It is home to the University of Parma, one of the oldest universities in the world. Parma is divided into two parts by the stream of the same name. The district on the far side of the river is \\"Oltretorrente\\". Parma's Etruscan name was adapted by Romans to describe the round shield called \\"Parma\\". - An autocracy is a system of government in which supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d'état or mass insurrection). Absolute monarchy (such as Saudi Arabia) and dictatorship (such as North Korea) are the main historical forms of autocracy. In very early times, the term \\"autocrat\\" was coined as a favorable feature of the ruler, having some connection to the concept of \\"lack of conflicts of interests\\". - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits. The city is both a commune and department, and forms the centre and headquarters of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an area of and a population in 2014 of 12,005,077, comprising 18.2 percent of the population of France. - Nice (; Niçard , classical norm, or \\"\\", nonstandard, ) is the fifth most populous city in France and the capital of the Alpes-Maritimes \\"département\\". The urban area of Nice extends beyond the administrative city limits, with a population of about 1 million on an area of . Located in the French Riviera, on the south east coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea, at the foot of the Alps, Nice is the second-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast and the second-largest city in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region after Marseille. Nice is about 13 kilometres (8 miles) from the principality of Monaco, and its airport is a gateway to the principality as well. - The Prince-Bishopric of Liège was a state of the Holy Roman Empire in the Low Countries, situated for the most part in present Belgium, which was ruled by the Bishop of Liège who held an Imperial Estate and had seat and voice at the Imperial Diet. The Prince-Bishopric of Liège should not be confused with the diocese of Liège, which was larger. - Lille is a city in northern France, in French Flanders. On the Deûle River, near France's border with Belgium, it is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region and the prefecture of the Nord department. - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Francis I ( German : Franz Stefan ; Italian : Francesco Stefano ; English : Francis Stephen ; 8 December 1708 -- 18 August 1765 ) was Holy Roman Emperor and Grand Duke of Tuscany , though his wife effectively executed the real powers of those positions . With his wife , Maria Theresa , he was the founder of the Habsburg - Lorraine dynasty . From 1728 until 1737 he was Duke of Lorraine . In 1737 , Lorraine became managed by France under terms resulting from the War of the Polish Succession . Francis and the House of Lorraine received the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in the peace treaty that ended that war . After taking the throne of the Holy Roman Empire , the return of the ancestral duchy of Lorraine went nominally to his brother Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine ( who was however engaged in ruling the Austrian Netherlands ) , until succession under derivate house alliances resulted in Lorraine 's annexation to France in 1766 . - Tuscany is a region in central Italy with an area of about and a population of about 3.8 million inhabitants (2013). The regional capital is Florence (\\"Firenze\\"). - The Austrian Netherlands was the Southern Netherlands between 1714 and 1797. The period began with the acquisition of the territory by the Habsburg Monarchy under the Treaty of Rastatt in 1714 and lasted until its annexation during the aftermath of the Battle of Sprimont in 1794 and the Peace of Basel in 1795. Austria, however, did not relinquish its claim over the province until 1797 in the Treaty of Campo Formio. The Austrian Netherlands was a noncontiguous territory that consisted of what is now western Belgium as well as greater Luxembourg, bisected by the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. The dominant languages were German (including Luxembourgish), Dutch (Flemish), and French, along with Picard and Walloon. - The Kingdom of Germany or German Kingdom (\\"Teutonic Kingdom\\") developed out of the eastern half of the former Carolingian Empire. Like Anglo-Saxon England and medieval France, it began as \\"a conglomerate, an assemblage of a number of once separate and independent... \\"gentes\\" [peoples] and \\"regna\\" [kingdoms].\\" East Francia (\\"Ostfrankenreich\\") was formed by the Treaty of Verdun in 843, and was ruled by the Carolingian dynasty until 911, after which the kingship was elective. The initial electors were the rulers of the stem duchies, who generally chose one of their own. After 962, when Otto I was crowned emperor, the kingdom formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire, which also included Italy (after 951), Bohemia (after 1004) and Burgundy (after 1032). - Maria Theresa Walburga Amalia Christina (; 13 May 1717 29 November 1780) was the only female ruler of the Habsburg dominions and the last of the House of Habsburg. She was the sovereign of Austria, Hungary, Croatia, Bohemia, Transylvania, Mantua, Milan, Lodomeria and Galicia, the Austrian Netherlands and Parma. By marriage, she was Duchess of Lorraine, Grand Duchess of Tuscany and Holy Roman Empress. - Mantua (; Emilian and Latin: \\"Mantua\\") is a city and commune in Lombardy, Italy, and capital of the province of the same name. - The Peace of Basel of 1795 consists of three peace treaties involving France during the French Revolution (represented by François de Barthélemy). - Bordeaux (Gascon Occitan: \\"\\") is a port city on the Garonne River in the Gironde department in southwestern France. - The Grand Duchy of Tuscany was a central Italian monarchy that existed, with interruptions, from 1569 to 1859, replacing the Duchy of Florence. The grand duchy's capital was Florence. Tuscany was nominally a state of the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797. - The War of the Polish Succession (17331738) was a major European war sparked by a Polish civil war over the succession to Augustus II, which the other European powers widened in pursuit of their own national interests. France and Spain, the two Bourbon powers, attempted to check the power of the Austrian Habsburgs in western Europe, as did the Kingdom of Prussia; whilst Saxony and Russia mobilized to support the eventual Polish victor. The slight amount of fighting in Poland resulted in the accession of Augustus III, who in addition to Russia and Saxony, was politically supported by the Habsburgs. - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names. - The Early Middle Ages (or early medieval period) marked the start of the Middle Ages of European History, lasting from the 6th to the 10th century C.E. The Early Middle Ages followed the decline of the Western Roman Empire and preceded the High Middle Ages (c. 10th to 13th centuries). The Early Middle Ages largely overlap with Late Ant1iquity. The term \\"Late Antiquity\\" is used to emphasize elements of continuity with the Roman Empire, while \\"Early Middle Ages\\" is used to emphasize developments characteristic of the later medieval period. - An emperor (through Old French \\"empereor\\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \\"Emperor\\".

Like a fender-bender to David Cronenberg's Crash, Carlos Brooks' Quid Pro Quo is a tame, yet weird and wonderful love-letter to the walking wounded. 2. Quid Pro Quo is a respectable feature-film debut for Mr. Brooks, and it remains reasonably thought-provoking without ever becoming emotionally absorbing. 3. The first half of Quid Pro Quo is among the most jaw-dropping things I've ever seen: Who knew there was a closeted subculture of people pretending to be paraplegics? 4. A bleakly humorous romantic character study, Quid Pro Quo is appealingly offbeat until its narrative takes a wayward detour into pat simplifications. 5. A finely observed, compelling drama with the creepy tinge of a thriller. 6. Might work if it was really about what it's really about, but its too-tricky script has too many paths that lead nowhere. 7. Farmiga is captivating, Stahl less so -- although a bigger problem is writer/director Carlos Brooks's script, which sets up one story, then shifts gears into something more personal and psychologically specific. 8. It certainly won't be everyone's cup of breakfast bitters, but you can't dismiss it nonchalantly. 9.

Answer based on context: On the night of 23/24 November, about 300 men of the 15th Sikhs left Alexandria by trawler for Matruh and then to withdraw the garrison from Sollum but found that the 100-odd Egyptians from Sollum were already at Matruh, having sailed east on a coastguard ship Rasheed. The garrison at Sidi Barrani repulsed an attack late on 22 November and retreated before dawn, arriving at Matruh on 24 November; Buq Buq 100 mi west of Matruh was also abandoned, although about 134 members of the Egyptian coastguard deserted to the Senussi with their equipment and 176 camels, after which a small force of Egyptian cavalry and infantry at Matruh were sent back to the delta in disgrace. As soon as Sollum was evacuated, ships arrived full of munitions for the Senussi. By 3 December, the Matruh garrison had increased to 1,400 men and by 10 November, the Western Frontier Force had arrived with an artillery battery, two 4 in guns of the Royal Marine Artillery Heavy Battery from Alexandria and two Royal Flying Corps B.E.2c aircraft from A Flight of 14 Squadron RFC, which began operations on 5 December.

On the other hand, Beirut, the capital city of Lebanon situated along the Mediterranean coastline, boasts a mix of ancient history and modern attractions. Top tourist attractions in Beirut include: - The National Museum of Beirut: A museum showcasing a vast collection of artifacts reflecting Lebanon's rich history and cultural heritage. - Raouché Rocks: Iconic natural rock formations standing tall in the Mediterranean Sea that attract locals and tourists alike. - Roman Baths: An archaeological site featuring well-preserved ancient Roman thermal baths. - Zaitunay Bay: A modern waterfront promenade with various high-end restaurants, boutiques, and a marina for boats and yachts.

Q: Christopher Warm had a sedentary job. On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs. In his company he was known as Office Desk, because when he was working he always sat behind his well-used piece of conference table standing in a hard to notice corner in the software specialists' room. Christopher wasn't a wide person, and so his piece of conference table didn't have to be too big either, which also practically solved office space problems in the 0-1 Computer firm. It was Warm's secret that the majority of his time outside of the company, he also spent behind a desk. On his keyboard he typed various letters and numbers, which would become computer programs for the 0-1 Computer Associates company. While the Man Called Office Desk (MCOD, or simply Cod in an alternative version) was writing an intuitive program for the management of empty office desk space in software companies, a thing that nobody had ever expected to happen happened. Warm became fused with the chair. The staff at 0-1 Computer were disappointed, they had expected Cod to fuse with a desk. It would have been much more entertaining to watch, you could have laughed at him a little, and the nickname, given to him by the programmers' boss would have gotten a whole new meaning. And right now, there wasn't even much to talk about during cigarette breaks. Warm did not hide the fact he would have preferred to fuse with a mouse, or a mouse pad. Right now, all he could do was to pretend he totally ignored the fact he was physically stuck to a chair. And he was doing just fine until it was time to go to his second shift at 1-0 Computer Associates, where he had been working on a program for the management of empty space in staff lockers in telecommunications companies.

(AP) — An early morning fight between two groups of students escalated into gunfire in the parking lot outside an Arizona university dormitory, leaving one person dead and three others wounded, authorities said Friday. The suspected shooter, identified by police as 18-year-old Steven Jones, was in custody, said university police Chief JT Fowler. The parking lot where the shooting happened is just outside Mountain View Hall dormitory at the northeast side of the Flagstaff campus, said school public relations director Cindy Brown. The dorm is home to many of the campus' sororities and fraternities, according to the school's website. \\"This is not going to be a normal day at NAU,\\" said school president Rita Cheng. \\"Our hearts are heavy.\\" Student Maria Gonzalez told The Associated Press that she at first suspected firecrackers. \\"I was studying for an exam so I looked out the window and see two people running, and that's when I realized they weren't fireworks they were actually gunshots,\\" she said. The first police call about the gunfire came in at 1:20 a.m. PDT. On its website, the university said that the campus was stabilized and the campus was not on lockdown. \\"How am I supposed to feel safe where I'm learning,\\" Gonzalez said. Brown said the wounded were taken to Flagstaff Medical Center, which said it couldn't release any information on conditions. Both university and Flagstaff police are investigating. The Flagstaff shooting comes on the same day that President Barack Obama is scheduled to visit Roseburg, Oregon, where eight students and a teacher were shot and killed last week at Umpqua Community College. The gunman in the Oregon shooting wounded nine others before turning the gun on himself. NAU plays a major role in the northern Arizona city of Flagstaff.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The energy causes the fault lines give way - The earth&#x27;s plates move - The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions - The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it. The answer is:","completion":"The missing first step of the given process is the accumulation and build-up of stress and strain within the Earth's crust due to the continuous movement of tectonic plates. This movement causes friction at the plate boundaries, as the plates interact with one another either through divergent, convergent, or transform movements. Over time, this friction generates significant stress, which is stored in the rocks and minerals composing the Earth's crust. The complete and detailed process of an earthquake occurrence is as follows: 1. Accumulation of stress and strain within the Earth's crust: As tectonic plates continuously move, they interact with each other along their boundaries. This interaction creates stress due to friction as the plates attempt to slide past one another or push against each other. The rocks and minerals in the Earth's crust store this stress as strain. 2. The energy causes the fault lines to give way: Eventually, the accumulated stress exceeds the strength of the rocks and minerals within the fault lines, causing a sudden release of this stored energy. The fault lines give way, allowing the plates to move relative to one another. This sudden movement causes the energy stored within the fault to be released. 3. The Earth's plates move: Once the fault lines give way, the tectonic plates continue to be in motion. The relative plate movements can occur in various forms, such as subduction (when one plate moves beneath another), rifts (when the plates are moving apart), or strike-slip (when the plates are sliding past each other). These plate movements can be instrumental in the formation of various geological features, such as volcanoes, mountain ranges, and ocean trenches. 4. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions: When the fault lines give way, the stored energy is rapidly released, producing seismic waves. These waves radiate outwards from the fault zone in all directions, similar to the ripples formed when a stone is dropped into a still pond. 5. The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it: As seismic waves propagate through the Earth's crust and upper mantle, they cause the ground to shake. This shaking can cause a wide range of damage and effects, depending on the intensity, depth, and distance of the earthquake's epicenter relative to populated areas. Seismic waves can be categorized into two main types: body waves (which travel through the Earth's interior) and surface waves (which travel along the Earth's surface). In summary, the missing first step in the given process is the accumulation and build-up of stress and strain within the Earth's crust due to the continuous movement of tectonic plates. This initial step is crucial in understanding the formation and occurrence of earthquakes, as it sets the stage for the subsequent release of energy and the propagation of seismic waves that impact the Earth's surface and its inhabitants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In other words, you need to get p by itself on one side of the equation. Here is the given mathematical equation: 82*p + 129 + 173 = 56 First, combine like terms by adding the two numbers on the left side of the equation. 82*p + 302 = 56 Then, you can isolate the term with p in it by subtracting 302 from both sides of the equation. You do this to get the equation to a point where it looks like p = some number. 82*p = 56 - 302 Calculate the right side of the equation: 82*p = -246 Finally, to solve for p, you should divide both sides of the equation by 82, as 82 is currently being multiplied by p. By dividing, you cancel out the 82 on the left side, leaving you with p by itself. p = -246 / 82 Now solve the division: p = -3 So, the solution for the equation 82*p + 129 + 173 = 56 is p = -3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is seen donning a disguise, and he walks to a cafe where CIA officer Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) is sitting at a table outdoors. He recognizes Shaw and asks for a light. Shaw does not recognize Carlos, because of his disguise, but he turns to watch Carlos enter the cafe. He watches as Carlos detonates a grenade, killing dozens of people.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Question: How can a person ensure their jewelry is safe in a hotel room? Options: - suitcase - safe deposit box - vault - department store - hole in ground Explain why a human would choose \\"safe deposit box\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","completion":"A human would choose \\"safe deposit box\\" to answer the question above because it is the most secure and reliable option for ensuring the safety of one's jewelry in a hotel room. Here's a detailed explanation of why a safe deposit box is the best choice among the given options: 1. Suitcase: While keeping jewelry in a suitcase might make it slightly less accessible than leaving it out in the open, it lacks adequate security features to protect the valuables from theft or damage. Suitcases can be easily broken into, and they can also get lost, stolen, or damaged during travels. 2. Safe deposit box: This option is specifically designed for storing and securing valuables such as jewelry. Most hotel rooms come equipped with a safe deposit box which is usually built into the room's closet or wardrobe, providing a private, enclosed space that is only accessible through a highly secure digital or mechanical locking system. The guest has the ability to set and change the code or use the provided key to access the contents of the safe deposit box. This ensures that the jewelry will be well-protected from theft or unauthorized access. 3. Vault: A vault is another secure option for storing valuables, but it typically refers to a large, fortified room found in banks or other financial institutions. It's unlikely that hotel guests would have access to a vault within the hotel premises, so this option is not practical in this context. 4. Department store: A department store is a retail establishment that might offer jewelry storage services such as a safe deposit box or jewelry repair. However, relying on a department store for storing one's jewelry during a hotel stay is not ideal due to practical reasons, such as store hours, distance from the hotel, and the inconvenience of having to transport the jewelry to and from the store. 5. Hole in the ground: Burying jewelry in a hole in the ground is not only impractical, but it also exposes the valuables to elements such as moisture and dirt, which could potentially damage the jewelry. Moreover, it would be challenging to find a suitable and secure location within the hotel premises or nearby to do so. In conclusion, a safe deposit box is the most secure and practical option among the given choices for ensuring the safety of one's jewelry in a hotel room. It offers a specifically-designed, private, and secure space that is readily accessible to the hotel guest, providing peace of mind and protection for their valuable possessions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To highlight the similarities and differences, let's break down each sentence and analyze them. 1. The exponential map of a nilpotent Lie algebra is a diffeomorphism between the Lie algebra and the unique associated connected, simply-connected Lie group. This sentence gives us the following information: - It is talking about an exponential map, specifically for a nilpotent Lie algebra. - It states that this exponential map is a diffeomorphism, which means it is a smooth, bijective map with a smooth inverse. - The exponential map creates a diffeomorphism between the Lie algebra and its associated connected, simply-connected Lie group. This implies that there exists a unique Lie group that is connected and simply-connected, which can be associated with the given Lie algebra. 2. The unique map of an exponential Lie - Algebra is a diffeomorphism between the Lie - Algebra and the nilpotent - associated, simply associated Lie group. This sentence can be interpreted as follows: - It seems to be talking about a unique map of some exponential Lie algebra, which is not explicitly stated to be nilpotent. - It also says that this unique map is a diffeomorphism between the Lie algebra and some associated Lie group. - However, this associated Lie group is described as nilpotent and simply associated. It is not explicitly mentioned to be connected and simply-connected. In summary, while both sentences are discussing diffeomorphisms involving Lie algebras and Lie groups, they are not the same. The first sentence specifically focuses on the exponential map for nilpotent Lie algebras and their associated connected, simply-connected Lie groups. In contrast, the second sentence talks about a unique map for an unspecified type of Lie algebra, and the associated Lie group is described as nilpotent and simply associated, but not necessarily connected or simply-connected."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Mia Beers from the U.S. Agency for International Development flew to Monrovia, Liberia, in early November 2014, to lead a 40-person Ebola Disaster Assistance Response Team. Once there, she coordinated thousands of U.S. personnel from five federal agencies, who were working in four countries. The largest team worked in Liberia, while three smaller teams worked in Guinea, Mali and Sierra Leone, all willing to put themselves at risk to help with the humanitarian mission. “Mia landed on the ground and helped to create order out of chaos,” said Nancy Lindborg, former USAID assistant administrator. “She crafted the strategy into which everyone could plug.” Ebola was at its peak in Liberia in September and October of last year, with about 300 new confirmed cases a week. By December, they were down to about 30 per week. “She provided tremendous leadership during a very crucial time,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, director of USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance. “This outbreak eclipsed the deaths of all previous outbreaks put together. It was just staggering.” When the team arrived, the U.S. and international governments were looking for cases outside of Monrovia and making treatment options available, explained Beers, who was the third team leader to serve in the country. Responders set up Ebola treatment units, airlifted personal protective equipment into the region, opened a dedicated medical unit to treat Liberian and international health-care workers and staff, and worked closely with non-governmental organizations, the United Nations and national governments. One of USAID’s strengths is its knowledge of local cultural issues, such as the Liberians’ custom of washing bodies for burial, a tradition contributing to the rapid spread of the disease, according to Carol Chan, deputy director of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance. “Mia understands humanitarian policy and the concept of ‘do no harm.’ We make sure we work with the host government, being respectful of what they need,” Chan said. “We needed the A-team out there, and Mia is A-plus.” Beers and the response team helped bring case numbers down by providing training for health-care workers, deploying testing laboratories, supporting epidemiological surveillance and doing “contact tracing” to identify and diagnose individuals who might have been in close contact with infected people. It was a “whole of government effort,” Beers said. The USAID team worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Defense, the U.S. Public Health Service and the State Department. Beers coordinated their work, relying on agencies’ areas of expertise, such as DOD’s skills with logistics and construction. “It was the first time in my career we deployed in support of another federal agency,” said Maj. Gen. Volesky, Joint Force Commander of DOD’s Operation United Assistance, adding that Beers set milestones for solving the crisis and kept everyone informed. “She would define a clear end state and drive toward it.” When members of Congress, U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power and other high-level officials visited the area, “All of them said, ‘We have not seen this level of interagency cooperation in any other place we’ve been,’ ” Volesky said, adding that Beers “was a great team member as well as team leader.” Beers made frequent site visits, making sure CDC’s infectious disease expertise melded with the humanitarian response, and led U.S. efforts to provide support, guidance and funding to governments and partners in the region. With the admiral leading the U.S. Public Health Service in Liberia, Beers helped strategize on operations and policies for health-care workers. She met daily with the State Department’s country teams on response efforts, and supported information campaigns to educate vulnerable populations about prevention and treatment. Before heading to West Africa, Konyndyk described how Beers was leading interagency engagement as director of Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement in USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, laying the foundation for the Ebola response. In West Africa, she had the “opportunity to take all these interagency concepts she had been working on and leading for years and put them into place in the field when it was really crunch time,” he said. “Weaving together a range of interagency capabilities is not an easy thing to do.” According to Beers, the response was a success due to “the dedication and the passion and knowledge” of many people in her office. “That’s what really made a difference,” she said. “It was an incredible response and brought us all together in one common cause.” This article was jointly prepared by the Partnership for Public Service, a group seeking to enhance the performance of the federal government, and washingtonpost.com.

A leader in developing the mathematical basis of population genetics and evolutionary theory, he pioneered the application of techniques from molecular biology, such as gel electrophoresis, to questions of genetic variation and evolution. In a pair of seminal 1966 papers co-authored with J.L. Hubby in the journal Genetics, Lewontin helped set the stage for the modern field of molecular evolution. In 1979 he and Stephen Jay Gould introduced the term \\"spandrel\\" into evolutionary theory. Lewontin has worked in both theoretical and experimental population genetics. A hallmark of his work has been an interest in new technology. He was the first person to do a computer simulation of the behavior of a single gene locus (previous simulation work having been of models with multiple loci). In 1960 he and Ken-Ichi Kojima were the first population geneticists to give the equations for change of haplotype frequencies with interacting natural selection at two loci. This set off a wave of theoretical work on two-locus selection in the 1960s and 1970s. Their paper gave a theoretical derivation of the equilibria expected, and also investigated the dynamics of the model by computer iteration. Lewontin later introduced the D' measure of linkage disequilibrium. (He also introduced the term \\"linkage disequilibrium\\", about which many population geneticists have been unenthusiastic.) In 1966, he and Jack Hubby published a paper that revolutionized population genetics. They used protein gel electrophoresis to survey dozens of loci in the fruit fly Drosophila pseudoobscura, and reported that a large fraction of the loci were polymorphic, and that at the average locus there was about a 15% chance that the individual was heterozygous. (Harry Harris reported similar results for humans at about the same time.) Previous work with gel electrophoresis had been reports of variation in single loci and did not give any sense of how common variation was. Lewontin and Hubby's paper also discussed the possible explanation of the high levels of variability by either balancing selection or neutral mutation. Although they did not commit themselves to advocating neutrality, this was the first clear statement of the neutral theory for levels of variability within species. Lewontin and Hubby's paper had great impact--the discovery of high levels of molecular variability gave population geneticists ample material to work on, and gave them access to variation at single loci. The possible theoretical explanations of this rampant polymorphism became the focus of most population genetics work thereafter. Martin Kreitman was later to do a pioneering survey of population-level variability in DNA sequences while a Ph.D. student in Lewontin's lab.

Article:","completion":"Title: Plymouth Argyle's Promotion from League Two Delayed After Draw with Portsmouth Plymouth Argyle will have to wait a bit longer for their much-desired promotion from League Two after a recent draw against Portsmouth at the famous Fratton Park. This closely contested match has left fans and the team alike eager for victory as they continue to fight for a League One position. The highly anticipated match between Plymouth Argyle and Portsmouth did not disappoint, with both sides displaying incredible determination and skill throughout the game. The Green Army, as Plymouth Argyle is affectionately known, has had an impressive season so far, with many considering them strong contenders for promotion. At Fratton Park, Plymouth Argyle started off the match on a high note, creating opportunities and posing significant threats in the early stages of the game. The team was able to maintain possession and control the pace of the match, showcasing their undeniable talent and hunger for the win. Despite their best efforts, they were unable to capitalize on the key opportunities, with the challenge from a formidable Portsmouth side proving too strong. Portsmouth, on the other hand, were equally determined to prevent Plymouth Argyle from tasting the glory of promotion on their home turf. The hosts displayed their mettle with a strong defense and a well-coordinated offensive strategy. They eventually managed to prevent any goals from being scored in the first half, even though they found themselves on the back foot on a few occasions. The second half of the match proved to be equally intense, with both teams searching for the single goal that could serve as a potential promotion ticket. Fratton Park visitors witnessed end-to-end action on the pitch, as the players dug deep to give it their all. In the end, despite the well-orchestrated plays, the deadlock remained, with the final whistle confirming a goalless draw. This high-stakes battle leaves Plymouth Argyle still awaiting the celebration of promotion, a milestone that has eluded them for a few years now. They must now look to their remaining fixtures of the season, ensuring that they maintain the necessary amount of points to secure their passage into League One. The draw also meant that Portsmouth, who are also vying for promotion, can still hold onto their hopes of landing a spot in the higher division. The team will need to approach their upcoming matches with the same level of vigor and confidence that they showed against Plymouth Argyle. Despite the disappointment of the draw, Plymouth Argyle's players, management, and fans continue to hold their heads up high. The season has shown the players' potential and the undisputed collective effort of the entire team, with many believing that the promotion is merely delayed and not lost entirely. The challenge for Plymouth Argyle now lies in maintaining this impressive form for the rest of the season. Every match counts, and the players must continue to give their all in the pursuit of promotion from League Two. A single loss or draw could be the difference between success and heartbreak. As the thrilling chase for promotion comes down to the wire, Plymouth Argyle and their fans will look towards the next match with unwavering confidence and hope. The dream of League One status is still very much alive, and the Green Army will fight tooth and nail to make it a reality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He noted that as case B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which case would see slower movement, case A or case C? A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's look at the factors that could cause a planet's movement to appear slower from Earth. 1. Orbital period: The time it takes for a planet to complete one orbit around the Sun. Planets farther from the Sun generally have longer orbital periods. 2. Distance from Earth: The farther a planet is from Earth, the smaller the angular movement we can observe in a given time. Let's compare Case A (Mars) and Case C (Jupiter): - Mars is closer to the Sun than Jupiter, so its orbital period is shorter than Jupiter's. A shorter orbital period means Mars would travel more in a given time compared to Jupiter. - Mars is also closer to Earth than Jupiter. However, in this case, the shorter distance does not considerably speed up the apparent movement since there is still a significant distance between Mars and Earth. Taking these factors into account, the slower movement would be observed in Case C, as Jupiter is farther from the Sun with a longer orbital period, resulting in less angular movement visible from Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Customers were inside the bowling alley at the time, but no one saw the accident take place, Fairfield police said. It wasn’t until other employees paged Geiger several times and didn’t get a response that they went looking for him and found his body. \\"He was sent back for a problem with one of the lanes,\\" said Fairfield police spokesperson Doug Day. \\"He'd been back there, they tried to call him, and when he didn't answer the call they went back there and they found him.\\" The Butler County Coroner's Office ruled Geiger's death Friday as accidental traumatic asphyxia. A former co-worker, Nathan Hursell, said Geiger had been working in the bowling alley business for 30 years. \\"Dave was a stand-up guy,\\" Hursell said. \\"He knew exactly what he was doing back there. It's one of those things where you don't think twice of that happening.

Humans learn from trial and error, which isn't possible without some negative events to help to push us to be creative and innovative. Answer:","completion":"To stop ruminating, one must first understand the nature of rumination and its detrimental effects on our mental health and well-being. Rumination is the act of continuously thinking about past events, usually with a negative focus, and dwelling on what could have been done differently, leading to feelings of regret, guilt, and self-doubt. This repetitive thought process prevents us from moving forward, growing, and learning from our experiences. To put an end to ruminating, consider implementing the following strategies based on the available options above: 1. Recognize and savor everyday successes: Shift your focus from your perceived failures to the small wins and accomplishments you achieve daily. By acknowledging the positive aspects of your life, you can break the cycle of rumination and create a more optimistic outlook. Try to cultivate gratitude by maintaining a journal where you write about the things you're grateful for each day. This can assist in redirecting your attention toward the positive aspects of your life and away from rumination. 2. Reframe past experiences as learning opportunities: Instead of dwelling on past events and allowing regret to consume your thoughts, approach these experiences as necessary building blocks for personal growth. Understand that failures and mistakes help you learn, adapt, and make better decisions in the future. By seeing them as learning experiences, you can extract valuable lessons from them and use that knowledge to refine your approach and develop resilience. 3. Develop a proactive mindset: Train yourself to be more solution-focused by practicing empathy, taking risks, and considering different perspectives on a situation. When you find your thoughts spiraling into rumination, pause and ask yourself, \\"What can I do right now to improve my situation?\\" By shifting your focus to actionable steps you can take, you empower yourself to move forward and break the cycle of rumination. 4. Separate your sense of self from external events: Sometimes we may define ourselves by the outcomes of situations or the opinions of others. This can make it difficult to let go of past experiences and lead to rumination. Cultivate self-awareness and embrace the idea that you are more than your experiences. You are a constantly growing, evolving individual with the ability to learn and adapt. By detaching your sense of self from external events, you can mitigate the impact these events have on your thoughts and emotions. In summary, to stop ruminating, it's essential to redirect your thoughts to more productive, action-oriented patterns while acknowledging the inherent lessons in each experience. Embrace the opportunity for growth and personal development, and cultivate a strong sense of self-worth that is not dependent on external events. Ultimately, breaking the cycle of rumination will contribute to improved mental well-being and a more fulfilling life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question \\"Why did Sasha do this?\\", is \\"Wait for the jury to return a verdict\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"No, \\"Wait for the jury to return a verdict\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Sasha do this?\\" Here are my step-by-step justifications: 1. The question \\"Why did Sasha do this?\\" is asking for the reason or motivation behind Sasha representing herself in court and pleading her case. 2. To provide a valid answer, the response should explain why Sasha chose to represent herself and argue in court, rather than addressing the outcome or process that follows the decision. 3. \\"Wait for the jury to return a verdict\\" is a statement about the subsequent step in the legal process after Sasha has already made the decision to represent herself and has argued her case. It does not provide insight into her reasoning behind choosing this course of action. 4. A more appropriate answer could be something like \\"Sasha may have chosen to represent herself in court due to financial constraints or personal belief in her ability to argue her case effectively.\\" Therefore, \\"Wait for the jury to return a verdict\\" is not a valid answer to the question of why Sasha decided to represent herself in court and plead her case."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The answer to the question: Who did Joe Denton give a ride to? is inside the article: Joe Denton, a corrupt ex-cop, is released from jail. Six years earlier, while on the mob's payroll, Denton attacked district attorney Phil Coakley, earning him the enmity of the police and the nickname \\"slash cop\\". After finding his ex-wife has left the city with their children, he moves in with his elderly parents. Denton researches his ex-wife on the internet, eventually digging up a phone number. After briefly talking to one of his daughters, his ex-wife takes the phone and threatens to press charges if he ever contacts them again. Denton passes a bar on his way back home. Although a recovering alcoholic, he enters and orders a drink. His friend Scotty, the brother of Denton's slain partner, greets him and offers him any help he needs. A young woman asks Denton for a ride home. Denton is surprised when she reveals herself to be Coakley's daughter and intentionally bloodies herself. Cued by her cries for help, two men drag Denton from his car; Denton beats both men savagely. After Denton is questioned by the police, Coakley admits the evidence backs up his story and reluctantly asks if Denton wants to press charges. Denton declines, saying he wants to leave his history in the past, to the disgust of Coakley and Lieutenant Pleasant, who calls him a disgrace. Pleasant, revealed to also be corrupt, demands Denton kill mob boss Manny Vassey, who has found religion on his deathbed. Pleasant explains Vassey's guilty conscience may lead him to confess to Coakley. Pleasant promises to help Denton renegotiate the terms of the settlement with his ex-wife if he kills Vassey. At his house, Vassey denies the rumors. As Vassey falls asleep, Denton begins to suffocate him, only to be interrupted by Charlotte Boyd, Vassey's hospice nurse. Denton smoothly thanks her for her work and leaves the house, where he encounters Vassey's sadistic son, Junior.

The bodies of Sian Blake, 43, Zachary, eight, and Amon, four, were found at their London home on Tuesday. Police are hunting for the children's father, Arthur Simpson-Kent, who travelled to Ghana days after they were reported missing. The Ghanaian Police said their help was requested two days ago. Detectives have been sent to the Cape Coast in the south of the country - where the extended Simpson family is from - as well as to other parts of the Atlantic shoreline. In addition, police checks are in place on all of Ghana's official borders. The authorities said while there is no official immigration record of Mr Simpson-Kent leaving the country, the delay in alerting them means he may have left via the borders into Togo, Burkino Faso or the Ivory Coast. BBC correspondent Alistair Leithead who is in Ghana said while there have been some reported sightings of him, the investigation was low-key and had not been reported in newspapers nor on television. No appeal has been made for his arrest. Ms Blake and the couple's sons were not seen after 13 December but a missing persons inquiry was not launched until 16 December, when the NSPCC raised concerns about their welfare. Police attended the family's home in south-east London and spoke to Mr Simpson-Kent, but that is the last time he was seen. A search at the home uncovered three bodies in the garden on 5 January and police said significant attempts had been made to conceal them. They all died from head and neck injuries, police said.

Plot title: The Tournament Movie plot: A series of TV news reports are shown about acts of violence across the globe; gunfights, shootings, explosions, terrorist attacks, and other acts of murder, both small and larger scale. In some of these reports, the newscasters say that authorities are dismissing some of the random explosions as accidental. A voiceover by a man named Powers (Liam Cunningham) says that not everything is as it appears. Every seven years an extraordinary event takes place in an ordinary town, and every-day people won't see it or otherwise know about it... but it happens.Shirao, Brazil, seven years prior to the present. Blood drips off of a meat hook in a burning warehouse, and there is the distant sound of machine gun fire. Joshua Harlow (Ving Rhames) ducks for cover, finding his revolver empty. Off to one side, another man lies wounded, also out of ammunition. The wounded man asks Joshua, 'Don't let it be him.'Joshua checks a mobile device and sees a display with one dot in the center, and another dot rapidly approaching the centered one. Gene Walker (John Lynch), a long-haired man with an automatic rifle arrives on the scene, taunting Joshua and opening fire. He sprays the area with bullets, further wounding the wounded man. Joshua manages to hit a button that causes the meat hooks, some still with large slabs of meat on them, to begin moving, providing him some cover as he runs. A closed-circuit TV camera (CCTV) is shown in one corner of the ceiling as Joshua runs into another room; the armed man following. Walker calls Joshua a 'stain' on their 'profession' and invites him to see the only way to quit.Joshua sees a discarded shotgun near where Walker is standing. Creating a distraction, he runs, leaps and slides across the blood-slick floor as Walker hurries to load a new magazine into his rifle. Grabbing the shotgun and pressing it right up against Walker's nose and mouth, Joshua pulls the trigger and Walker's head is turned into a gory mess. On the mobile device, one of two adjacent dots on the display, disappears.Joshua... My question: Where the tournament has come?

How is \\"It is crucial that the Convention responsible for framing the text completes its work in sufficiently good time in order to be able to deliver the charter by the end of this year.\\" said in German?","completion":"Es ist entscheidend, dass das für die Ausarbeitung des Textes zuständige Gremium seine Arbeit rechtzeitig abschließt, um die Charta bis Ende dieses Jahres vorlegen zu können. Here's a detailed breakdown of the translation: - \\"It is crucial\\" is translated to \\"Es ist entscheidend\\" in German. 'Es' means 'it', 'ist' is the verb 'to be' and 'entscheidend' means 'crucial'. - \\"that the Convention\\" becomes \\"dass das Gremium\\". 'dass' is used for 'that', and 'Gremium' stands for 'convention' or 'committee' in this context. - \\"responsible for framing the text\\" translates to \\"für die Ausarbeitung des Textes zuständig\\". This breaks down to: 'für' meaning 'for', 'die Ausarbeitung' (framing), 'des Textes' means 'of the text', and 'zuständig' (responsible). - \\"completes its work in sufficiently good time\\" becomes \\"seine Arbeit rechtzeitig abschließt\\". 'seine Arbeit' means 'its work', 'rechtzeitig' indicates 'in good time' or 'in a timely manner', and 'abschließt' is 'completes'. - \\"in order to\\" translates to \\"um\\" in German. - \\"be able to deliver the charter\\" can be rendered as \\"die Charta vorlegen zu können\\". Here, 'die Charta' represents 'the charter', 'vorlegen' means 'deliver' or 'present', and 'zu können' means 'to be able to'. - \\"by the end of this year\\" translates to \\"bis Ende dieses Jahres\\". 'bis' means 'by', 'Ende' stands for 'end', 'dieses' represents 'this', and 'Jahres' is 'year'.

The first statement describes a long-haired man holding a cardboard sign stating his willingness to work and accepting any help. This situation implies the man may be seeking a job or is in need of assistance. The second statement describes a man holding a champagne glass in a club, which implies that he is in a social setting and enjoying himself. Step 2: Compare both premises. Comparing the two statements, we can identify that they are describing two distinct scenarios: one portrays a man in need of work and help, while the other shows a man enjoying himself at a club. Step 3: Evaluate if the first premise is true based on the second premise. The two premises are independent of each other and do not provide any information connecting them, meaning that neither statement can be used to determine the truth of the other.

Write a text based on this summary: liquidating lehman brothers uk may take years Text:","completion":"Once upon a time, there was a big company called Lehman Brothers UK. They were part of an even bigger family of companies from all around the world. One day, they ran into some big troubles, and now the people in charge need to figure out how to fix things. This process is called \\"liquidating.\\" You see, when a company has to close its doors, they have to take everything they own – like their toys, clothes, and furniture – and sell them. After selling these items, they use the money they got to pay back all the people they borrowed money from or owe money to. In the case of Lehman Brothers UK, this is a really big job, kind of like cleaning up your room when it's super messy! It's going to take a very long time – maybe even years – to finish cleaning up and selling everything. But it is important because it helps make sure everyone who was owed money gets paid back. So the next time you hear someone talk about \\"liquidating Lehman Brothers UK,\\" just remember, it means there is still a big mess to clean up, and everyone is working hard to make sure it's done the right way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It entered service late in the war (1944) and saw service on the Eastern and Western Fronts. The \\"Jagdpanther\\" combined the very powerful 8.8 cm KwK 43 cannon of the Tiger II and the characteristically excellent armor and suspension of the Panther chassis, although it suffered from the general poor state of German ordnance production, maintenance and training in the later part of the war, which resulted in small production numbers, shortage in spare parts and poor crew readiness. - The Pak 43 ( Panzerabwehrkanone 43 ) was a German 88 mm anti-tank gun developed by Krupp in competition with the Rheinmetall 8.8 cm Flak 41 anti-aircraft gun and used during the Second World War . The Pak 43 was the most powerful anti-tank gun of the Wehrmacht to see service in significant numbers , also serving in modified form as the 8.8 cm KwK 43 main gun on the Tiger II tank , to the open - top Nashorn , and fully enclosed , casemate - hulled Elefant and Jagdpanther tank destroyers . The improved 8.8 cm gun had a very flat trajectory out to 914 m ( 1,000 yd ) , making it easier for the gunner to hit targets at longer ranges as fewer corrections in elevation were needed . In addition to this , the gun 's exceptional penetration performance made it able to frontally penetrate any Allied tank to see service during the war at long ranges , even the Soviet IS - 2 tanks and IS chassis - based tank destroyers . The gun 's maximum firing range exceeded 13 kilometers ( 8 miles ) . - The 8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71 (Kampfwagenkanone \\"fighting vehicle cannon\\") was an 88 mm 71 calibre tank gun designed by Krupp and used by the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War. It was mounted as the primary armament on the Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausf. B \\"Tiger II\\" and the 8.8 cm PaK 43, an anti-tank gun, was very similar in design and use albeit not mounted on tanks but rather on tank destroyers or deployed on the field. - Düsseldorf (Low Franconian, Ripuarian: \\"Düsseldörp\\" ) is the capital city of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the seventh most populous city in Germany. Düsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs. The city is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe Düsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. - Nashorn (German \\"rhinoceros\\", pronounced [nashn]), initially known as Hornisse (German \\"hornet\\"), was a German tank destroyer of World War II. It was developed as an interim solution in 1942 by equipping a light turretless chassis with the Pak 43 heavy anti-tank gun. Though only lightly armoured and displaying a high profile, it could frontally penetrate any Allied tank at long range, and its relatively low cost and superior mobility to heavier vehicles ensured it remained in production until the war's end. - Hornets (insects in the genera Vespa and Provespa) are the largest of the eusocial wasps, and are similar in appearance to their close relatives yellow jackets. Some species can reach up to in length. They are distinguished from other vespine wasps by the relatively large top margin of the head and by the rounded segment of the abdomen just behind the waist. Worldwide, there are 22 recognized species of \\"Vespa\\", and three species of \\"Provespa\\", which are unique amongst hornets in being nocturnal. Most species only occur in the tropics of Asia, though the European hornet (\\"Vespa crabro\\"), is widely distributed throughout Europe, Russia, North America and Northeast Asia. Wasps native to North America in the genus \\"Dolichovespula\\" are commonly referred to as hornets (e.g. baldfaced hornets), but are actually yellowjackets. - Essen (Latin: \\"Assindia\\") is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Its population of approximately 589,000 makes it the ninth-largest city in Germany. It is the central city of the northern (Ruhr) part of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan area and seat to several of the region's authorities. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - The Kriegsmarine (\\"War Navy\\") was the navy of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945. It superseded the \\"Kaiserliche Marine\\" (German Imperial Navy) of World War I and the inter-war \\"Reichsmarine\\". The \\"Kriegsmarine\\" was one of three official branchesalong with the \\"Heer (Army)\\" and the \\"Luftwaffe (Air Force)\\"of the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of Nazi Germany. - Friedrich Carl Krupp (Essen, 17 July 1787 Essen, 8 October 1826) was a German steel manufacturer and founder of the Krupp family commercial empire that is now subsumed into ThyssenKrupp AG. - The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted. - The Treaty of Versailles was the most important of the peace treaties that brought World War I to an end. The Treaty ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The other Central Powers on the German side of World War I signed separate treaties. Although the armistice, signed on 11 November 1918, ended the actual fighting, it took six months of Allied negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. The treaty was registered by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on 21 October 1919. - Rheinmetall AG is an automotive parts supplier and military technology group headquartered in Düsseldorf. In fiscal 2015 (2014), the company's 20,676 (20,166) employees generated sales of €5.18 billion (€4.68 billion). Rheinmetall was the tenth-largest European defence contractor in 2011. - U-boat is the anglicised version of the German word U-Boot , a shortening of Unterseeboot, literally \\"undersea boat\\". While the German term refers to any submarine, the English one (in common with several other languages) refers specifically to military submarines operated by Germany, particularly in the First and Second World Wars. Although at times they were efficient fleet weapons against enemy naval warships, they were most effectively used in an economic warfare role (commerce raiding), enforcing a naval blockade against enemy shipping. The primary targets of the U-boat campaigns in both wars were the merchant convoys bringing supplies from Canada, the British Empire, and the United States to the United Kingdom and (during the Second World War) to the Soviet Union and the Allied territories in the Mediterranean. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The Elefant (German for \\"elephant\\") was a heavy tank destroyer used by German Wehrmacht Panzerjäger during World War II. It was built in small numbers in 1943 under the name Ferdinand after its designer Ferdinand Porsche, using tank hulls that had been produced for the Tiger I tank requirement which was rejected in favour of a Henschel design. - Ferdinand Porsche (3 September 1875 30 January 1951) was an automotive engineer and founder of the Porsche car company. He is best known for creating the first gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle (Lohner-Porsche), the Volkswagen Beetle, the Mercedes-Benz SS/SSK, several other important developments and Porsche automobiles. In addition, Porsche designed the 1923 Benz Tropfenwagen, which was the first racing car with a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. - The Krupp family (see pronunciation), a prominent 400-year-old German dynasty from Essen, have become famous for their production of steel, artillery, ammunition, and other armaments. The family business, known as Friedrich Krupp AG, was the largest company in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. It was important to weapons development and production in both world wars. One of the most powerful dynasties in European history, for 400 years Krupp flourished as the premier weapons manufacturer for Germany. From the Thirty Years' War until the end of the Second World War, they produced everything from battleships, U-boats, tanks, howitzers, guns, utilities, and hundreds of other commodities. - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force.

If elected, Park -- the first woman ever nominated by the party, and the daughter of the country's former dictator -- would become the country's first-ever female president. Park won the support of her party running on a campaign of creating \\"a country where no one is left behind.\\" Park has said she will focus on welfare policies if she is elected in December and will engage with North Korea if Pyongyang abandons its nuclear weapons program. Park hopes to unite a country that the legacy of her father, the late Park Chung-hee, still divides. The military dictator who went on to win elections was behind the rapid economic growth of South Korea during the 1960s, following the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to1953 and devastated the peninsula. Supporters say he economically transformed the country, but critics say he disregarded democracy to do so and committed human rights abuses. Under pressure from the Kennedy administration in the United States, Park re-established civilian rule and was elected in a national referendum in 1963, and easily re-elected in 1967, former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Donald Gregg noted in a 1999 Time article. Park \\"had a hard time beating Kim Dae-jung in 1971. The validity of Park's narrow election victory is still questioned. In 1972, fearing Kim's political potency, Park changed the election system, allowing indirect voting that could be controlled by the incumbent. In 1972 and again in 1978 he was easily elected for six-year terms,\\" wrote Gregg, who had served as ambassador from 1989 to 1993. Park was assassinated by his security chief in 1979. Park Geun-hye lost to the current president, Lee Myung-bak, in the party's last primary in 2007. Lee can only serve one term under South Korean law. CNN's Judy Kwon and Josh Levs contributed to this report.

As I sat parked at the old service station, I pulled out the maps and tried to do a little backtracking. It didn't take me long to figure out where I had made the wrong turn. I had tried following my memory instead of Luna's directions and wound up about eighty miles off course. My gas tank was pushing 'E' but fortunately the service station was open. When I stepped out of my Jeep, I could feel the soles of my boots melt on the asphalt. The heat coming off the cracked and pitted cement peeled off in waves that rolled out in every endless direction. The barren mountains in the distance looked unstable, like I was looking at them through a window pane slicked with olive oil. I slogged my way over to the gas pump and wrapped my shirt around the handle to keep my skin from burning against the desert-baked metal. The heat was so great I worried the fumes would ignite. A dirty round man stood in the shadowy doorway of the ramshackle service station and stared at me while he rubbed his hands inside an oily red rag. The oval name-patch stitched to his coveralls was loose at one end and curled like a leaf in the heat. His name was Jack.

A variety of games for the FDS were released by Nintendo (including some like Super Mario Bros. which had already been released on cartridge) and third party companies such as Konami and Taito. A few unlicensed titles were made as well. However, its limitations became quickly apparent as larger ROM chips were introduced, allowing cartridges with greater than 128k of space. More advanced memory management chips (MMC) soon appeared and the FDS quickly became obsolete. Nintendo also charged developers considerable amounts of money to produce FDS games, and many refused to develop for it, instead continuing to make cartridge titles. Many FDS disks have no dust covers (except in some unlicensed and bootleg variants) and are easily prone to getting dirt on the media. In addition, the drive use a belt which breaks frequently and requires invasive replacement.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: Can Andrew M. Cuomo breathe a little easier? Just one day after a poll showed his Republican opponent, Carl P. Paladino, with surprising strength in a one-to-one matchup, a new survey from a different polling organization showed Mr. Cuomo with a far wider margin. The new poll (pdf), issued by the Siena Research Institute, showed Mr. Cuomo leading Mr. Paladino by 57 percent to 24 percent, with Rick A. Lazio, who lost the Republican primary but remains in the race on the Conservative Party line, earning 8 percent. Mr. Cuomo’s favorable rating was 60 percent and Mr. Paladino’s 32 percent — while Mr. Paladino’s unfavorable rating was 36 percent. The new poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. The two polls were different in significant ways. While Wednesday’s poll, released by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, screened out voters that Quinnipiac judged as unlikely to vote in November, Siena surveyed a sample of all registered voters. And the Quinnipiac survey did not include Mr. Lazio in its general election matchup. Still, while the new poll shows Mr. Paladino much further behind, it does show him with momentum. “The good news for Paladino is that since last month, he has picked up 10 points against Cuomo,” said Steven Greenberg, a spokesman for the Siena poll. “The bad news is that he remains far behind, trailing Cuomo by 33 points, while Lazio siphons off 8 percent of the anti-Cuomo vote.” While Mr. Paladino’s campaign crowed over Wednesday’s Quinnipiac poll, his campaign dismissed the latest survey on Thursday. “Today’s Siena poll has questionable results,” said Michael Caputo, Mr. Paladino’s campaign manager. “We’re confident we’ll see a wide variety of public poll results in this race, but we take each with a grain of salt.” Notably, the Siena poll has generally good news for rest of the Democratic ticket, too. In the race for state comptroller, the poll shows the incumbent, Thomas P. DiNapoli, leading his Republican challenger, Harry Wilson, by 51 percent to 25 percent. And the Democratic candidate for attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, leads the Republican candidate, Daniel M. Donovan Jr., by 45 percent to 32 percent in the poll, though many voters did not know enough about the two men to have an opinion. ||||| Seems like only yesterday (because it was) when racist weirdo Carl Paladino was within six points of Andrew Cuomo in New York’s most embarrassing election of 2010, but a brave new poll just appeared today and now Paladino is safely down to 24% and Cuomo’s at 57%. How did Carl Paladino suddenly lose the love and support of New York state voters? Did he forget to send every voter their own wacky “Obama eats watermelon” email? The New York Times reports: Mr. Cuomo’s favorable rating was 60 percent and Mr. Paladino’s 32 percent — while Mr. Paladino’s unfavorable rating was 36 percent. The new poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. The two polls were different in significant ways. While Wednesday’s poll, released by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, screened out voters that Quinnipiac judged as unlikely to vote in November, Siena surveyed a sample of all registered voters. And the Quinnipiac survey did not include Mr. Lazio in its general election matchup. Lazio will be on the ballot as the “Conservative Party” candidate, because New York is apparently part of Great Britain once again, and he takes 8% of Crazy Carl’s support when included in the polling. Otherwise, it seems the only way Paladino can continue his shot at losing in the +/- 6 percent range is if most voters stay home because they’re either annoyed by everyone or lack the money to buy gas to drive to the polling station a block or two away.

Mr. Cuomo had a 60% favorable rating while Mr. Paladino's was 32%. Even though Mr. Paladino is not as popular as Mr. Cuomo, he has gained more support since the last month, so that's good news for him. But he is still very far behind Mr. Cuomo.

Answer the following question: Information: - I Feel Sick is a \\"doubleshot\\", full-color comic book written and drawn by the comic artist Jhonen Vasquez and colored by Rosearik Rikki Simons (who also voiced GIR in \\"Invader Zim\\"). It revolves around Devi D. from \\"Johnny the Homicidal Maniac\\" (JTHM), and her dealings with the same supernatural and/or psychological forces that drove Johnny to lunacy. Originally intended as a single paperback, it was later split into two issues so as to avoid compromising the length of the story. It was published by Slave Labor Graphics. Vasquez stated that the creation process of \\"I Feel Sick\\" was cathartic. The problems Devi had while working for NERVE and neglecting her own work was reminiscent to the pressure Vasquez had while working on \\"Invader Zim\\". - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. - Nickelodeon (often shortened to Nick) is an American basic cable and satellite television network launched on December 1, 1977, and is owned by Viacom through Viacom Media Networks and based in New York City. It is primarily aimed at children and adolescents aged 817, while its weekday morning edutainment programs are targeted at younger children ages 27. - Squee is a fictional character in Jhonen Vasquez's comic book \\"Johnny the Homicidal Maniac\\", who was later featured in his own four-issue series, published by Slave Labor Graphics. This was eventually collected as a Trade Paper Back (TPB), titled Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors. - Johnny the Homicidal Maniac (often abbreviated JtHM) is the first comic book by Jhonen Vasquez. The series tells the story of a young man named Johnny C. as he explores the psychological and possibly supernatural forces which compel him to commit a string of murders with which he always seems to get away. \\"JtHM\\" began as a comic strip in the 1990s, then ran under alternative comics publisher Slave Labor Graphics as a limited series of seven issues, later collected in the trade paperback \\"Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Director's Cut\\". The series produced two spin-offs: \\"Squee!\\" and \\"I Feel Sick\\". - Jhonen C. Vasquez (born September 1, 1974) is an American comic book writer, cartoonist and music video director. He is best known for creating the comic book \\"Johnny the Homicidal Maniac\\", with its spin-off comics \\"Squee!\\" and \\"I Feel Sick\\", and the Nickelodeon animated series \\"Invader Zim\\". - A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes. - Slave Labor Graphics (SLG) is an independent American comic book publisher, well known for publishing darkly humorous, offbeat comics. - Alternative comics cover a range of American comics that have appeared since the 1980s, following the underground comix movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Question: Where would you put an account book if you are leaving and do not need to bring it with you? Options: - kept at accountant - purse - desk drawer - bank - keeping track of expenses The answer is \\"desk drawer\\" because","completion":"placing an account book in a desk drawer offers several advantages when you do not need to bring it with you. These advantages include security, organization, accessibility, and protection. First and foremost, a desk drawer provides a relatively secure place to store your account book. It keeps the account book safe from unauthorized access or tampering, as drawers can often be locked. This is especially important if your account book contains sensitive financial information relevant to your personal life or your business. In terms of organization, storing the account book in a desk drawer helps maintain an orderly workspace or home office. This designated spot ensures that you can easily find the account book whenever you need it, without having to rummage through bags or stacks of papers. Furthermore, keeping the account book in a specific location prevents it from getting lost amidst clutter, ensuring that your financial records remain safely stored and easy to access when required in the future. Accessibility is another key factor. When you do not need to bring the account book with you, there's a high likelihood that you will need to access it later at some point. Keeping it in a desk drawer ensures that it's easily accessible whenever you need to check, update, or consult the records. This feature proves particularly useful if you need to work on it regularly or have ongoing tasks that involve the information contained within the account book. Lastly, the protection offered by a desk drawer cannot be overlooked. An account book contains important financial records that must be preserved for future reference or legal purposes. Storing it in a desk drawer helps protect it from external factors, such as dust, moisture, accidental spills, or even pets. This ensures the longevity of the account book and the integrity of the information found inside. In contrast, the other options present some drawbacks. Keeping the account book at your accountant's office may cause inconveniences when you need to access it, while keeping it in a purse may be insecure and risk damage due to daily wear and tear. Bank vault storage is usually unnecessary for day-to-day account books and is more fitting for highly valuable items or documents. Finally, keeping track of expenses is an essential aspect of financial management, but it is not a physical location to store an account book. In conclusion, the most suitable location for storing an account book when you do not need to bring it with you is in a desk drawer. This option offers security, organization, accessibility, and protection, ensuring that your vital financial records remain safe and easy to access whenever you need them. The other options are either less secure, less convenient, or not relevant to the task of finding a storage location for your account book."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Google Inc co-founder Sergey Brin has separated from his wife of six years, and now the 40-year-old Silicon Valley mogul is reportedly dating a younger employee. Brin and Anne Wojcicki, who married in 2007, have been living apart for several months, the couple's spokesperson said last night. 'They remain good friends and partners,' the spokesperson added. The woman said to be seeing Brin has been named in reports as Amanda Rosenberg, a 26-year-old Google Glass marketing manager. There is no suggestion that the couple were dating before Brin separated from his wife. Split: Mr Brin, who is worth a staggering 23 billion, has separated from his wife of six years, Anne Wojcicki, left. Romance: Amanda Rosenberg, pictured in Google Glass (left), is reportedly dating Sergey Brin. The 26-year-old, who describes herself. as Asian but moved to the UK, has played a key role in the development. of Google Glass and came up with the product's buzz phrase 'OK glass'. She joined Google as an account manager in June 2008 before becoming mobile business development manager EMEA two years later. Wojcicki, 40, is the chief executive of a biotech firm that Google has invested millions of dollars in and whose sister is one of the Internet search company's top executives. The technology blog AllThingsD on Wednesday was the first to report of the couple's split and Valleywag named Rosenberg. Brin and Wojcicki, who have two children and who have a prenuptial agreement, are not yet legally separated, the report said. Susan Wojcicki, Anne's sister, is senior vice president of Ads and Commerce for Google and is considered one of the Internet company's top executives. Power couple: If Brin and Wojcicki, his wife of six years, divorce, Californian law suggests their massive fortune would have to be halved - although they reportedly signed a strict pre-nuptial agreement. The relationship between Google and. the Wojcickis dates back to the company's earliest days: in 1998, the. nascent search company set up shop in Susan Wojcicki's garage shortly. after raising its first funding. Google. has invested roughly 10million in 23andMe, the company that Miss. Wojcicki co-founded in 2006 and which sells DNA testing kits and. provides clients with information about their ancestry and medical. conditions. Forbes said that Mr Brin is currently worth 22.8billion and holds more than 20billion worth of Google shares. Since Larry Page took over as CEO of Google, Brin has been spending most of his time at Google’s research lab, Google X, which has been developing ambitious ‘moon shot’ projects like the Glass and a self-driving car. Interconnected: Google has invested 10million in 23andMe, the company that Miss Wojcicki (right) co-founded in 2006 and which sells DNA testing kits. New technology: Brin pictured wearing Google Glass at a conference earlier this year. Brin and Wojcicki have gained a. reputation as a philanthropic power couple, donating tens of millions of. dollars to a variety of charitable organizations. In 2012 alone, the couple gave away 223million, Los Angeles Times. reported, earning them the distinction of being the fifth biggest. donors to U.S. charities, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy. Much of the funds went to their own charity, The Brin Wojcicki Foundation, which promotes human rights and anti-poverty programs. San Jose Mercury reported that they have also given tens of millions of dollars to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, and the couple co-founded a new organization along with Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, which awards 15million prizes to life scientists. According to reports, Brin has been linked to Google Glass Marketing Manager Ms Rosenberg. Romantic link: Hugo Barra, Google's product management drector for Android, introduces the Nexus 7 last year. Ms Rosenberg was appointed marketing manager in January 2012 moving from London to work at the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and within seven months was assigned to heading up marketing for the Google Glass. In her blog, she charts her first thoughts at starting work in the U.S. She said: 'Hello new boss, hello new team... LIKE ME IMMEDIATELY.' She explained the origins of the product's key phrase 'OK glass' on her Google Plus account earlier this year. The idea came about while she dined with Glass project manager Mat Balez. When he told her that a phrase that transcended different cultures was needed to activate the Glass menu and let the device know that the wearer wants to use it, she came up with the phrase. Employee: Miss Rosenberg pictured in a YouTube marketing video for Google Glass. She won her role promoting the controversial spectacles after coming up with the voice command ¿Ok, Glass¿ to activate them. Not only did she consider it to be suitable for a global product, it was also decided that it was subtle enough not to embarrass the user in public. According to her post, the phrases 'go go Glass' and 'Glass alive' and even 'pew pew pew' were said to have been considered before her idea. Reports of the romance come as another Google high-flyer, with whom she has been romantically linked, Hugo Barra, quit the company to work for a Chinese smart phone firm. Mr Barra, vice president of Android product management, presided over the much-trumpeted launch of Google's Nexus tablet. He announced his departure for Chinese company Xioami on his Google Plus account after five years at the firm. He said he had 'decided to start a new career chapter'. In the post, Mr Barra also said that his colleagues at Google are 'the most amazing group of people I've ever worked with in my life.'

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"During what time period did the Anasazi Indians inhabit the Las Vegas valley?\\" is \\"Around 1500 a.d\\"?","completion":"Oh no, sweetie. That's not correct. The passage mentions that signs of the Anasazi Indians appeared halfway through the first millennium A.D., which means around 500 A.D., not 1500 A.D.

Give him a hand.","completion":"No, the word \\"hand\\" does not have the same definition in the two sentences provided. The term \\"hand\\" has multiple meanings depending upon the context in which it is used. In each of these sentences, the word \\"hand\\" has a different meaning and serves a different purpose. Here's a detailed explanation of each sentence: 1. \\"A ranch hand\\": In this context, the word \\"hand\\" refers to a person who is employed to help with manual labor tasks, especially on a ranch or a farm. Ranch hands perform duties such as taking care of animals, herding cattle, building and maintaining fences, repair and maintenance work, driving tractors, and more. The word \\"hand\\" in this case represents a worker or an assistant who provides support and assistance in the daily operations of a ranch or a farm. 2. \\"Give him a hand\\": In this sentence, \\"hand\\" is used to convey the act of applauding someone, as in clapping your hands together in appreciation or approval. When you say \\"give him a hand,\\" you are asking others (or yourself) to acknowledge and celebrate someone else's accomplishment, effort, or performance. It is a phrase used to express encouragement, praise, or congratulation for a job well done. Here, the word \\"hand\\" has no direct connection to physical labor or employment; rather, it refers to a gesture of appreciation and recognition. In summary, the word \\"hand\\" carries different meanings in the two given sentences. In the first example, it represents a person who works on a ranch, assisting with manual labor tasks. In the second example, it denotes a gesture of applause, praise, and social acknowledgment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Anna Riviere was one of the most admired of 19th-century English sopranos . She was also one of the most adventuresome. She was born in London on January 9th, 1810. She entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of 14. Seven years later, just after her first show, Anna married Sir Henry Bishop, who was 24 years her senior. Her reputation as a singer grew rapidly, based largely on her tours with Sir Henry and harpist Nicholas Bochsa. After a tour of Dublin, Edinburgh, and London, Anna Bishop deserted her husband and three children and ran away with Bochsa. From then on, Madame Bishop--as she continued to be known--traveled and sang as if her life depended on it. Between 1839 and 1843 she traveled to every major town in Europe, where she sang in 260 concerts. In the course of two years in Naples, she performed in 20 operas. In 1855 she and Bochsa sailed for Sydney, Australia. He died there the following year, and Anna went on to tour South America before returning to New York, where she married a diamond merchant. Then she began what proved her most dangerous adventure. After another American tour in 1866, she and her husband set sail across the Pacific. They were shipwrecked on a small coral reef, and for more than a month they drifted in a small boat before they finally reaching Guam. She had lost her music, her wardrobe, and her jewelry, but Madame Bishop was not to be stopped. She went on to Manila and began a concert tour that led to Hong Kong, Singapore, and India before she went back to England. After another two-year world tour she returned eventually to New York, where she gave her last public performance in 1883--at age 73. Meanwhile the husband she left behind, Sir Henry, had become famous for writing the music to lyrics that might eventually have been meaningful to Anna Bishop--\\"Home, Sweet Home.\\" Question: Sir Henry is a _ .

Context: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis promised Thursday the Pentagon will \\"notify\\" Congress before any possible military action in Syria, where the U.S. is considering responding to a suspected chemical weapons attack. \\"There will be notification to leadership, of course, prior to the attack,\\" Mattis said in his testimony at the House Armed Services Committee. \\"We will report to Congress. We will keep open lines of communication.\\" But notably, Mattis did not indicate the Trump administration would seek congressional approval before the strike, which presumably would target the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Trump says the U.S. will soon launch \\"nice and new and smart\\" missiles in response to last week's suspected poison gas attack, which left scores dead in a rebel-held area. Trump blames Assad for the attack. A U.S. attack is likely to upset a small but growing number of U.S. lawmakers who demand President Donald Trump first ask Congress to authorize any hostilities, citing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a federal law intended to check the president's ability to wage war. U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have long argued they have legal authority to order airstrikes and other short-term military campaigns if those engagements fall short of the \\"hostilities\\" mentioned in the War Powers Resolution. Additionally, U.S. presidents have cited a pair of authorizations by Congress following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks as justification for the near-constant U.S. strikes on Islamic militants around the world. The Trump administration has used those authorizations as justification for its current war in Syria. The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, and helps lead an international coalition against Islamic State in Syria and neighboring Iraq. The overwhelming majority of U.S. lawmakers have not publicly objected to the administration's legal rationale for those missions.

The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Stephen Reeder Donaldson ( born May 13 , 1947 ) is an American fantasy , science fiction and mystery novelist , most famous for The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant , his ten - novel fantasy series . His work is characterized by psychological complexity , conceptual abstractness , moral bleakness , and the use of an arcane vocabulary , and has attracted critical praise for its \`\` imagination , vivid characterizations , and fast pace . '' He earned his bachelor 's degree from The College of Wooster and a Master 's degree from Kent State University . He currently resides in New Mexico . In the United Kingdom he is usually called \`\` Stephen Donaldson '' ( without the \`\` R '' ) . - A bachelor's degree (from Middle Latin \\"baccalaureus\\") or baccalaureate (from Modern Latin \\"baccalaureatus\\") is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study lasting three to seven years (depending on institution and academic discipline). In some institutions and educational systems, some bachelor's degrees can only be taken as graduate or postgraduate degrees after a first degree has been completed. In countries with qualifications frameworks, bachelor's degrees are normally one of the major levels in the framework (sometimes two levels where non-honours and honours bachelor's degrees are considered separately), although some qualifications titled bachelor's degrees may be at other levels (e.g. MBBS) and some qualifications with non-bachelor's titles may be classified as bachelor's degrees (e.g. the Scottish MA and Canadian MD). - Kent State University (KSU) is a public research university in Kent, Ohio, United States. The university also includes seven regional campuses in Northeast Ohio and additional facilities in the region and internationally. Regional campuses are located in Ashtabula, Burton, East Liverpool, Jackson Township, New Philadelphia, Salem, and Warren, Ohio, with additional facilities in Cleveland, Independence, and Twinsburg, Ohio, New York City, and Florence, Italy. - Northeast Ohio refers to the northeastern region of the U.S. state of Ohio. The region contains six Metropolitan Statistical Areas: ClevelandElyria; Akron; CantonMassillon; YoungstownWarrenBoardman; Mansfield, and Sandusky, along with six Micropolitan Statistical Areas: Ashland, Ashtabula, New PhiladelphiaDover, Norwalk, Salem, and Wooster. Most of the region, with the exception of the YoungstownWarrenBoardman and Mansfield metropolitan areas, is also part of the ClevelandAkronCanton Combined Statistical Area and media market, while Mahoning, Trumbull, and Columbiana counties form part of the YoungstownWarren CSA and media market with Mercer County, Pennsylvania. Northeast Ohio also includes most of the area known historically as the Connecticut Western Reserve. In 2011, the Intelligent Community Forum ranked Northeast Ohio as a global Smart 21 Communities list. It has the highest concentration of Hungarian Americans in the United States. - New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is fifth by area, the 36th-most populous, and the sixth-least densely populated of the 50 United States. - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - High fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy, defined either by its setting in a fictional universe or by the epic stature of its characters, themes, and plot. The term \\"high fantasy\\" was coined by Lloyd Alexander in a 1971 essay, \\"High Fantasy and Heroic Romance\\". - The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant is a series of ten high fantasy novels written by American author Stephen R. Donaldson. The series began as a trilogy, entitled \\"The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever\\". This was followed by another trilogy, \\"The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\", and finally a tetralogy, \\"The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\". - Kent is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and the largest city in Portage County.

The city is counted as part of the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area and the larger ClevelandAkronCanton Combined Statistical Area. - A master's degree (from Latin \\"magister\\") is a second-cycle academic degree awarded by universities or colleges upon completion of a course of study demonstrating mastery or a high-order overview of a specific field of study or area of professional practice. A master's degree normally requires previous study at the bachelor's level, either as a separate degree or as part of an integrated course. Within the area studied, master's graduates are expected to possess advanced knowledge of a specialized body of theoretical and applied topics; high order skills in analysis, critical evaluation, or professional application; and the ability to solve complex problems and think rigorously and independently. - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Innovation can be defined simply as a \\"new idea, device, or method\\". However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term \\"innovation\\" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that \\"breaks into\\" the market or society. It is related to, but not the same as, invention. Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process. The exnovation is the opposite of innovation. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - In Italy, the Iaurea is the main post-secondary academic degree. The name originally referred literally to the laurel wreath, since ancient times a sign of honor and now often worn by Italian students right after their official graduation ceremony and sometimes during the graduation party. A graduate is known as a \\"laureato\\", literally \\"crowned with laurel.\\" - Ohio is an Eastern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Ohio is the 34th largest by area, the 7th most populous, and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 United States. The state's capital and largest city is Columbus. - Twinsburg is a city in Summit County, Ohio, United States about halfway between Akron and Cleveland. The population was 18,795 at the 2010 census. In 2013, Twinsburg was named the thirty-eighth best place to live in the United States by Christine Phillips and CNN Money Magazine. - Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \\"extraterrestrial\\" or \\"alien\\"), is life that does not originate from Earth. These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology. - Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384322 B.C.), though \\"analysis\\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. - Florence is the capital city of the Italian region of Tuscany and of the Metropolitan City of Florence. It is the most populous city in Tuscany, with 383,083 inhabitants, expanding to over 1,520,000 in the metropolitan area. - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - An academic degree is a qualification awarded on successful completion of a course of study in higher education, normally at a college or university. These institutions commonly offer degrees at various levels, typically including bachelor's, masters and doctorates, often alongside other academic certificates, and professional degrees. The most common undergraduate degree is the bachelor's degree, although in some countries lower qualifications are titled degrees (e.g. associate degrees in the US or foundation degrees in the UK) while in others a higher-level first degree is more usual. - Cleveland is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and the county seat of Cuyahoga County, the most populous county in the state. The city is located on the southern shore of Lake Erie, approximately west of the Pennsylvania border. It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, and became a manufacturing center owing to its location on the lake shore, as well as being connected to numerous canals and railroad lines. Cleveland's economy has diversified sectors that include manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, and biomedical. Cleveland is also home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure. It means that the President could commit capital treason, or any other federal crime, and then immediately pardon himself. \\"It means that he could commit murder in the White House,\\" Koppelman said. \\"It makes no sense within the Constitution as a whole.\\" Asked by reporters Monday about Trump’s comment on his ability to pardon himself, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders repeatedly replied: \\"The...

Vera only allowed the dogs in the kitchen and not on the furniture, because there were too many ways they could damage the","completion":"delicate fabrics or leave their fur on the upholstered surfaces. As any pet owner is well aware, dogs can inadvertently cause harm to furniture, carpets, and personal belongings when they become too enthusiastic while playing or when they try to mark their territory. The cost of repairing or replacing damaged furniture can be significant, and for Vera, maintaining the pristine condition of her living space was of paramount importance. Moreover, Vera understood that setting boundaries for the dogs was essential for maintaining a harmonious household. By restricting their access to certain areas, she was able to provide a sense of structure and order – something that would help her dogs feel secure, owing to the consistency in rules and expectations. Though dogs are known for their loyalty and obedience, they can become unruly when they lack the proper guidance. By setting and enforcing limits, Vera demonstrated a form of discipline that her dogs could recognize and appreciate. For the sake of cleanliness, Vera knew that allowing dogs on the furniture could create an uphill battle in keeping her home immaculate. Dogs, by nature, can track in dirt from the outdoors, and their fur can attract and trap dust, allergens, and dander. Though Vera was diligent in caring for her pets, ensuring that they were properly groomed and cleaned, there was still the risk of leaving a mess on her cherished furniture. It was practical for her to establish an area in the kitchen where the dogs could relax and play without creating undue stress for her in maintaining her home's pristine condition. Moreover, many of the elements within Vera's home, such as expensive, heirloom furniture pieces, intricate woodwork, and delicate textiles, could not withstand constant interaction with her dogs. Sharp claws could easily leave scratches on hardwood surfaces, or worse, the dogs might chew on the furniture's exposed corners. This would not only impact the aesthetic value of the belongings but also their monetary worth. Keeping the dogs out of these areas minimized the damages and potential expenses tied to fixing or replacing such valuable pieces. Another consideration for Vera in limiting her pets' movement was the potential to cause disturbances while she entertained guests. Though her dogs were likely loving and gentle creatures, not everyone shared the same level of comfort or enthusiasm around animals, let alone within their personal space. By designating the kitchen as their main area, Vera's dogs would be able to socialize with guests without invading their physical boundaries. This arrangement served as a thoughtful compromise, ensuring that both her dogs and her visitors could coexist without feeling imposed upon. In conclusion, Vera's decision to keep her dogs in the kitchen and off the furniture was a carefully considered choice that took into account various factors like the preservation of her cherished belongings, the need for discipline and structure, and the desire for a clean and orderly environment. By being proactive with her dogs, Vera was able to create a balanced living situation for both her and her pets, showing that setting boundaries can bolster not merely the functionality of a home, but also the harmony within it."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Liam Shiels (born 29 April 1991) is an Australian rules footballer in the Australian Football League currently with the Hawthorn Football Club.

Who starred as 'Arthur Parker', a sheet music salesman, in the Dennis Potter TV drama, 'Pennies From Heaven'?","completion":"'Pennies from Heaven' is a classic British television drama series written by the eminent playwright Dennis Potter. It originally aired on BBC1 from the 7th of March to the 11th of April in 1978. The character of Arthur Parker, a troubled sheet music salesman, is brought to life by none other than the versatile and highly acclaimed British actor Bob Hoskins. Bob Hoskins, born as Robert William Hoskins on October 26, 1942, cemented his status as one of the most admired British actors of his generation with his brilliant portrayal of the flawed yet endearing Arthur Parker. In 'Pennies from Heaven', Hoskins' character struggles with his personal relationships and grapples with the unforgiving realities of the Depression era in the United Kingdom while continuously trying to make ends meet as a sheet music salesman. The series features a unique blend of drama, musical numbers, and the protagonist's elaborate fantasy sequences, where the characters lip-sync to popular songs of the 1930s. Through this innovative narrative technique, Dennis Potter masterfully crafts a thought-provoking commentary on various themes such as love, morality, dreams, and societal expectations. In addition to Bob Hoskins, 'Pennies from Heaven' also includes a talented ensemble cast, such as Cheryl Campbell, who plays Eileen, Arthur's wife; Rosie Collins as Barbara, the object of Arthur's affections; Kenneth Colley as the accordion salesman; and Kenneth Cranham as Tom, a man who shares a unique bond with Eileen. Bob Hoskins, in his vivid portrayal of Arthur Parker, captivates audiences by flawlessly displaying a wide range of emotions by delving into the deepest corners of his character's soul. He brings this struggling and disenchanted everyman's torments and fantasies to life, which adds depth and dimension to the story. Hoskins' performance in 'Pennies from Heaven' paved the way for a distinguished career in various film and television productions, both in the UK and internationally. Some of his most memorable roles include his performances in 'The Long Good Friday' (1980), 'Mona Lisa' (1986), and 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' (1988), further solidifying his status as a versatile and respected actor in the industry. Sadly, Bob Hoskins passed away on April 29, 2014, but his contribution to the world of performing arts will always be remembered and cherished by his admirers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: who defeated king darius at the battle of marathon?","completion":"The Battle of Marathon, fought in 490 BC, did not involve King Darius directly, as he was not present on the battlefield. The Persian force that fought in the Battle of Marathon was led by two generals, Datis and Artaphernes, who were appointed by King Darius I of Persia. It is, however, important to clarify that the Persian army at Marathon faced the Athenian army and not King Darius. The Athenian army, along with their allies, the Plataeans, were victorious against the Persian force. King Darius I, also known as Darius the Great, was the third ruler of the Achaemenid Empire, which was the largest empire of its time, spanning three continents (Asia, Africa, and Europe). He rose to power in 522 BC and ruled until his death in 486 BC. His rule was characterized by great expansion efforts and significant architectural accomplishments, as well as his establishment of a central administration system across the empire. In 492 BC, King Darius launched an invasion attempt into mainland Greece as a response to the Ionian Revolt, which had been supported by some Greek city-states such as Athens and Eretria. The first Persian invasion of Greece was aimed to punish those who aided the Ionian Revolt and to extend his empire over the Greek city-states. In 490 BC, the Persian forces managed to destroy Eretria and then advanced on to Marathon, a coastal plain approximately 26 miles (42 kilometers) northeast of Athens, where the battle took place. At the Battle of Marathon, the Athenian army was led by their ten elected generals, the most famous of whom were Miltiades, Callimachus, and Themistocles. The Athenian generals employed a strategic deployment known as the 'double envelopment' in which the center of the battle line was weakened, allowing the wings to flank and encircle the Persian forces. This tactic caught the Persian forces by surprise and led to the eventual retreat and withdrawal of Datis and Artaphernes from the battlefield. In conclusion, it wasn't a person who directly defeated King Darius at the Battle of Marathon but rather the Athenian and Plataean forces that vanquished the Persian army led by his two generals, Datis and Artaphernes. Following the defeat at Marathon, King Darius began preparing for a second invasion of Greece. However, he died in 486 BC before he could launch the invasion. It was his son, Xerxes I, who later led the second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The primary aim of this legislation is to protect innocent citizens from the devastating consequences of having their personal information stolen and misused. The increasing number of identity theft cases in recent years has become a major concern for lawmakers. This legislative proposal seeks to address the issue by imposing stricter penalties on those who engage in identity theft and creating preventative measures to thwart potential thieves. First and foremost, the bill includes harsher punishments for those found guilty of committing identity theft. These stricter penalties are intended to deter potential criminals from engaging in such illegal activities, thus reducing the number of incidents occurring each year. Secondly, the proposal calls for enhanced security measures to safeguard personal information. These measures include requiring businesses to implement stronger data protection protocols and offering support for victims of identity theft in recovering their financial losses. Furthermore, the bill aims to bolster public awareness and education about identity theft to empower citizens to take necessary precautions and recognize the warning signs of potential threats. The proposal also seeks to strengthen collaboration between law enforcement agencies and financial institutions to better identify and prosecute offenders. The advancing bill was met with bipartisan support in the House of Representatives, demonstrating the collective understanding that identity theft is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed. The legislation's progress facilitates the potential for even more robust strategies and policies to be developed in the fight against identity theft. In conclusion, the bill's advancement in the House signifies a major step towards protecting citizens from identity theft. By imposing stricter penalties, enhancing security measures, and raising public awareness, this legislation could significantly reduce the negative impact of identity theft on society.

Her boyfriend, Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) proposes to her before leaving for Sicily to attend to his dying mother; she accepts, but is insistent that they carefully follow tradition as she believes her first marriage was cursed by her failure to do so, resulting in her husband's death when he was hit by a bus.

Loretta returns home and informs her parents of the engagement. Cosmo dislikes Johnny and is reluctant to commit to paying for the \\"real\\" wedding Loretta insists on, while Rose is pleased that Loretta likes Johnny but does not love him; she believes that one can easily be driven crazy by a partner whom one loves.

Review title: Plastic Failure Product review: The Cloths line worked reasonably well for the first few months, but then the plastic knob on the left side broke and, apparently, cannot be replaced. The piece is actually a ratcheting lock that keeps the line tensioned. Without it the line will just sag and is useless. As stated above, this part should not be plastic.I went to the company website \\"Whitney Design\\" and there isn't even a link for support or parts; check it out. That's a question I should have asked before paying 55 for this; \\"Does the company support what they sell?\\"I would not buy this product again. A:","completion":"Based on the review provided, it is likely that this review would decrease the chances of buying the product. There are several factors in the review that contribute to this conclusion: 1. First and foremost, the reviewer reports that the product failed after just a few months. A component, specifically the plastic knob on the left side, broke unexpectedly. As the product's performance and durability did not meet the expectations of the reviewer, it is natural for potential buyers to be concerned about its effectiveness. 2. The broken part of the product is described as a ratcheting lock that is essential for maintaining the line tension. Without this functional component, the product is rendered useless, and the line will sag. This highlights a critical design flaw that affects the product's basic functionality. 3. The reviewer points out that the material used for this particular component, plastic, is not an appropriate choice. The reviewer suggests that a more robust material would have been better suited for the part, given its importance to the overall functionality of the product. This detail may decrease the chances of purchasing the product, as consumers may perceive this choice of material as indicative of poor manufacturing or design choices. 4. The reviewer then discusses the lack of support from the company, Whitney Design, after encountering the issue with the product. They could not find a link for support or replacement parts on the company's website. This lack of customer support is a red flag for potential buyers, as it indicates that they may face difficulty seeking assistance or replacement parts if they encounter a similar issue. 5. Lastly, the price of the product, at 55, appears to be relatively expensive. Given the reviewer's negative experience with the product, particularly with regards to its functionality and the lack of customer support, other potential buyers may reconsider their decision to buy the product at this price point, especially if there are alternative options available in the market at a lower cost or with a better reputation for quality and customer service. In conclusion, the review would most likely decrease the chances of buying the product due to the concerns raised about its durability, the choice of materials used, the absence of customer support from the company, and the relatively high cost."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: John is six years old.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Native American sand paintings are a very beautiful and popular art form for collectors today. But traditionally, the paintings are created to heal a person during a ceremony. The type of image and ceremony used is determined by the disease which the person is suffering from. The sand painting may contain an image of the Holy People. The tribe medicine man may ask the Holy People to help him paint the image and therefore help heal the person in need. When the medicine man finishes painting, he checks its accuracy. The order and the symmetry of the painting symbolize the harmony which a patient wishes to achieve in his or her life. The accuracy of a sand painting is believed to determine its healing effects. In some cases, more than one sand painting might be used in a healing ceremony. During the ceremony, the person who needs healing will sit on the Native American sand painting. The sand painting serves as an entrance for the spirits and through the painting, the person can absorb the healing energies from these spirits. The sand paintings were not originally meant to be sold or hung on the wall. Once the ceremony is completed, the sand painting must be destroyed, thus allowing the sand to return to the Earth. This is necessary because the sand painting is now seen as poisonous, having absorbed the illness, and must be destroyed. The entire ceremony, from the painting to the destroying is usually completed within a 12-hour period. The medicine man never wrote down how to perform the healing ceremony, but it was passed down from generation to generation. The Pueblo tribe was the first tribe to create Native American sand paintings, but the art soon spread to many other tribes. Today, it is the Navajos who are the most active in creating Native American sand paintings. It is believed that it was a medicine man named Fred Stevens who was the first person to create a Native American sand painting for sale in the 1950s. A trader, Rex Bollin, recommended Fred to sell sand paintings since they were so beautiful.... Answer:","completion":"Question: What is the primary purpose of traditional Native American sand paintings in healing ceremonies? A) To serve as a decorative piece during ceremonies B) To act as an entrance for spirits to provide healing energies C) To be sold to collectors for profit D) To hang on the wall as a reminder of the ceremony Answer: B) To act as an entrance for spirits to provide healing energies"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Jason Munt said him and Carly Furnish got beamed up by a bunch of aliens just after he'd boldly gone with her in the car park woods. It was the boldly going bit people thought was bullshit. Carly Furnish was a good God-loving girl. Trouble was, she'd gone missing. And Jason Munt had a weird crescent-shaped branding in his back, and was sticking to his story. Jason got hauled in by the cops and told he was in a whole heap of trouble. He reported blinding lights and a feeling like floating. He described being strapped to a table by little green men. A cop slapped the table and shouted, 'there's a frigging girl out there.' Jason said he knew how it sounded - the little green men, the whole thing - but it's true: they were little and green, just like out of the comic books. He volunteered tests for drink and drugs. He came back negative on both counts. They left him to stew. He said the last he saw of Carly was her being sucked up in some kind of light ray. He said, 'she seemed asleep - all peaceful, like.' Jason could not explain why he'd been beamed back down to earth, yet they'd seemingly taken Carly all the way off home with them to the Planet Zog. There were plenty of people willing to reckon it proved aliens had mighty good taste, but it wasn't the time nor the place to say it out loud. The cops released Jason after two days of questions. He stuck to his story throughout. The desk sergeant said, 'mark my words, there's a lot of hate out there.' Jason headed straight home. He lived in one of the straggle of council houses leading up to the tip. Carly Furnish and her folks lived two doors down. Supposedly they were distant relatives, but that's what everyone said about folks on that street. Why was Jason kept by the cops for two days? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. They wanted to monitor him. B. They wanted to know what the aliens said. C. They thought he had something to do with Carly's disappearance. D. not enough information Answer:","completion":"C.

They probably could have skipped some of the beginning - I'm not sure why this starts out in the Asian part of Turkey. If it was because starting in the Mediterranean, they could have gotten closer starting in modern day Lebanon. One the cameras and crews get to the Bakhtyari tribe, it's the beginning of an amazing 48 day journey. 50,000 people with about 250,000 goats, camels, cattle, and horses make this amazing trek across what seems to be a very fast moving Karun River. They use rafts that are kept afloat by inflating goat skins - you can see where the head and legs were removed. The other \\"bank\\" of the river was very steep - I'm guessing about a 60 degree rise. Just watching that was incredible, but there was much more to come. To get to the pastures, they also had to cross a major mountain that had about 4 feet of snow, if not more. Being able to climb this mountain was pretty amazing in and of itself, but they (and all of the animals) climbed this mountain barefoot! Yes, barefoot.

Options： A. capsulize idea B. train C. suck D. exception E. anarchy Answer:","completion":"D. exception The most suitable option to complete the statement about the cocky lead character who beat the odds is \\"every rule having its exception.\\" This idiom refers to the idea that there are often situations where a prevailing rule or generalization does not necessarily apply, and the character in question has managed to defy the odds and succeed despite these preconceived notions. In this context, the lead character's quip after once again overcoming challenges highlights his defiance of conventional wisdom and showcases his confidence in his abilities. The other options do not fit the context or convey the intended meaning. Option A, \\"capsulize idea,\\" is an unrelated phrase and not an idiom. It doesn't fit the context of the statement. Option B, \\"train,\\" is a term that can refer to either a transportation mode or a series of events, but it does not make sense in this context to complete the quote about the lead character defying the odds. Option C, \\"suck,\\" is an informal term for not being good at something. It doesn't complete the statement in a meaningful way and is not related to the idea of defying conventional wisdom. Option E, \\"anarchy,\\" is a state of disorder or political chaos, and it does not fit the context of the lead character overcoming challenges.

His father, Norton Cuban, was an automobile upholsterer, while Cuban has described his mother, Shirley, as someone with \\"a different job or different career goal every other week.\\" He grew up in the suburb of Mount Lebanon, in a Jewish working-class family. His paternal grandfather changed the family name from \\"Chabenisky\\" to \\"Cuban\\" after his family emigrated from Russia through Ellis Island. On January 4, 2000, Cuban purchased a majority stake in the NBA's Dallas Mavericks for 285 million from H. Ross Perot, Jr. In the 20 years before Cuban bought the team, the Mavericks won only 40% of their games, and a playoff record of 21-32. In the 10 years following, the team won 69 percent of their regular season games and reached the playoffs in each of those seasons except for one. The Mavericks' playoff record with Cuban is 49 wins and 57 losses, including their first trip to the NBA Finals in 2006, where they lost to the Miami Heat. On June 12, 2011, the Mavericks defeated the Heat to win the NBA Finals. Historically, NBA team owners publicly play more passive roles and watch basketball games from skyboxes; Cuban sits alongside fans while donning team jerseys. Cuban travels in his private airplane--a Gulfstream V--to attend road games. In May 2010, H. Ross Perot, Jr., who retained 5% ownership, filed a lawsuit against Cuban, alleging the franchise was insolvent or in imminent danger of insolvency. In June 2010, Cuban responded in a court filing maintaining Perot is wrongly seeking money to offset some 100 million in losses on the Victory Park real estate development. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2011, due in part to Cuban asserting proper management of the team due to its recent victory in the 2011 NBA Finals. In 2014, the 5th Circuit Court affirmed that decision on appeal. Following his initial defeat, Perot attempted to shut out Mavericks fans from use of the parking lots he controlled near the American Airlines Center.

The Avenue Range Station massacre was the murder of a group of Aboriginal Australians by white settlers during the Australian frontier wars. It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi.... The answer is:","completion":"James Brown and Eastwood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have never been a stop-and-smell-the-roses type of person. For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

Can you tell me the answer to which teenage activist girl from swat nominated for international children’s peace prize??","completion":"The teenage activist girl from Swat, Pakistan, who was nominated for the International Children's Peace Prize is Malala Yousafzai. Born on July 12, 1997, she gained global recognition for her advocacy on girls' education and women's rights in her native region, despite the numerous challenges and threats posed by the Taliban, an Islamist extremist group present in the area. Malala's journey to becoming a prominent activist began when she was just 11 years old. In 2009, she started writing a blog for BBC Urdu under the pseudonym 'Gul Makai.' Through her writing, she highlighted the challenges girls in her region faced due to the Taliban's policy of not allowing them to attend school. Malala had already developed a strong belief in the importance of education, and her passion for this cause was evident in her blog as she chronicled her daily experiences amid the volatile environment. Her courageous efforts did not go unnoticed, and soon, Malala began to receive national and international recognition for her activism. She was featured in several documentaries and appeared on various media platforms, where she continued to advocate for girls' education, even in the face of life-threatening adversity. In October 2012, Malala survived a horrific assassination attempt when a Taliban gunman attacked her on a school bus, shooting her in the head. Despite the severe injuries she sustained, Malala's resolve to fight for the cause of education remained unbroken. Following her recovery, she continued to raise her voice against the injustice and oppression faced by millions of girls around the world who are denied their fundamental right to education. In recognition of her unwavering dedication to advocating for girls' education and her courage in the face of extreme adversity, Malala was nominated for the International Children's Peace Prize in 2011. Although she did not win the prize that year, her work has since been acknowledged through several other prestigious awards and honors. In 2014, at the age of 17, Malala became the youngest-ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for her struggle against the suppression of children and young people's right to education. She also co-authored the memoir, \\"I Am Malala,\\" which became an international bestseller, sharing her life story and experiences. Today, Malala remains a powerful advocate for girls' education, inspiring millions worldwide. Through the Malala Fund, which she co-founded, Malala continues to work towards achieving universal access to quality education for girls, empowering them to change their lives and communities for the better."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The White House said President Barack Obama supports reinstatement of a federal ban on assault weapons -- a position he took in the 2008 campaign but failed to press during his first term. \\"It does remain a commitment of his,\\" presidential spokesman Jay Carney told reporters as the nation reeled from a mass shooting in Connecticut that mainly killed school children. An emotional Obama did not address that issue directly in a televised statement from the White House on the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown that killed 26 people, but he said something had to be done. \\"We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics,\\" said Obama, the father of two girls. He wiped away tears when he spoke of the \\"beautiful little kids\\" killed in the massacre. Complete coverage on the Connecticut school shooting. Police recovered three weapons from the scene: a semiautomatic .223-caliber rifle made by Bushmaster, a Glock and a Sig Sauer, both handguns, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. Others also spoke out for a strong federal response. \\"We cannot simply accept this as a routine product of modern American life.

Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, said in a statement. Witness: At least 100 rounds fired. Congress approved a ban on assault weapons in 1994. The prohibition, which expired in 2004, did not eliminate them, but restricted their features, limiting magazine capacity to 10 rounds and regulating pistol grips, bayonet attachments and flash suppressors. Gun rights generally divide Americans. A Pew poll conducted after the 2011 assassination attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, which killed six other people, found that 49% of Americans said it was \\"more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns,\\" while 46% said it was \\"more important to control gun ownership.\\" But a survey conducted by CNN/ORC International in August shortly after the deadly theater mass shooting earlier this year in Aurora, Colorado, found that 76% of those surveyed believe \\"there should be some restrictions on owning guns.\\" Tweets from the shooting. Obama supported a platform while running for president in 2008 that included reinstating the assault weapons ban, but has largely avoided the issue of gun control during his first term. He wrote an opinion piece two months after the Giffords shooting acknowledging the importance of the Second Amendment right to bear arms and called for a \\"focus\\" on \\"effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible, law-breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place.\\" Obama said at a presidential debate in October that he wanted a \\"broader conversation\\" in general about reducing gun violence. \\"Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced,\\" he said. The National Rifle Association, which advocates for gun rights, said in a statement that it would not have any comment on the Connecticut shooting \\"until the facts are thoroughly known.\\" Kristin Goss, an associate professor of public policy and political science at Duke University and author of \\"Disarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in America,\\" said earlier this year that the pro-gun control side of the issue \\"has struggled to come up with a compelling narrative\\" to persuade more people to support stricter gun laws. \\"For a long time, these gun violence rates and massacres spoke for themselves.

Jolly farm adopted the permaculture methods created by Sepp Holzer, while Peach farm continued using fertilizers and pesticides. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm caused less fertilizer to end up in oceans? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Jolly farm, which adopted the permaculture methods created by Sepp Holzer, caused less fertilizer to end up in oceans. This is because permaculture methods focus on ecological and sustainable practices that minimize the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. In contrast, Peach farm continued using fertilizers and pesticides, which, as the hint suggests, can be carried away by rain and runoff, ultimately contributing to pollution and dead zones in bodies of water like oceans.

For general audiences, this picture will no doubt appear as a high-tech summer action spectacle in the “Transformers” mode, but one made with superior cinematic craft and a profound appreciation for the classic monster-attack movies of the 1960s. This is escapist entertainment on a grand scale, with only dim and distant connections to contemporary social or political reality. In between the impressive oceanic throw-downs between gigantic interdimensional beasties and colossal human-powered fighting machines, we get all the ancillary ingredients required by the genre: macho confrontation and comradeship, a lot of military-bureaucratic texture, a smidgen of romance, some zany character comedy. What politics the movie possesses are minimal and arguably reactionary: Governments all over the world have peed their drawers when faced with a real-life “existential threat,” and it’s up to real men (and giant robots) to resist the invading monster hordes. Then there are all the film buffs, critics and so forth who’ve followed the twists and turns of del Toro’s peculiar career, with all its unfinished projects, impossible dreams and executive-producer credits. (He was supposed to direct the “Hobbit” movies – sigh! – and he was supposed to adapt H.P. Lovecraft’s “At the Mountains of Madness\\" – triple sigh!) If that describes you, “Pacific Rim” draws a line in the sand and dares you to cross it, with a discordant otherworldly roar. Except that you won’t find any sand in this movie – it’s all rain-soaked sci-fi cityscapes and roiling Pacific Ocean – and I was having so much fun I lost track of where the line between good-stupid and bad-stupid might lie. Suffice it to say that if you were hoping for an allegorical and/or political fairy tale in the mode of del Toro’s 2006 masterpiece “Pan’s Labyrinth,” you won’t find it here. His first film as a director in five years finds del Toro in maximally geeked-out fanboy mode, the mode of the “Hellboy” films and “Blade II,” fulfilling a promise I imagine him making to himself as a teenage boy back in Guadalajara, circa 1980, while he was watching “Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster” for the seventh time: As God is my witness, one day I’ll make a movie as badass as this one! My advice is that you have to honor this movie at that level or leave it alone. If you feel no affection toward the Japanese “Kaiju” monster movies of the ‘50s and ‘60s, from “Godzilla” onward, or for other related pop-culture streams that flow into “Pacific Rim” – the giant-robot anime of the ‘80s, or the “henshin” tradition of shows like “Ultraman,” in which an oversize anthropomorphic hero defends humanity from alien invaders – then quite likely this isn’t the del Toro picture for you. I found the storytelling and characters in “Pacific Rim” highly appealing, but they’re built to conform to genre norms and stereotypes, or maybe to max them out to the point of distortion, but not quite to subvert them and still less to appear “naturalistic.” Someone in my Facebook universe described “Pacific Rim” as del Toro’s version of “Kill Bill,” meaning that it’s a personal declaration of love and loyalty to a disreputable popular genre, and an attempt to make that kind of movie as good as it can be. That just about nails it. “Pacific Rim” opens with a lot of dense exposition, delivered in voice-over by Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam of “Sons of Anarchy”), the hotshot flyboy who will be our nominal hero. This may reflect del Toro’s awareness that this movie’s youthful target audience may not be all that familiar with the Kaiju universe. (If you too are confused, Wikipedia and this fine explainer by Vulture’s Nick Schager should help.) Ordinarily in movie criticism, you’re supposed to treat this sort of thing as a flaw, am I right? While we look at TV images of Barack Obama, ruined cities and steaming piles of monster excrement, Raleigh explains that giant beasts from another dimension called Kaiju are coming through a crack in the ocean floor (just a touch of the never-gonna-happen Lovecraft project there), but we built some colossal rock ‘em-sock ‘em robots called Jaegers (German for “hunter”) to fight them, so big they have to be controlled by two human pilots who become psychically fused in something called the Drift. Got all that? Good. Now let me get out of the way so you can swoon over Idris Elba. If you thought Raleigh Becket sounded like a computer-generated action-hero name (and/or an obscure historico-literary joke), I give you the remarkably charismatic Elba – star of “The Wire,” “The Office” and “Luther,” among other things -- as a hardass, order-barking commander type called Stacker Pentecost, who sort of sneaks up on us as the movie’s real dramatic centerpiece. There’s a Dickensian functionality to these monikers: How could a guy called Stacker Pentecost not be an entirely awesome leader with a dark personal secret who is by the living Christ going to command your respect and doesn’t give a flying Kaiju crap whether you like him? When you’ve got a murky, rain-swept, mid-Pacific battle sequence between a thermonuclear-armed Jaeger and a giant Kaiju called Knifehead or whatever happening every few minutes, the switchbacks of the plot are not so much the point. But let’s just say that Raleigh and Stacker go from being heroes to bums after the Jaeger program goes sour, and Raleigh spends a few years working construction on the giant Alaska-to-California wall that politicians have chosen as the means of preventing the Kaiju from stomping any more major metropolises. It doesn’t work. (Yes, in a movie by a Mexican director, that may just strike a resonant chord in the real world.) While del Toro and co-writer Travis Beacham never really explain the screwed-up geopolitical backdrop, there’s terrific deep-focus texture to all the sets and locations here, including the dystopian-proletariat world of the wall-builders and the \\"Matrix Reloaded\\" ambience of the Hong Kong base where Stacker, now gone rogue in a \\"Henry V\\" vein, has set up a last-ditch Jaeger fortress aimed at saving the world. Would it shock you if I suggested that his band of brothers, his collection of rogues, misfits and rust-bucket robots, including a PTSD-afflicted Japanese woman (the terrific Rinko Kikuchi) and a pair of nerdball brilliant scientists (Charlie Day and Burn Gorman) – along with a slimy black-market dealer in Kaiju parts (del Toro regular Ron Perlman) -- turns out to have just the right combo of courage, pluck and brains? I didn’t think so. As for the all-digital battle sequences, while they’re worlds better than Michael Bay’s patented Incohero-Vision, they could have used more light and clarity – or maybe just more establishing shots where we can tell who’s whomping on whom. (I attended a 3-D IMAX screening in Manhattan, and while it was great to have that huge screen, I’ve heard anecdotally that the 2-D image is cleaner, as usual.) This is a noisy, chaotic, technology-crazed 21st-century action film, but also one made with tremendous excitement, vigor and heart, along with a myriad of wonderful details. (One of the scientists has a piece of living Kaiju brain in a tank, and it has this questing, dangling tentacle appendage that I really, really, really hope not to dream about ever.) Will I be disappointed if del Toro stays in this mode and at this production level for the rest of his career, and steers away from more intimate projects? Absolutely. Am I disappointed with “Pacific Rim” as it is, in all its bigness and dumbness and its thrilling if slightly self-mocking city-stomping Kaiju revelry? Oh, hell no. ||||| Pacific Rim Action. Starring Charlie Hunnam, Rinko Kikuchi and Idris Elba. Directed by Guillermo del Toro. (PG-13. 131 minutes.) \\"Pacific Rim,\\" an action movie about the possible destruction of the human race, inadvertently makes the case that extinction might not be so bad, after all. If this is the best we can do in terms of movies - if something like this can speak to the soul of audiences - maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with. Fully half of \\"Pacific Rim\\" consists of computer renderings of Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots (or something close) fighting with computerized images of monster dinosaurs. These images - shown in rapid-fire cuts so you almost have no time to notice they're mundane - are accompanied by a soundtrack of nonstop noise: Blaring brass instruments, sounds of waves crashing, a soaring chorus (\\"Ahh! Ohh! Ahh!\\") and the deafening clang of grinding machinery. In between the combat scenes, we get the gentler interludes, in which forthright but stupid people get into pointless emotional conflicts for the sake of creating some illusion of human spectacle. If we do end up rooting for them over the invaders, it's because, biologically, we happen to be on their team. But next to these guys, the alien dinosaurs keep looking better and better. The movie is set about 10 years from now, near the end of a brutal war between humanity and the dinosaurs. Through a fissure in the ocean floor, they apparently broke through and started stomping on everything. Within the movie's first 30 seconds, they've demolished the Golden Gate Bridge - they would have knocked down the new Bay Bridge, but why do something easy? Every week our movies play at the destruction of beloved landmarks, to the point where we have to wonder if this is our culture unconsciously rehearsing for something. To combat the monsters, the humans devise enormous, skyscraper-size iron men, controlled by two pilots, and these iron men stand in the ocean and try to beat up the dinosaurs. At first these metal giants are successful, but soon they're not, which is where the movie begins: The dinosaurs, bigger and stronger than ever, are starting to win. Charlie Hunnam plays an impetuous, rough-around-the-edges pilot, a courageous iconoclast who is iconoclastic in the exact same way as every other action hero. He also has the misfortune of looking so much like one of the supporting players, Robert Kazinsky, that unless they're both on the screen, it takes about a minute to figure out who is who. Guys, flip a coin: Tails grows a mustache. Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer. Here is what passes for clever in \\"Pacific Rim\\": A dinosaur sprouts wings, grabs a metal giant and flies high into the air. Or another one: A metal giant picks up two train cars and boxes a dinosaur's ears with them. Some, to be sure, will love these moments, but they reek of the computer screen. Why go to the movies to look at somebody else's computer after looking at your own all week? The Japanese actress, Rinko Kikuchi, succeeds in giving an inward and thoughtful performance as an aspiring pilot, despite the commotion surrounding her. And Burn Gorman and Charlie Day, as a mismatched pair of bickering, eccentric scientists, provide some comic relief. But \\"relief\\" is the word to stress here. The actors can't make \\"Pacific Rim\\" any better. They can only relieve some of the pain. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicle's movie critic. E-mail mlasalle@sfchronicle.com ||||| The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Jul 10, 2013 10:29 AM Despite what we all may have suspected, “Pacific Rim” is not a big summer blockbuster. It is a huge summer blockbuster, whose enormity of scale is far beyond anything seen before. The alien monsters and the human-piloted robots that fight them dwarf the comparatively scrawny machines in the “Transformers” movies, as does the relative intelligence brought to bear by director and co-writer Guillermo del Toro. Which isn’t to say that “Pacific Rim” is a smart movie. Not at all. (See “relative,” above.) It’s big and loud and kind of dumb and predictable. The difference is that, in del Toro’s hands, it’s meant to be. Perhaps it’s giving him too much benefit of the doubt, based on such freak-out exercises as “The Devil’s Backbone” and “Pan’s Labyrinth,” but even with the unimaginable size of the whole thing, one never gets the feeling that del Toro loses control of the effects and battles. They serve him, not the other way around. Is it all too much? Good heavens, yes. That’s the point. If you’re not expecting an all-out sensory assault, boy, have you wandered into the wrong movie. How big are we talking? One of the robots uses an aircraft carrier as a weapon. A hand-held weapon. Also so big that the monsters and robots dwarf things like human actors and character development, which is more problematic. The film is set in the near future, when, as we learn in a voiceover, the kaiju, building-size monsters, begin springing up from the ocean every now and then to destroy coastal cities. All the world’s countries pool their resources and build the jaegers, German for “hunters,” to fight back. These gigantic robots are so big it takes two people to pilot them. In the film’s most-interesting idea, the pilots must form a neural bridge, called “the drift,” to operate the things. This also involves memories from their respective pasts, which can prove tricky. Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and his older brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) are good at this, until one day tragedy strikes during a battle and Becket wanders for a few years, unwilling and unable to fight again. But he’s found by his former commanding officer, the brilliantly named Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), who persuades him to return to action, as the kaiju are growing stronger and more resourceful, their visits more frequent. Even though the world’s leaders have given up on the jaegers, Pentecost believes they’re the only way to defeat the kaiju. The leaders are building an enormous wall to try to keep the creatures out. Building a wall is obviously a clear political statement about immigration that … Hahahaha. Kidding. Although “Pacific Rim” is an obvious few notches above such mindless fare as “Transformers” on the intelligence scale, something as complex as border walls is way beyond the scope of the film, and the often-political del Toro’s intentions. There are a handful of other teams piloting the few remaining jaegers, including a bottle-blond Russian couple who look like they wandered out of “Rocky III.” But it’s obviously going to be Raleigh’s fight, particularly after he’s paired with the beautiful rookie Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), who shares a secret with Pentecost. There is some comic relief from Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as bickering scientists, but del Toro for the most part is content to keep things serious, with preparation for battles, battles and recovery from battles comprising the bulk of the story. It’s loud, it’s long and there’s never much doubt about where it’s headed. But “Pacific Rim” appears to be exactly the movie del Toro wanted it to be.

After the August missile strikes, diplomatic options to press the Taliban seemed no more promising than military options. The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban, and also to Sudan, that they would be held directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, wherever they occurred, carried out by the Bin Laden network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it. For a brief moment, it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up Bin Laden. On August 22, the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working-level State Department official that the strikes were counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on Bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan. Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to Bin Laden should he be sent to Saudi Arabia. Yet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel Bin Laden, the Taliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime. (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.) Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September. His account confirmed reports that the U.S. government had received independently. Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U.S. agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody. The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained. Several officials told us, in particular, that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda financial official, Madani al Tayyib, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997.67Though U.S. officials repeatedly raised the issue, the Saudis provided limited information. In his September 1998 meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah, Vice President Gore, while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness, renewed the request for direct U.S. access to Tayyib. The United States never obtained this access. An NSC staff-led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to Tayyib and to see \\"if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia, including especially the Bin Laden family.\\" One result was two NSC-led interagency trips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000. During these trips the NSC, Treasury, and intelligence representatives spoke with Saudi officials, and later interviewed members of the Bin Laden family, about Usama's inheritance. Question: \\"What event with Mullah Omar caused diplomatic relations with the Taliban to be suspended after he denounced the Saudi government?\\" Answer: \\"When Taliban delegates met with William Milan\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the answer is not correct. The event that caused diplomatic relations with the Taliban to be suspended was when Mullah Omar refused to keep his earlier promise to expel Bin Laden, and both sides had a shouting match, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government.

With the tribes to the north and west destroyed, the Iroquois turned their attention southward to the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock. 1660 marked the zenith of Iroquois military power, and they were able to use that to their advantage in the decades to follow. The Susquehannock had become allied with the English in the Maryland colony in 1661. The English had grown fearful of the Iroquois and hoped an alliance with Susquehannock would help block the northern tribes' advance on the English colonies. In 1663 the Iroquois sent an army of 800 warriors into the Susquehannock territory. They repulsed the army, but the invasion prompted the colony of Maryland to declare war on the Iroquois. By supplying Susquehannock forts with artillery, the English in Maryland changed the balance of power away from the Iroquois. The Susquehannock took the upper hand and began to invade Iroquois territory, where they caused significant damage. This warfare continued intermittently for 11 years. In 1674 the English in Maryland changed their Indian Policy and negotiated peace with the Iroquois. They terminated their alliance with the Susquehannock. In 1675 the militias of Virginia and Maryland captured and executed the chiefs of the Susquehannock, whose growing power they feared. The Iroquois made quick work of the rest of the nation. They drove the warriors from traditional territory and absorbed the survivors in 1677. During the course of this conflict, in 1670 the Iroquois also drove the Siouan-speaking Mannahoac tribe out of the northern Virginia Piedmont region. The Iroquois claimed the land by right of conquest as a hunting ground. The English acknowledged this claim in 1674 and again in 1684. They acquired the land from the Iroquois by a 1722 treaty.

The infinitive form ends in t (archaically, ti). It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs (for example, můžu tě slyšet—\\"I can hear you\\"). Czech verbs have three grammatical moods: indicative, imperative and conditional. The imperative mood adds specific endings for each of three person (or number) categories: -Ø/-i/-ej for second-person singular, -te/-ete/-ejte for second-person plural and -me/-eme/-ejme for first-person plural. The conditional mood is formed with a particle after the past-tense verb. This mood indicates possible events, expressed in English as \\"I would\\" or \\"I wish\\". What kind of endings does the conditional mood add for each category in English? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"In English, the conditional mood does not have specific endings for each category like in Czech. Instead, conditional sentences are formed using auxiliary verbs such as \\"would,\\" \\"could,\\" or \\"should\\" followed by the base form of the verb. These auxiliary verbs can be used with any subject, and there is no need to change the verb ending based on the person or number.

On the right side, we see that there are three terms with u, so we can combine them: 23*u + 125*u + 83*u = (23 + 125 + 83)*u = 231*u Now our equation looks like this: -41*u - 7616 = 231*u Step 2: Move the u terms to one side and the constant term to the other side. Add 41*u to both sides of the equation to move all the u terms to the right side: -41*u + 41*u - 7616 = 231*u + 41*u -7616 = 272*u Step 3: Divide both sides by 272 to solve for u. -7616 / 272 = 272*u / 272 u = -28 The answer is u = -28."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Aaron Sorkin fans had reason to rejoice Tuesday morning as comedian Amy Schumer released a parody video of his show, The Newsroom. The parody version took the writer's iconic walk-and-talks, moral dilemmas and sexual politics to a different venue: a fast food restaurant. 'The Foodroom' gives a four-minute foray into the fictitious world of McDalmonds, where a cranky male manager is in a moral lock-of-horns with his corporate overlords. Sound familiar? Similar plot lines. have been used in many of Sorkin's shows, whether it be the latest. iteration in The Newsroom or earlier series like Sports Night or Studio. 60 On The Sunset Strip. (If 'corporate' was subbed out for. 'Republicans', there would be examples in The West Wing as well.) Showing. that the spoof was done in good fun, the male protagonist was played by. Sports Night alum Josh Charles, while his pesky female sidekick and. former flame is taken on by Schumer. Walk-and-talk: The parody film was made by comedian Amy Schumer (seen in the background) and Josh Charles, who previously starred in Sorkin's earlier TV series Sports Night. In. the clip, Charles' charactor JJ McAhoy (which is a clear homage to Jeff. Daniel's character in The Newsroom, Will McAvoy) is resistant to a. healthy change that his overlords want to make in adding apple slices to. their kids meals. 'Silly me, I thought we stood for something around here,' McAhoy says in disgust. Schumer,. whose sketch comedy show will feature the clip on her Comedy Central. show tonight, goes on to buck him up and encourage him to take first the. pragmatic route before returning to his moral high ground. Moral highground: Though the spoof centers around a fast food chain's resistance to healthy food, it takes its cues from themes seen in much of Sorkin's work. Big finish: The romantic sub plot also mimics the gender relations on Sorkin's shows. In a romantic interlude, she takes a jab. at the way in which Sorkin's female characters are portrayed as at times. hapless and entirely beholden to their love interests. Poking fun: Aaron Sorkin has taken part in previous parodies, including one on 30 Rock. 'I worked my way up to be a GM of a Sbarro in Tel Aviv, and then one day, I was stuffing cous cous into a calzone and then one day I realized a woman's life is worth nothing except if she's making a great man greater,' she says as they share a private moment by a deep fryer. This is far from the first time that Sorkin's distinctive style has been spoofed by famous fans, as former West Wing stars have created their own videos in the guise of their old characters to help get out the vote for one of their siblings who was running for office. The Oscar-winning writer himself has poked fun at his walk-and-talk formula in an appearance in 30 Rock. Sorkin is currently believed to be putting the final touches on the script for The Newsroom's third season which will air in September, but he has appearances scheduled at the Tribeca Film Festival next week and the Nantucket Film Festival in June, where he is being honored with their Screenwriter's Tribute. Until the HBO show returns, or his fast-paced writing style gets back on the big screen with his Steve Jobs biopic, fans can get quick refresher through the spoof.

Here are possible answers to this question: - garden - yard - southern europe - rice paddy - house I believe the correct choice is \\"garden\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The statement indicates a scenario where a person is eagerly waiting for her new terrace to be covered with green. The use of the color \\"green\\" primarily suggests an environment filled with plants, grass, and various foliage, instantly evoking images of natural spaces such as a garden or yard rather than man-made constructs or regions. However, among the choices provided, \\"garden\\" proves to be the most fitting answer, and here's a detailed explanation: Starting with \\"garden\\", the term implies a planned space, typically outdoor, set aside for the cultivation and display of various forms of nature, usually dominated by greenery or plants. And in this case, \\"her new terrace to be covered in green\\" aligns seamlessly with the concept of a garden. Therefore, the idea of waiting for greenery to cover a terrace fits perfectly into the concept of a garden, particularly if this green terrace was the “final piece of her dream.” On the other hand, a \\"yard\\" is more of a general term referring to an open area around a house or building. Though yards can contain greenery, it doesn't necessarily imply the same deliberate cultivation that a 'garden' does. The expectation of a terrace turning green suggests a more intentional act of gardening, thus making the term 'yard' a less suitable option. \\"Southern Europe\\" is a geographic term designating a region and lacks a direct connection to the scenario of waiting for a terrace to turn green. This location-based answer doesn't provide enough contextual relevance to be considered the best answer. A \\"rice paddy\\" refers to a flooded parcel of arable land used for cultivating rice. While this is an inherently green space, it doesn’t align with the scenario described. A rice paddy is a type of agricultural field and does not typically feature terraces that someone would eagerly wait to see covered in green. Lastly, \\"house\\" tends to refer to a building that serves as living quarters. While a house can indeed incorporate a terrace or green space, the phrase \\"waiting for her new terrace to be covered in green\\" specifically zeroes in on the greenery aspect. It's a more specific constraint that is optimally captured by ‘garden’ rather than 'house'. In light of these considerations, it's apparent that \\"garden\\" is the most suitable answer. It encapsulates the essence of waiting for a terrace to be covered in green and concludes the creation of a dream space with the anticipation and joy of gardening practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In addition, he delivered lectures in Europe and published a weekly newspaper to gain support for his ideas. In 1832 Owen opened the National Equitable Labour Exchange system, a time-based currency in which the exchange of goods was effected by means of labour notes; this system superseded the usual means of exchange and middlemen. The London exchange continued until 1833; a Birmingham branch operated for only a few months until July 1833. Owen also became involved in trade unionism. He briefly served as the leader of the Grand National Consolidated Trade Union (GNCTU) before its collapse in 1834. Socialism first became current in British terminology in the discussions of the Association of all Classes of all Nations, which Owen formed in 1835 and served as its initial leader. Owen's secular views also gained enough influence among the working classes to cause the Westminster Review to comment in 1839 that his principles were the actual creed of a great portion of them. However, by 1846, the only long-lasting result of Owen's agitation for social change, carried on through public meetings, pamphlets, periodicals, and occasional treatises, remained the co-operative movement, and for a time even that seemed to have utterly collapsed. Answer this question \\"what did the exchange system do\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"The exchange system, known as the National Equitable Labour Exchange, used a time-based currency in which the exchange of goods was effected by means of labour notes. This system superseded the usual means of exchange and middlemen, allowing goods to be exchanged directly based on the labor time invested in their production. It operated in London until 1833 and had a short-lived branch in Birmingham until July 1833."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What band's members testified before Congress? Answer the above question based on the context below: The band members grew uncomfortable with their success, with much of the burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on frontman Vedder. While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its video for \\"Jeremy\\", including Video of the Year and Best Group Video, the band refused to make a video for \\"Black\\" in spite of pressure from the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs. Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed listeners from creating their own interpretations of the song, stating that \\"Before music videos first came out, you'd listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and you'd come up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the very first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression.\\" The United States Department of Justice was investigating the company's practices at the time and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company. Band members Gossard and Ament testified at a subcommittee investigation on June 30, 1994 in Washington, D.C. Pearl Jam alleged that Ticketmaster used anti-competitive and monopolistic practices to gouge fans. After Pearl Jam's testimony before Congress, Congressman Dingell (D-Mich.) wrote a bill requiring full disclosure to prevent Ticketmaster from burying escalating service fees. Pearl Jam's manager said he was gratified that Congress recognized the problem as a national issue.","completion":"The band whose members testified before Congress is Pearl Jam.

After battling the Super Bowl champions in Week 9, the winless Raiders went back home for Week 10 to take on their divisional rival and the defending AFC Champion Denver Broncos for the first time all year. Broncos QB Peyton Manning was immediately picked off by cornerback D.J. Hayden on his second pass of the game 30 seconds in. Taking over near midfield, the Raiders got down to the Denver 23, but were forced to kick a 41-yard field goal, which Janikowski was successful on. Broncos kicker Brandon McManus responded with a field goal of his own, and the game was tied at 3 apiece. In the second quarter, McManus added another field goal and, later in the period, the Raiders intercepted Manning again; this time, it was Justin Tuck. Oakland scored a touchdown off the turnover and took a 10-6 lead on a Derek Carr 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brice Butler. However, after 2 unsuccessful drives for each team, Carr was intercepted by Denver cornerback Bradley Roby and the Broncos stormed back with two quick touchdowns. Both touchdowns were passes by Manning to C.J. Anderson and Emmanuel Sanders of 51 and 32 yards, respectively. Denver led 20-10 at the half. In the second half, Oakland's offensive miscues continued as Khalif Barnes fumbled at his own 13-yard line, and the Broncos wasted no time as Manning's 10-yard pass to Julius Thomas put Denver up by 17. Oakland's next possession ended in a punt, and Manning went right back to Thomas for another touchdown, Peyton's fourth of the day and second from 32 yards out. Carr was picked off again, the Broncos scored yet another touchdown on Manning's fifth of the game and second to Emmanuel Sanders, and the visitors took a commanding 41-10 lead. Down 31 points, the Raiders headed into the 4th quarter getting embarrassed by the potent Denver offense, and were unable to do much more than score an insignificant touchdown with 53 seconds left. The Broncos left Oakland with a 41-17 win and moved to 7-2 on the season. Meanwhile, the Raiders' woes continued as their record fell to 0-9.

Use this fact to answer the question: adding salt to a solid decreases the freezing point of that solid Which would freeze last? OPT: i. a thimble of water. ii. a pond of water. iii. a glass of water. iv. an ocean of water. The answer is:","completion":"Based on the given information about adding salt and how it affects the freezing point of a solid, it is clear that the presence of salt will impact the freezing process. However, the question presents us with scenarios involving different volumes of water without mentioning the presence of salt in any of these options. Therefore, we need to consider other factors, such as the volume, heat capacity, and surface area, to determine which would freeze last. i. A thimble of water will freeze quickly due to its small volume and surface area exposed to the freezing environment. The amount of energy required to cool and freeze the water in a thimble would be minimal. ii. A pond of water will freeze at a slower rate than a thimble of water due to the increased volume and larger surface area. The pond will require more energy to be removed in order for it to freeze compared to the thimble. iii. A glass of water has a larger volume than a thimble but smaller than a pond. Thus, it will take more time to freeze than a thimble but less time than a pond. The surface area exposed to the freezing environment also plays a role in this process. iv. An ocean of water is the largest volume compared to the other options and has the largest surface area exposed to the freezing environment. However, one key factor to consider is that ocean water contains salt, which, as per the fact provided, will further lower its freezing point. In addition to the salt content, ocean currents help to distribute heat and cold, thus delaying the freezing process. With these factors in mind, the answer to which would freeze last is: iv. An ocean of water. The immense volume, the presence of salt, and the heat distribution from ocean currents all contribute to the ocean taking the longest time to freeze compared to the other options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: One day, a train was approaching the small town of Cheekyville. On the train was a young man with a big suitcase. He was called William Warbler, and he looked very common indeed. What made him most unusual, though, was the fact that whenever he needed to communicate he did it by singing opera . It didn't matter to William whether it was simply a matter of answering a brief greeting, like \\"good day\\". He would clear his voice and respond, \\"Gooood dayyy to youuuuuuuu... toooooo!\\" No one could get a normal spoken word out of him and no one knew how he made his living. As he lived quite simply, always wearing his same old second-hand suit, people often looked down on him. William had been in Cheekyville for some years, when, one day, word spread round town like wildfire: William had played a role in a very important opera in the nation's capital. Everyone in the capital went to see it, and it was a great success. Everyone in Cheekyville felt it was a surprise. But something more surprising was, when William was being interviewed by reporters, he answered their questions by speaking rather than singing. And he did it with great manners, and with a clear and pleasant voice. From that day, William gave up singing at all hours. Now he did it only during his stage appearances and world tours. Some people suspected why he had changed, but others continued believing him to be somewhat mad. They wouldn't have thought so if they had seen what William kept in his big suitcase. It was a large stone, with a hand-carved message on it. The message said: \\"Practice, my boy.

He's in his perfect place when dicing tomatoes, making salads and baking cakes. By the time Kenny, 16, reached his third year of high school at Hickory Grove, North Carolina, US, he had become vice president of his school's cooking club. He also opened his own food company, called Modern Fusion. Kenny said he developed his love of cooking by watching his mother, and his grandmother, who owned a catering business herself. Kenny helped them both in order to remember their tips: how long to cook chicken so it stays wet, and the right amount of tomatoes to add to a spaghetti dish. At the age of 5, he cooked his first dish of shrimp and broccoli. Taking it for his school lunch, he warmed it up in the school's microwave, while the other kids ate their sandwiches. \\"I love to eat, and it started to become more fun to cook than to use a microwave,\\" he said. Cooking came easy to Kenny, and he enjoyed adding new ingredients into common dishes. \\"It started with a passion and I wanted to know more,\\" he said.

Professors often assign book reviews as practice in careful analytical reading. As a reviewer, you bring together the two parts of accurate, analytical reading and strong, personal response when you indicate what the book is about and what it might mean to a reader. In other words, reviewers answer not only the WHAT but the SO WHAT question about a book. Thus, in writing a review, you combine the skills of describing what is on the page,analyzing how the book tried to achieve its purpose, and expressing your own reactions. Most book reviews start with a heading that includes all the basic information about the book, like: Title. Author. Place of publication, publisher, date of publication. Number of pages. The review usually begins with an introduction that lets your readers know what the review will say. The first paragraph usually includes the author and title again, so your readers don't have to look up to find this information. You should also include a very brief description of the contents of the book, the purpose or audience for the book, and your reaction and evaluation. Then you move into a section of background information that helps place the book in context and discusses how to judge the book. Next, you should give a summary of the main points, quoting and explaining key phrases from the author. Finally, you get to the heart of your review -- your evaluation of the book. In this section, you might discuss some of the following issues: *How well the book has achieved its goal. *What possibilities are suggested by the book. *What the book has left out. *How the book compares with others on the subject. *What personal experiences you've had related to the subject. It is important to use labels to carefully distinguish your views from the author's, so that you don't confuse your readers. Then, like other essays, you can end with a direct comment on the book, and tie together issues... Question: Readers will get puzzled if _ .

What is the answer?","completion":"In July 2013, it was revealed that the world-famous British author, J.K. Rowling, was the secret author behind the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. Rowling is best known for her immensely popular Harry Potter series, which has sold millions of copies worldwide and been made into blockbuster movies. J.K. Rowling published her first novel under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith in April 2013. The novel titled \\"The Cuckoo's Calling\\" was a crime fiction novel and the first installment in the Cormoran Strike series. It featured detective Cormoran Strike and his assistant, Robin Ellacott, who work to solve high-profile crimes. The book received positive reiews, both for its riveting plot and engaging characters. However, it initially did not achieve significant sales or widespread recognition. In July of the same year, an anonymous tweet revealed that \\"Robert Galbraith\\" was actually J.K. Rowling. Following the revelation, it was reported that a partner at the law firm handling Rowling's legal affairs had leaked the information to a family friend who then shared it on Twitter. Subsequently, the book's sales skyrocketed, and Rowling confirmed that she was the true author behind the pen name. She later expressed her disappointment with the leak, as she wanted to continue writing under a pseudonym to separate this work from her already well-established literary career. Since the revelation, Rowling has continued to write and publish books under the Robert Galbraith pseudonym, including three more novels in the Cormoran Strike series: \\"The Silkworm\\" (2014), \\"Career of Evil\\" (2015), and \\"Lethal White\\" (2018). The series has gained a considerable following, and the books have been adapted into a television series called \\"C.B. Strike\\" by the BBC network. In conclusion, J.K. Rowling was revealed as the secret author behind the Robert Galbraith pseudonym in July 2013. Under this pen name, she has published the Cormoran Strike series, which has achieved acclaim and success in both literary and television adaptations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here are possible answers to this question: - roof - home - fabric - floor - computer game I believe the correct choice is \\"roof\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"Yes, you are correct. The most appropriate choice in this context is \\"roof.\\" The statement \\"After the windstorm it needed replacing, he decided to get a heavier tile\\" suggests that the subject is related to construction or materials that can potentially be damaged by wind. Among the given options, a roof is the only item that fits this description. The reason behind choosing a heavier tile is to increase the durability and resistance of the roof against strong winds and storms. Improved roofing materials can better withstand harsh weather conditions and protect the structure and interior of the building. Here's a brief explanation of why the other choices don't fit the given context: 1. Home - The overall structure of a home wouldn't be directly impacted by the decision to use heavier tiles. 2. Fabric - Fabrics are not typically affected by windstorms in the same manner as a roof, and tiles are not used in creating or repairing fabrics. 3. Floor - While floors can have tiles, they aren't exposed to windstorms and wouldn't require a heavier material for better resistance. 4. Computer game - This choice is irrelevant, as tiles and windstorms have no direct connection to computer games. In conclusion, the correct choice is indeed \\"roof,\\" as it makes the most sense when considering the context of windstorm damage and the need for a heavier tile to enhance its resistance against adverse weather events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which person's car, Jacob's or Alejandro's, must have accelerated slower? Jacob is an avid street car racer who is driving in his sleek black Mustang. He comes to a red light and sees the car next to him is an expensive looking Honda Civic, owned by a man named Alejandro. Jacob and Alejandro agree to race, and when the light turns green they both slam their feet on the gas pedal and take off. Jacob's car arrives at the light pole down the street from the light sooner than Alejandro's car, and he wins the race. Hint: Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration.

Jury selection for Cosby’s criminal... (Associated Press) PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Bill Cosby has performed in public for the first time since a sex abuse scandal embroiled him in 2015, telling stories and honoring old friends in his hometown on Monday as a retrial looms in his criminal sexual assault case. The 80-year-old entertainer took the stage Monday night at a Philadelphia jazz club for his first show since May 2015. His last comedy tour ended amid protests as about 60 women were coming forward to accuse him of drugging and molesting them over five decades, something he has denied. Cosby arrived at the club on the arm of his spokesman Andrew Wyatt. He wore a gray hoodie printed with the phrase \\"Hello Friend,\\" something his late son, Ennis Cosby, often would say. Cosby is scheduled for an April 2 retrial on charges he drugged and molested a woman at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. He has pleaded not guilty and remains free on bail. His first trial ended with a hung jury last year. Jury selection for his retrial will start March 29. Cosby's spokesman notified reporters of the comedy performance about two hours before he was to take the stage at the LaRose Jazz Club. The show was part of a program honoring jazz musician Tony Williams. The performance is Cosby's latest step back into the spotlight he's mostly shied from since his December 2015 arrest. Two weeks ago, Cosby invited reporters to tag along as he ate dinner with old friends at a Philadelphia restaurant. Over the weekend, Cosby's social media accounts featured photos of him visiting a barber and a cafe in the area and showing support for the Philadelphia Eagles, who won Sunday's NFC Championship game against the Minnesota Vikings and secured a spot in the Super Bowl. ___ This story has been corrected to show the arrest was in 2015, not 2005. ||||| Bill Cosby, sitting on a stool in a hoodie at a Philly jazz club, telling stories and working the crowd.

I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’.

Brad, Texas (CNN) -- Authorities were working on plans Friday for residents who were forced to flee a wildfire in northern Texas to return home, a day after firefighters made progress battling the blaze that destroyed dozens of homes. The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. \\"We feel much better about this fire today,\\" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service. He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds. The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer. Authorities also are trying to open the lake for the Labor Day holiday, he said. On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered in several communities on the north side of the lake after the fire charged over a ridge and approached a dam on the lake, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. The wildfire was moving so fast that the Forest Service pulled out of its command observation post, telling journalists and onlookers to get out of the way of the fire. \\"My house is right through here, though it may be gone,\\" Tom Hardeston told WFAA as he watched the fire. Nearby ranchers battled to save their herds from the encroaching fire. \\"I'm just moving them from pasture to pasture,\\" Cindi McCoy told WFAA, referring to her livestock. \\"As one pasture burns, I'm moving them back to that one and bring(ing) them back around.\\" Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"The Texas forest protection service did so to clean the forest.\\" correctly answer the question \\"What caused the fires?\\"?

Given the background: In coastal regions, sea breezes and land breezes can be important factors in a location's prevailing winds. The sea is warmed by the sun more slowly because of water's greater specific heat compared to land. As the temperature of the surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it by conduction. The warm air is less dense than the surrounding environment and so it rises. This causes a pressure gradient of about 2 millibars from the ocean to the land. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher sea level pressure, flows inland into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast. When large-scale winds are calm, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea. If an offshore wind of 8 knots (15 km/h) exists, the sea breeze is not likely to develop. and the situation: Jackie and Mark are two friends who are spending a day at the beach. Jackie wants to go out on the boat to spend some time on the ocean, but Mark wants to lay out on the beach and relax. Since they can't agree, Jackie goes out on the boat alone while Mark stays behind on the beach. Answer the following question: Is the air around Mark more or less dense than the air around Jackie?","completion":"To answer whether the air around Mark is more or less dense than the air around Jackie, we need to consider the properties of land breezes and sea breezes as described in the background information. 1. Land heats up more quickly than the sea, causing the air above the land to rise due to its lower density. 2. A pressure gradient is created from the ocean to the land, with cool, dense air from above the sea flowing inland to replace the rising warm air. Since Mark is on the beach and Jackie is out on the ocean, we can infer the following: - The air around Mark is cooler and denser than the air above the land further inland, as it is being influenced by the cool sea breeze. - The air around Jackie is cooler and denser as well, as she is on the ocean, and the water has a greater specific heat, causing the air above the water to be cooler. Comparing these points, the air around Mark is cooler and denser than the air further inland but it's still influenced partly by the land's warmth. On the other hand, the air around Jackie is solely being influenced by the cool ocean temperature. Therefore, the air around Mark is likely to be less dense than the air around Jackie since Jackie's location, being on the ocean, is under stronger influence of cooler and denser air due to water's greater specific heat compared to land."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question. You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Luca Di Angelo (Fabio Testi) is a smuggler, one member of an organized team trafficking cigarettes and booze up and down the coast off Naples, Italy. After a run-in with the police in which the smugglers manage to get away by faking a boat explosion resulting in the police motorboats responding to the false emergency allowing the smugglers to get away, Luca and his brother Mickey suspect Scherino (Ferdinand Murolo), the head of a rival gang of smugglers, of passing on their actives. Lucia and Mickey take their accusations to their boss Perlante (Saverio Marconi) a sleazy playboy withy numerous Mafia connections, who agrees to look into it. After a nighttime fire at Mickey's racing stables kills a valued racehorse, he and Luca drive over to inspect the damage. But on the way, they are stopped at a fake police roadblock where the assassins dressed as policemen trick Mickey into getting out of the car and machine-gun him to death over and over again (a homage to Sonny Corelone's death scene in The Godfather), while Luca barely escapes injury by hiding on the floor of the car.Afterwards, Perlante suggests that Luca leave town for a few days, but he refuses. After his brother's funeral, conducted on the gang's speedboats in the Bay of Naples, with the police surveying them, Luca vows revenge. Despite his wife Adele's (Ivana Monti) pleas, Luca goes after the prime suspect: Scherino. That night, Luca breaks into Scherino's house, but gets spotted and severely beaten up by Scherino's henchmen. However, Scherino spares Luca's life. He tells Luca that he had no part in Mickey's killing.After Luca recovers from his injuries thanks to a local doctor named Charlie (Giordano Falzoni) who treats injuries for large bribes of cash, Luca meets with an informant who gives him a tip to who ordered the hit on Mickey. Traveling to a derelict fishing boat in the marina where a hood is making a drug pick-up, Luca tortures him for information about his boss, whom Luca learns is a Frenchman called Francois Jacios, aka: The Marsigliese. Luca calls Perlante, who tells him more about the vicious gangster, and who is muscling into Italian organized crime to deal in hard drugs. At his hideout in Naples, the Marsigliese (Marcel Bozzufi) is meeting Ingrid, a German drug courier from Frankfurt wanting to sell him some heroin. When the Marsigliese sees that the heroin is 'cut', he has her face horribly burned by a blowtorch while he watches with sadistic satisfaction.Over the course of one day, the Marsigliese orders a series of shootings of all the rival Mafia Dons all over Naples as part of his plan to become the sole kingpin of Naples. Perlante barely escapes an attempt on his life when his right-hand man Alfredo (Giulio Farnese) triggers a bomb which has been hidden under Perlante's bed, killing Alfredo and Perlante's mistress. Perlante calls Luca and tells him about the series of hits. He sets up a meeting between them and the Marsigliese at the local soccer stadium where the Frenchman discusses merging their criminal concerns. Afterwards, Luca meets with his fellow smugglers and persuades them not to accept the Marsigliese demands for the inflow of drugs into their community would only escalate the number of addicts and drug-overdoses, plus they would not receive any profits since the Marsigliese would keep most of the money for himself and his close associates.In response to the Mafia killings, the Naples police chief (Fabio Jovine) orders Captain Tarantino (Venantino Verantini) to conduct a massive sweep of the Neapolitan bay area to clean it up of crime. The dragnet has many smugglers arrested. Luca is saved from a police raid on his house by, of all people, Scherino, who suggests they form an alliance to defeat the Marsiglise. They meet that night at Perlante's house to discuss their plans with him. But Luca soon smells the tell-tale odor of the Marsiglieses personal parfum in the room. Luca realizes that Perlante is in league with the Marsgliese just as the gangster and his henchmen burst into the room and kill all of Scherino's henchmen as well as mortally wound Scherino himself. Luca's split-second reflexes of diving out a glass window and running away from the house ensures his escape. The mortally wounded Scherino manages to shoot off one shot from his gun at the treaterous Perlante, hitting him in the neck, before he drops dead himself.The Marsigliese abducts Luca's wife, Adale, and again insists that Luca should turn over the smuggling network over to his drug operation. To help Luca make up his mind, the sound of Adale being beaten and gang-raped are relayed to Luca over the phone. Luca agrees to the Marsigliese demands. In desperation, Luca calls upon the elderly Don Morrone (Guido Alberti), the leader of the old-guard Italian Mafia who has been reading the news throughout the movie of the numerous killings. Morrone is happy to come out of semi-retirement to deal with the French sadist. Morrone relays his plans to his various middle-aged associates who swing back into action for their cause.The following morning, a meeting between Luca and the Marsigliese in a local open square where the handover to Adele is taking place. Luca sees that it is indeed a set up to have him killed. Don Morrone and his men, using a series of hit-and-run attacks, appear and blast away all of the Marsigliese's henchmen. Luca then chases the crazed Marsigliese through the deserted streets and allyways where after the Frenchman runs down an alley which is a dead end, Luca catches up to him and shoots the Marsigliese dead who lands on a pile of garbage bags. Across down, the police raid the Marsigliese hideout where they find the tramatized Adele and a large stash of cocaine and heroin, while the rest of the Marsigliese henchmen surrender.The final scene has Captain Tarantino meeting with Don Morrone and his housekeeper at a wharf marketplace where the policeman thanks the elderly Mafia don for his tip leading to the discovery of the Marsigliese hideout and drug shipment seizure. But when Tarantino asks Morrone about the murder of the Marsigliese and his men, Morrone claims to know nothing about it, and also not to know Luca Di Angelo. From Tarantino's sarcastic tone of voice, he knows that Morrone is lying. But out of sympathy, the policeman lets Morrone go without arresting him., Question: What is the name of Luca's wife?","completion":"Part #1: Identify key characters in the movie plot.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Such was the scene as world-renowned violinist and conductor Itzhak Perlman opened the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) season, leading the musicians through a remarkable performance of Beethoven's works. In a perfect marriage of skill and passion, Perlman and the BSO reminded the audience why they fell in love with classical music in the first place. Step 1: Background on Itzhak Perlman Itzhak Perlman, an Israeli-American musician, is not only a virtuoso violinist but also a talented conductor. Born in Tel Aviv, he first gained fame as a prodigy at a young age. Over the years, he has performed with numerous orchestras worldwide, winning countless awards and earning himself the reputation of one of the finest violinists the world has ever seen. Known for his impeccable technique, depth, and sensitivity, Perlman has the rare ability to captivate and inspire audiences with his musical brilliance. Step 2: Introduction of the works performed by BSO For their inaugural performance of the season, the BSO offered an exciting program featuring two of Beethoven's most iconic works: Symphony No. 5 in C minor and Violin Concerto in D Major. These masterpiece compositions, sheer testaments to Beethoven's genius, are timeless in their appeal and continue to enchant listeners with their beauty and emotion. Step 3: Discuss Perlman's role as conductor and soloist Assuming dual roles as conductor and soloist, Perlman expertly navigated between these two demanding positions. His deep understanding of Beethoven's music enabled him to bring out the full range of emotions, from the dramatic, forceful opening of Symphony No. 5 to the delicate, lyrical melody of the Violin Concerto. Perlman's experience as a violinist and conductor allowed him to guide the BSO through a seamless, cohesive performance that left the audience captivated. Step 4: Reflect on the synergy between Perlman and the BSO What sets this performance apart is the synergy between Perlman and the BSO musicians. As Perlman led the orchestra, the connections between them were palpable. Together, they achieved more than perfect synchronization; it was as though the entire ensemble breathed, played, and felt each piece as one unit. This unique bond projected an air of unity that permeated throughout the hall, drawing the audience into the emotional depths of Beethoven's work. Step 5: Discuss the audience's reception From the moment the first note was played, it became apparent that the audience was in for a treat. The attentiveness of the crowd spoke volumes about Perlman and the BSO's ability to bring Beethoven's compositions to life. As the last note of the evening resonated through the concert hall, the audience responded with a standing ovation, a testament to the magical experience they had just witnessed. Conclusion: The opening night of the BSO season with Itzhak Perlman leading the way was nothing short of exceptional. Combining Perlman's virtuosic talent and the musicianship of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Beethoven's music was showcased in all its beauty and grandeur. As the applause subsided and the audience filed out, it was clear that this performance would remain etched in their memories for years to come. And so, with Perlman at the helm, the BSO season has begun, promising a remarkable journey of musical excellence to incredibly fortunate spectators."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},Y={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},N={key:1};function R(n,e,h,m,i,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",Y,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
