Given the question: Given the following context: County Cork, Ireland, 1920. Dr. Damien O'Donovan is about to leave his native village to practise medicine in a London hospital. Meanwhile, his brother Teddy commands the local flying column of the Irish Republican Army. After a hurling match, Damien witnesses the summary execution of his friend, Micheál Ó Súilleabháin, by British Black and Tans. Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the British Army vainly trying to intimidate a railway personnel for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade. After drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's Royal Irish Constabulary barracks to acquire revolvers, then uses them to assassinate four Auxiliaries. In the aftermath, Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's socialist views. Meanwhile, British officers interrogate Teddy, pulling out his fingernails when he refuses to give them the names of IRA members. Johnny Gogan, a British soldier of Irish descent, helps the prisoners escape, but three are left behind. After the actions of Sir John and Chris are revealed to the IRA's intelligence network, both are taken hostage. As Teddy is still recovering, Damien is temporarily placed in command. News arrives that the three remaining IRA prisoners have been tortured and shot. Simultaneously, the brigade receives orders to \\"execute the spies\\". answer the following question: Which organization does Sir John Hamilton's servant betray? The answer is:","completion":"The Irish Republican Army (IRA) Justification: The text explicitly states that Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, Chris Reilly, who is an IRA member, into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps.

Today, we are going to learn about how to take care of a new piercing. A piercing is when someone puts a small hole in a part of your body, like your ear or your nose, and puts some special jewelry there. It may sound a bit weird, but lots of people have piercings, and they look really cool! When you get a new piercing, it's very important to take care of it so it can heal properly. Here's how you can do that: 1. Keep from touching your piercing: It's really exciting to have new jewelry, but it's super important not to touch it too much. Our hands can have germs, and we don't want those germs to get on our piercing. So, try to keep your hands away from it as much as you can. 2. Leave the jewelry in place: The jewelry that's put in your new piercing is there to help it heal. If you take it out, it might be hard to put it back in, or your piercing might close up. So, keep the jewelry in until it's all healed, and if you want to change it, ask a grown-up for help. 3. Avoid applying ointments: Sometimes, people want to put ointments or creams on their piercings to make them feel better. But, these can actually cause problems and slow down the healing process. It's best to just let your piercing be and let your body do its healing magic. 4. Wear loose clothing: If your new piercing is on a part of your body that has to touch your clothes, like your belly button, it's important to wear loose clothing. This way, your clothes won't rub against your piercing and cause it to get irritated. 5. Stay away from unclean water: Fun times in the swimming pool or at the beach are great, but not when you have a new piercing. Unclean water can have lots of yucky germs that can make your piercing very unhappy. Until your piercing is healed, stick to playing in clean water, like in a bathtub. 6. Sleep on your back or sides: Getting a good night's sleep is important for healing your new piercing. If you have a piercing on your ear, try to sleep on your back or on the side that doesn't have the piercing. This will help keep your piercing safe and comfy while you catch some Zzz's. There you have it, little friends! Taking care of a new piercing might seem like a big job, but if you follow these steps, it will heal up nicely and look awesome! Just remember to always ask a grown-up for help if you're not sure what to do. Happy healing!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process: - Magma cools inside the crust - Magma crystalizes - Lava cools on the surface - Lava crystalizes - Minerals dissolved in water crystlize. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose force is imposed on the rocks more often happens, how will it affect MORE minerals forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation--in this case, the increased imposition of force on rocks--can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of mineral formation. The discussion requires an understanding of the basic geological processes of mineral formation, which are indeed affected by the pressure exerted on the rocks. First, let's overview the processes you've mentioned. 1. Magma cools inside the crust: Minerals can form deep within the Earth's crust where temperatures and pressures are high. This process produces igneous rocks, such as granite and basalt, which contain various minerals. When magma cools slowly underground, the crystals have a longer time to grow and become larger. 2. Magma crystallizes: As the magma slowly cools, elements within it begin to chemically combine, forming minerals. The rate of crystallization and the specific minerals formed are determined by the chemical composition of the magma, temperature, and pressure. 3. Lava cools on the surface: Lava, or magma that has reached the surface of the Earth, cools much faster than magma underground, giving the minerals less time to crystallize. This results in smaller crystals and the formation of extrusive igneous rocks, like basalt and obsidian. 4. Lava crystallizes: As the lava cools, its elements chemically coalesce into minerals, creating a rock with tiny crystals. 5. Minerals dissolve in water and crystallize: This forms sedimentary rock. When water evaporates or changing conditions cause mineral-saturated water to become supersaturated, mineral crystals can precipitate. Now, let's explore how increased imposition of force can impact these processes. Direct Effect: The direct effect refers to the literal change in the physical environment in which the rocks are situated. Greater force can translate into increased pressure. When we discuss an increased imposition of force, we're intrinsically discussing an increased pressure system that would, in turn, influence the rate and type of mineral formation. Minerals forming deep within Earth’s crust under high pressure would respond differently to this change than those subjected to low pressures at or near the Earth's surface. Higher pressures generally lead to minerals with more compact structures. This can influence some transitions from one mineral type to another. For example, graphite under very high pressure can transform into diamond. Indirect Effect: Indirect effects could be seen as changes in geochemical cycles or shifts in further physical or chemical conditions due to the increased force. Increased pressures can indirectly affect the nature and degree of metamorphism occurring in metamorphic rocks, as the minerals within the rocks react to the changes in pressure and temperature. Changes in pressure can also alter the solubility of water in magma, possibly causing it to crystallize more quickly and alter the types of minerals that form. Therefore, more frequent applications of force on rocks will cause the physical conditions of mineral formation to change, leading to potential differences in the types and qualities of the minerals formed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Before he won Oscars for his music, composer Howard Shore helped kick off SNL Composer Howard Shore is a refined man. His music, from the Oscar-winning scores for the “Lord of the Rings” films to his recent concertos for piano and cello, favors long melodic lines and unmessy orchestration. “There’s a clarity of music that I think reflects his clarity of thought,” suggested his old friend and bandmate Paul Hoffert. But this same Howard Shore first introduced himself to viewing audiences as the musical director of “Saturday Night Live,” where he sang in drag with his All-Nurse Band and, as Dr. Frankenstein, reanimated Madeline Kahn’s Bride of Frankenstein to sing Stephen Sondheim’s “I Feel Pretty.” Yet even here, and in Shore’s broader role creating the musical personality of the sketch-comedy giant, is evidence of the composer’s seriousness. “Watching Howard take an LP out of its cover and sleeve and put it on a turntable and brush it — it wasn’t anything he did haphazardly,” SNL creator Lorne Michaels said. “I was always in more of a hurry than he was.” Michaels and Shore grew up in the same neighborhood in Toronto and met as teenagers at summer camp, where they put on shows together, including “The Fantasticks.” “We were pretty good,” Michaels said dryly. “Just a summer camp in Canada — but the plays were taken seriously.” Shore’s earliest musical diet included his parents’ Elvis and Glenn Miller records, the B-movie scores he heard on afternoon television, and the songs filling the synagogue his father helped build. His aptitude was caught at the age of 8, thanks to the Canadian school system’s nationwide use of the Seashore Measures of Musical Talent tests. He promptly began taking clarinet lessons. “I studied harmony and counterpoint, and I kept the pencil going,” said Shore, 70, employing his oft-used mantra for composition. (He still writes with pencil and paper today.) “I studied a lot of different instruments — woodwinds and piano and brass and cello. And then I finally put everything away and just kept the pencil going.” Jazz became his main squeeze before he turned 10, and he picked up the alto sax. “It was exciting,” he said, “and it was mysterious. I would listen to Ellington and go, ‘What is that? How do you create that kind of sound?’ The energy, the creative flow of it — I still love it to this day, because it’s not about following; it’s about equal participation.” Michaels (then Lorne Lipowitz) remembered listening to John Coltrane records in Shore’s basement, and Shore’s father calling down to “play the melody!” Shore giggled at the anecdote and said Michaels still quotes his father’s phrase as a sign-off from phone calls. After high school, Shore majored in composition at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. While he was in school, Michaels introduced him to Hoffert, a fellow Torontonian who was starting a jazz-flavored band and wanted Shore to join their brass section. For the next five years Shore recorded and toured with Lighthouse, one of Canada’s most popular bands on the front lines of jazz fusion. They opened for Jimi Hendrix at the Isle of Wight; in Philadelphia, Elton John opened for them. In addition to playing, Shore also wrote charts and occasionally sang, and when the band began playing with symphony orchestras around Canada, he got to flex his classical muscles by writing orchestral arrangements. Michaels was simultaneously creating variety shows for Canadian Broadcasting Corp. radio and television (precursors to SNL), and he invited Shore to handle musical responsibilities. “If it was anything to do with music, Howard would have been there,” said Michaels, who moved to New York in 1975 and launched “Saturday Night Live” on NBC — bringing Shore along with him. “Unlike, say, anything else in the comedy part of it, where there would have been huge discussions,” Michaels said, “in that, I would just go, ‘Howard, are you sure you know what you’re doing here?’ and that would have been the extent of it.” Shore was a core member of the show’s small, ragtag team and not only composed the free-form jazz pieces that opened and closed the show (and have for 42 years) but also wrote songs and dramatic underscores, appeared in sketches and was in charge of booking musical guests. “We had Keith Jarrett, we had Sun Ra, we had Leon Redbone,” Michaels said. “We were very, I won’t go with the word ‘earnest,’ because it makes it sound a little more serious, but we were very driven for it to be good — a notion of good that seemed very clear to us.” Shore scored his first feature film, “I Miss You, Hugs and Kisses” — a low-budget, Canadian murder movie — in 1978. He courted another Toronto filmmaker, David Cronenberg, whose early work he had seen as a teenager, asking whether he could score “The Brood,” an eerie chiller that foreshadowed their next 30-plus years of collaboration. “It wasn’t a matter of ego for him, it wasn’t a desire to establish a signature style that would be recognizable in every film,” Cronenberg said. With the help of library books, Shore taught himself the mechanics of scoring and synchronizing music to film. His score for “The Brood” was composed for a mere 21 strings, but it planted seeds of style and process he has continued to use — and evolve — throughout his career. “I just try to feel something and create that,” Shore said, “because music is an emotional language, so I try to capture the feeling of it, what I’m after. It’s not that technical, and it’s not about technology. Maybe that’s why I worked in film so much, because a lot of it is about capturing the feeling of a scene.” Cronenberg became Shore’s most frequent collaborator, and he gave the composer freedom to experiment with unconventional ideas in “Scanners” (1981) and “Videodrome” (1983) up through “The Fly” (1986) and recent fare such as “Maps to the Stars” (2015). “Howard became kind of a character actor,” said Cronenberg, who suggested that the emotion Shore is especially gifted at evoking is “the strange and terrible sensuality of loss.” “The music would add something — add some dialogue, add a level of understanding or suggestion or provocativeness — rather than amplify what was already there.” Shore lived off SNL royalties for almost a decade, but he gradually realized he had become a career film composer as he received offers from directors including Jonathan Demme (“The Silence of the Lambs”), Martin Scorsese (“The Departed”) and David Fincher (“Seven”). By the 1990s, he was scoring three or four films a year. In 2000, he took on his most ambitious project yet with Peter Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” trilogy. Over the course of nearly four years, Shore composed a dense, 11-hour opus brimming with elaborate, interlocking character themes for the London Philharmonic Orchestra and choirs singing the languages of author J.R.R. Tolkien. “What Howard does as well as any living composer is to understand the emotional content of movies,” said Viggo Mortensen, who played Aragorn in the trilogy. “He is capable of . . . showing a particular understanding of the subliminal power that music can provide [and] seems to thoroughly understand the essential rhythms of stories.” “Lord of the Rings” earned Shore his three Oscars and has remained an outsize part of his life in the hundreds of live performances of the scores around the world. (He returned to Middle Earth with Jackson for the three “Hobbit” films.) It also marked a turn in his life. “Once the trilogy was finished, my pencil rested,” said Shore, who promptly began looking beyond the movie theater to the concert hall — “just for the finer brushstroke.” “I had done a lot in film. I did a lot of the things that I had set out to do when I was younger,” he said, “where the concert pieces seemed like I could stretch out a bit. I could write in a more complex counterpoint if I wanted. It allowed a freedom to express ideas in music.” He spent three years adapting “The Fly” into an avant-garde opera, which premiered in 2008. (The New York Times deemed it “ponderous and enervating . . . and the problem is Mr. Shore’s music.”) Since then, he has written a song cycle (“A Palace Upon the Ruins”) with text by his wife, Elizabeth Cotnoir, a piano concerto for Lang Lang (“Ruin and Memory”) and a cello concerto for Sophie Shao (“Mythic Gardens”). The latter two will make their recording debut Feb. 17 on Shore’s label, Sony Classical. “There’s still a real interest and a love of film,” Shore said, “but I’ve got a bit of catching up to do.” Last year, he provided a piano-driven score for Tom McCarthy’s Oscar-winning “Spotlight.” McCarthy was impressed with the veteran composer’s collaborative nature. “He sort of leads with his mind, but he has a tremendous amount of heart,” McCarthy said. “You can feel that in his music, and you can feel it in his process. He’s a guy who doesn’t just start scoring — he starts talking a lot about themes and understanding the material and the journey of the story before he starts to write a note.” The source of Shore’s deferential personality is easy to pinpoint. “I think his Canadianness is very much a part of what makes him able to do that shape-shifting,” Cronenberg said. “It’s really part of the Canadian tradition — politically, even — to not impose yourself in an aggressive way but to be willing and able to compromise and to understand, therefore, other people’s point of view.” “The seriousness of approach, I think, and the modesty of it is very Canadian,” Michaels agreed. “Not fighting for credit as much as fighting for it to be good.” Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Shore’s record label is Howe Records. It is Sony Classical.

An airport runway was closed and flights diverted after an unexploded World War II bomb was found next to a highway close to Frankfurt airport. The 500kg device was discovered during construction work on a stretch of the A3 highway near Offenbach. Police shut off a 1,000 metre area of the autobahn, which is one of the busiest stretches of road in the country, causing long traffic jams. Disruptions: A stretch of the A3 highway near Offenbach was closed after the 500kg explosive was found. One of the airport's four runways was then closed for landings after experts warned that aircraft should avoid flying over the bomb site. The device had been outfitted with a chemical detonator, increasing the difficulty of the bomb disposal's job, who finally decided to destroy it in a controlled explosion after detonation was deemed impossible. Planes were allowed to take off from the runway, but only in the direction away from the bomb site. One of the airport's runways was closed for landings after experts advised against flying over the bomb site. Live bombs dating back to the aerial bombing of Germany during World War II are still frequently found. Most local authorities have teams working full-time to detect and defuse them. In May, bomb disposal experts were called to Reddish, in Manchester, after a live World War Two bomb was found in an outside toilet. Police evacuated people from 10 houses on the street and neighbouring roads for around two hours, and set up a 100m cordon.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Other historians find incongruity in the proposition that the very place where the vast number of the scholars that influenced the scientific revolution received their education should also be the place that inhibits their research and the advancement of science. In fact, more than 80% of the European scientists between 1450–1650 included in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography were university trained, of which approximately 45% held university posts. It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable, and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development. There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system, which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world. However, university professors still utilized some autonomy, at least in the sciences, to choose epistemological foundations and methods. For instance, Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction. Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities, and the debates surrounding that adoption, which led to more mechanistic approaches to scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change. There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities. Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged, when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability, and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources.

Article: Genital warts are a common complication of HPV, though the transmission of HPV does not always lead to genital warts. Approximately 360,000 individuals acquire genital warts each year in the United States alone. Genital warts may appear as a small bump or group of bumps. There is great variance in the appearance and size of genital warts. They may appear small or large, raised off the skin or flat, or may appear lumpy like a cauliflower crown. If left untreated, genital warts may go away on their own, they may remain unchanged, or they may spread and grow larger. Genital warts that grow large and spread to the birth canal may cause complications during a pregnancy. Cervical cancer is the second most common form of cancer in women living in under-developed regions of the world. In 2012 it caused almost 270,000 deaths worldwide. Cervical cancer usually does not present any noticeable symptoms until it enters advanced stages, at which point it can become life-threatening and difficult to treat. Having regular Pap tests can help identify and treat cervical cancer before it enters the advanced stages. Regular Pap tests are the most effective means of detecting and preventing cervical cancer. Though cervical cancer is the most serious complication related to HPV transmission, the virus has been linked to numerous other types of cancers that can affect both men and women worldwide. Vulvar cancer - cancer of the vulva (the outer portion of female genitalia) is often caused by HPV. Almost seven out of every ten cases of vulvar cancer, and virtually all incidents of vulvar pre-cancer, are linked to HPV transmission. Routine physical examinations by a medical professional are the best means of detecting vulvar cancer. Vaginal cancer - over seven out of every ten cases of vaginal cancer are linked to HPV transmission. The same Pap tests used to detect cervical cancer are sometimes used to detect vaginal cancer and pre-cancer. Penile cancer - men exposed to high-risk HPV strains may develop cancer of the penis. In fact, roughly six out of every ten cases of penile cancer are linked to HPV transmission. There is currently no approved screening test to detect the early stages of penile cancer, and many cases go undetected until the later stages of cancer. Anal cancer - nearly all cases of squamous cell cancer of the anus across both men and women are caused by HPV transmission. The best way to detect anal cancer is by performing an anal cytology test, sometimes referred to as an anal Pap test. These exams are typically only performed on individuals determined to be at a high risk of cancer formation, such as people with compromised immune systems or individuals who have received an organ transplant. Mouth and throat cancer - over seven out of every ten cases of cancer in the back of the throat (including the tongue and tonsils) are linked to HPV transmission. Mouth and throat cancer, also known as oropharyngeal cancer, does not currently have any approved screening test to detect the early stages. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article is about a problem called genital warts, which can happen when people get a germ called HPV.

The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

Q:In common everyday speech, speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: sound travels most slowly in gases; it travels faster in liquids; and faster still in solids. For example, (as noted above), sound travels at 343 m/s in air; it travels at 1,480 m/s in water (4.3 times as fast as in air); and at 5,120 m/s in iron (about 15 times as fast as in air). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at 12,000 metres per second (27,000 mph);[1] (about 35 times as fast as in air) which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions.

Short movie review: is to be mesmerised Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the provided short movie review, it appears that the critic is thinking positively of the movie. The word \\"mesmerised\\" is generally used to depict a state of awe or fascination and is usually associated with positive feelings. It suggests that the film was incredibly captivating, engaging the critic's attention completely and providing an engrossing cinematic experience. To be mesmerized can mean that the content, acting, music, cinematography, direction, or even editing of the movie was so phenomenal that it left the critic absorbed and transfixed. This state of trance can only be achieved if the movie's elements were praiseworthily executed and successfully managed to draw the critic into its world. Therefore, it seems that the critic highly appreciated the movie for its capability to resonate on a profound level. However, precise interpretation might require more context about the film genre and what specific aspects mesmerized the critic. For instance, they could have been mesmerized by mind-bending visual effects in a fantasy movie, by the complexity of plot in an intricate thriller, by profound performances in a drama, or by the grandeur of production in a period piece. But as per the limited information available, and considering that \\"mesmerizing\\" is typically a high compliment in movie reviews, it can be affirmed that the critic seemed to have a positive opinion about the movie. It is likely that they would recommend others to see the movie too since they found it so entrancing. Their positive review could increase the public interest in the movie, contributing to higher viewership and possibly greater box office success for the movie as well.

As the Xbox 360 uses a modified version of the UPnP AV protocol, some alternative UPnP servers such as uShare (part of the GeeXboX project) and MythTV can also stream media to the Xbox 360, allowing for similar functionality from non-Windows servers. This is possible with video files up to HD-resolution and with several codecs (MPEG-2, MPEG-4, WMV) and container formats (WMV, MOV, TS). If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What PC operating system is required to stream content to a 360?","completion":"To stream content to an Xbox 360, a PC operating system of either Windows Media Center or Windows XP with Service pack 2 or higher is required. The Xbox 360 uses a modified version of the Universal Plug and Play Audio Visual (UPnP AV) protocol for streaming, so the computer needs to be compatible with this technology. This protocol allows devices to share audio, video, and photos over a network. Hence, the system is ideal for sending content from your PC to the Xbox 360. Windows Media Center, available on most versions of Windows (especially Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8), is particularly set up to work smoothly with the Xbox 360. You can stream digital media content like recorded TV, music, and pictures from your computer to your Xbox 360 console using the Windows Media Center Extender. Windows XP with Service pack 2 or higher, while older, is also capable of streaming content to an Xbox 360. The Service pack installed significantly enhances the multimedia capabilities of the operating system and permits better integration with newer devices. Additionally, it's worth noting that the Xbox 360 also supports streaming from alternative UPnP servers like uShare and MythTV. This allows for similar functionality even if you're not running a Windows operating system, though the streaming setup with these systems might be a bit more difficult. The supported video formats that can be streamed include MPEG-2, MPEG-4, and WMV container formats such as WMV, MOV, TS. This gives quite a wide range of options for the media types that can be shared between your computer and the Xbox 360. Remember that all these processes ideally ought to be carried out in a local-area network, due to bandwidth considerations. Streaming content over a network ensures smoother, less interrupted playback, as long as your network connection is stable and efficient. In conclusion, to stream content to an Xbox 360, you would need at least a PC operating with Windows XP (with Service pack 2 or higher) or Windows Media Center. If you have non-Windows servers, the usage of UPnP servers such as uShare and MythTV is also possible for streaming content to the Xbox 360."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Rosa Moline is the dissatisfied, restless wife of Lewis, a small-town Wisconsin doctor. She is easily bored, uninterested in her husband's career or in anything to do with her current circumstances. She has long desired a glamorous life, in a world where she can have expensive things and meet truly interesting people. For over a year, she has been having an affair with Neil Latimer, a Chicago businessman who owns the local hunting lodge. Tired of waiting for him to ask her to marry and move to Chicago, Rosa extorts money from Lewis' patients - who often do not have cash but pay him in produce or in other non-financial ways - to finance her trip to the city. Lewis does not yet know about the affair, but he is used to his wife's unease with her life; he discovers the extortion and throws the cash at her, telling her that if she goes to Chicago, she need not come back. Rosa immediately leaves and fully expects Latimer to welcome her. However, he avoids her at first, then when he does meet her, he tells her he is love with another woman and intends to marry. Devastated, Rosa returns to Wisconsin, where Lewis forgives her. She soon becomes pregnant and, briefly, seems to be trying to settle down. During a party for Moose, the man who tends to the hunting lodge, Latimer shows up. He lets Rosa know that he has changed his mind and wants to marry her. Moose overhears the couple planning for her divorce and their marriage; the next day, as everyone is heading out on a hunting trip, Moose bets that her lover will not want the baby and advises Rosa that she had better tell Latimer about it, or he will. To prevent that eventuality, she shoots and kills Moose during the hunt. She is acquitted of this act by claiming she thought he was a deer. answer the following question: What does the man who tends the hunting lodge threaten to tell the Chicago businessman about?

Select from: * Leafs. * Eggs. * Milk. * Fruit.","completion":"Your statement is referencing the process of how plants, particularly fruit-bearing plants, provide us the fundamental ingredients for a multitude of food items, including a type of dessert normally served with ice cream. This seems to describe an apple pie, peach pie, or some other form of fruit pie. The correct answer to your query, in this case, would be \\"Fruit.\\" To explain this in more detail, let's start by looking at the process of how plants bear fruits: Fruit-bearing plants undergo a process called pollination, which involves the transfer of pollen from the male reproductive organs to the female reproductive organs of a plant. This begins the process of fruit growth. The fertilized plant will produce a seed, and the plant's ovary will grow around this seed to form the fruit. This process, from pollination to fruit maturity, can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months, depending on the type of fruit-bearing plant. The fruit can contain one or more seeds that can be re-planted to produce more fruit-bearing plants. The fruit itself, made up of ripened ovary and surrounding tissue, is often sweet and serves as an attractive source of food for animals. This has evolved as a way for the plant to spread its seeds. When an animal consumes the fruit, the seeds pass through their digestive system unharmed, and are then dispersed in a new location where they can grow into a new fruit-bearing plant. And these fruits from the plants are widely utilized in different food preparations, one of which is a delicacy that comprises a sweet substance with a decorative component of flour at the bottom. This is a clear representation of a fruit pie, which indeed is often served with a scoop of ice cream on top. So looking at the entirety of the process, from plant pollination to fruit pie production, it's clear how essential fruits are, not just in providing us with daily nutrients and health benefits, but also in contributing to culinary diversity, creating delectable desserts that many of us enjoy. Fruit's delicacy provides a wonderful combination when paired with flour-based pie crust and ice cream, resulting in a sweet treat that is a common favorite across many cultures. So, as a long answer, plants are indeed the source of fruit, which in turn becomes the fundamental ingredient in this delectable dessert that you seem to be gracious about."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who witnessed a performance by a rude singer? ? Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish.

Capitalize this past sentence correctly.","completion":"As DLL files are created to support other programs and software working well, the data and functions are actually shared by many programs. When you uninstall a program, CNBXLF4.DLL may be mistakenly deleted. Here is an extended explanation on this: Dynamic-Link Library, commonly known as DLL, is a file format used in Microsoft Windows to hold multiple instructions and pieces of code that many software applications will need to execute common tasks. The purpose is to promote code reuse, efficient use of memory, and disk space. This way, a program can use a DLL's code to execute a specific activity, as opposed to writing their own code for that task. Even multiple applications can use the DLL's functionality at the same time. Given their critical role, DLL files are shared among various software applications. Consequently, when software is installed, it may also bring certain DLL files that are essential to its operation. However, other applications installed on your system can also use these DLL files. Circumstances can arise when uninstalling a program, where certain DLL files, such as CNBXLF4.DLL, may accidentally get deleted. This can happen if the uninstaller mistakenly identifies the DLL file as being exclusive to the software it is removing, not realizing or not being programmed to realize, that the DLL is shared with other applications. Consequently, the deletion of such DLL files may lead to other software applications on your system that rely on the DLL, to malfunction. They may throw error messages, crash or not operate correctly because the DLL they were using is no longer available. This is why uninstalling a program requires careful handling to avoid the unintended deletion of shared DLL files. To avoid such situations, it is advisable to utilize reliable uninstalling software that comes with features to detect shared DLLs and prevent their accidental deletion during an uninstallation process. Additionally, routine backups of your system can ensure that necessary DLL files can be restored in case they get deleted."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The atmosphere was warm and inviting, with soft lighting and comfortable seating. The staff greeted us with enthusiasm and promptly led us to our table. The menu was extensive, offering a diverse selection of dishes to cater to various tastes and dietary preferences. Our server, Sarah, was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and offered thoughtful recommendations for each of us. She suggested the grilled halibut for me, which turned out to be a great choice. The fish was cooked to perfection - moist, tender, and full of flavor. It came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes that were just the right amount of creamy. My friends ordered the beef tenderloin, seafood paella, and a vegetarian risotto. Each dish was beautifully presented, and my friends raved about the taste and quality. The portion sizes were generous, but we still managed to find some room for dessert. Sarah recommended the chocolate lava cake, and it was heavenly. The cake was moist and rich, with a gooey center that oozed decadent chocolaty goodness. The freshly whipped cream and raspberry coulis that accompanied it was the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. Throughout our meal, the service remained attentive, friendly, and efficient. We never felt rushed, nor did we experience any long waits between courses. The entire staff at Delicious Bites went above and beyond to ensure our evening was enjoyable. In addition to the extraordinary food and service, the prices at Delicious Bites were quite reasonable, especially considering the quality of the ingredients and the portion sizes. The extensive wine list, featuring both local and international wines, catered to various price points and matched well with the dishes on offer. To sum up, our evening at Delicious Bites was an outstanding experience. The welcoming ambiance, attentive service, innovative dishes, and great value all contributed to a memorable night. I highly recommend Delicious Bites to anyone looking for a stellar dining experience. We will undoubtedly be returning to this restaurant in the near future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this article, we will explore the work and ideologies of two extraordinary pioneers in these fields: Kathleen Sebelius and Lisa Jackson. Both women have tirelessly worked to create awareness and implement policies to ensure healthier, sustainable, and equitable societies. Kathleen Sebelius: Championing Health and Human Services Step 1: Introduce Kathleen Sebelius and her role in public health. Kathleen Sebelius, the former Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, is well-known for her work in public health. She held this position from 2009 to 2014 under former President Barack Obama. Prior to this, Sebelius served as the governor of Kansas from 2003 to 2009. Step 2: Discuss Sebelius' work and accomplishments in the field. Sebelius played a crucial role in implementing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States. This transformative healthcare legislation expanded healthcare access for millions of Americans and worked to address existing inequalities in healthcare coverage. She also championed the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, helping to destigmatize mental health and ensure more equitable treatment and coverage for people suffering from mental health and addiction issues. Lisa Jackson: A Leader in Environmental Protection Step 1: Introduce Lisa Jackson and her role in environmental protection Lisa Jackson, the former Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under President Obama, has been a fierce advocate for environmental justice. She led the EPA from 2009 to 2013 and was the first African-American woman to hold the position. Step 2: Discuss Jackson's work and achievements in the field. During her tenure at the EPA, Jackson oversaw the development of strict emissions standards for cars and trucks, which contributed to cleaner air quality and helped to promote the shift towards sustainable transportation options. She also played a key role in dealing with BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spill, ensuring a transparent and accountable response to the spill's massive impact on the environment and human health. The Intersection of Health, Environment, and Justice Step 1: Explain the connection between health, environment, and justice. Sebelius and Jackson's work exemplify the importance of considering health and the environment together. Environmental factors significantly affect public health, and social and economic disparities often serve to exacerbate these impacts. By addressing the interconnectedness of health, environment, and justice, we can work towards solutions that target the root causes of these issues and foster a more equitable society. Step 2: Provide examples connecting health, environment, and justice through the work of Sebelius and Jackson. Examples include Sebelius' focus on expanding healthcare access through the ACA, which helped to address environmental health disparities faced by economically disadvantaged communities. Jackson's environmental justice work at the EPA helped to protect communities located near toxic waste sites and other sources of environmental hazards to ensure that low-income and minority individuals have the same protection from environmental and health harm as other citizens. Conclusion: The contribution of Kathleen Sebelius and Lisa Jackson in the fields of health, environment, and justice has had a profound impact on American society. By promoting policies that protect the environment and ensure equitable access to healthcare and mental health services, these inspiring leaders have demonstrated that a just, healthy, and sustainable future is within reach."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Text: There are reports of stingers breaking off in wounds, but this may be rare. This would not be fatal to the stingray as it will be regrown at a rate of about 1.25 to 2 centimetres (0.49 to 0.79 in) per month (though with significant variations depending on the size of the stingray and the exact species). Contact with the stinger causes local trauma (from the cut itself), pain, swelling, and muscle cramps from the venom, and possible later infection from bacteria or fungi. Immediate injuries to humans include, but are not limited to: poisoning, punctures, severed arteries and veins, and occasionally death. Fatal stings are very rare, but can happen, infamously including Steve Irwin. In Irwin's case, the stinger penetrated his thoracic wall, causing massive trauma. Question: does the barb on a stingray grow back?","completion":"Yes, the barb on a stingray can grow back. If a stingray loses its barb, it can grow a new one. It takes some time, like a month or more, and it can be different for each stingray. But they can grow a new barb if they lose the old one."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: well now that's Sentence 2: It's likely not Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Entailment in linguistics refers to a relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence guarantees or brings about the truth of the other. In this case, the two sentences provided do not have any causative or inferential relationship. Sentence 1: \\"well now that's\\" This sentence is incomplete and requires additional context to establish its meaning. It seems to express a reaction or evaluation to a situation or information, but without more information, it is difficult to determine the subject or the intended message. Sentence 2: \\"It's likely not\\" This sentence suggests that something is probably not true, valid, or possible. However, it is also a vague statement that requires further context to determine what specifically is being referred to. Since both sentences lack clear context and do not have a direct relationship with each other, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In order for there to be entailment, the two sentences need to have a logical and coherent connection, such that the truth of one directly implies the truth of the other.

The adoption of the mother of Jesus as a virtual goddess may represent a reintroduction of aspects of the worship of Isis. \\"When looking at images of the Egyptian goddess Isis and those of the Virgin Mary, one may initially observe iconographic similarities. These parallels have led many scholars to suggest that there is a distinct iconographic relationship between Isis and Mary. In fact, some scholars have gone even further, and have suggested, on the basis of this relationship, a direct link between the cult of Mary and that of Isis.\\" Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What is the name of the goddess that the Virgin Mary met in Egypt?","completion":"Considering the context of the given statement that explores potential iconographic similarities between the Egyptian goddess Isis and Virgin Mary, it is important to note that the question about Virgin Mary meeting a goddess in Egypt is based on an assumption derived from the comparison made between these two figures from different religious and cultural backgrounds. In reality, there isn't any documentation or evidence to suggest that Virgin Mary met an Egyptian goddess during her time in Egypt. The story of Mary and Joseph taking baby Jesus to Egypt is mentioned in the Bible; however, it does not mention any encounter with a goddess. This question appears to be speculative and assumes a meeting based on the perceived similarities between the two figures. Thus, providing a name for a goddess that the Virgin Mary met in Egypt would be misleading as it doesn't have a factual basis in religious texts. Therefore, it is more appropriate to label the question as \\"unanswerable\\" within the current context and scope of information available."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: Peter for the following movie plot: In Manhattan, cockroaches are spreading the deadly \\"Strickler's disease\\" that is claiming hundreds of the city's children. Entomologist Susan Tyler uses genetic engineering to create what her colleague (and husband) Peter Mann and she call the Judas breed, a large insect that releases an enzyme which causes the roaches metabolism to speed up and starve themselves to death. It successfully kills off the disease. The released population was all-female and designed with a lifespan of only a few months, so that it would only last one generation. Three years later, a reverend is chased and dragged underground by a strange assailant. The only witness is Chuy, the \\"special\\" ward of an immigrant subway shoe-shiner named Manny. Two kids later sell a \\"weird bug\\" from the subway to Susan, which she performs test on, and realises is part of the Judas breed. Looking for more valuable specimens, the kids go down the tracks where they find a large egg sac and are then killed. Chuy also enters the church to find \\"Mr. Funny Shoes\\" and is abducted. Peter, CDC officer Josh and subway cop Leonard enter the maintenance tunnels to investigate but Peter and Leonard get separated from Josh, who is then killed trying to find his way back up. Susan is taken from the train platform by one of the creatures and brought into the tunnels. Manny also enters the tunnels in search of Chuy and comes across Susan, whom he rescues along with Peter and Leonard, before they barricade themselves in a train car. Susan surmises that the Judas' accelerated metabolism has allowed it to reproduce and that they have evolved to mimic their human prey. The group formulates a plan to get the car moving: Peter will switch the power on, and Manny will switch the tracks. Susan projects that the Judas will spread throughout the tunnels unless they are able to kill the single fertile male. Manny finds Chuy but is killed by the male Judas, so Susan goes in search of him but finds only Chuy. Leonard's injured leg starts bleeding heavily, so he causes a distraction...

Write the answer: What country, including land from subtropical plains to sub-alpine peaks of over 7,000m (23,000 ft), and currently a monarchy, was rated in 2006 as the eighth happiest country in the world?","completion":"The country referred to is the Kingdom of Bhutan, a small landlocked nation nestled in the eastern Himalayas between China and India. Bhutan covers an area of approximately 38,394 square kilometers (14,824 square miles) and is characterized by its diverse topography, ranging from subtropical plains in the southern part of the country to the towering sub-alpine peaks in the north, some of which reach over 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) in elevation. Bhutan is a constitutional monarchy with a rich cultural history that dates back to the 8th century AD. The monarchy was established in 1907 and the current (and fifth) king, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, ascended the throne in 2006 after his father, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, abdicated in his favor. In 2006, Bhutan was rated as the eighth happiest country in the world, according to a global survey assessing life satisfaction from the perspective of residents. Interestingly, Bhutan has been a pioneer in utilizing an alternative measure of national progress called Gross National Happiness (GNH). This concept was first introduced by King Jigme Singye Wangchuck in 1972 with the aim of measuring the well-being and quality of life of its citizens, focusing on four pillars: sustainable and equitable socio-economic development, environmental conservation, cultural preservation, and good governance. Bhutan's landscape features pristine forests, fertile valleys, and rugged mountains, making it a haven for a wide variety of flora and fauna. While the southern lowlands are home to subtropical forests that provide habitats for animals such as elephants, tigers, and deer, the high-altitude regions in the north harbor the elusive snow leopard, Himalayan black bears, and blue sheep. This environmental diversity has contributed to Bhutan's status as a biodiversity hotspot and a sought-after destination for nature enthusiasts. Culturally, Bhutan is predominantly Buddhist, with Vajrayana Buddhism being the state religion. This spiritual tradition is deeply ingrained in the daily lives of the Bhutanese people and is evident in the numerous monasteries, temples, and religious festivals that dot the country. Bhutanese architecture is also unique, characterized by its use of locally available materials like wood, stone, and earth, and steeply pitched roofs to facilitate rainwater drainage in the mountainous terrain. In conclusion, the Kingdom of Bhutan is renowned for its diverse landscapes, ranging from subtropical plains to sub-alpine peaks, and its current status as a monarchy. Its recognition as the eighth happiest country in the world in 2006 is a testament to the Bhutanese government's commitment to prioritizing the well-being of its citizens and its successful implementation of Gross National Happiness as an alternative to traditional indicators of national progress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Described as \\"the theatre's greatest living poet\\" since Samuel Beckett, Müller is arguably the most important German dramatist of the 20th century after Bertolt Brecht. His \\"enigmatic, fragmentary pieces\\" are a significant contribution to postmodern drama and postdramatic theatre. - Samuel Barclay Beckett (13 April 1906 22 December 1989) was an Irish avant-garde novelist, playwright, theatre director, and poet, who lived in Paris for most of his adult life and wrote in both English and French. He is widely regarded as among the most influential writers of the 20th century. - Dimiter Gotscheff ( Bulgarian : ; born 26 April 1943 in Parvomai , Bulgaria ; died 20 October 2013 in Berlin ) was a Bulgarian - born German theater director . His work is often associated with dramatist and director Heiner Müller . - The European Plain or Great European Plain is a plain in Europe and is a major feature of one of four major topographical units of Europe - the \\"Central and Interior Lowlands\\". It is the largest mountain-free landform in Europe, although a number of highlands are identified within it. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - The notion of postdramatic theatre was established by German theatre researcher Hans-Thies Lehmann in his book \\"Postdramatic Theatre\\", summarising a number of tendencies and stylistic traits occurring in avant-garde theatre since the end of the 1960s. The theatre which Lehmann calls postdramatic is not primarily focused on the drama in itself, but evolves a performative aesthetic in which the text of the performance is put in a special relation to the material situation of the performance and the stage. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate.

Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment.

Q: Kezia Dugdale strongly criticised Richard Leonard's approach to Brexit in a letter that that was later leaked. She also accused him of \\"censoring\\" two of the party's MEPs over their support for another referendum on EU membership. A Labour source said this had been the result of a \\"misunderstanding\\". And he said Mr Leonard had written to the two MEPs - Catherine Stihler and David Martin - to apologise. The party's conference in Dundee begins on Friday and lasts until Sunday. In her letter, Ms Dugdale said she wanted to \\"formally complain\\" to Mr Leonard about the way in which Ms Stihler and Mr Martin had been treated ahead of the conference. She also claimed Ms Stihler's section in the conference guide had originally included a statement in support of a so-called People's Vote on Brexit which had been changed without her consent. Ms Dugdale wrote: \\"From what I can see from the agenda, there is no formal opportunity for them to speak or indeed a formal item to thank them for their combined 55 years of electoral service to the party. \\"If that wasn't bad enough, I was shocked to discover from Catherine that her statement in the conference guide had been amended without her consent. \\"When that was challenged, she was told it was on your direction and that you had the final say on what was printed.\\" Ms Dugdale, who has been a prominent campaigner for another referendum on Brexit, claimed the section had originally said: \\"Brexit is a tragedy for our country and for the workers and communities that Labour represents. \\"That's why David and Catherine fully support a People's Vote with the option to remain in the EU.\\" However, according to Ms Dugdale, the section was replaced with: \\"The complete mess the Tories have made of Brexit means they are putting Scottish people's jobs and our industries at risk. Labour will always put them first.\\" Ms Dugdale said changing the section without Ms Stihler's permission was \\"wholly inappropriate\\", adding: \\"I can't possibly understand why you would seek to censor her final words to party members, especially since what she states is party policy and has been since last September.\\" A Labour source told BBC Scotland: \\"This was a genuine misunderstanding and Richard has written to Catherine and David to apologise.\\" Mr Leonard was also criticised in the email for his stance on Brexit, with Ms Dugdale expressing her disappointment that his support for holding a People's Vote had not come sooner. She wrote: \\"You know that I've found the party's position on Brexit and a second EU referendum disappointing for some time. \\"As I said at group last week and repeatedly over the past few months, I don't believe there is such a thing as a good Brexit or indeed a 'jobs first Brexit'. \\"The move towards supporting a People's Vote is a welcome one, but it should have happened much, much earlier. I note from your roundtable with journalists last week that you'd sooner we left the EU than give people a final say. \\"That's disappointing for the many party members who fervently back a final say and indeed all of our voters who are now a bit lost for a home.\\" Mr Leonard is a close ally of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who had previously resisted pressure from Remain supporters in his own party to get behind another referendum, insisting he preferred to force a general election. But Mr Corbyn announced a change of heart last month, telling his MPs: \\"One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May's overwhelmingly rejected deal. \\"That's why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country.\\" Mr Leonard later told BBC Scotland he backed the move, saying it could be the only way to break the deadlock over Brexit at Westminster. He also said he was \\"disappointed\\" that Labour's investigation into claims of Islamophobia against a Dumfries and Galloway councillor was taking so long. Jim Dempster was suspended by Labour in March of last year after admitting telling transport officials that \\"no-one would have seen [then-transport minister Humza Yousaf] under his burka\\". Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland he was hurt that the case had still not been dealt with almost a year after it was referred to Labour's national disciplinary body in London. But Mr Leonard said: \\"The case is being dealt with through due process. I'm disappointed that it's taking as long as it has - the person involved in the complaint is still suspended from the Labour Party and I hope this will be resolved very quickly indeed\\". Mr Dempster apologised to Mr Yousaf at the time, saying he was \\"thoroughly ashamed and embarrassed\\" by the comments he had made, and that \\"my ignorance is totally inexcusable.\\" A:","completion":"\\"Kezia Dugdale Criticizes Richard Leonard on Brexit and MEP Censorship\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Mary's (Elle Fanning) seemingly dull Christmas is suddenly filled with excitement and adventure following the arrival of her Uncle Albert, who gives her a Nutcracker as a gift. Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcracker – called N.C. – comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey. They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom. When Mary and N.C. go to the top of the Christmas tree, they meet a fairy and, as she begins to sing, N.C. looks at his hand, as it begins to turn human. Worried about this he runs into the sleigh, but leaves his human hand revealed, and Mary sees this. Mary, seeing this, goes to N.C. and rubs his hand as we see that he is in fact a human crying with tears of joy that he is human again. The snow fairy begins to sing and toys appear and begin to ice skate around the tree. N.C. takes Mary to the top to show her his city. The two come up with a plan to shut down the smoke factory. Suddenly N.C. is starting to turn back in to a doll. Then the tree is shaking and Mary falls off, only to awake to being in her room. Mary tries to tell her parents about it but they think she is not telling the truth. Later on in the movie N.C appears to have been killed, but Mary's tears and declaration of love restore him to life and transform him into a prince, his true form. The rats are all defeated and overthrown, but now Mary must reluctantly awaken from her dream. Before she is fully awake, N.C. promises that they will meet again. When Mary then goes to Uncle Albert's workshop she meets his new young neighbor, who is the exact image of the Nutcracker Prince and asks to be called N.C. The two become close friends, and the last shot of the film shows them ice skating together.

In the first quarter, St. Louis drew first blood as QB Marc Bulger completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt. The 49ers responded with kicker Joe Nedney getting a 28-yard TD field goal. In the second quarter, the Rams increased their lead with kicker Jeff Wilkins getting a 49-yard field goal for the only score of the period. After a scoreless third quarter, St. Louis continued its domination as Wilkins kicked a 35-yard field goal.

OPT: 1). negative 2). positive I think the answer is","completion":"1) Negative The sentiment embodied by this tweet leans towards the negative side for a few reasons. First, the individual has just woken up from a \\"really scary dream\\", which is something that can cause a feeling of anxiety, fear, or uneasiness. These emotions are generally associated with negativity and can have an impact on the person's overall mood. The fact that it was a really scary dream, as opposed to mildly unsettling, also intensifies the negative sentiment. Secondly, the weather plays a role in shaping the overall mood of this tweet. Describing the environment as being \\"all rainy\\" can evoke moods such as melancholy, sadness, and dreariness. Rainy weather often has the ability to dampen moods and, in some cases, intensify feelings of negativity. Combined with the fact that the person recently woke up from a scary dream, the rain might serve to amplify their emotional state, making the overall sentiment even more negative. It's important to note that people's reactions to rain can be subjective, with some individuals finding solace in the calming effect rain may have on their mood. However, given the context of the scary dream and the combination of factors mentioned above, it seems more likely that the tweet leans towards the negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pakistani nuclear scientist Khan was placed under house arrest in 2004. Admitted selling nuclear weapons technology to Iran, N. Korea, Libya, then recanted. Khan is regarded as a hero in Pakistan for helping develop nuclear weapons.","completion":"Title: U.S. Expresses Concern Over Pakistani Nuclear Scientist's Release from House Arrest Introduction: The United States has voiced concern over the recent release of Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan from house arrest. Khan, who was placed under house arrest in 2004, had admitted to selling nuclear weapons technology to countries such as Iran, North Korea, and Libya before later recanting his confession. Despite his involvement in nuclear proliferation, Khan remains a national hero in Pakistan for his role in helping the country develop nuclear weapons. U.S. Concerns with Khan's Release: The U.S. government has expressed its concern regarding Abdul Qadeer Khan's release from house arrest, stating that it could potentially lead to the reemergence of nuclear proliferation. As a key figure in the development of nuclear weapons technology, Khan's connections to countries like Iran, North Korea, and Libya pose a potential risk to global security. The United States has been actively working with the international community to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and technology. Khan's release raises questions about Pakistan's commitment to upholding non-proliferation norms and ensuring the containment of nuclear arms. Khan's Past Involvement in Nuclear Proliferation: Abdul Qadeer Khan is a controversial figure in the world of nuclear weapons development. In the 1970s, he played a pivotal role in advancing Pakistan's nuclear program, eventually leading the country to become a nuclear-armed state. However, his legacy took a dark turn when it was revealed that he had been involved in the black market sale of nuclear technology to countries like Iran, North Korea, and Libya. In 2004, Khan confessed to selling nuclear weapons technology to those countries but later recanted his confession. Regardless of his later denial, his actions resulted in a significant setback in international efforts to limit the spread of nuclear capabilities to rogue states. Khan's Status in Pakistan: Despite his involvement in illicit nuclear dealings, Abdul Qadeer Khan is considered a hero in Pakistan for his role in helping the country develop its nuclear weapons program. As Pakistan faced increasing security threats from neighboring countries like India, the development of nuclear weapons was seen as a crucial step in ensuring the country's safety. Khan's contributions to Pakistan's nuclear capabilities have made him a beloved figure among the Pakistani people, making his arrest and detention a politically sensitive issue within the country. As such, his release from house arrest has been applauded by some citizens who believe that he should not have been detained in the first place. Conclusion: The release of Abdul Qadeer Khan from house arrest in Pakistan has raised concerns from the United States and the international community about the potential resurgence of nuclear proliferation. As a key figure in the development of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, Khan's involvement in the sale of nuclear technology to countries like Iran, North Korea, and Libya poses a potential risk to global security. While Khan's release may be celebrated by some within Pakistan, the international community must remain vigilant to ensure that the efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons technology are upheld. Addressing the potential risks associated with Khan’s release will require continued collaboration and cooperation from the global community and a commitment to promoting non-proliferation norms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Food prices saw their biggest fall for over a year last month as prices continued to drop, a survey suggests.","completion":"Title: Food Prices Tumble as Market Signals Biggest Fall in a Year: A Comprehensive Survey Analysis Introduction In recent financial developments, food prices have witnessed their most substantial drop in over a year, with consumers and retailers reaping the benefits. This piece aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the causes, implications, and future outlook for food prices amidst this crucial economic turning point. Utilizing data from recent surveys, we will discuss the potential consequences of this decline on various stakeholders such as farmers, retailers, and consumers, and the international market, while also exploring the recurring fluctuations in food prices. Causes for the Decrease in Food Prices The significant drop in food prices can be attributed to a variety of factors. Key reasons behind this phenomenon include: 1. Favorable Weather Conditions: Better-than-expected weather has led to bountiful harvests and, in turn, higher food productivity on a global scale. The result has been an abundance of food supply leading to a decrease in food prices. 2. Reduced input costs: Key input prices such as oil and fertilizers have been declining. This has lowered production costs for farmers, subsequently bringing down food prices in the broader market. 3. The impact of international trade: With increasing global trade, food prices have become more sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations. The appreciation of the US dollar has contributed to relatively lower global food prices. 4. Technological advancements: The continuing development of agricultural technology has also played a significant role in raising food productivity, leading to increased supply and thus reduced food prices. Implications of the Decline in Food Prices The current decline in food prices is likely to have consequences for consumers, producers, and the global market as a whole. Some of these implications include: 1. Effect on Consumers: Overall, lower food prices benefit consumers by reducing their grocery bills and cost of living. Affordable food prices also contribute to food security, ensuring access to nutritional needs for all. 2. Impact on Producers: Farmers face income reductions due to the lower market prices received for their products. This may lead to instability in the farming sector, increased debt levels and possible ripple effects on the broader economy. 3. Decreased Inflation Rates: Lower food prices help reduce overall inflation, which can lead to more accessible interest rates and responsible purchasing behaviors for consumers. 4. Challenges in the Global Market: Declining food prices may exacerbate existing inequalities between developed and developing countries, as the former often benefits from lower import costs while the latter may face challenges in maintaining export revenue. Future Outlook and Industry Responses As food prices continue to drop, it is crucial to understand whether the trend is temporary or long-lasting. Various stakeholder groups can respond proactively to this situation: 1. Governments and International Organizations: Policy interventions to support struggling farmers might involve targeted subsidies, increasing financial assistance, or improving access to resources. Agricultural support programs can help ensure long-term food security and the resilience of farms. 2. Retailers: Retailers can take advantage of lower prices to promote sales and special offers to boost revenue and increase customer loyalty. 3. Consumers: Consumers can utilize this period of lower food prices to incorporate healthier and more diverse ingredients into their diets. They should also remain mindful of the potential negative environmental and social implications of excessively cheap food. 4. The Private Sector: The agriculture industry can invest in innovative technologies to foster sustainable production systems, reduce waste, and mitigate future shocks in food prices. Conclusion The present decline in food prices, the largest in over a year, presents both opportunities and challenges for consumers, producers, and the global market as a whole. Understanding the causes and implications of this trend will allow stakeholders to adapt and respond strategically, ensuring long-term resilience and sustainability for the food sector. Ultimately, the decrease in food prices should be approached with both awareness and critical thinking, as the potential consequences reverberate across the global economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:Topic: DC handgun ban Argument: Alternative measures can be taken in place of a ban to stem crime and murder. Solution:","completion":"The stance of the argument given is \\"against\\" the DC handgun ban. Step by Step Analysis: 1. First, examine the Topic and the Argument. The Topic is the \\"DC handgun ban\\". 2. Then, identify whether the argument is expressing a positive, negative, or neutral view of the Topic. 3. The argument text states \\"Alternative measures can be taken in place of a ban to stem crime and murder.\\" This suggests that the author proposes different approaches rather than a total ban on handguns in DC to tackle crime and murder issues. 4. This argument questions the effectiveness of the handgun ban, implying a disagreement with the Topic, thus it does not support the DC handgun ban. 5. Therefore, since this argument is not positively aligned with the Topic and it isn't neutral (as it does question the appropriateness of the ban), its stance is considered to be \\"against\\" the DC handgun ban. In short, the key was to determine the sentiment of the argument towards the topic. We can conclude that the argument is against the ban because it proposes different solutions to the crime and murder issues, thereby challenging the effectiveness and necessity of the handgun ban.

See options at the end It is better to use coffee filters instead of cloth rags to clean windows because the OPT: (I). coffee filters are lint free. (II). cloth rags are lint free.","completion":"It is better to use coffee filters instead of cloth rags to clean windows because the (I) coffee filters are lint free. This choice offers numerous advantages and benefits when it comes to window cleaning. To better understand the reasoning behind this preference, let's break down the characteristics of both coffee filters and cloth rags following the specific points mentioned in the options: 1. Lint-free properties: Coffee filters are made of fine paper and specifically designed to trap coffee grounds, which requires them to be lint-free. Their lint-free nature makes them an excellent choice for cleaning windows, as it minimizes the likelihood of leaving streaks, dirt, or debris. Cloth rags, on the other hand, may be made from various materials like cotton, microfiber, or terrycloth, which can produce lint. The lint may cling to the window's surface, causing streaks and leaving debris behind. 2. Absorbency: Coffee filters have moderate absorbency, which helps remove liquids like window cleaning solutions effectively. Cloth rags also have absorbency, but their absorbency can vary widely based on the material. Some cloth rags might cause the cleaning solution to spread, while others will readily absorb the solution and may leave streaks. 3. Softness: The material used to make coffee filters is soft and non-abrasive, greatly reducing the likelihood of scratching or damaging the window surface. Cloth rags may be made from materials that are soft or coarse, so it's essential to be cautious about the specific type of cloth rag. Microfiber cloth rags do offer softness and lint-free benefits, but coffee filters remain a viable option given their low cost and consistent effectiveness. 4. Economical and eco-friendly: Coffee filters are an affordable option for cleaning windows. They generally come in larger quantities and cost less than most cloth rags. Furthermore, reusing coffee filters for cleaning purposes is an eco-friendly way to give them a second life, reducing resource waste. Cloth rags are also reusable and an eco-friendly option; however, they require proper washing and maintenance to maintain their effectiveness. 5. Single-use and disposable: Coffee filters serve as disposable, one-time-use cleaning aids. They help in maintaining hygiene and avoiding cross-contamination, which may not be true with cloth rags if not cleaned thoroughly. In summary, using coffee filters instead of cloth rags to clean windows is a recommended approach due to their lint-free properties, absorbency, softness, economic and eco-friendly nature, and disposable characteristics. All these factors combined ensure that windows are cleaned effectively without streaks, debris, or scratches."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choices: - tissues - lungs - arteries - kidneys A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Kidneys The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs located below the ribcage near the middle of the back. They are vital to the human body as they serve multiple functions, including filtering waste products and excess substances from the bloodstream, regulating blood pressure, maintaining electrolyte balance, and producing hormones. Stones, infections, and diabetes are some potential threats to the health and proper functioning of the kidneys, and each of these issues can lead to severe complications if not addressed promptly. 1. Kidney stones: Kidney stones form when substances such as calcium, oxalate, and phosphorus, which are usually found in urine, become concentrated and crystalize. These hard deposits can range in size from tiny grains to large pebbles, and some may even be as big as a golf ball. When kidney stones grow large enough or move into the urinary tract, they can cause severe pain and discomfort. If not managed timely, these stones can lead to urinary tract infections and even kidney damage. 2. Infections: Kidney infections, most commonly caused by bacteria that enter the urinary tract and spread to the kidneys, can be a serious health concern. Symptoms may include fever, chills, back or flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and frequent urination. If left untreated, kidney infections can lead to permanent damage to the kidneys, as well as spread to the bloodstream and cause life-threatening complications. 3. Diabetes: Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the body's ability to properly process and use glucose. High blood sugar levels resulting from diabetes can damage blood vessels in the kidneys over time, ultimately affecting their ability to filter waste products effectively. This damage can lead to kidney disease, also known as diabetic nephropathy. According to the National Kidney Foundation, diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States. In summary, the health and functioning of the kidneys are vital to the overall well-being of our body. Ensuring the proper management of kidney stones, infections, and diabetes is crucial in maintaining the effectiveness of these paired organs and preventing further complications. Priority should be given to proper hydration, a balanced diet, regular exercise, and appropriate medical care to maintain kidney health and keep them functioning optimally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Countries like Denmark and Finland scored highest on the study of happiness in Europe carried out by Cambridge University, which also found that the sunny southern countries of Italy, Portugal and Greece got the least joy out of life. The survey entitled: \\"No Man is an Island\\" showed that countries where people enjoy time with friends and family, have trust in government and national institutions were more likely to be happy than those living in a sunny climate. The study rated respondent on their overall sense of happiness and life satisfaction on a _ of one to 10. Danes --who expressed a high level of trust in their politicians and public institutions--came top of the field at 8.3. Italians--who reported lower levels of satisfaction with their national quality of government--came last at 6.49.' \\"Italy, Greece, Portugal, Germany and France report the lowest levels of happiness while the Scandinavian Countries, Netherlands and Luxembourg report the highest,\\" the study said. Although Europeans are generally four times wealthier than their fathers and grandfathers, their levels of happiness are either equal to or lower than 40 years ago. The study also looked at factors contributing to happiness within countries and surprisingly found that an interest in politics actually increased happiness. Lead researcher Luisa Corrado said tax cuts and throwing money at social problems appeared to have no effect on the happiness of citizens when compared with government policies which strengthened and supported wider social networks. \\"People are less naive ( ) than one would expect, politicians need to adapted their policies and target specific problems in specific areas,\\" she said.

Berg village used many sandbags to protect from the dam overflowing. Creek village didn't use any sandbags, they were caught by surprise. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village was more affected by the dam overflowing? Hint: People protect areas that might flood with dams. In dire situations, they use sandbags ( Figure below ). Dams are usually very effective, but high water levels sometimes cause a dam to break. In that case, flooding can be catastrophic. Flood waters can also overflow a dam. People may line a river bank with levees to protect against floods. These are high walls that keep the stream within its banks during floods. Flood protection in one location sometimes causes problems elsewhere. For example, a levee in one location may just force the high water upstream or downstream. This will lead to flooding in a different location. Sometimes water gets so high that the river must be allowed to flood.

Context: Using newly captured French ports, the German Navy enjoyed success against an over-extended Royal Navy, using U-boats against British shipping in the Atlantic. The British Home Fleet scored a significant victory on 27 May 1941 by sinking the German battleship Bismarck. In November 1939, the United States, who were taking measures to assist China and the Western Allies, amended the Neutrality Act to allow \\"cash and carry\\" purchases by the Allies. In 1940, following the German capture of Paris, the size of the United States Navy was significantly increased. In September the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases. Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941. In December 1940 Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the US to become an \\"arsenal of democracy\\" and promoted Lend-Lease programmes of aid to support the British war effort. The US started strategic planning to prepare for a full scale offensive against Germany. At the end of September 1940, the Tripartite Pact formally united Japan, Italy and Germany as the Axis Powers. The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country, with the exception of the Soviet Union, which attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three. The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and Romania joined. Romania and Hungary would make major contributions to the Axis war against the USSR; in Romania's case partially to recapture territory ceded to the USSR.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the city Neill was placed in charge of the garrison? is inside the article: Neill was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him in charge of the Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks. He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack. Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Seguín left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer. In response to Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29.

Article: A South African farmer is receiving phone calls from his sheep after equipping them with cell phones to keep tabs on the flock amid recent livestock thefts, according to local press Wednesday. When the sheep call, it is always bad news for farmer Erard Louw of the Cape Town suburbs, as the phones around their necks are only set to switch on when the sheep start running, a sign that thieves have cut through the fences. \\"As they run it gives me a phone call and says 'Sheep One' or 'Sheep Two' and so on, so at least I know where to start looking because the farm is 750 hectares (1,850 acres),\\" Louw told the Cape Times daily. Louw attached the phone-like security device to the collars of four sheep in separate flocks after thieves sneaked in and stole 27 sheep and 13 lambs a couple of weeks ago, driving Louw to _ for ways to protect his animals. He said there was no use calling nearby police, as they were stationed too far away and in his experience they either lacked an available car or the vehicle was out of fuel or missing tyres -- also the work of thieves. According to Louw, the cell phones have already proved their worth, with one sheep-snatcher caught thanks to the device. Still, with theft attempts currently at their peak, given long winter nights and early nightfall, a few sheep-robbers managed to get away in spite of the device. \\"The phone did start ringing that night and I went out,\\" he said, but added that he was too late. Question: Why did Erard Louw attach the phone-like device to the sheep he raises? Options: A: Because he thought it was fun to do. B: Because the police there didn't care about animals.

By equipping the sheep with cell phones, Louw would receive a phone call whenever the sheep started running, indicating that thieves had cut through the fences.

Before the game, there will be a fireworks display and a fly over by some jet fighter planes. Jonathan has been looking forward to the fireworks for weeks because he has heard they are really great. The fireworks begin and their sound waves are of a high intensity. After the fireworks, the jets fly over and the sound waves for that has an even higher intensity than the fireworks did. But I can use this background: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. What is an answer for this question: Which sound less likely damaged Jonathan's ears?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If \\"someone is holding out a punctured ball in front of a brown dog with a red collar.\\", can we conclude \\"A person holds a punctured ball in front of a dog.\\"?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude that \\"A person holds a punctured ball in front of a dog\\" based on the given description, \\"someone is holding out a punctured ball in front of a brown dog with a red collar.\\" In the given description, the phrase \\"someone is holding out a punctured ball\\" clearly suggests that there is a person involved in this situation who is holding a ball that has been punctured. The action of holding the punctured ball is the focus of this part of the sentence. Next, the description provides further context about where the ball is being held: \\"in front of a brown dog with a red collar.\\" Based on this information, we can infer that there is a dog present, and its specific characteristics are being noted. The dog is mentioned as being brown and wearing a red collar. The sentence also states that the punctured ball is being held in front of this dog. To come to the conclusion \\"A person holds a punctured ball in front of a dog,\\" we can simplify the original description by removing the specific details about the dog's appearance (brown color and red collar), which may not be relevant to the main idea conveyed in the sentence. What matters for the conclusion is the mere presence of a person, a punctured ball, and a dog. Thus, by eliminating the details about the dog that are not essential to the overall action, we can deduce that \\"A person holds a punctured ball in front of a dog\\" is a correct and simplified conclusion based on the given description."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your doctor will focus on managing the medical disorder that's causing your neuropathy which will reduce symptoms and improve the nerve function in your feet. Your doctor may prescribe: Amitriptyline: This medication, originally used as an antidepressant, effectively treats neuropathic pain. You'll be started on the lowest dose, 25 mg a day. You can gradually increase the dosage to 150 mg per day. Always take the medication before going to bed. This drug should not be prescribed if you have a history of suicide risk. Pregabalin: This sedative is usually prescribed for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes. You will start with the lowest possible dose, and increase it as your doctor suggests. The maximum dosage is 50 to 100 mg, taken three times per day by mouth. Maximum dosing may be increased over time to 600mg/day, but dosage over this amount isn't effective. Duloxetine: This medication is usually prescribed for pain associated with neuropathic pain caused by diabetes. The dosage starts at 60 mg orally. The dosage can be doubled and your doctor will review the treatment after two months. While you can double the dosage, most doses over 60 mg a day are rarely more effective and may actually cause other problems. Combination therapies: Your doctor may recommend combining several medications such as TCA, venlafaxine, or tramadol. These can provide better results for neuropathy than any single medication alone. Your doctor may prescribe long-acting opiates to treat the pain of your neuropathy. This is usually determined on an individual basis, because side effects include dependence (addiction), tolerance (they become less effective over time), and headaches. Immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide may also be prescribed to treat a chronic type of neuropathy (dysimmune neuropathy) that may be resistant to other treatments. Depending on the cause of your neuropathy, your doctor may recommend a decompressive surgery. This will release pressure from entrapped nerves which will let them function correctly. Decompressive surgery is often done for carpal tunnel syndrome. But, certain types of hereditary neuropathy that cause issues in the foot and ankle can also benefit from decompressive surgery. Amyloid peripheral neuropathy may be treated by a liver transplant, since this type of neuropathy is caused by metabolic liver problems. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article is about different medications and treatments that can help people with neuropathy, which is a problem with the nerves in their body.

Both soldiers and other tactical personnel are trained to defend their organizations, nations, or groups and fight enemies to protect their interests and achieve specific strategic goals. This objective aligns most closely with wartime scenarios. 3. Conquer opponent: While conquering opponents may be part of the broader goal in a war, it's not the only thing participants have to do to another person. Some soldiers may only be engaged in a limited number of battles or specific strategic tasks during the war, meaning they might not be directly involved in conquering opponents. 4. Change society: Wars can bring about changes in society, but this is more often a byproduct rather than a direct objective individuals have to accomplish during a war. This transformation usually stems from the war's aftermath and the reconstruction that follows. 5. Kill: Although killing the enemy might be an unavoidable aspect of warfare, it's important to note that war encompasses more than just killing. Soldiers engage in other activities such as intelligence gathering, logistics, communication, and non-combat support roles. So, while killing might occur in a war, it's not the only thing participants \\"have to do.\\" In summary, the most accurate choice among the provided options would be \\"fight enemy,\\" as it represents the primary responsibility of soldiers and tactical personnel during a war. The other alternatives can be valid elements of war; however, they are not the most likely or direct actions that one has to do to another person in the context of a war."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: \\"This is just the first stage in an opening up of the Tube network to become 24 hours. \\"For 150 years, the Tube has been the beating heart of London, its tunnels and tracks providing the arteries that have transported millions of people and helped to drive the development and economic growth of our great city.\\" But are others equally as positive? No matter how this is dressed up by Boris Johnson and his officials, today's announcement is all about slashing almost Â£250 million from the annual London transport budget and the proposed cuts will decimate staffing levels and hit the most vulnerable users of Tube services the hardest. \\"RMT's position remains the same. We will work with sister unions and the public to fight these plans and that means using every campaigning, political and industrial tool at our disposal and our executive will be looking at a timetable and a strategy for that campaign, including a ballot for industrial action, later today. FSB London welcomes the new 24 hours Tube service at weekends and improvements to the reliability, capacity and accessibility of Tube services. London is a 24-hr international city and it should have a transport infrastructure to support the night time small business economy. However, whilst the 24-hour Tube service is a much-needed step forward, more needs to be done to address the problem of road congestion and the state of repair of roads in London. We are horrified at London Underground's dangerous plans to cut staff from Tube stations. Thousands of disabled and older passengers rely on station staff to help us travel safely and independently. Many of us - particularly visually impaired people and those with a learning impairment - simply cannot use ticket machines. When we first established the West End Commission at the start of this year, one of the major recommendations that came through was to run the Tube at later times at the weekend. We are delighted that our work with businesses, Peter Hendy, and the TfL team has now made that a reality. The West End Partnership may be in its infancy but we are already getting results that will benefit the entire West End of London. Later tubes = great. Closure of all ticket offices?! Idiocy of the highest order. London is a modern, global city and it is only right that we should have a transport system that reflects this. We support the work that TfL has done in putting in place plans to extend the Tube which will further help us compete with other major cities. The Mayor of London has today ripped up his manifesto promise to the people of London. As a result of his plans, Londoners will feel more anxious travelling at times when stations may be deserted.

Pick your answer from: (1). yes (2). it is not possible to tell (3). no","completion":"(2). It is not possible to tell When you hear a thump, it can indicate that there was some sort of impact or collision happening nearby. However, this sound on its own doesn't provide enough information to conclusively determine where it came from, or whether there was also a loud noise from the kitchen. There are several reasons for the uncertainty: 1. Ambiguity in the source of the thump: The thump sound could have originated from various places within your environment, not necessarily from the kitchen. For instance, it could have come from a neighboring room, outside, or even from an appliance or device that's within your vicinity. Without additional context, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact source based on just hearing a thump. 2. Difference in sound characteristics: A thump is generally a low-frequency, muffled sound that can result from various causes, such as objects falling or being struck. On the other hand, a loud noise from the kitchen might be sharp, sudden, or high-pitched (e.g., glass breaking, pots and pans clanging, an appliance malfunctioning). Without knowing the specific characteristics of both the thump and the loud noise, it's challenging to determine whether they are related or distinct events. 3. Time factor: Hearing a thump doesn't automatically suggest that there was a simultaneous loud noise in the kitchen. The thump could have occurred on its own earlier or later than the kitchen noise. Unless you have information indicating that the thump and the loud noise happened at the same time or were directly related, it's impossible to make a definite conclusion. 4. Echo and sound distortion: Depending on your location and the acoustics of your environment, sound can sometimes bounce off walls, furniture, and other surfaces, causing it to travel in multiple directions. This can lead to increased difficulty in accurately identifying sound sources or distinguishing between multiple sounds. For example, the thump you heard might have been an echo of a louder sound coming from the kitchen or another part of your living space. Without knowing the acoustical properties of your surroundings, it's hard to say for certain. In conclusion, it's not possible to tell whether \\"I heard a thump and a loud noise from the kitchen\\" based solely on the fact that you heard a thump. Further investigation or context is needed to accurately establish the relationship between the two sounds and determine the validity of the statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.). After reading the above, is \\"Ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state relationships, or dire consequences would be paid\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of relationships did Confucius say must be hierarchical and dictorial, and if they are not what would happen?\\"?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, the fifth of the six children (four girls and two boys) of Lukasz and Mary (Lancos) Musial (, MOO-show). His mother was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent and his father was a Polish immigrant who chose the name Stanislaw Franciszek for his first son, though his father always referred to Musial using the Polish nickname Stasiu, pronounced \\"Stashu\\". Musial frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered Lefty Grove his favorite ballplayer. Musial also had the benefit of learning about baseball from his neighbor Joe Barbao, a former minor league pitcher. Musial began the 1950s by posting a .350 batting average before participating in the 1950 All-Star Game, where in fan balloting he was the NL's number two choice. He had the longest hitting streak of his career during the 1950 season--a 30-game stretch that ended on July 27. With the Cardinals falling 14 games out of first place by September, manager Dyer used him at first base and all three outfield positions. New Cardinals manager Marty Marion led the team to a third-place finish in 1951, while Musial was named The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year. National media attention inadvertently turned to Musial a month before the 1952 season began, after Ty Cobb wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in Life magazine. Cobb singled out Musial and Phil Rizzuto as the only players \\"who can be mentioned in the same breath with the oldtime greats\\". Cobb went on to refer to Musial as \\"a better player than Joe DiMaggio was in his prime.\\" In response, Musial displayed his characteristic modesty, saying, \\"Cobb is baseball's greatest. I don't want to contradict him, but I can't say that I was ever as good as Joe DiMaggio.\\" The only major league pitching appearance of Musial's career occurred as a publicity stunt during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season. Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank Baumholtz, the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season. With Baumholtz batting right-handed for the first time in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner. The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career. The Cardinals franchise was up for sale in early 1953, and Musial and Schoendienst advised their friend and fellow duck-hunter Gussie Busch to consider buying the team. Busch used the resources of the Anheuser-Busch company to purchase the Cardinals, keeping Musial in St. Louis by averting the possibility of a move by the team to another city. The 1953 season marked Musial's 10th NL All-Star selection, and the 12th consecutive time he finished a major league season with a batting average above .300. Musial accomplished another historical feat on May 2, 1954, in a doubleheader in St. Louis against the New York Giants: he hit three home runs in the first contest, then added two more in the second to become the first major leaguer to hit five home runs in a doubleheader. In addition to his five home runs, he also hit a single in the first game, setting a new record of 21 total bases for a doubleheader. The only player besides Musial to hit five home runs in a doubleheader is Nate Colbert, who achieved the feat in 1972.

An Ohio school teacher who tried to sue her school district for discrimination after claiming she had a phobia of young children has had her case thrown out by court. Maria C. Waltherr-Willard, of Greenhills, Ohio, had worked as a high school French and Spanish teacher but alleged the school district reassigned her to teach junior high as a way of expediting her exit. The 63-year-old said she suffered from pedophobia, a fear of young children, and claimed the Mariemont school district knew of her condition and still assigned her to teach younger aged students. But she lost her appeal at a three-judge panel of the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. The teacher claimed she had suffered from pedophobia since the 1990s and had been told by school district that she would not have to teach young children. Mariemont sent Willard to a psychiatrist for an independent evaluation, which confirmed that her 'mental state...would disable her from teaching [children under 12].' For the next twelve years, Willard remained at the high school, where she taught all levels of French and the introductory course in Spanish. Ms Willard had worked as a high school French and Spanish teacher but alleged Mariemont High School (pictured) reassigned her to teach junior high as a way of forcing her to quit. Eventually, Mariemont decided to move its French courses online, which meant that the high school no longer needed a French teacher. The school district's superintendent, Paul Imhoff, met with the high-school principal, James Renner, to discuss what to do with Ms Willard. Mr Renner told Mr Imhoff about Willard's pedophobia and so he decided to transfer her to middle school. Ms Willard did not object to the new assignment, and later expressed 'enthusiasm' for teaching middle school children. Willard began teaching at the middle school in September 2010. Six months later, she asked Mr Imhoff to send her back to the high school, saying that her talents were 'underutilized' at the middle school and that another year there would have 'further detrimental impact on [her] health.' Mr Imhoff responded that '[t]here are currently no openings at Mariemont High School for the next year, but I will keep your request on file.' Shortly thereafter, Ms Willard retired. The teacher claimed her move to middle school caused her blood pressure to soar - but her case was rejected. Two years later, she brought the lawsuit against the school saying her transfer to the middle school had triggered her phobia. She claimed it caused her blood pressure to soar and forced her to retire in the middle of the 2010-11 school year. But the federal court upheld the decision of the lower court saying it was correct in ruling in the school district's favor on the various claims, including age and disability discrimination. It said Ms Willard had asked to school to employ her at the high school as a full-time Spanish teacher (on account of her disability), but it already had one and so did not need another. It also said she was not discriminated against for her age, as her replacement was 'not substantially younger than she was'. The court also rejected her claim she was treated with 'ridicule and insult' as any emails circulated behind her back did not refer to her age or pedophobia.

Write highlights for this article: Nixon calls his future wife Patricia Ryan 'dearest heart' and daydreams about their future together. Letters go on display this Friday at California museum to celebrate 100th birthday of Nixon's wife. By. Rachel Rickard Straus. PUBLISHED:. 06:54 EST, 12 March 2012. |. UPDATED:. 14:09 EST, 12 March 2012. Richard Nixon is remembered for many things – but very rarely for being a softy. However a series of love letters penned to his future wife long before his rise to power and fall from grace, reveal that at one time he was just another man in love. Decades before he became known to some as ‘Tricky Dick’, it was Nixon making up the nicknames – sweet ones to his future bride in gushy love notes that reveal a surprisingly soft and romantic side of the man taken down by Watergate. Young love: Then attorney Richard Nixon and his bride pose with their newly acquired marriage license in in front of a fireplace at the Mission Inn. They wed in the inn's wedding chapel on June 12, 1940. Love token: This delicately written letter from Pat Nixon to her husband is part of the display. ‘Dearest heart’, he addresses her, while recalling their first meeting in flowery prose and daydreaming about their future together. During their two-year courtship Nixon and his wife Patricia Ryan exchanged dozens of letters, six of which will be unveiled Friday at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, California, as part of an exhibit celebrating the 100th birthday of the woman Nixon playfully called his ‘Irish gypsy.’ ‘Every day and every night I want to see you and be with you. Yet I have no feeling of selfish ownership or jealousy,’ Nixon writes in one undated letter. ‘Let's go for a long ride Sunday; let's go to the mountains weekends; let's read books in front of fires; most of all, let's really grow together and find the happiness we know is ours.’ Eighteen years after his death, the correspondence offers a tiny window into a fiercely private side of Nixon that almost no one ever saw. ‘These letters are fabulous,’ said supervisory museum curator Olivia Anastasiadis. ‘It's a totally different person from the Watergate tapes that people know. President Nixon started out as an idealistic young man ready to conquer the world and with Pat Ryan he knew he could do it. There's a lot of hope, there's a lot of tenderness and it's very poetic. United: Richard Nixon and his wife Pat pose for photos while campaigning at the Rockefeller Center in New York in 1960. Tender: The highly personal letters reveal a totally different side to Nixon. Richard Nixon was secretly seeing a psychiatrist during the height of his political career, a new book has claimed. The former US president began seeing Dr Arnold Hutschnecker in 1952 with a string of complaints he thought were all in his mind, like back and neck pain and insomnia. ‘The Gumshoe and the Shrink’ claims that Nixon continued seeing the doctor for at least a decade including during the fateful 1960 election which he lost to John F Kennedy. Should the disclosures have been made public at the time, it is questionable whether voters would have allowed such an unstable man to become president. Author David Robb also reveals that in a foreshadowing of Watergate Nixon once hired a private eye to look into Kennedy’s health. According to the book, in 1960 Nixon’s team got into offices belonging to two doctors treating Kennedy looking for dirt that he was actually secretly ill. When Kennedy found this out his father bizarrely asked his friend Frank Sinatra to find the best investigator around so they could do their own digging. ‘He loved her, he was absolutely enthralled by her and that's all he thought about.’ The letters stand in stark contrast to the grim-faced leader forced to resign in 1974, disgraced. Instead, Nixon comes across as an ardent and persistent suitor in the letters, which date from 1938 to just before the couple's marriage in June 1940. The two met while auditioning for ‘The Dark Tower’ in the Southern California town of Whittier and dated for two years until Nixon proposed on the south Orange County cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. He later delivered her engagement ring in a small basket overflowing with mayflowers. The romantic touch and chivalry that Nixon brought to his seaside proposal comes through in the letters as well. In two of the handwritten notes,. Nixon — raised a Quaker — uses ‘thee’ instead of ‘you’ to refer to his. future bride, a pronoun that signals a special closeness in the Quaker. tradition. He also writes about himself in the third person, referring. to himself as a ‘prosaic person’ whose heart was nonetheless ‘filled. with that grand poetic music’ upon knowing her. ‘Somehow. on Tuesday there was something electric in the usually almost stifling. air in Whittier. And now I know. An Irish gypsy who radiates all that is. happy and beautiful was there,’ he wrote in one letter. ‘She left. behind her a note addressed to a struggling barrister who looks from a. window and dreams. And in that note he found sunshine and flowers, and a. great spirit which only great ladies can inspire. Someday let me see. you again? In September? Maybe?’ A. much more practical - and somewhat less impulsive — Pat Ryan replies in. one short note: ‘In case I don't see you before why don't you come. early Wednesday - and I'll see if I can burn a hamburger for you.’ The. object of Nixon's affection was slower to come around, but eventually. was just as smitten with Nixon as he was with her, said Ed Nixon,. Nixon's youngest brother. Exhibition: Six love letters go on display on Friday at the Richard Nixon Presidential. ‘She was quite an independent young lady and she was very cautious about anyone she met and if they couldn't smile, she wouldn't want to do too much unless she could make them smile. That captured Dick's imagination,’ the younger Nixon said. ‘She was challenging. She challenged me and I think she challenged Dick.’ Nixon's presidency began to unravel in 1972 when burglars who were later tied to his re-election committee broke into the Democratic headquarters to get dirt on his political adversaries. Nixon denied knowing about plans for the break-in beforehand, but an 18 1/2 minute gap in a recording of a post-Watergate White House meeting led many to suspect a cover-up. Secret shrink: A new book details the presidential campaign of Richard Nixon against John F Kennedy and how Nixon was secretly seeing a psychiatrist. Faced with impeachment and a possible criminal indictment, Nixon resigned on Aug. 9, 1974 and retreated to his native California. The following month he was granted a pardon by President Gerald Ford. Pat Nixon never doubted her husband and stood by him until she died in 1993, a day after their 53rd wedding anniversary, said Robert Bostock, a consultant to the Richard Nixon Foundation, which is co-sponsoring the exhibit, and a former aide to Nixon after he left the White House. Her loyalty and spirit was a. testament to their love and part of what bound them together from the. earliest days of their courtship in Whittier, when he was a young. attorney and she a high school stenography teacher fresh out of college. ‘She. was with him the whole way; she never lost faith in him. Her feeling. was that it was the country's loss when he had to resign, that he had. accomplished so much good and had so much more good to accomplish,’ Mr. Bostock said. ‘Her favourite saying was, 'Onward and upward.' She spent. no time looking back. She was always looking forward.’ Revelations: British journalist David Frost (left) interviewed Richard Nixon in a series in 1977 that ended in one of 20th century television's most dramatic confessions. Highlights:","completion":"1. A series of love letters written by Richard Nixon to his future wife, Patricia Ryan, reveal a softer and more romantic side of the former US president. 2. The letters, exchanged during their two-year courtship, will be displayed at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in California to celebrate Patricia's 100th birthday. 3. The correspondence offers a glimpse into a private side of Nixon that was rarely seen, showing him as an idealistic young man and an ardent suitor. 4. The couple met while auditioning for a play in Whittier, California, and dated for two years before getting married in June 1940. 5. Pat Nixon stood by her husband throughout his political career and remained loyal to him even after his resignation due to the Watergate scandal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

People come from all over the world to taste their sandwiches. The mayor of Reslie, while having a meeting about how to spend the excess funds from tourism this year, was told that the city is experiencing soil piping. The neighboring city, Tichago, consumes many of Reslie's grilled cheese sandwiches. The mayor of Tichago has just received a phone call from the mayor of Reslie asking if Tichago is also having soil piping. Tichago's mayor replies that no, they are not. and a hint : Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage. Please answer this question : Will Reslie need to replace their levees sooner or later than Tichago Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is evident that Reslie is currently experiencing soil piping, which is a form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. This phenomenon is detrimental to not only levees but also dams and can lead to sinkhole formations. Meanwhile, Tichago, the neighboring city of Reslie, has not reported any instances of soil piping. This distinction is crucial in determining the urgency associated with replacing the levees in each city. Soil piping significantly weakens the levee structure due to the turbulent flow removing soil from the mouth of the seep flow and the subsequent up-gradient advance of subsoil erosion. The progression of soil piping is directly linked to the stability and future performance of the levees. Substantial erosion of the subsurface material can lead to the eventual collapse of the levee and even cause a breach in the case of extreme events. On the other hand, though soil salination is described, it does not appear to be directly tied to either Reslie or Tichago. Soil salination is characterized by the accumulation of free salts, which can result in decreased agricultural value. This occurrence tends to be more common in arid regions with saline soil parent material. Such an issue may arise due to human activities, such as irrigation, which can elevate the water table's underlying level. Control methods for soil salination often include watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in tandem with subsurface drainage. Given that Reslie is grappling with the detrimental effects of soil piping, the city will likely need to replace their levees sooner than Tichago, as the latter city has not reported soil piping occurrences. This priority makes sense, as the city of Reslie must address the erosion and associated structural problems resulting from the soil piping to ensure the levees' continued stability and effectiveness. In conclusion, due to the present soil piping situation in Reslie and the negative impact it has on levee stability and performance, it is expected that Reslie will need to replace their levees sooner than Tichago. This course of action is critical for maintaining the safety and functionality of the city's infrastructure. It is recommended that Reslie takes this opportunity to evaluate the conditions contributing to soil piping and works on addressing the underlying issues, while Tichago should monitor their levees and soil conditions to pre-empt any potential future problems."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Naturally coloring your hair can be a messy process and take longer to process than chemical dyes. However, if your hair is damaged or easily damaged, natural colorants will be easier on your tresses than conventional hair dyes. It's up to you personally whether the benefits outweigh any inconvenience. If you have sensitive skin, herbal colorants may be the best choice for you, since chemical hair dyes can cause contact dermatitis. Natural colorants such as cassia obovata, henna and indigo are mixed into a paste that needs to sit out overnight. They also take longer to develop (from an hour to six hours) once applied to your hair. Keep in mind that the results you get with natural dyes can vary. If you have a specific desired look in mind, they might not be a good option for you. While you can plan for a general shade, natural colorants react differently to each individual's type and condition of hair. Your results will be unique and may be lighter, darker, or more varied in hue than you expect. Natural colorants, particularly tinting rinses, may not give you complete coverage of gray hair. How well it works for you depends on the method you use, how long you let it sit, and your hair type. You may need to repeat the process of coloring after 48 hours if your gray hair has not been covered successfully. Your individual hair type as well as various hair products you've used in the past affect how your hair takes to natural colorants. Save a few trimmings of hair the next time you get your hair cut, or snip a lock of hair near the back of your neck. Apply the colorant you want to use to the strand using the instructions for the method you've chosen. After applying the colorant, wait the entire process time. Then, rinse the lock completely and allow it to dry in direct sunlight, if you can. Check the final results under bright natural lighting. If necessary, adjust the ingredient or processing time for your own hair – more or less, depending on the shade you desire. Keep in mind that your strand test may not provide an accurate result for all of your hair. Some parts of your hair, such as the top portion, may take the dye differently. This is because typical styling, touching, and environmental exposure can affect your hair. Because natural hair colorants are typically messier than conventional hair dye, you will want to think about the best place to color your hair beforehand. Cassia obovata is not staining unless there is something added to it, like rhubarb. Henna and indigo, however, are both difficult to apply and very staining. If the weather is nice, you may want to bring one to two large mirrors and dye your hair outside. If you're dyeing your hair in the bathroom, you may want to do so inside of a bathtub or shower. When you dye your hair, wear old clothes or a hairdresser's cape. Then, cover all surfaces with plastic sheeting or old towels. You can also get a friend to help you, which can minimize the mess. When hair turns gray, not only the pigment changes. The cuticles are also thinned, making the strands of hair coarser and more prone to breakage. You can restore moisture to your hair with a natural product: egg, honey and olive oil, or coconut oil. Cassia obovata, henna, lemon and tea can be drying to your hair, so especially consider doing a natural conditioning treatment afterwards. Mix a whole egg and apply it to clean, damp hair once a month. Leave the mixture in for twenty minutes, then rinse it out with cool water. Massage 1/2 cup of honey and one to two tablespoons of olive oil into damp, clean hair. Allow the mixture to sit in your hair for twenty minutes, then rinse it out with warm water. Coconut oil is in a solid state at room temperature, so warm it in your hands or a microwave (if the latter, make sure it is warm and not too hot before applying). Work a couple of teaspoons of it into damp hair and wrap your hair in an old towel (coconut oil can stain fabric). Let it sit for one to two hours, then fully rinse it out and shampoo your hair. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article is about coloring your hair using natural colorants instead of chemical dyes.

What is the answer for the question: Which kingdom had their king baptized in 580? from the following article ? John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century. A:","completion":"The answer to the question is Alodia. The king of Alodia was baptized in 580, after requesting a bishop to help convert his people. This event marked the beginning of the conversion of the kingdom to Christianity under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

First, we have to subtract the numbers: 46963 - 11048 To do this, we take the bigger number, 46963, and remove 11048 from it: 46963 -11048 ------- 35915 Now our equation looks like this: 35915 = 3734*m - 42499 Our goal is to find the value of 'm.' To do that, we need to get 'm' by itself on one side of the equals sign (=). We'll start by moving the -42499 over to the other side. To do this, we'll add 42499 to both sides of the equation: 35915 + 42499 = 3734*m 78414 = 3734*m Now we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3734 to get 'm' by itself: 78414 / 3734 = m And when we divide the numbers, we get: 21 = m So the solution to our math problem is m = 21!

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Now, I have a new situation: John enrolled in a prestigious culinary school. In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B. Answer this question please: Which fruits had most probably gone through heated sugar syrup, bowl A or bowl B? Answer:","completion":"The fruits that have most probably gone through heated sugar syrup are the ones in bowl A. In the given situation, John's instructor demonstrated the process of preparing glace fruit, also known as candied or crystallized fruit, which involves placing whole fruits, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel in heated sugar syrup. The sugar syrup absorbs the moisture within the fruit, preserving it while maintaining its quality for a significant amount of time, up to a year. This preservation method enables the fruit to become saturated with sugar, which in turn prevents the growth of spoilage microorganisms. This is due to the unfavorable osmotic pressure generated by the high concentration of sugar. The instructor chose to display the glace fruits in bowl A, thus providing a comparison with non-glace fruits, which were placed in bowl B. So, based on the information provided, we can deduce that the fruits from bowl A are the ones that have gone through the heated sugar syrup process, making them glace or candied fruits, in contrast to the non-glace fruits in bowl B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air. Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are two ways in which the body cools down?\\" is \\"Sweating and constricting blood vessels\\"?

UPDATED:. 20:08 EST, 4 October 2013. Questions: Prince Andrew ended trip with a visit to Eugenie in New York. Prince Andrew’s continued royal globe-trotting is expected to come under. fresh scrutiny as he returns from a three-week, 21,258-mile ‘official’ trip. The Queen’s son, who was forced to give up his formal role as a. UK trade ambassador after a string of scandals, has visited Indonesia,. Vietnam, Hong Kong, Japan and New York. The trip came just weeks after a separate trip to Qatar, another of his favourite destinations. The. first leg of his tour of the Far East was funded in full by taxpayers,. Buckingham Palace admitted last night. A one-way-business class ticket. would cost at least £5,000. In both Tokyo and New York his expenses –. including travel and accommodation – were in part subsidised by a. private defence think tank which has appointed him to its board of. ‘International Advisors’, the Mail has learnt. Founded in 1831 by the. Duke of Wellington, the Royal United Services Institute is a respected. independent, not-for-profit research body offering expert opinion on. defence, security and terrorism. But questions are sure to be asked. as to how Andrew can reconcile his royal role and duties with. representing an organisation, however independent, that is funded by. private individuals, governments and corporations which include defence. manufacturers. Andrew flew out of the UK – accompanied by a team of. round-the-clock, publicly-funded police bodyguards – on September 16 to. Jakarta, where he stayed for three days. The visit was, apparently,. designed to promote ‘UK bilateral relations including in trade and. investment, science and innovation as well as education’. He attended. a dinner at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, opened the new British Embassy and. attended a launch of a Government-backed tourism initiative. Details. of the trip were not released until after his arrival, however, as. Andrew is the only member of the royal family who refuses to publicise. his foreign travel in advance. Palace officials confirmed last night. that this leg of his journey was approved by the Royal Visits Committee. at the request of the Foreign Office, which means that all his travel. costs, hotels and expenses are met by taxpayers out of the Queen’s. Sovereign Grant. One-way business class flights to Jakarta are just under £5,000. His last official engagement was on the evening of September 19, after which Andrew disappeared for a three-day weekend. Scrutiny: The Prince is the only member of the Royal Family who refuses to publish his travel detail in advance. Buckingham Palace said only that he spent the time ‘privately’. He then reappeared in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi on September 23 for a two-day stay. Most. notable in a series of engagements, was a high-level RUSI conference. discussing UK-Vietnam defence co-operation and strategic issues in. South-east Asia. Palace officials say the prince covered the cost of. this part of his trip personally. His final engagement was on September. 24 – after which the prince apparently took himself off on holiday again. for five days. Again, palace officials have declined to discuss his. movements. Andrew then turned up in Tokyo on Monday this week for. another public, yet privately-funded, series of engagements. The main. thrust of the prince’s visit was to attend a RUSI conference on. British-Japanese security co-operation, where he shared the stage with. Sir John Scarlett, former Director of the Security Intelligence Service. (MI6), and Japanese premier, Shinzo Abe. Japan is looking to spend. billions on its defence as tensions rise with China and pressure comes. from the US for the country to become more pro-active globally. As a. result huge defence contracts are up for grabs. According to. well-placed sources, the prince also took the opportunity to spend some. time privately with the Japanese royal family. After initially. refusing to discuss who was paying for the prince to be there,. Buckingham Palace eventually admitted – after being challenged by the. Mail – that RUSI had ‘made a proportionate contribution towards his. costs’. The think-tank also funded him to fly on to New York on. Wednesday this week, ostensibly to take part in further high-level. discussions on its behalf. His arrival in Manhattan coincided with. that of his youngest daughter, Princess Eugenie, who moved to the city. to work for a year for an online auction company. Andrew took Eugenie,. 23, out for dinner on Wednesday night at ABC Kitchen. Buckingham Palace. have refused to say when the prince is returning to the UK. A spokesman for the prince said he was a ‘great admirer of the RUSI’s work’. Sources. stressed Andrew did not receive a salary as a member of its. International Advisory Board and pointed out it ‘already has. well-established links with the Royal Family, in the form of the Queen,. who is its patron, and the Duke of Kent, its president’. They also. claimed that the prince – nicknamed Air Miles Andy for his love of. travel – was taking scheduled flights throughout his trip. A. spokesman for RUSI said they had been keen to invite Andrew to join. their advisory board as he ‘endorsed and consolidated RUSI’s status as a. leading independent international think tank’. However the latest revelations will, once again, shine an unwelcome spotlight on his activities. In. 2001 he became the UK’s Special Representative for Trade and. Investment. But he was repeatedly accused of wasting taxpayers’ money. The final nail in the coffin was the furore over his friendship with. Jeffrey Epstein, a US financier who has been jailed for soliciting. prostitution from underage girls. In July 2011 Andrew announced he was. standing down. Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said:. ‘Taxpayers will wonder why they are paying for the Prince’s gallivanting. across the globe, given that he is no longer a UK trade envoy. It is. imperative that the Prince is open and transparent about exactly how he. has spent taxpayers’ cash.’ Highlights:","completion":"1.

Rebecca thought her chest was too small.. [B]. Amy thought her chest was too small..","completion":"Saving for a breast augmentation was important to Rebecca but not Amy, as [A]. Rebecca thought her chest was too small. Breast augmentation, also known as augmentation mammoplasty, is a surgical procedure that involves the placement of implants or the transfer of fat to increase the size, shape, or fullness of a person's breasts. The reasons individuals opt for breast augmentation vary - some do it for cosmetic reasons, while others undergo the procedure to restore their breasts after mastectomy or injury. In this sentence, we learn that Rebecca perceives her chest as being too small and thus wants to save money for a breast augmentation. Her perception of her chest size might stem from personal preferences, societal pressures, or a desire to improve her overall self-confidence. Individuals often choose to undergo cosmetic treatments like breast augmentation as a result of personal factors or to align more closely with certain beauty norms. On the other hand, Amy does not share the same concern about her chest size. This indicates that she feels comfortable and confident in her body as it is or does not attach the same importance to breast size as Rebecca does. Self-acceptance, the ability to see beauty that transcends societal standards, or simply different priorities may contribute to Amy's lack of interest in breast augmentation. It's essential to recognize that individuals have unique perspectives on their bodies and varying degrees of comfort with making surgical alterations. The contrast between Rebecca and Amy's views on breast augmentation highlights the importance of acknowledging and respecting individual choices regarding cosmetic procedures. People may have different personal goals, desires, and priorities when it comes to their appearance and body image. It's crucial to support individuals in making informed decisions and taking actions that they believe will enhance their overall well-being and happiness, regardless of whether or not those actions align with societal standards or personal preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Article: Finally, there is some good news for older dads. A new study shows that their children and even grandchildren may get a health benefit because of their older age. It's based on research into something called telomeres--tips on the ends of chromosomes Some previous studies have connected having longer telomeres with better health and longer lives. Telomeres haven't been proven to cause those benefits in the general population, but a number of researchers think they may hold secrets for things like longevity and cancer. As you age, telomeres shorten. However, previous studies have shown that the older a man is when he becomes a father, the longer the telomeres his children tend to have. The new research confirms that and finds it's extended to the grandchildren. That's a cheerier result for older dads than some other studies in recent years that indicate their kids are at higher risk for things like autism Carol Greider of Johns Hopkins University, who shared a Nobel Prize in 2009 for telomere research but didn't participate in the new study, said it's no surprise that the telomere effect would extend beyond children to grandchildren. She also said that since older fathers also tend to pass more potentially harmful genetic mutations , it's \\"not at all clear\\" whether advanced paternal age gives an overall health benefit to children. In a statement, the researchers who conducted the study said their study shouldn't be taken as a recommendation that men reproduce at older ages because there's a risk of genetic mutations. Some previous studies of the impact of older fatherhood have been less encouraging. In 2010, for example, at least two big studies confirmed a link to having children with autism. In 2008, a big Swedish study strengthened evidence linking bipolar disorder to older paternal ages. Question: Which of the following statements about telomeres is NOT true?

The smell of popcorn played on the breeze, and life seemed good. It was one of the happiest Saturday mornings I had spent with my little daughter, Gigi. That is, until two strangers threw her into their car and sped away. It seemed like a bad dream. I could barely whisper when the police questioned me. For hours we waited,but there was no word on the whereabouts of the car. Tears would start to come. Then nothing. I was numb with fear. \\"Go home, Ma'am,\\" the police officer said. \\"I'll have someone drive you. We'll also want to monitor your telephone. The kidnappers might call, and we'll want to keep track. Trust me, these guys can't get far. \\" After what had just happened, it was hard for me to trust anything. My friend Gloria came over that afternoon. \\"I heard about Gigi on the radio,\\" she said. \\"Everyone is looking for the car.

I have sentences ready in my mind, but I can't speak it. What should I do? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"Between the phrases 'Looking forward to speak with you' and 'Look forward to speak with you', the correct phrase is actually 'Looking forward to speaking with you'. Let's break it down and analyze it further: 1. 'Looking forward to speak with you': This phrase is incorrect because 'to' should be followed by the gerund form of the verb 'speak', which is 'speaking', making the correct phrase, 'Looking forward to speaking with you'. 2. 'Look forward to speak with you': This phrase is also incorrect for the same reason as mentioned in the first case. The correct phrase here would be 'Look forward to speaking with you'. Now, let's address the second part of your query regarding feeling weak at spoken English and not being able to speak it despite having sentences ready in your mind. To improve your spoken English, you can try the following techniques: 1. Practice regularly: Consistent practice is essential in improving your spoken English skills. Speak out loud in English every day, even if you're speaking to yourself. This will help you gain confidence and fluency. 2. Engage in conversations: Having more conversations in English with friends, classmates, or colleagues will improve your speaking skills. Try to find conversation partners who are interested in practicing English as well, or join a language exchange group. 3. Record yourself: Record your voice as you speak in English and play it back to identify areas that need improvement, such as pronunciation, grammar, or fluency. 4. Learn and practice new vocabulary: Expanding your vocabulary will enable you to express yourself better and have more engaging conversations. Try to learn a few new words every day and use them in your speaking practice. 5. Watch and listen: Expose yourself to English-language media like TV shows, movies, podcasts, and YouTube videos to help both your listening and speaking skills. 6. Speak slowly: Avoid worrying about speaking fast. Speaking slowly gives you time to think and remember the correct vocabulary or grammar. 7. Work on pronunciation: Focus on specific sounds that you find challenging or unfamiliar in the English language. Use pronunciation guides and videos to practice these sounds. 8. Get feedback: Ask your conversation partners or teachers for feedback on your spoken English. They can help identify areas to improve on and provide advice. Finally, the two questions you've asked in your query are distinct: 1. The first question seeks to determine the correct phrase between two given options. 2. The second question addresses your concern about feeling weak at spoken English and requests advice on how to improve.

Translate \\"La Importancia de Amamantar a los Bebés Prematuros\\" from Spanish to English.","completion":"The phrase \\"La Importancia de Amamantar a los Bebés Prematuros\\" translates to \\"The Importance of Breastfeeding Premature Babies\\" in English. Breastfeeding is essential for the overall health and well-being of infants, and it is particularly important for premature babies. Premature infants, who are born before their due date, often face numerous health challenges as compared to full-term infants. These challenges include weak immune systems, underdeveloped lungs and digestive systems, and difficulties in maintaining proper body temperature. Breast milk provides a variety of vital nutrients, growth factors, antibodies, and enzymes that are crucial for the development and survival of premature babies. 1. Nutrients: Breast milk is rich in nutrients such as proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals, which are essential for the growth and development of premature infants. These nutrients are more easily absorbed and utilized by the baby's body compared to formula. 2. Immunological benefits: Premature babies have underdeveloped immune systems, making them more susceptible to infections. Breast milk provides antibodies that can protect them from various infections and enhance their immune systems' ability to combat pathogens. 3. Growth factors: Breast milk contains various growth factors that promote the maturation and development of a premature baby's digestive system and other vital organs. 4. Easy digestibility: Breast milk is more digestible than formula, making it easier for premature babies to break down and absorb essential nutrients. This can help in avoiding gastrointestinal issues such as constipation and gas that are commonly experienced by premature infants. 5. Skin-to-skin contact: Breastfeeding encourages skin-to-skin contact between the mother and the baby, which can significantly benefit the baby's emotional, mental, and physical development. This contact assists in regulating the baby's body temperature and stabilizing their heart rate, breathing, and blood sugar levels. 6. Bonding: Breastfeeding creates a strong emotional bond between a mother and her baby, which can have lasting positive effects on both the mother and the baby's well-being. Due to these advantages, breastfeeding plays an essential role in the growth, development, and survival of premature babies. It can help them overcome the challenges they face and improve their chances of leading healthier lives. It is always recommended to consult with healthcare professionals to determine the best breastfeeding plan for premature infants, considering any specific needs or conditions they may have."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: Roy Lichtenstein had never publicly published his artwork. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"If the first sentence is true, it implies that Roy Lichtenstein's artwork is present in a collection along with the works of other notable artists such as Rodin, Giacometti, Dubuffet, and Henry Moore. Assuming this information is accurate, it means Roy Lichtenstein's artwork is, in fact, on display, which is a form of making artwork publicly accessible. Now, analyzing the second sentence which claims that \\"Roy Lichtenstein had never publicly published his artwork.\\" The term \\"publicly published\\" usually refers to the act of making something publicly accessible or available for viewing or appreciation. The existence of Lichtenstein's artworks in the collection mentioned in the first sentence contradicts this claim, as his work is being showcased alongside other esteemed artists. Therefore, if we assume that both sentences are referring to the same context and time period, then the second sentence does not seem to be true, given that the first sentence is true. However, if the second sentence is referring to a time before the collection was put together, it could have been true at that time but would no longer be true after his artwork was added to the collection.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article:You can see the tall blue and grey watchtowers rising above the horizon. This is the current home of Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman, the country's most notorious drug lord who set up the Sinaloa cartel in the late 1980s. It is also the prison from which he escaped last July, down a a 1.5km-long (one mile-long) tunnel. As you approach the prison, you have to go through a military checkpoint, tanks parked alongside. There are lots of federal police milling around closer to the fence. Outside the prison gates, there is a taco stand doling out lunch to guards. Stray dogs are stretched out in the afternoon sun and construction workers are busy making improvements to the prison. El Altiplano is one of three maximum-security prisons in Mexico that are based on the same design. Federal Social Readaptation Centre Number Two, or Puente Grande in Jalisco state, was where El Chapo first escaped in 2001. The official line was that he hid in a laundry cart, although people close to the prisons system tell me he actually walked out dressed in police uniform. The third prison is in Matamoros in the northern state of Tamaulipas. The National Security Commission, which runs Mexico's federal prisons, last weekend paid a visit to El Altiplano to ensure its security was up to scratch. After a four-hour tour, officials concluded that the prison met international standards. Sources in the Mexican government have also told me that there will soon be 10 times the number of cameras there used to be in El Altiplano. There will also be an elite team dedicated to watching El Chapo around the clock. Not only that, but he will move cells on a regular basis - sometimes spending just a few hours or days in a one. Floors have been reinforced and there is a host of other improvements they have made to make sure there is not a third escape. \\"You can have a high-security prison, but if he's given the key, it's no longer high-security,\\" said one expert who has worked in the federal prison system for years but did not want to be identified. The problem he sees is that the prison buildings and security systems in these maximum-security prisons are first-rate but often the people running them are not well-trained - nor trustworthy - so it means nothing. The drugs boss, it seems, is not happy. This week it was reported that El Chapo's lawyers were set to file a legal challenge against him being held in isolation. But how long can the government keep up these special measures? \\"I'm not sure that will hold for the medium term because there are going to be other priorities coming along,\\" says Alejandro Hope, a security analyst in Mexico City. \\"It's going to be a stretch for the government to spend that much money and resources on one inmate, important as he may be. \\"But more importantly, he will work relentlessly to undermine those conditions - that means corruption, intimidation and legal challenges.\\" That is a fear shared by Gerardo Rodriguez Sanchez Lara, at the Centre for Studies on Impunity and Justice at the University of the Americas in Puebla. \\"The Mexican government can no longer have the luxury of saying that it can give a 100% guarantee that El Chapo will pay for his crimes in a Mexican prison for the rest of his life,\\" he says, arguing that extradition is crucial. Sanchez Lara sees two avenues for El Chapo to escape - by illegal means such as tunnelling out or by having a good lawyer. He cites the example of cartel leader Sandra Avila Beltran - also known as the Queen of the Pacific - who was freed last year after seven years in prison. Rafael Caro Quintero is another capo who caused uproar when he was released in 2013. The judicial system in Mexico is lacking he says, adding that Mexico has 3.5 judges for every 1,000 inhabitants, compared to an international average of 16. \\"I think that Mexico is very vulnerable in terms of its ability to keep him,\\" he says. \\"He could get out on legal questions and I think that's the most dangerous thing. \\"What worries me is if he corrupts or threatens violence against judges and federal government workers who are involved in the process of extradition [US requests were filed in 2015].\\" While the extradition process gets under way, it is something that El Chapo's lawyers will fight all the way. All the while, many experts expect him to be plotting his next escape. \\"Don't underestimate the man's creativity,\\" says Alejandro Hope. \\"He may or may not escape but I think the working hypothesis for the Mexican government should be that he is going to try. Right now, for El Chapo, it's a race between extradition and escape.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"So, there is a very important man named El Chapo who did some bad things and started a group called the Sinaloa Cartel. He is now in a big, high-security prison in Mexico with tall walls and watchtowers. He has escaped from prisons two times before, and people are worried he might try to escape again. The Mexican government is trying to make sure he cannot escape a third time by adding more security cameras, moving him to different cells often, and increasing the number of guards. However, some experts believe that other things may distract the government and they might not be able to give El Chapo enough attention all the time. El Chapo's lawyers are trying to fight against him being kept in isolation and moved to another country's prison. Some people think he might use either illegal ways, like digging tunnels, or legal ways with the help of good lawyers to escape from prison again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By checking the computer diagnostics, Ash can gather information about the system’s resources, performance, and potential bottlenecks. This will help them determine if the update has improved the computer's performance or if they need to consider further troubleshooting options. Option B, deleting the installed update, wouldn't be the logical next step.

The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

Given the below context: After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a...

It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go.\\"In 1993, Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to photographer Bert Stern, notable for his work with Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism. Throughout her career, Minogue has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new \\"look\\" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people. Stylist William Baker has suggested that this is part of the reason she entered mainstream pop culture in Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records.By 2000, Minogue was considered to have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having maintained her career longer than her critics had expected. Her progression from the wholesome \\"girl next door\\" to a more sophisticated performer with a flirtatious and playful persona attracted new fans. Her \\"Spinning Around\\" video led to some media outlets referring to her as \\"SexKylie\\", and sex became a stronger element in her subsequent videos. William Baker described her status as a sex symbol as a \\"double edged sword\\", observing that \\"we always attempted to use her sex appeal as an enhancement of her music and to sell a record.

God In monotheism and henotheism, God is conceived of as the Supreme Being and principal object of faith. The concept of God as described by theologians commonly includes the attributes of omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), omnibenevolence (perfect goodness), divine simplicity, and eternal and necessary existence. God is also usually defined as a non-corporeal being without any human biological gender, but the concept of God actively (as opposed to receptively) creating the universe has caused some religions to give \\"Him\\" the metaphorical name of \\"Father\\". Because God is conceived as not being a corporeal being, God cannot(some say should not) be portrayed in a literal visual image; some religious groups use a man (sometimes old and bearded) to symbolize God because of His deed of creating man's mind in the image of His own. Q: What type of human is God portrayed as in some religions?","completion":"In some religions, God is portrayed as a human-like figure, often an older man with a beard.

Hoke Answer:","completion":"Title: The Enigmatic Arrival Genre: Mystery, Drama, Thriller Plot Summary: An enigmatic man named Hoke arrives at an isolated house in a rural town, where the lives of the occupants take a turn as they reveal hidden secrets of their past, unravel mysteries from the house's history, and ultimately decide their future. Hoke, a stranger with peculiar demeanor and mysterious abilities, becomes a catalyst leading the residents on a journey of self-discovery, emotion, and truth. Act 1: The film takes place in the idyllic town of Crestfall, where a historic house named \\"Widdershins\\" has recently been inherited by the Caldwell family – Mark, his wife Angela, and their two children Sarah and Ben. The family is excited and curious about their new home, but also wary because they know little about its history or the reason they've inherited it from a distant relative. One foggy morning, a man named Hoke arrives at Widdershins. His unassuming yet charismatic presence intrigues the family, but his reason for showing up is quite unclear. He explains that he has been traveling and happened to pass through the town, hearing about the house's fascinating history and wanted to learn more about it. Mark and Angela, although slightly skeptical, invite him to stay as their guest for a few days. Act 2: As Hoke starts to learn more about the house and its history, he discovers that there's more to Widdershins than meets the eye. He begins to find hints about the house being built on ancient Native American land, and a long-secret tragedy that occurred on the site decades earlier. Meanwhile, Hoke's presence and his interactions with each family member starts to unravel the buried emotions, secrets, and aspirations that they hold. Sarah, a budding artist, finds inspiration and guidance through Hoke's insights on creativity. Ben, who was struggling at school and with bullying, starts to open up and gain confidence as Hoke shares his experiences and lessons about overcoming adversity. However, Mark and Angela find their relationship tested as their long-held secrets are exposed and confronted, all triggered by Hoke's enigmatic ability to encourage honesty. As the family struggles with the truth, they also try to uncover the mystery surrounding the house. It is revealed that the tragedy was the murder of a Native American girl by one of the house's former residents, whose spirit is said to be entrapped within the house. Hoke believes that the answers to solving the mystery lie within the family itself, and that they are meant to live in this house to bring closure to this tragic event. Act 3: Overwhelmed by the revelations, the Caldwells debate whether or not they should stay at Widdershins. They begin to question Hoke's intentions and wonder if he is somehow involved in the tragedy or if he is simply a guiding force, pushing them towards their destiny. They also grapple with the emotional truths about themselves, ultimately growing closer as a result. The climax of the film is a powerful séance led by Hoke, allowing them to communicate with the spirit of the murdered girl and confront the dark history of the house. The spirit reveals that the tragedy can be resolved by exposing the murderer's identity and ensuring that justice prevails. The Caldwells, gaining clarity and understanding, work together to solve the mystery. In the end, the Caldwell family chooses to embrace their new life at Widdershins. They are stronger as a unit, having faced their weaknesses and difficult truths. The spirit of the Native American girl is set free, and peace is restored to the town. As the film concludes, Hoke quietly leaves Widdershins to continue on his journey. His role as a catalyst remains enigmatic, leaving viewers questioning who Hoke truly was, and what brought him to the Caldwell family. The film leaves a lasting impression on the audience, combining both the supernatural and the emotional worlds and offering a deeply engaging, thought-provoking experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: What large dwarf planet in our solar system was only discovered in 2005? A: Answer:","completion":"The large dwarf planet in our solar system that was only discovered in 2005 is Eris (Option D). Eris is a trans-Neptunian object, which means it is located in the region of our solar system beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is a member of the scattered disc, a group of icy celestial bodies that stretch beyond the Kuiper Belt and into the far reaches of the solar system. Eris was discovered by a team of astronomers led by Michael E. Brown, Chad Trujillo, and David L. Rabinowitz on January 5, 2005, at the Palomar Observatory in California. Originally, the team assigned the informal name of \\"Xena,\\" a reference to the television series Xena: Warrior Princess, but the International Astronomical Union (IAU) later assigned the official name Eris, after the Greek goddess of strife and discord. Eris has a diameter of about 2,326 kilometers (1,445 miles), making it slightly smaller than Pluto, but more massive. It is composed mainly of rock and ice, with an estimated density of 2.52 grams per cubic centimeter. Eris is known to have a small moon, Dysnomia, which was discovered in September 2005. Dysnomia has a diameter of about 700 kilometers (435 miles) and orbits Eris at a distance of approximately 37,000 kilometers (23,000 miles). The discovery of Eris played a significant role in the controversy and subsequent reclassification of celestial bodies in our solar system. In 2006, the IAU created a new category of celestial objects called \\"dwarf planets\\" and included Eris, Pluto, and other similar bodies in this new category, effectively demoting Pluto from its former status as the ninth planet. Eris has an extremely elliptical orbit, with an orbital period of approximately 557 Earth years, which means it takes 557 years for the dwarf planet to complete one orbit around the Sun. At its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion), Eris is about 5.65 billion kilometers (3.51 billion miles) away, while at its farthest point (aphelion), it is roughly 14.6 billion kilometers (9.1 billion miles) away. The discovery and study of Eris and other trans-Neptunian objects have provided valuable insights into the composition, dynamics, and origin of our solar system, as well as the potential existence of additional celestial bodies waiting to be discovered in the distant reaches of our celestial neighborhood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What was the last name of the person who led 500 Americans in an unsuccessful attempt to capture the fort from about 100 British defenders? is inside the article: Fort Ticonderoga (), formerly Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain, in northern New York, in the United States. It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack.

A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Determine the sentiment: There are some redeeming qualities to this show. One is that the theme tune does have a decent melody. The show does have a nice premise. Also, I am probably in the minority, but I like Wanda. I like the fact she is caring, and is more a mother figure to Timmy. However, despite all this, I do not like this show, it isn't excrement but I do find it very annoying. I wouldn't say that it is the best animated show on Planet Earth. When I use that term for an animated TV show, I think of Peter Pan and the Pirates, I think of Darkwing Duck, I think of Scooby Doo and I think of Talespin. And I hope I am not the only one who really likes the Wild Thornberrys and resent the fact it gets poked fun at. Nor do I think Fairly Odd Parents is the worst animated show on Planet Earth. I accept it's annoying, and in some ways overrated, but it isn't the worst show on Nickolodean. That is Chalk Zone, god that show is unwatchable. But the worst animated show I've ever seen is Shaggy and Scooby Doo:Get a Clue, which is crudely animated, unfunny and frankly a disgrace. One thing I don't like about this show is the animation. The characters, forgive me if I offend, have very weird facial features, and a lot of the backgrounds are dull and lack the colour that make Spongebob Squarepants and Wild Thornberrys so nice to look at. The characters with the exception of Wanda I find very annoying. I can't believe such a talented voice actress like Tara Strong(aka. Charendoff) voiced Timmy. Timmy I don't find very likable as a lead character at all, he is annoying and sometimes patronising, and he is a poor decision maker as well. And his voice gets on my nerves. I actually like Strong but not in this show. Another annoying character is Cosmo, the supposedly funny character. Instead, his jokes are as unfunny as they could become. They are either a) contrived, or b) over familiar. Timmy's parents are awful characters, who don't give a toss about their son, and their personalities wear well thin. The story lines are very unoriginal on the most part, and I keep thinking, where have I seen this before. The episodes after the arrival of the baby I thought were unwatchable. Even worse is the scripts, very unfunny, childish, witless and suffer from a complete lack of energy. All in all, not the worst show ever, but pretty poor for an animation fan, and fairly uncomfortable to sit through. 3/10- there are redeeming qualities, and I completely understand if people like it.

A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself.

Though clerics, they were inaccurately called \\"lay cardinals\\" and were permitted to marry. Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV, only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals. Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The influence of the Pope over the practice of appointing cardinals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders, but had not been ordained as deacons or priests, has been significant in shaping the current prerequisites for becoming a cardinal within the Catholic Church. This historical practice allowed for what were inaccurately known as \\"lay cardinals\\" who were often allowed to marry. Individuals such as Teodolfo Mertel represented the last of this cadre before major changes were initiated with the Code of Canon Law revised in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV. Pope Benedict XV played a pivotal role in redefining the eligibility criteria for cardinals. Through the revision of the Code of Canon Law, he stipulated that only those who are already priests or bishops could be appointed as cardinals. This was an important departure from the accepted practice before, thereby closing the door to the so-called \\"lay cardinals,\\" which effectively ended the possibility of having married cardinals. However, the restrictions didn't end there. Since the time of Pope John XXIII, further requirements were imposed, intensifying the caveats surrounding cardinal appointment. Any priest, according to Pope John XXIII, who was appointed a cardinal must also be consecrated a bishop, unless a dispensation was obtained. This decision added another layer to the hierarchical ladder that must be climbed to reach the status of cardinal. The rationale behind these transformative changes was centered on ensuring that those holding the high rank of cardinal possessed a deep and holistic understanding of the services, rituals, and responsibilities associated with the high offices of the Church. Consequently, this implied a more rigorous process needed for an individual to become a cardinal, culminating in a group of top church leaders who had been carefully vetted and considered fully qualified in doctrine, practice, and service. In summary, the Popes drastically influenced the practice through their actions by effecting changes that raised the standard and requirements for cardinal appointments. These changes reinforced the strictly clerical and religious nature of the cardinalate and further distinguished it from layperson status within the Church hierarchy, a transformation mainly ushered in by Popes Benedict XV and John XXIII."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Given the following passage \\"In the early 20th century, Carl von Voit and Max Rubner independently measured caloric energy expenditure in different species of animals, applying principles of physics in nutrition.

This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. Now, I have a new situation: Jeff and Jeremy were neighbors and best friends since kindergarten. They always enjoyed the same hobbies and did everything together. When puberty hit, Jeff was growing much taller than Jeremy. Jeremy's parents were worried about him because he was not growing and was the shortest boy in their class so they took him to the doctor to have his hormones tested.

Summarize this article: In the high-priced Bay Area, even some households that bring in six figures a year can now be considered “low income.” That’s according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which recently released its 2017 income limits — a threshold that determines who can qualify for affordable and subsidized housing programs such as Section 8 vouchers. Related Articles Faced with sky-high prices, homebuyers look to leave Bay Area Leaving California? After slowing, the trend intensifies 4 signs California’s job market is cooling Just how unaffordable are Oakland and San Jose for teachers? A new report crunches the numbers What it feels like to be priced out of my own Bay Area hometown San Francisco and San Mateo counties have the highest limits in the Bay Area — and among the highest such numbers in the country. A family of four with an income of 105,350 per year is considered “low income.” A 65,800 annual income is considered “very low” for a family the same size, and 39,500 is “extremely low.” The median income for those areas is 115,300. Other Bay Area counties are not far behind. In Alameda and Contra Costa counties, 80,400 for a family of four is considered low income, while in Santa Clara County, 84,750 is the low-income threshold for a family of four. The eye-popping numbers are harsh reality for Demetrio Gonzalez, a Richmond resident with multiple higher education degrees, including a master’s in education, who supports the work of approximately 1,700 educators in West Contra Costa Unified School District in his position as president of the United Teachers of Richmond. With an income of 48,000, it’s a challenge for him to live in the Bay Area. By the time he pays rent for a home he shares with four roommates, including teachers, along with student loans, food, travel, phone and car payments, he has about 300 left each month. “With this income, I don’t think it is possible to create a future in the place I love and the place I work,” he said. “When I decide to buy a home — if possible — I’ll have to look elsewhere.” The new federal income limits are higher than last year and previous years, a reflection of the rising incomes and cost of living in the Bay Area. The increases will allow people at the upper tiers of the “low-income” limits access to some affordable housing programs from which they were previously disqualified. “We’ve significantly increased income limits at every income level — that means more housing opportunity (because it) broadens the pool of individuals and families (who are considered low income),” said Ed Cabrera, a regional public affairs officer for HUD. “I think it’s fair to say that these income limits are one way to gauge livability and affordability.” Jeff Levin, policy director for East Bay Housing Organizations, said the market has shifted “dramatically” over the past two decades, forcing renters to spend significantly more on average than they have in previous years. In Oakland, the median income for renter households is around 40,000, which means that more than half of all renter families qualify as very low income, Levin said. Most of those families are paying more than half their income for housing costs. Moriah Larkins is one of them. Larkins makes 15.50 an hour working at Home Depot and spends at least 40 percent of that on her HUD-subsidized apartment in West Oakland, she said. Sometimes, it’s even more than that. “It’s not even enough living in subsidized rent,” Larkins said of living in the costly Bay Area. Michael Santero, director of asset management for San Jose-based First Community Housing, said it’s easy to see the increased need for affordable housing right now, as more people flock to affordable housing programs offered by First Community Housing and others in the face of rapidly rising housing costs. While the new HUD income limits broaden the group of people eligible for such programs, it doesn’t help alleviate the demand for such housing. It’s up to developers and cities to provide more supply. “There is a huge demand for anything that’s remotely affordable. … People aren’t moving out at all,” Santero said. “Even in an affordable unit, I’d have people moving out often in summer in a normal market, but now we get hardly any notices.” Roxanne Calimeris, 27, a social worker who lives in Oakland, said she was shocked at the level of competition for getting an apartment in that city. An employee of Alameda County, Calimeris makes about 82,000 per year, putting her well above the “low income” limit of 56,300 for a single person in the East Bay, but even on that salary, living in the region isn’t easy. Rent costs her about 1,200 per month, for an apartment she shares with her sister (“I knew I couldn’t get my own place,” Calimeris said), and an extra 600 in student loans and 250 for a car payment eat into the rest of her paycheck. Some Bay Area cities have seen average rents soften a bit, but they’re still higher than much of the country. According to ApartmentList.com, the median monthly cost of a two-bedroom apartment was 2,550 in San Jose by the end of last year. In Oakland, it was around 2,500, and in San Francisco, it was a cool 4,550. Even places in the East Bay suburbs, where many have flocked to find rent relief, were expensive. Pleasanton’s median for a two-bedroom was 2,770, and in Concord, it was 1,900 per month. Not surprisingly, the Bay Area HUD income limits are higher than other metropolitan areas in the country. In the Seattle area, 72,000 per year is considered “low income” for a family of four, while in Boston, the limit is 78,150. In Los Angeles County, 72,100 is “low.” Jennifer Lin, deputy director of the East Bay Alliance for a Sustainable Economy, said that while more people are falling into the “low-income” bracket, it’s important to remember how many people are still struggling to make it work at the lowest income levels. “For every household who makes 80,000, there are many who make much less,” Lin said, pointing to minimum-wage earners in Oakland, for example, whose 12.86-per-hour wage adds up to under 27,000 a year. Even when the minimum wage across the state hits 15 per hour by 2022, workers will make just 31,200 annually (working 40 hours per week every week of the year). A member of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, Larkins, the Home Depot employee, has been active in campaigns to improve wages for herself and others in low-wage industries like retail. While such efforts have been successful in lifting minimum wages across the state, it can still be a struggle for those workers to survive in the Bay Area. “Minimum wage is going up, but it would be different if the cost of living was the same as when I was a teenager,” Larkins said. “Minimum wage goes up, and the cost of living goes up.” ||||| Betty Rose Allen says eviction battle took a toll on her mother Beatriz’s health in yet another case that highlights the deleterious effects of the tech industry on the city’s affordable housing When doctors said Beatriz Allen might only have a few weeks left to live, death was not the biggest threat looming over her family. Her landlords had set a deadline of 9 May for her eviction – right around the time that doctors predicted she might die. The eviction battle gave the 81-year-old San Francisco woman nightmares, and took a toll on her waning health, according to her family. And on 30 April, Allen went to sleep and never woke up. “It was scary for her,” said Betty Rose Allen, Beatriz’s daughter, seated inside the apartment where she has lived with her mother since 1978. “Living with mama, and watching them push and push, and allowing that fear to keep increasing … it felt like they were killing her.” The eviction of the Allens by a Silicon Valley CEO and his family is the latest case of displacement and death in the California city, where a booming tech economy has contributed to rising income inequality and one of the country’s worst housing crises. 'This is killing me': 100-year-old woman fights eviction in San Francisco Read more Tariq Hilaly, the CEO of a healthcare tech startup called Lumity, bought the property along with his wife and parents in 2014. The landlords’ attorney told the Guardian that the owners had made every effort to resolve the dispute without litigation, and had worked to assist the family with relocation. He further asserted that the owners had been patient and accommodating, even though Tariq’s parents, who are in their 70s, have a right to occupy the property and are eager to move into the Allens’ apartment to be close to family. But Betty Rose and her supporters said it was unethical for the landlords to evict Beatriz in her final year of life, and that the recent evictions of seniors in rent-controlled homes were a form of abuse that could increase as housing prices continued to soar in San Francisco and the surrounding region. In March, a 100-year-old tenant, Iris Canada, died in San Francisco after losing her protracted eviction battle with owners, and nearby Carl Jensen, 93, also died amid a fight over the fate of his property. “Mom is No 3. She is the third person to be killed and die for this,” said Betty Rose, 58, who is still fighting to stay in her home, which is located on the same block where she grew up in the city’s Noe Valley neighborhood. Wealth has become so immense in San Francisco that the federal government recently stated that a household making 105,350 per year could be considered “low-income”. By many measures, the city has the priciest real estate in the US. Beatriz grew up in El Salvador, and her family was twice exiled before she eventually relocated to the US, her daughter said. The two worked for the San Francisco school district until Beatriz suffered multiple strokes starting in 2002. For 15 years, Betty Rose cared for her mother, who was severely anemic and had from vascular dementia and chronic kidney disease. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Beatriz Allen, who had lived in her apartment since 1978. Photograph: Courtesy of family Their new landlords – who also purchased the property next door and moved in – first filed an eviction notice in March 2016, saying that the owners’ family intended to occupy the Allens’ unit, records show. They were given 60 days to leave. After the tenants’ attorneys fought back, the landlords eventually said Beatriz and her daughter could stay for one year, which in some cases is required by law for seniors and tenants with disabilities. The eviction falls under the Ellis Act, a controversial state law that allows certain property owners to remove longtime tenants from units with rent control. In such a hot real estate market with a major housing shortage, there are clear financial incentives to evict elderly tenants who have maintained low rental rates for decades. As the 2017 eviction deadline approached and Beatriz’s health worsened, the family wanted assurances that the mother would not be forced out in the final days of her life. On 28 April, Mark Chernev, an attorney for the Hilalys, told Beatriz’s lawyers that the owners would agree to let the 81-year-old woman remain in her home until her death – but only if Betty Rose agreed that she would voluntarily move out after her mother died. “The owners remain hopeful your clients would reconsider avoiding litigation entirely by simply agreeing that Betty Rose will voluntarily surrender possession,” wrote Chernev, who also represented the landlords who evicted Iris Canada, the 100-year-old woman. Betty Rose said it was hard to focus on the eviction and the lawyers when she knew she was spending her final weeks with her mother. But she was also not ready to give up her apartment of nearly 40 years. “She wanted to fight for her home,” said her attorney Raquel Fox, who argued that the landlords should have halted the eviction efforts once doctors said Beatriz only had a few months or weeks to live. “Her health was just deteriorating.” Two days after Chernev’s letter, Beatriz died. On a recent afternoon, Betty Rose broke down crying recounting how her mother kept asking if they could invite the landlords over for dinner and try to convince them to let her stay: “What was breaking her heart was that she just didn’t understand why our landlord had lawyers against her. We were really good tenants.” Chernev told the Guardian that the owners had offered a 100,000 relocation payment and had been willing to give Betty Rose a “generous grieving period” to stay after her mother’s death if she had agreed to move. The tenants’ lawyer, however, said they were not offered the settlement payment. Chernev criticized the tenants’ attorney for continuing to fight the case, saying it was a losing battle: “The owners are going to get possession.” He also emphasized that Tariq’s parents, who are currently living out of state, are elderly: “They just want to live with their family, which they’ve been wanting to do for a year and a half now.” Tariq Hilaly and his parents did not respond to a request for comment. Leslie Dreyer, an anti-eviction organizer with the Housing Rights Committee, noted that low-income tenants and seniors often have nowhere else to go after being evicted from a longtime home in San Francisco. “How many more elders do we have to lose before our representatives actually take initiative to protect the tenants that are most in need?” Dreyer said. Asked what her backup plan would be if she had to leave her home, Betty Rose paused and sighed. “I don’t have one.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"In California’s Bay Area, households earning six figures per year can now be considered \\"low income\\", according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Can you tell me the answer to who plays falcon in wet hot american summer??","completion":"In the film 'Wet Hot American Summer' (2001), Falcon is portrayed by actor Jonah Blechman. Jonah Blechman is an American actor known for his roles in films like 'This Boy's Life' (1993) alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, 'Another Gay Movie' (2006), and its sequel 'Another Gay Sequel: Gays Gone Wild!' (2008). In 'Wet Hot American Summer,' a cult classic satirical comedy, Blechman plays Falcon, a minor character. The film, directed by David Wain and written by Wain and Michael Showalter, is a parody of the teenage films from the late 1970s and early 1980s, particularly those set in summer camps. The ensemble cast includes other prominent actors, such as Janeane Garofalo, David Hyde Pierce, Molly Shannon, Paul Rudd, Christopher Meloni, and Elizabeth Banks, among others. Set on the last day of Camp Firewood in the summer of 1981, the film follows various campers and counselors as they try to tie up loose ends from the summer, find romance, and take part in wacky and witty antics. Though initially poorly received by critics, 'Wet Hot American Summer' garnered a cult following, which led to two Netflix prequel/sequel series, 'Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp' (2015) and 'Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later' (2017). However, Falcon's character does not appear in these follow-up series. In conclusion, Jonah Blechman plays the character Falcon in the 2001 film 'Wet Hot American Summer.'"},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

(II). 11. (III). five. (IV). two. The answer is:","completion":"(IV). two. A partial lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth moves between the Sun and the Moon, but the three celestial bodies do not align perfectly. The Earth casts a partial shadow, or penumbra, on the Moon, causing a noticeable darkening of the Moon's surface. This phenomenon can often be seen by observers on Earth, as the Moon's appearance changes even when not fully covered by Earth's shadow. The number of partial lunar eclipses that occur each year can vary, but the minimum number is two. This is due to the fact that there are two points in Earth's orbit where it aligns with both the Moon's orbit and the Sun. These points are known as lunar nodes. The Moon orbits Earth roughly every 29.5 days, and Earth orbits the Sun approximately once every 365.25 days. Since the Moon's orbit is tilted about 5° relative to Earth's orbit around the Sun, a direct alignment of the Sun, Earth, and Moon, allowing for a partial lunar eclipse, will only occur at certain points during Earth's orbit around the Sun. The most favorable times for eclipses to occur are when Earth is closest to the lunar nodes, which happens twice a year, approximately 173.3 days apart. These periods are known as \\"eclipse seasons.\\" When an eclipse season occurs, there are typically two eclipses – a solar eclipse and either a total, partial, or penumbral lunar eclipse depending on the alignment. The minimum number of partial lunar eclipses per year is two, as there are two eclipse seasons where at least one partial lunar eclipse can occur. However, not all eclipse seasons will host a partial lunar eclipse, and the number of partial eclipses might differ each year due to the relative positions of the Moon, Earth, and Sun. It is worth noting that the frequency of partial lunar eclipses can also be influenced by other factors such as the precession of the Moon's orbit and Earth's axial tilt. These factors can cause slight variations in the timing and occurrence of eclipses, leading to a complex pattern of eclipse frequency over time. Overall, the minimum number of partial lunar eclipses that can be expected in any given year is two, but the actual number may vary due to a combination of orbital factors and other celestial phenomena."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

WASHINGTON — The number of people without health insurance continues to decline and has dropped by 15.8 million, or one-third, since 2013, the Obama administration said Tuesday. The decline occurred as major provisions of the Affordable Care Act took effect. The law expanded coverage through Medicaid and through subsidies for private insurance, starting in 2014. In the first three months of this year, the National Center for Health Statistics said, 29 million people were uninsured. That was seven million fewer than the average for 2014, after a reduction of 8.8 million from 2013 to 2014. The data may bolster Democrats’ claims that the law is working as they intended, but it is unlikely to prompt Republicans to let up on criticism of the law, which was passed without any Republican votes. In a report on its findings, the center said that the proportion of the population without insurance had declined by five percentage points, to 9.2 percent, in the first quarter of this year, from 14.4 percent in 2013. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Among people age 18 to 64, the number who were uninsured dropped by about one-third, to 25.5 million, in the first quarter of this year, from 39.6 million in 2013. And among children under 18, the number of uninsured declined to 3.4 million this year, from 4.8 million in 2013. The decline in the number of uninsured coincides with improvements in the economy. In the last two years, the recovery has gained traction and the unemployment rate has declined steadily. The numbers for the first quarter of this year, from the National Health Interview Survey, are estimates based on data for 26,121 people. The information was collected in household interviews by the Census Bureau, using procedures specified by the National Center for Health Statistics, a part of the Public Health Service. The survey focused on the civilian population outside prisons and nursing homes. Number of Uninsured Continues to Drop The Obama administration reports that 9.2 percent of all Americans were uninsured in the first quarter of this year, down from 14.4 percent in 2013, just before major provisions of the Affordable Care Act went into effect.

In the first three months of this year, among poor people age 18 to 64, about 28 percent lacked health insurance, down from 39.3 percent in 2013, the government said.

States that expanded Medicaid have seen a sharper drop in the proportion of people who are uninsured, although residents of those states were also more likely to have coverage before the health law took effect.

By contrast, it said, in 2013, people without coverage accounted for at least 20 percent of the population in 14 states. Arkansas, California and Kentucky were among the states showing the largest reductions in the proportion of people without insurance. The data, collected in telephone interviews as part of the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, showed that the uninsured now account for 5 percent of the population or less in seven states: Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Vermont.

Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington join them as states that have at least a 10-percentage-point reduction in uninsured rates. Seven of the 10 states with the greatest reductions in uninsured rates have expanded Medicaid and established a state-based marketplace exchange or state-federal partnership, while two have implemented one or the other. The marketplace exchanges opened on Oct. 1, 2013, with new insurance plans purchased during the last quarter of that year typically starting on Jan. 1, 2014. Medicaid expansion among initially participating states also began with the onset of 2014. As such, 2013 serves as a benchmark year for uninsured rates as they existed prior to the enactment of the two major mechanisms of the healthcare law. Through the first half of 2015, there are now seven states with uninsured rates that are at or below 5%: Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, Minnesota, Iowa, Connecticut and Hawaii. Previously -- from 2008 through 2014 -- Massachusetts had been the only state to be at or below this rate. No state, in turn, has reported a statistically significant increase in the percentage of uninsured thus far in 2015 compared with 2013. Nationwide, the uninsured rate fell from 17.3% in full-year 2013 to 11.7% in the first half of 2015. These data, collected as part of the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, are based on Americans' answers to the question, \\"Do you have health insurance coverage?\\" These state-level data are based on daily surveys conducted from January through June 2015 and include sample sizes that range from 232 randomly selected adult residents in Hawaii to more than 8,600 in California. States That Have Embraced Multiple Parts of Health Law Continue to See More Improvement Collectively, the uninsured rate in states that have chosen to expand Medicaid and set up their own state exchanges or partnerships in the health insurance marketplace has declined significantly more since 2013 than the rate in states that did not take these steps. The uninsured rate declined 7.1 points in the 22 states that implemented both of these measures by Dec. 31, 2014, compared with a 5.3-point drop across the 28 states that had implemented only one or neither of these actions. Although the 22 states that implemented both mechanisms before Jan. 1, 2015, had a lower uninsured rate to begin with, the 7.1-point drop is larger than what is reported among the other 28 states, and represents a 44% decline since 2013 in the uninsured rate among adults residing there. The 5.3-point drop in the 28 states that have implemented one or neither of the mechanisms represents a 28% decline in uninsured rates. Still, the difference in the rate of decline in uninsured rates between the two groups of states has now leveled off, and is unchanged relative to the same 1.8-point gap in the rate of decline measured in midyear 2014. The end of this article contains a full list of all 50 states, and the 2013 and first-half 2015 uninsured rates for each. Implications Americans' attitudes about the law known as \\"Obamacare\\" have become more positive in recent months, and now as many Americans approve of the law as disapprove, a shift from the last several years in which disapproval had consistently outweighed approval. This is happening as uninsured rates for most states have continued to decline. The Supreme Court ruling in the King v. Burwell case preserved subsidies for qualifying, low-income adults in states that have defaulted to the federal exchange rather than set up their own locally managed and promoted insurance marketplaces. That decision preserves health insurance for the millions of American adults in those states who have gained health insurance via the federal marketplace in the last two years. A few states, including Utah, continue to consider Medicaid expansion under modified specifications from what is detailed in the Affordable Care Act. In addition to New Hampshire last August, Indiana and Pennsylvania each enacted Medicaid expansion in early 2015, becoming the 27th and 28th states (plus the District of Columbia) to expand Medicaid. Implementation of this type of expansion in Montana is pending federal waiver approval, and Alaska Gov. Bill Walker has announced that he will proceed with expansion, submitting plans on July 16 to accept federal funds for Medicaid, with a Sept. 1 target date for expansion. While some additional progress can be made, therefore, in the reduction of the uninsured rate via further Medicaid expansion, this mechanism for reduction has likely reached most of its potential unless additional states choose to implement it. As such, the marketplace exchanges that enable people to select and purchase their own plan directly from insurers will likely be the primary means by which the national uninsured rate would be reduced in the immediate future. Change Analysis Rules Some states have chosen to implement state-federal \\"partnership\\" exchanges, where states manage certain functions and make key decisions based on local market and demographic conditions. For the purposes of this analysis, these partnerships are included with the state exchanges. States with Medicaid expansion that occurred on or after Jan. 1, 2015, were excluded from the \\"States With Medicaid Expansion and State Exchange/Partnerships\\" group. For example, Pennsylvania, which manages a state-based exchange but did not enact Medicaid expansion until Jan. 1, 2015, is excluded, while New Hampshire -- which expanded in August 2014 and has been excluded in previous analyses -- qualified for this one. Four states -- North Dakota, New Jersey, Ohio and Arizona -- decided to expand Medicaid without also administering a state-based exchange or partnership, while several others continue to debate expansion. Pennsylvania enacted Medicaid expansion effective Jan. 1, 2015, and Indiana did so on Feb. 1. The District of Columbia, which has expanded Medicaid and has implemented a locally managed exchange, is not included in this analysis. Survey Methods Results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Dec. 30, 2013, and Jan. 2-June 30, 2015, as part of the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, with a random sample of 178,072 adults in 2013 and 88,667 adults through the first half of 2015, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The margin of sampling error is ±1 to ±2 percentage points for most states, but climbs as high as ±4 percentage points for 2015 results for states with small populations such as North Dakota, Wyoming, Vermont and Alaska. All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting. Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 50% cellphone respondents and 50% landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region. Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods.

(Photo: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI, AFP/Getty Images) The number of Americans without health insurance dropped from 36 million last year to 29 million in the first quarter of this year, according to the latest in a string of reports showing uninsured rates are on the decline. The newest report, released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics on Wednesday, contains early estimates from the National Health Interview Survey, which are based on data for 26,121 people from across the nation. The estimate of 29 million, which represents 9.2% of Americans, reflects the portion of respondents who reported being uninsured at the time of the interview. \\"Our report doesn't address any reasons\\" behind the drop in the uninsured, lead author Robin Cohen says.\\"We're a policy-neutral research organization.\\" The report adds to mounting evidence of the same trend. Research published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association analyzed 2012-15 results of the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index and found a 7.9 percentage point drop in the number of people who reported being uninsured since the Affordable Care Act took effect. And a report released in March by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the number of adults without insurance fell 16.5 million from five years ago. \\"Certainly, the biggest thing that's going on is the ACA,\\" says Rachel Garfield, a senior researcher and expert on the uninsured at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \\"The reason we know that is that groups being targeted by the ACA are seeing the sharpest declines in uninsured rates.\\" Wednesday's report details insurance gains for various groups in the first quarter of this year: • Among adults 18-64, 18.1% had public coverage, 70.4% had private coverage and 13% were uninsured. The uninsured rate was down from 16.3% in 2014, a departure from generally rising uninsured rates during the years 1997-2010. • Among children, 4.6% were uninsured — less than half the 1997 rate of 13.9% — and 40.4% had public coverage. Just over 56% were covered by private plans, up slightly from 2013, reversing a 14-year trend of declining private coverage rates among the youngest Americans. • More poor people have gotten insured. Since 2013, poor and near-poor children and working-age adults saw the biggest drops in their uninsured rates. And working-age adults who live in states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA were less likely to be uninsured than residents of non-expansion states. Avik Roy, a health care policy expert with the free market Manhattan Institute, says he'd rather see more Americans get insured through jobs than through Medicaid, partly because fewer physicians accept the government plan for the poor and disabled and recipients don't get the same access to care. Roy also argues that employment is at least as important as the ACA in driving health coverage. When more people are working, he says, more have insurance. \\"In general, we should fully expect this in an economy that's slowly recovering,\\" he says. \\"The ACA is part of the reason why we've had such a slow economic recovery.\\" Garfield acknowledges that the improving economy helps push down uninsured rates, but says it's not as big a factor as the health reform law. She expects to see uninsured rates keep falling through \\"full implementation\\" of the ACA in 2016-17, then begin leveling off and perhaps eventually reach half the pre-ACA number of 46 million. Experts don't expect everyone to get insurance; undocumented immigrants, for example, aren't eligible for coverage through the ACA. \\"Many expect the (uninsured) rate will continue to fall,\\" Garfield says. \\"But it won't reach zero.\\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1To5iDu ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"In the United States, the number of people without health insurance continues to decline and has dropped by 15.8 million or one-third since 2013, according to the Obama administration.

Her parents file a lawsuit against the genetics company InGen, now headed by John Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow, who plans to use Isla Sorna to alleviate the financial losses imposed by the incident that occurred at Jurassic Park four years earlier. Mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm meets Hammond at his mansion. Hammond explains that Isla Sorna, abandoned years earlier during a hurricane, is where InGen created their dinosaurs before moving them to Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar. Hammond hopes to stop InGen by sending a team to Isla Sorna to document the dinosaurs, thus causing public support against human interference on the island. Ian, who survived the Jurassic Park disaster, is reluctant.

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: It is said that in the United States much has been told about that anyone can become rich and successful if he works hard and has some good luck. Yes, when one becomes rich he wants people to know it. And even though he does not become very rich, he wants people to think that he is. That's what \\"Keeping up with the Joneses \\" is about The expression was first used in 1913 by a young American called Arthur Momand looked around him and noticed that many people did things to keep up with their neighbours. He called it \\"Keeping up with the Joneses\\", because Jones is a very common name in the United States. \\"Keeping up with the Joneses\\" came to mean keeping up with the people around you. Momand's series appeared in different newspapers across the country for over 28 years. People never seem to get tired of keeping up with the Joneses. That is one reason why they read \\"right\\" books, go to \\"right\\" universities and eat in \\"right\\" restaurants. Every city has an area where people want to live because others will think better of them if they do. And there are Joneses in every city of the world. But one must get tired of trying to keep up with the Joneses, because no matter what one does, Mr Jones always seems to be ahead.

Q:Question: \\"What sare the benifts of the blood brain barrir?\\" Context: \\"Another approach to brain function is to examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The benefits of the blood-brain barrier include: 1. Protection: It serves as a protective shield for the brain, ensuring that most harmful substances, toxins, and pathogens cannot enter the brain from the bloodstream. This helps maintain the brain's delicate environment and functioning. 2. Regulation: The blood-brain barrier helps regulate the movement of essential nutrients, ions, and molecules between the bloodstream and the brain. This ensures that the brain receives the necessary substances and maintains a stable environment for optimal neuronal function. 3. Selective Permeability: The blood-brain barrier is selectively permeable, which means that it allows certain substances, such as vital nutrients like glucose and amino acids, to pass through while blocking others. This selectivity helps the brain maintain its chemical balance and prevent toxic substances from entering. 4. Maintaining Homeostasis: The blood-brain barrier plays a crucial role in maintaining the brain's homeostasis, ensuring that the brain's environment and functioning remain stable and consistent despite changes in the more-variant external environment of the body. Overall, the blood-brain barrier is essential for sustaining the brain's function, protection, and general well-being."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

While Joseph was highly motivated, diligent, and committed to succeeding at the task at hand, Nick's indifference and lack of enthusiasm proved to be a significant obstacle in his journey towards success. Despite both individuals possessing the necessary skills and abilities to complete the goal, Nick's lackadaisical attitude caused a divergence in their respective outcomes. From the very beginning, Joseph showed a burning passion for achieving the goal. He woke up early every day, meticulously planned his schedule, and spent long hours honing his skills and knowledge. In addition, Joseph proactively sought feedback from others, consistently pushing himself to exceed his own expectations. The result of his efforts was a display of unwavering resilience and a relentless pursuit of improvement, propelling him towards the successful completion of the task. On the other hand, Nick's disinterest in the process was evident from the start. He frequently procrastinated, succumbing to distractions that hindered his progress and resulted in minimal investment in the goal. Even when faced with setbacks and obstacles, Nick failed to exhibit the motivation and determination needed to overcome such challenges. Instead, he wallowed in self-pity and continued to cling to his lackadaisical demeanor, allowing his chances of success to dissipate further. As time went on, the differences between Nick's and Joseph's dedication only became more pronounced. While Joseph continued to push the boundaries of his capabilities and make strides towards achieving the goal, Nick remained stuck in his lackadaisical mindset, unwilling to take the concrete actions necessary for change. As a result, the gap between their respective accomplishments widened, and it became increasingly apparent that only one of them possessed the drive and commitment needed to secure success. Ultimately, Joseph's unwavering resolve and enthusiasm led him to the achievement of the goal he so earnestly sought. In contrast, Nick's lackadaisical approach resulted in stagnation and failure to reach the desired outcome. It was evident that the distinction between their levels of effort and determination played a critical role in determining each person's ability to effectively complete the goal. In conclusion, Nick was unable to complete the goal as opposed to Joseph, due to his lackadaisical attitude and unwillingness to put forth the necessary effort. Joseph's unwavering dedication and determination exemplified the power of hard work and persistence in the pursuit of success, while Nick's unwillingness to change ultimately served as his undoing.

Movie plot title: Tideland Movie plot: Tideland centers on an abandoned child, Jeliza-Rose, and her solitary adventures during one summer in rural Texas while staying at a rundown farmhouse called What Rocks, and focuses on the increasingly dark, imaginative fantasy life the girl creates with the aid of dismembered Barbie doll heads that she often wears on her fingertips. With names such as Mystique, Sateen Lips, Baby Blonde and Glitter Gal, the doll heads not only engage in long conversations with Jeliza-Rose, reflecting different aspects of the girl's psyche, but also act as her companions while she explores the barren Texas landscape. After her mother chokes to death, Jeliza-Rose and her father, Noah, flee to Noah's mother's home, a remote Texas farmhouse. Noah fears that with all the drugs in their house he will lose Jeliza-Rose and be sent to prison, so he attempts to set it alight before they leave, although Jeliza-Rose manages to stop him. They find the farmhouse abandoned, but they settle in anyway. Their first night there, Noah dies from a heroin overdose. For much of the rest of the film, Noah's corpse remains seated upright in a living room chair with sunglasses covering his eyes. As her father slowly begins to decompose, Jeliza-Rose doesn't readily acknowledge his death because she has grown accustomed to him being unconscious for long periods at a time. Instead, she retreats deeper and deeper into her own mind, exploring the tall grass around the farmhouse, relying on her doll heads for friendship as an unconscious way of keeping herself from feeling too lonely and afraid.

Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury. - Arsia Mons is the southernmost of three volcanos (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. To its north is Pavonis Mons, and north of that is Ascraeus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is to its northwest. Its name comes from a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which he named in turn after the legendary Roman forest of Arsia Silva. - The Tharsis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Tharsis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9). - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that leaves Earth orbit and explores space. It may approach the Moon; enter interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or approach interstellar space. - Pavonis Mons (Latin for \\"peacock mountain\\") is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the middle member of a chain of three volcanic mountains (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes) that straddle the Martian equator between longitudes 235°E and 259°E. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 and was originally called Middle Spot. Its name formally became Pavonis Mons in 1973. - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock. - Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world. - The Tharsis Montes are three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. From north to south, the volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. Mons (plural \\"montes\\") is the Latin word for mountain. It is a descriptor term used in astrogeology for mountainous features in the Solar System. - Ulysses Tholus is a Martian volcano. It is located in the Tharsis quadrangle at 2.89° north latitude and 121.55° west longitude. It is 58 km across and is named after a classical albedo feature name. Ulysses Tholus is immediately east and slightly north of another volcano, Biblis Tholus. - Olympus Mons (Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22 km (13.6 mi). Olympus Mons stands about two and a half times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It is currently the largest volcano discovered in the Solar System and had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \\"Olympic Snow\\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain. - Ascraeus Mons is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the northernmost and tallest of three shield volcanoes collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The volcano's location corresponds to the classical albedo feature Ascraeus Lacus. - Biblis Tholus is an extinct Martian volcano located at 2.55 ° N 235.62 ° E , one of two volcanoes near the center of the Tharsis volcanism . Along with Ulysses Tholus , it is almost midway between Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes . It is approximately 170 kilometers ( 110 mi ) long and 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) wide , rising about 3 kilometers ( 1.9 mi ) from its surroundings . In the middle of the volcano is a caldera , named Biblis Patera , believed to have formed as the result of collapse of the magma chamber during eruptions of the volcano . The caldera is 53 kilometers ( 33 mi ) in diameter and four kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) in depth . - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - Mount Everest, also known in Nepal as Sagarmth and in China as Chomolungma/, is earth's highest mountain. Its peak is above sea level. Mount Everest is in the Mahalangur Range. The international border between China (Tibet Autonomous Region) and Nepal runs across Everest's summit point. Its massif includes neighbouring peaks Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , and Changtse, . - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers. Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground.

They don't have simple models of how it should work. They don't know what to do when it doesn't work. I think there is huge potential, so I have designed some for them. The ability to connect to friends, who remember the same movies, news and music, is really important, especially as people get older. They end up in retirement homes and they aren't always close to their friends. Allowing the network to help them connect with friends and family members is a really powerful thing. My wife likes using the Internet, although it took me years to get her to use e-mail. She was born with normal hearing, but lost it when she was three years old. She was totally deaf for many years until 53 when she got ear implants .They work really well. That is a big change for her. Before then, her friends couldn't call her on the phone, so they insisted that she use e-mails to communicate with them. The younger people don't even think of this as technology. It's just there, and they use it .There's been a very interesting change in communication styles between the old and the young .A woman named Sharryturkle wrote about this phenomenon .There are some kids who are now in their teens and are tending not to make phone calls. And they think of e-mail as old-fashioned and slow. The reason why teens don't make phone calls seems to be that they don't know what to say. When they call they often pause for a while. On the other hand, texting is considered proper, and it's OK if you don't answer. You might have been distracted .It's not considered rude, but it's considered unusual if you're in this kind of voice conversation and simply stop talling.

Given the question: I have a new situation: In his chemistry lab David is learning about acids. He took three solutions to identify them correctly, sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a strong acid; sample B is a weak acid; and sample C is not an acid. David needs to identify the content of each sample by learning about their attributes. But I can use this background: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar? Like other acids, it tastes sour. Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms. For example, stomach acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of mucus. Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass. What is an answer for this question: Would sample C have pH higher or lower than seven? The answer is:","completion":"To answer the question, let's examine the information given step by step: 1. Sample A is a strong acid, sample B is a weak acid, and sample C is not an acid. 2. If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. 3. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid. 4. The more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value. Now, let's analyze the information: Since sample C is not an acid, it means that it does not have a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water. This implies that its pH must be either equal to or greater than 7. Therefore, sample C would have a pH higher or equal to 7."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Select the topic that this about: Costs tied to the country's controversial biometric ID card plan will cause the price of new passports to soar.","completion":"The topic under discussion is the increasing cost of passports due to the implementation of a biometric ID card plan in the country. The controversial biometric ID card plan has drawn criticism from various parties due to concerns about its impact on an individual's privacy, security, and the potential for misuse. As a result, the costs involved in the implementation of this project are likely to have a significant impact on the cost of obtaining a new passport. To provide a detailed and comprehensive analysis on this topic, we will discuss the following aspects: 1. The Biometric ID Card Plan: A brief introduction to the controversial biometric ID card plan, its purpose, and major features. 2. Privacy, Security, and Misuse Concerns: An exploration of the major concerns raised by critics of the biometric ID card plan, including privacy and security risks, as well as the potential for misuse of personal data. 3. Implementation Costs: A detailed examination of the various costs involved in implementing the biometric ID card plan and its impact on the price of new passports. 4. Alternative Approaches: A review of alternative methods to enhance passport security and authentication without incurring such high implementation costs. The Biometric ID Card Plan The biometric ID card plan was introduced as a measure to enhance national security, border control, and immigration enforcement. It is designed to store an individual's biometric data, such as fingerprints, facial features, and iris scans, on a secure chip embedded within the identification document. This data can then be used to verify the individual's identity more effectively than traditional methods. Privacy, Security, and Misuse Concerns Despite the advantages that the biometric ID card plan may offer in terms of security and enforcement, several concerns have been raised by critics, including: - Privacy concerns: Storing biometric data on ID cards could lead to breaches of privacy, as this sensitive data could potentially be accessed and used by unauthorized parties or even stolen in case of data breaches. - Security risks: The centralized storage of biometric data creates a single point of vulnerability that could be exploited by cybercriminals or nation-state actors, leading to widespread identity theft and fraud. - Potential misuse: Government authorities may use the biometric data for purposes beyond national security and immigration control, such as surveillance, profiling, or targeting individuals for political or discriminatory purposes. Implementation Costs The costs of implementing the biometric ID card plan are substantial and include expenses related to: - Research and development: The development of advanced biometric technologies and secure storage solutions requires significant investment in research and development. - Infrastructure: The implementation of new systems and equipment to capture biometric data, process it, and embed the information into secure chips on ID cards and passports requires considerable resources and infrastructure investments. - Training: Government employees who process and handle biometric ID cards must be trained on new procedures and technologies, further increasing costs. - Public awareness: Ensuring the public is informed about the new biometric ID requirements and ensuring that the ID cards are adopted by the majority of the population would require extensive public awareness campaigns. These costs are eventually passed on to the general public in the form of higher prices for new passports and other government-issued identification documents. Alternative Approaches There are alternative approaches to enhancing passport security and authentication without implementing the controversial biometric ID card plan. Some of these include: - Increasing security features on existing passports, such as adding holograms, watermarking, or using advanced materials that make counterfeiting more difficult. - Relying on technology like mobile-based authentication methods, which offer more privacy-friendly and cost-effective solutions for verifying someone's identity without requiring the storage and handling of sensitive biometric data. - Strengthening partnerships between countries to collaborate on shared databases for lost or stolen passports, which would improve the detection of forged documents at border crossings. In conclusion, the increasing cost of passports due to the implementation of the country's controversial biometric ID card plan is a considerable concern. As the plan faces scrutiny and criticism related to individual privacy, security risks, and potential misuse, alternative methods of improving passport security could be explored to avoid the high costs and controversial nature of the biometric ID card plan."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 1: A school bus is driving uphill on a rural road. Sentence 2: A race car is driving along a dirt road. Now, let's compare them. Both sentences talk about a vehicle (school bus and race car) driving on a road. But the first sentence is about a school bus going uphill on a country road, and the second one is about a race car on a dirt road. They are different types of vehicles and different types of roads. So, on a scale from 0 (no meaning overlap) to 5 (means the same thing), I would say the sentences have a meaning overlap of about 2.

Q: Which generation of a plant is generally larger and longer-lived? A: The answer is:","completion":"To find the answer to this question, I will first need to gather information about the various generations of a plant and their respective sizes and lifespans. Step 1: Understanding plant generations Plants mainly reproduce through two cycles, the alternation of generations: the sporophyte generation and the gametophyte generation. The sporophyte generation produces spores, and the gametophyte generation produces gametes. Step 2: Comparing the size and lifespan of plant generations In most plants, the sporophyte generation is generally larger and longer-lived compared to the gametophyte generation. This is because the sporophyte generation carries out most of the photosynthetic activity and provides structural support for the plant.

Write an article based on this summary: The funeral of actor Frank Kelly, best known for his role as Father Jack Hackett in Channel 4 comedy Father Ted, has taken place in Dublin.","completion":"Title: Remembering Frank Kelly: A Fond Farewell to Father Jack Hackett The Dublin skies were grey and somber, a fitting canvas for a city mourning the loss of one of its most iconic and beloved actors. Friends, family, and fans gathered to pay their last respects to the incomparable Frank Kelly as his funeral service took place on March 3. Known for his unforgettable portrayal of the lovably cantankerous priest Father Jack Hackett in the hit Channel 4 comedy 'Father Ted,' Frank Kelly's sudden passing left an indelible void in the hearts of those who knew him or admired his work. Born in County Dublin on December 28, 1938, Frank Kelly's acting career spanned over six decades, with an impressive range of roles in theater, film, and television. Though his most famous role was undoubtedly as Father Jack, Kelly's talent for comedy shone through in his numerous other characters, including his work on 'Hall's Pictorial Weekly' and 'Glenroe,' and appearances in 'Emmerdale' and 'Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie.' A multifaceted artist, he was also known for his radio and television work as a writer, director, and producer. At the service held in the Church of the Guardian Angels in Blackrock, the eulogies painted a vivid picture of a man who was as kind and generous as he was talented. His children recounted stories of their father with fondness, while fellow 'Father Ted' actor Joe Rooney, who played Father Damo, spoke lovingly of the show's impact and the lasting friendships forged during the three seasons it aired. A poignant moment occurred when Eoin McLove, a character from the show, recited one of Father Jack Hackett's iconic catchphrases: \\"Drink! Feck! Arse! Girls!\\" evoking laughter and tears from those in attendance. Kelly's children described their father's love for his craft, and how acting was his passion from an early age. They recounted how their father studied acting at the Dublin's Gate Theatre, immersing himself in the works of Shakespeare and Beckett before branching out into a wide array of roles. He often claimed that playing Father Jack was \\"the gift of a lifetime,\\" despite struggling at times with the immense public recognition that came with it. The late actor's generosity was apparent in his philanthropic endeavors. Kelly was an active patron for many charitable organizations, including the Irish Heart Foundation and the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook. In remembrance of his kindness and dedication to the well-being of others, the mourners were encouraged to make donations to ASPISC (Association for Suicide Prevention and Inner City Services), a charity close to Kelly's heart. As the funeral procession made its way through the streets of Dublin, the city that had been his home for so many years, it was clear that the impact of Frank Kelly's life and career went far beyond his time on the screen. His warmth, humor, and humanity touched the lives of everyone he met, and the legacy he leaves behind is one that will be cherished forever. In the words of Father Ted's creator, Graham Linehan, \\"If I live to be a hundred, I won't come up with another character as funny as Father Jack.\\" For those who loved and admired Frank Kelly, there can be no truer sentiment. As the curtains close on this extraordinary life, we say farewell to the man who created one of television's most iconic characters and, in doing so, brought laughter and joy to the hearts of countless viewers around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He has been declared dead many times, the latest by a US air strike on 14 June in Libya, according to the country's authorities. However, Belmokhtar has survived previous announcements of his death. In March 2013, the Chadian army claimed to have killed him, only for him to resurface months later. For years, the US government has been offering a reward of up to 5m (Â£3.3m) for information leading to his location. \\"He is one of the best known warlords of the Sahara,\\" Stephen Ellis, an academic at the African Studies Centre in Leiden in The Netherlands, says. He became known as \\"Mr Marlboro\\" because of his role in cigarette-smuggling across the Sahel region to finance his jihad, which he has recently waged under the banner of the Signed-in-Blood Battalion. \\"Belmokhtar has been active in political, ideological and criminal circles in the Sahara for the past two decades,\\" Jon Marks, an academic at the London-based think-tank Chatham House, told the BBC. Profile: Al-Qaeda in North Africa Born in Ghardaia in eastern Algeria in 1972, Belmokhtar - according to interviews posted on Islamist websites - was attracted as a schoolboy to waging jihad. Inspired to avenge the 1989 killing of Palestinian Islamist ideologue Abdullah Yusuf Azzam, he travelled to Afghanistan as a 19 year old to receive training from al-Qaeda. \\"While there, Belmokhtar claims [on Islamist websites] to have made connections with jihadis from around the world,\\" says the US-based Jamestown Foundation, in a report published on its website. \\"Moreover, Belmokhtar claims to have been to battlefronts 'from Qardiz to Jalalabad to Kabul'.\\" When he returned to Algeria in 1993, the country was already in the throes of conflict after the French-backed Algerian military annulled elections that the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win. Belmokhtar joined the conflict, which claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, and became a key figure in the militant Armed Islamist Group (GIA) and later the breakaway Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC). Algerian journalist Mohamed Arezki Himeur says Belmokhtar lost his left eye in fighting with government troops in the 1990s and now wears a false eye. \\"He has been condemned to death [by Algeria's courts] several times,\\" he adds. When the GSPC merged with al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Belmokhtar headed an AQIM battalion in the desert between Algeria and Mali. After AQIM stripped him of his title as \\"emir of the Sahel\\" as a result of in-fighting, Belmokhtar launched a new jihadist group in 2012, known variously as the Signed-in-Blood Battalion, the Masked Men Brigade and the Khaled Abu al-Abbas Brigade. The bloody attack on the In Amenas gas facility in south-eastern Algeria was its first big operation, showing that he remained influential despite his marginalisation within AQIM. Among the hundreds of hostages seized were many Western workers. By the time Algerian forces had brought the crisis to an end, 38 people were dead, of whom all but one were foreigners. It was thought Belmokhtar's aim had been to move the Western hostages to northern Mali, where French troops had intervened to oust an alliance of Islamist militants. Sightings of Belmokhtar had been reported in the two main cities in northern Mali, Timbuktu and Gao, since the al-Qaeda-linked rebels seized control of the region in 2011. \\"He knows the Sahara Desert very well,\\" says Mr Himeur. In recent years, Belmokhtar has gained notoriety as a hostage-taker across the vast Sahara, often demanding multi-million dollar ransoms from Western governments which - along with cigarette-smuggling - finances his jihad. Former UN Niger envoy Robert Fowler was captured by Belmokhtar loyalists outside Niger's capital, Niamey, in December 2008. \\"We were frog-marched and thrown into the back of a truck... We began our descent into hell - a 1,000km [600-mile] journey northwards, into the Sahara Desert,\\" he told the BBC. \\"I think I know instinctively what they [the hostages captured in Algeria were] going through.\\" In its report, the Jamestown Foundation said Belmokhtar had been able to operate across borders because of his deep ties to the region. \\"Key to Belmokhtar's Saharan activities has been his strong connections with local Tuareg communities... Belmokhtar is reported to have married four wives from local Arab and Tuareg communities,\\" it said. In June 2012, Algerian media reported that Belmokhtar - described in 2002 by French intelligence sources as \\"uncatchable\\" - had been killed in clashes between Islamists and Tuareg separatists in northern Mali. But this turned out to be untrue. The Signed-in-Blood Battalion warned in December 2012 against any attempt to drive out the Islamists from Mali. \\"We will respond forcefully [to all attackers]; we promise we will follow you to your homes and you will feel pain and we will attack your interests,\\" the group said, according to Sahara Media. The attacks in Niger, while planned by Belmokhtar, were allegedly carried out by his allies in Mujao fighters - angered by Niger's co-operation with France and involvement in Mali. Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou believes the militants who carried out the attack came from new bases in southern Libya. His country has contributed soldiers to the 6,000-strong West African force in Mali, which deployed following the French intervention in January 2012 and which will be incorporated into the new UN force in July. After the Niger attacks, an statement allegedly posted online by the Signed-in-Blood Battalion and signed by Belmokhtar urged Niger's withdrawal with this warning: \\"Columns of commandos and those seeking martyrdom are ready and waiting for their targets.\\" Summary:","completion":"This article is about a man named Belmokhtar who was a leader in terrorism and criminal activities in the Sahara Desert, but his current status is uncertain as he has been declared dead many times by different sources."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

They named it \\"Cleaveland\\" after their leader, General Moses Cleaveland. Cleaveland oversaw design of the plan for what would become the modern downtown area, centered on Public Square, before returning home, never again to visit Ohio. The first settler in Cleaveland was Lorenzo Carter, who built a cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga River. The Village of Cleaveland was incorporated on December 23, 1814. In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands and harsh winters, its waterfront location proved to be an advantage, giving access to Great Lakes trade. The area began rapid growth after the 1832 completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal. This key link between the Ohio River and the Great Lakes connected the city to the Atlantic Ocean via the Erie Canal and Hudson River, and later via the St. Lawrence Seaway. Its products could reach markets on the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River. Growth continued with added railroad links. Cleveland incorporated as a city in 1836.In 1836, the city, then located only on the eastern banks of the Cuyahoga River, nearly erupted into open warfare with neighboring Ohio City over a bridge connecting the two. Ohio City remained an independent municipality until its annexation by Cleveland in 1854. The city's prime geographic location as a transportation hub on the Great Lakes has played an important role in its development as a commercial center. Cleveland serves as a destination for iron ore shipped from Minnesota, along with coal transported by rail. In 1870, John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil in Cleveland. In 1885, he moved its headquarters to New York City, which had become a center of finance and business.Cleveland emerged in the early 20th century as an important American manufacturing center. Its businesses included automotive companies such as Peerless, People's, Jordan, Chandler, and Winton, maker of the first car... answer the following question: What was the nickname of the city that was named on July 22, 1796 during the early 20th century?

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions. Question: \\"What will the December flight test?\\" Answer: \\"The advantage of riding on the tip of the rocket ranter than the side\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the answer is not correct.

Article: Socialization is the process of introducing a puppy to new situations so he learns to interact properly. Introducing your puppy to new situations and people teaches him that the right things (such as other friendly dogs, cats, and people) are not to be feared. Fearful dogs can become “aggressive” if they bite and bark when they cannot run away from the situation. Running away from things that should not be feared can be dangerous. Dogs can run into traffic and get hit by vehicles or run away from home and get lost. Once he's current with vaccinations, you can take him to parks, for walks along busy streets, other dog-friendly places, or enroll him in obedience school. If there are no obedience classes in your area or if you are waiting for one to start up, you can start on basic commands and socialization. You can also take him to crowded areas so he can watch new people and things. You should try exposing your dog to as many different things as possible. For example, take him for a short car ride and stop every once in a while to let him check out his surroundings. Or, invite friends and their pets over to meet your dog. Let him interact with all different types of people and animals. Don't force or rush your dog to socialize. If he's fearful around new animals, don't constantly make him interact. Instead, take it slow and move at a pace that's clearly comfortable for him. If you do, your Jack Russell will learn to be nervous and aggressive with other dogs. Instead, try to keep him on his leash and keep him beside you when other dogs approach. If a stray or aggressive-looking dog comes up, leave the area quickly with your Jack Russell in tow. On the other hand, Jack Russells can be overly aggressive towards other dogs, even other Jack Russells. Since Jack Russell Terriers are hunting dogs, it's in their nature to be aggressive. You should never leave your dog unattended with another dog, even another Jack Russell Terrier. For this reason, you shouldn't have a Jack Russell Terrier around small children, small animals or pets, or cats. To curb some of your dog's aggression, keep him well exercised and active. Bored Jack Russell Terriers are more likely to be aggressive or destructive. Since your Jack Russell may think he's the top dog, let him know that you are the master. For example, after he's learned the sit command, make your Jack Russell sit for his food before you let him eat it. Be firm and consistent with him. Don't just let him do whatever he wants. You can take him for a long walk or play active games. Jack Russells are very smart and will keep you hopping unless they can find an outlet for all their pent-up energy. Playing active games such as fetch will help burn off their excessive energy. Terriers love this game. Jack Russells love when you chase them for the toy. Don't make this a habit, or your dog will learn not to come to you when you call him. Instead, teach him the \\"drop it\\" command. This way, you're still in charge of the game. These can help burn your Jack Russell's energy. Kongs are great toys because they're almost impossible to tear apart. You can pack them full of peanut butter and treats to keep you Jack Russell busy and working for his snacks. Generally, stuffed toys aren't great for terriers, even though they love them. Your Jack Russell will probably tear it apart and try to eat it piece by piece leaving your home covered in stuffing. Choose a high-quality dog food that isn't filled with grains or preservatives. Instead, look for a dog food that lists meat, such as lamb or chicken, as a top ingredient. Since dog food products vary, follow the specific feeding instructions on the package. You'll probably also need to adjust the amount food you give your Jack Russell Terrier based on his age, activity level, and size. As a general guideline, a 12 inch Jack Russell Terrier should weigh around 12 to 13 pounds.

Article: On Sunday, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney strongly endorsed the idea that House speaker Paul Ryan should step down in order to trigger an election that would force House Democrats to vote for unpopular Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. At a conference in Colorado sponsored by THE WEEKLY STANDARD, Fox News host Bret Baier asked Mulvaney what he thought of the idea that Ryan should step down and allow his likely successor, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, to become speaker this year. \\"I've talked with Kevin about this privately but not as much publicly,” Mulvaney replied. “Wouldn't it be great to force a Democrat running in a tight race to have to put up or shut up about voting for Nancy Pelosi eight weeks before an election? That's a really, really good vote for us to force if we can figure out how to do it.\\" As my colleague Haley Byrd reported over the weekend, talk of Ryan stepping down picked up after a vote on the farm bill failed on Friday: The push for a shortened leadership race began quietly in the days after Ryan announced he would retire. Some members, like close McCarthy ally Tom Graves, asserted that a lame-duck speaker would have diminished power within the GOP conference and on the campaign trail. “We would have more success if there’s no ambiguity as to what the leadership structure might look like,” Graves told Politico. But Friday appeared to have been a breaking point for the forces eager to see Ryan step down sooner, after GOP leaders were unable to navigate the demands of the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus, resulting in the embarrassing failure of the Farm Bill. In the aftermath of the bill’s demise on the House floor, a “senior Republican source” lashed out at Ryan in a Politico story about the legislative failure. The “senior Republican source” argued that “this is the problem when you have a lame duck speaker who announces he’s leaving eight months in advance.” “He can make calls to members to urge them to vote for something, but who will care?” the individual added. A remarkably similar quote later appeared in The Hill, also attributed to a senior GOP source. \\"If you have somebody who’s going to be stepping down eight months in advance, a lot of people are not going to care what you have to say,” the source said. One problem with the plan: Paul Ryan has shown no interest in giving up the job before he retires from Congress. “I’ve talked to a lot of members who think it is in our best interest for me to stay here and run through the tape,” Ryan said at a press conference last month. Jonathan Swan of Axios reported Sunday that Kevin McCarthy’s “allies tell me they believe opponents are planting stories amping up the Ryan-McCarthy divide to ‘drive a wedge’ between the two men.\\" But Mulvaney is not an enemy of McCarthy—he’s an ally. McCarthy told TWS's Haley Byrd it was \\"completely untrue\\" that he has been entertaining a plan to force a speaker's election before November. \\"Paul has my total support,\\" McCarthy said in a statement Sunday. \\"Together we are completely focused on our agenda and traveling the country to take our unified message and action to the voters in November.” Asked to respond to Mulvaney's remarks, McCarthy spokesman Matt Sparks tells TWS that McCarthy \\"opposes holding a speaker election\\" anytime between now and November. Update: A senior House GOP source tells TWS: \\"The idea of having a speaker’s vote now in the hopes of forcing vulnerable Democrats to vote for Pelosi is painfully dumb. There are maybe one or two incumbent House Democrats running for re-election that are all that vulnerable. The pickup opportunities we’re seriously contesting are Nolan, Walz, and Shea-Porter, all of whom aren’t running.\\" Update II: Mulvaney spokeswoman Meghan Burris issued the following statement on Monday: \\"Mick works on a regular basis with the Speaker and Majority Leader and his comments Sunday morning were purely hypothetical. He is supportive of the Speaker. He is also supportive of any ideas that unite Republicans and divide Democrats, which is what his comments at the conference referenced. He is not ‘working behind the scenes’ for an early Speaker’s race nor getting involved in any leadership races.\\" ||||| Top House Republicans are privately questioning whether retiring Speaker Paul Ryan can make it through Election Day. No one’s plotting to take him out at this point, and Ryan insists he’s not going anywhere. But rank-and-file Republicans, including moderates who’ve been unflinchingly loyal to Ryan during his three-year tenure, have become increasingly willing to defy the lame-duck leader. And White House officials have also discussed whether Ryan should remain in the job, administration sources said, though there is no effort by the Trump White House to push out Ryan. Story Continued Below The doubts have been fueled by a series of high-profile embarrassments for the Wisconsin Republican. The most recent was the collapse of the Republican farm bill Friday on the House floor. But centrist Republicans have also backed Ryan into a corner on immigration, the most contentious issue facing the party. And this week, those moderates are expected to reach the 218-vote threshold needed to force bipartisan votes to protect Dreamers — despite Ryan’s effort to stop them. “The conference is in open warfare. Paul has run out of juice,” said a senior Republican lawmaker who wants a speaker vote to happen soon and requested anonymity to speak frankly. “It became clear on Friday that it’s time to let go.” The most reliable politics newsletter.

Adding to the awkwardness, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney over the weekend endorsed the idea of Ryan stepping down now and allowing his likely successor, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, to become speaker this year. Procedurally, such a vote would also force Democrats to vote for or against Nancy Pelosi as party leader. \\"I've talked with Kevin about this privately but not as much publicly,” Mulvaney said at an event hosted by The Weekly Standard. “Wouldn't it be great to force a Democrat running in a tight race to have to put up or shut up about voting for Nancy Pelosi eight weeks before an election? That's a really, really good vote for us to force if we can figure out how to do it.\\" McCarthy denied suggestions Monday that he was trying to get President Donald Trump to oust Ryan, dismissing a separate report in The Weekly Standard that a coup was afoot. He also downplayed Mulvaney’s comments, arguing that the “only thing Mulvaney has ever talked about is ‘Will you run for speaker if we keep the majority?’ Nothing different than that whatsoever.” “Paul is here until the end of election,” McCarthy said, disputing the notion that Ryan is too weak to remain speaker. The majority leader blamed Democrats for last week’s debacle on the farm bill. “Democrats don’t want to work with us on anything, from the farm bill to taxes to opioids or anything else, so we had to do the farm bill all by ourselves,” McCarthy said. Ryan allies argue that pushing him out wouldn’t solve the GOP’s internal problems. Plus, Republicans from all camps agree that McCarthy currently wouldn't have 218 votes to be speaker — mainly because he hasn’t yet cut a deal with Freedom Caucus members for their votes. “Speaker Ryan has said he intends to run through the tape and that has not changed,” said spokeswoman AshLee Strong. But it’s unclear how long that argument will keep Ryan skeptics at bay. After Ryan announced in mid-April his plans to retire at the end of the year but remain speaker through the election, White House officials asked members of the speaker’s staff whether it would be sustainable for him to remain in the job for seven more months, according to one administration official. Around that time, Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.) — a close friend of McCarthy (R-Calif.) — suggested publicly that Ryan should step down as speaker sooner, rather than later. Some GOP donors also began expressing concerns about giving money to a lame-duck speaker who wouldn’t be there next year. Ryan’s office, however, insisted he would not be pushed out. And since then, both the White House and McCarthy allies have kept their concerns about Ryan’s effectiveness private, according to at least five sources. McCarthy and the White House don’t want to be seen as pushing Ryan out because the move could backfire and repel some House Republicans. Still, some Republicans feel strongly that Ryan is losing his grip on the conference. The farm bill exposed that, they argue, because normally reliable Republicans opposed the bill despite Ryan personally lobbying for their support. Those members included Reps. Fred Upton and Rodney Frelinghuysen. Another recent episode provided more evidence of Ryan’s waning power. During a private meeting with top Republicans last week, Ryan backed Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker (R-N.C.) to fill a vacancy on the powerful Ways and Means Committee. Republicans typically heed Ryan’s preferences for such openings, but in this case the committee went against the speaker and backed Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio) instead. Meanwhile, the White House has grown frustrated with the lack of movement on Trump’s proposal to cut spending — and some blame Ryan for the slowdown. It was Ryan who insisted several weeks ago that the so-called rescissions package be modified, siding with GOP appropriators who were concerned that revisiting a deal they had reached months earlier with Democrats and that Trump had signed would set a bad precedent. The House has delayed consideration of the package because Republicans have been unable to lock down the votes, though leaders still expect to pass the bill after making additional tweaks to the proposal. Ryan still enjoys support from a majority of the conference. National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Steve Stivers said in an interview Monday that “Paul’s our best face on issues” and has “historically [been] our best fundraiser and is doing an incredible job.” “There may be those who try to challenge him, but I feel like he’s not going anywhere anytime soon, nor will he because he’s the best person to be speaker,” the Ohio Republican said. Asked whether stories about GOP infighting would hurt Republicans’ fundraising ability, Stivers allowed that “it might” but then argued he didn’t think so. “People are still supporting him because it’s not about one person; it’s about what our House majority means and he’s able to articulate that very well,” Stivers said. “So I don’t think it’s going to be a problem. We keep watching it, but he’s continuing to do very very well.” However, things are going to get only more difficult for Ryan in the coming weeks when moderates are expected to force a contentious floor vote on immigration. Ryan had promised the centrists that if they don’t seek a showdown right away, he’d help them write a bill that codifies the Obama-era program to protect Dreamers and increases border security. Yet moderate Republicans, annoyed with conservatives who helped sink the farm bill Friday, are expected to forge ahead with their initial plan. Ryan will likely be powerless to stop it as more and more Republicans sign on to the petition forcing votes on bipartisan DACA bills. ||||| (CNN) House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Monday categorically denied that he's spoken with Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney about replacing Paul Ryan as House speaker before the election. \\"No, there is no plan and Mick has not talked to me about coming up with a plan,\\" the California Republican said after being asked about comments Mulvaney made at a Colorado conference sponsored by the Weekly Standard . Fox News' Bret Baier asked Mulvaney what he thought of the idea that Ryan should step down and allow McCarthy, whom Ryan has endorsed to replace him , to become speaker this year. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has said repeatedly that he's not planning to leave before the end of his term in January. \\"I've talked with Kevin about this privately but not as much publicly,\\" Mulvaney told Baier over the weekend. \\"Wouldn't it be great to force a Democrat running in a tight race to have to put up or shut up about voting for Nancy Pelosi eight weeks before an election? That's a really, really good vote for us to force if we can figure out how to do it.\\" McCarthy said there was absolutely no effort or scheming between the two of them to get the California congressman into the speakership before the election. \\"Not on any planet,\\" McCarthy said on Capitol Hill. \\"Look, Mulvaney and I are longtime friends. We go to dinner when we're back here on the early nights. The only thing Mulvaney has ever talked about was will you go to run for speaker if we keep the majority. Nothing different than that whatsoever.\\" Read More |||||Summary:","completion":"White House budget director Mick Mulvaney has endorsed the idea of House speaker Paul Ryan stepping down to trigger an election forcing House Democrats to vote for unpopular Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. At a conference in Colorado, Mulvaney was asked about the potential for Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Ryan's likely successor, becoming speaker this year. Mulvaney responded by saying it would be beneficial to force Democratic candidates in tight races to decide on voting for Pelosi shortly before an election. However, Ryan has shown no interest in resigning before he retires from Congress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This observation reveals the importance of peer support in dealing with bullying. It's not just about letting an adult know, but also about creating an environment where peers stand up for each other. This understanding could help reshape anti-bullying initiatives and promote a more inclusive and supportive atmosphere in schools. The need for effective intervention is critical, as bullying can have long-term negative effects on victims, including lower self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts. If telling someone isn't enough, then perhaps schools should adopt a multi-faceted approach to combating bullying. This could involve educating students on the signs of bullying, raising awareness about the issue, and encouraging an atmosphere of support and empathy among students. Additionally, fostering effective communication between students, teachers, parents, and administrators can help create a supportive network focused on tackling bullying. Sharing experiences and discussing potential solutions can help develop more targeted approaches to dealing with the problem. Teachers and staff should also be trained in recognizing and handling bullying situations appropriately. It's essential for them to understand the seriousness of the issue and take the right steps in addressing the concerns of victims or witnesses. This can involve mediating and resolving conflicts, providing the necessary emotional support, and liaising with the appropriate resources within the school, such as counselors or support groups. Peer support programs like mentorship and buddy systems can also be an important element of a comprehensive anti-bullying initiative. By pairing students with older peers and providing guidance and support, schools can create a strong culture of students looking out for one another. Ultimately, the most logical way to complete the passage is to emphasize that the experiences and lessons learned at the International Bullying Prevention Association conference suggest that stopping bullying is a complex issue, requiring collaborative efforts from all stakeholders involved. We cannot rely solely on the \\"tell someone\\" approach; instead, we must focus on fostering a supportive environment where students feel empowered to stand up for themselves and their peers, creating a safe space for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the most salient words in this sentence: ferns and lichen growing on a tree in the rain forest","completion":"The most salient words in the sentence \\"ferns and lichen growing on a tree in the rain forest\\" are: 1. Ferns - Ferns are non-flowering vascular plants that have roots, stems, and fronds (leaves) and reproduce via spores. They hold importance in the sentence as they are one of the primary subjects being addressed. 2. Lichen - Lichen is an organism that arises from the symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae or cyanobacteria. It is significant in the sentence as, like ferns, it is the other main subject being described. 3. Growing - This word indicates the presence and development of the ferns and lichen on the tree. It highlights the thriving nature of these organisms in their particular environment. 4. Tree - A tree serves as the location or habitat in which the ferns and lichen grow. It is an essential part of the ecological structure in which ferns and lichen live and develop. 5. Rain forest - This term outlines the broader setting where the entire situation takes place. A rain forest is a dense, biodiverse, and generally warm ecosystem with abundant rainfall; it provides a context for understanding the presence, growth, and importance of ferns and lichen on a tree.

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan. All his more expensive rides were in the garage, collecting dust and gaining vintage resale value. I rang the bell. I waited and watched a couple of squirrels fight over a small treasure in the bushes.

John was studying about the history of Sahara desert. He was amazed to find that ten thousand years ago there were plenty of rainfall in that region. He labeled that era as era A. Then he found that rainfall deceased in the region about eight thousand years ago. He labeled that era as era B. He was wondering how that change in rainfall might have helped emerge the Egyptian civilization. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would era B see less or more rocks with chemical reactions than era A? The answer to this question is:","completion":"To answer the question correctly, I will first analyze the provided information and consider the possible factors that could influence the number of rocks with chemical reactions in each era. Step 1: Understanding the differences between Era A and Era B - Era A: 10,000 years ago, plenty of rainfall in the Sahara region - Era B: 8,000 years ago, less rainfall in the Sahara region Step 2: Identifying factors that could influence chemical reactions in rocks - Water presence: Water is a key factor in chemical reactions involving rocks because it can help dissolve minerals and facilitate reactions between them. In Era A, there was plenty of rainfall, meaning there was more water available for these reactions to occur. In Era B, the decrease in rainfall would result in less water available for these chemical reactions. Step 3: Considering the influence of the Egyptian civilization on era B - The emergence of the Egyptian civilization in relation with era B could lead to an increase in human activity, such as construction, mining, and agriculture, influencing the frequency of chemical reactions in rocks. However, this factor may not be as significant as the availability of water in the environment. Step 4: Concluding based on the most significant factor Since the availability of water is the most significant factor in determining the number of rocks with chemical reactions, era B would likely see fewer rocks with chemical reactions than era A, due to the decrease in rainfall in the region. The answer to this question is: Era B would see less rocks with chemical reactions than era A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby and Judy (Christopher Severn and Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) at university. They have live-in staff: Gladys the housemaid (Brenda Forbes) and Ada the cook (Marie De Becker).As World War II looms, Vin comes down from university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreements (mainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruism) they fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal.Several months later, as the war comes closer to home with the bombing of Great Brittan, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot.

I have a new situation: Robert was watching the local news when he saw a report about a wildfire. The report stated that there was a brush fire in the southwest part of Texas, where it was currently daytime. When he switched the channel, he saw another report about a different wildfire. This one was a forest fire in the northwest part of Seattle, where it was currently nighttime. But I can use this background: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. What is an answer for this question: Which wildfire, the one in Texas or the one in Seattle, will have higher intensity? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The wildfire in Texas will likely have a higher intensity than the one in Seattle, based on the information provided. There are several factors that contribute to this conclusion. Firstly, the Texas wildfire is occurring during daytime hours. As mentioned in the background information, wildfire intensity generally increases during the day due to lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. These conditions make it easier for the fire to spread and intensify. Sunlight warms the ground, which causes air currents to travel uphill and fan the flames. This typical daytime scenario in Texas would lead to a higher intensity wildfire compared to one occurring during nighttime hours, such as the one in Seattle. Secondly, the Texas fire is described as a brush fire, whereas the Seattle fire is a forest fire. While both types of fires can be destructive, brush fires tend to spread more quickly and intensely because of the lighter, more flammable fuel (dry grass and shrubs) they typically consume. The larger, denser materials found in a forest fire, such as trees, can take more time to burn and spread. This difference in fuel type would also contribute to the Texas fire being more intense than the one in Seattle. Additionally, the location of the fires may play a role in their intensities. While the exact environmental conditions at each site are not provided, we can make some general assumptions based on the regions involved. Southwest Texas has a semi-arid to arid climate, with lower humidity, higher temperatures, and more direct sunlight compared to that of the northwest part of Seattle which is known for its temperate marine climate, involving higher humidity, cooler temperatures, and more cloud cover. Under these climate conditions, a fire in Texas would likely have a higher intensity due to the more favorable conditions for the fire to spread and intensify. In conclusion, based on the information provided, the wildfire in southwest Texas is expected to have a higher intensity than the wildfire in northwest Seattle. Factors contributing to this conclusion include the time of day when the fires are occurring, the type of fires (brush fire versus forest fire), and the regional climate conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kentucky's Republican Senate candidate Rand Paul criticized President Barack Obama's handling of the Gulf oil spill Friday as putting \\"his boot heel on the throat of BP\\" and \\"really un-American.\\" Republican U.S. Senate candidate Rand Paul is shown during an interview at his campaign headquarters after winning his party's primary election in Bowling Green, Ky., Wednesday, May 19, 2010. (AP Photo/Ed... (Associated Press) Paul's defense of the oil company came during an interview in which he tried to explain his controversial take on civil rights law, an issue that has overtaken his campaign since his victory in Tuesday's GOP primary. \\"What I don't like from the president's administration is this sort of, 'I'll put my boot heel on the throat of BP,'\\" Rand said in an interview with ABC's \\"Good Morning America.\\" \\"I think that sounds really un-American in his criticism of business.\\" Paul appeared two days after a landslide primary victory over the Republican establishment's candidate, Trey Grayson. He had spent most of the time since his win laboring to explain remarks suggesting businesses be allowed to deny service to blacks without fear of federal interference. On Friday said he wouldn't seek to repeal civil rights legislation. On the oil spill, Paul, a libertarian and tea party darling, said he had heard nothing from BP indicating it wouldn't pay for the spill that threatens devastating environmental damage along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. \\"And I think it's part of this sort of blame-game society in the sense that it's always got to be somebody's fault instead of the fact that maybe sometimes accidents happen,\\" Paul said. The senate candidate referred to a Kentucky coal mine accident that killed two men, saying he had met with the families and he admired the coal miners' courage. \\"We had a mining accident that was very tragic. ... Then we come in and it's always someone's fault. Maybe sometimes accidents happen,\\" he said. The political novice came under blistering scrutiny little more than 24 hours a landslide Republican primary victory. He defeated a rival recruited by Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, and invited Obama, who never enjoyed popularity in the state, to campaign for Kentucky's Democratic candidates as a strategy toward a Republican win in November. Paul, 47 and an eye surgeon, is making his first run for public office, and his emergence as a favorite of tea party activists has been one of the most striking developments of the early months of the midterm election campaign. In an appearance on primary night, he credited their support with powering him to his victory, and the first opinion poll since then shows him with a commanding lead over his Democratic rival, Jack Conway. ||||| Rand Paul, the Tea Party's rising star from Kentucky who won the state's GOP Senate primary this week, says criticism of his views on the Civil Rights Act and other pieces of anti-discrimination legislation are \\"red herrings\\" and Democrats' attempt to \\"trash\\" his campaign. \\"When does my honeymoon period start? I had a big victory,\\" Paul told George Stephanopoulos on \\"Good Morning America\\" today. \\"I've just been trashed up and down and they have been saying things that are untrue. And when they say I'm for repealing the Civil Rights Act, it's absolutely false. It's never been my position and something that I basically just think is politics.\\" Play Paul's comments came amid a firestorm of criticism sparked earlier this week when he appeared to question the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which he said went too far in banning discrimination by private companies. In an interview Wednesday with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, Paul was asked whether he believed private businesses should have the right to refuse service to African-Americans. \\"Yes,\\" Paul said. \\"I'm not in favor of any discrimination of any form. … But I think what's important about this debate is not written into any specific 'gotcha' on this, but asking the question: what about freedom of speech? Should we limit speech from people we find abhorrent? Should we limit racists from speaking?\\" His comments drew a range of criticism, including a rebuke from the White House Thursday, with press secretary Robert Gibbs telling reporters, \\"a discussion about whether or not you support those I don't think has a real, shouldn't have a place in our political dialogue in 2010.\\" Republicans also seemed to distance themselves from Paul's views. Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele made it clear the GOP supports the Civil Rights Act, whatever its Senate nominee in Kentucky says. Paul has said he doesn't believe the government has the right to tell a private business who they have to serve but insists he has not -- and has never -- called for a repeal of the law. \\"If you want to bring up 40-year-old legislation, why don't you bring me on with Sen. [Robert] Byrd, and we'll talk about how he filibustered the Civil Rights Act,\\" he said of the 92-year-old West Virginia Democrat. \\"Make him, call him to task for something he actually did as opposed to calling me to task for something they insinuated that I might believe that's not true. \\"What is going on here is an attempt to vilify us for partisan reasons. Where do your talking points come from? The Democratic National Committee, they also come from Rachel Maddow and MSNBC.\\" Paul Slams Obama Administration for Treatment of BP Paul's political philosophy, which is shared by many members of the Tea Party movement, emphasizes a more limited role of the federal government in U.S. business and society. Earlier this year, for example, Paul told the Fox Business Channel that he believes government agencies should reduce their regulation of the energy industry. \\"Get the EPA out of our coal business down here, get OSHA out of our small businesses. We need to restrain government to let small businesses create jobs,\\" he said. Paul affirmed the comments on \\"Good Morning America,\\" saying that he finds the Environmental Protection Agency's recent regulatory initiative on greenhouse gas emissions, independent of Congress, \\"particularly galling.\\" \\"I think that's a regulatory commission run amok and I think we need to have congressional oversight,\\" he said. \\"I don't think regulatory agencies should write regulations without approval of the people through their representatives. And I stick to that and that's absolutely my point of view.\\" The Kentucky Senate candidate also criticized the Obama administration's treatment of BP in the wake of the ongoing Gulf of Mexico oil spill. \\"What I don't like from the president's administration is this sort of, 'I'll put my boot heel on the throat of BP.' I think that sounds really un-American in his criticism of business,\\" he said. \\"I've heard nothing from BP about not paying for the spill. And I think it's part of this sort of blame game society in the sense that it's always got to be someone's fault instead of the fact that sometimes accidents happen.\\" Paul's Civil Rights Comments Could Embolden Tea Party Critics The controversy over Paul's comments on federal civil rights legislation has revived suggestions by Tea Party critics that there are racists in the movement, an allegation Paul denies. The most recent ABC News polls show the perception of racial prejudice in the movement exists, particularly among the movement's opponents. Among all Americans, 28 percent see racial prejudice against President Obama as a substantial factor in support for the Tea Party movement. Paul clarified his views in a written statement Thursday, saying whatever concerns he may have had about parts of the Civil Rights Act, he has not -- and has never -- called for repealing it. \\"Even though this matter was settled when I was 2, and no serious people are seeking to revisit it except to score cheap political points, I unequivocally state that I will not support any efforts to repeal the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\\" Paul, 47, said. \\"Let me be clear: I support the Civil Rights Act because I overwhelmingly agree with the intent of the legislation, which was to stop discrimination in the public sphere and halt the abhorrent practice of segregation and Jim Crow laws,\\" he said. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Rand Paul, a political candidate from Kentucky, was critical of how President Obama handled a big oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

Q:- These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots and passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Chlorophyll absorbs the sun&#x27;s energy - It is this energy that is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen - Oxygen is released from the leaves into the atmosphere - Hydrogen and carbon dioxide are used to form glucose or food for plants. What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the process described above, which is a simplified explanation of the process of photosynthesis in plants, is the absorption of water by the plant roots. Photosynthesis is a vital process for plants to produce glucose through the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, which is ultimately used by the plant as a source of nourishment. A detailed understanding of this first step involves several sub-steps: 1. Water absorption: Plant roots are responsible for absorbing water and essential nutrients from the soil. The root system is formed by the main root (called the tap root) and numerous lateral (branching) roots, which spread out and penetrate the soil to access its resources. The root hairs, which are extensions of the root epidermis, are crucial in facilitating the absorption process by increasing the surface area for water and nutrient uptake. 2. Osmosis: Water moves into the roots through a passive transport process called osmosis, driven by a difference in concentration of water molecules in the soil and the plant root cells. The water potential (an indication of the free energy of water molecules) is generally lower in the root cells than in the soil, which causes water to move into the root tissues. Osmosis ensures that the plants obtain a steady supply of water for their survival and growth. 3. Transportation through the xylem: Once absorbed by the roots, the water travels through specialized vascular tissues called xylem, which are responsible for conducting water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the other parts of the plant. The xylem consists of elongated, dead cells called tracheids and vessel elements, which form a continuous network of interconnected tubes. The water in the xylem moves upwards through a combination of processes, such as capillary action, root pressure, and transpiration pull. In summary, the first step of the described process, which is integral to the overall process of photosynthesis, consists of the absorption of water by plant roots, followed by its transportation through the xylem vessels in the stem to reach the leaves, where the subsequent steps of photosynthesis occur. This step is essential for providing the raw materials and maintaining the hydration necessary for the energy conversion and synthesis of glucose in plants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Justification: Natural forces, such as wind and water, cause erosion, which breaks down rocks into smaller pieces. Step 2: The wind or water deposits tiny rocks. Justification: After breaking down the rocks, wind and water transport and deposit the tiny rocks in a new location. Step 3: The rocks become known as sediment. Justification: Once deposited, the tiny rocks are considered sediment, which forms in layers over time. Step 4: The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top. Justification: As more layers of sediment accumulate, the weight of the new layers presses down on the older layers beneath, compacting them together. Step 5: Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve. Justification: Over time, minerals within the sedimentary rocks dissolve due to water and other factors, aiding in the further compacting and binding of the particles.

Read this: As with most of Europe, prehistoric Britain and Ireland were covered with forest and swamp. Clearing began around 6000 BC and accelerated in medieval times. Despite this, Britain retained its primeval forests longer than most of Europe due to a small population and later development of trade and industry, and wood shortages were not a problem until the 17th century. By the 18th century, most of Britain's forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from Scandinavia, North America, and the Baltic. Most forest land in Ireland is maintained by state forestation programmes. Almost all land outside urban areas is farmland. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England. Oak, elm, ash and beech are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, pine and birch are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, wych elm, birch and pine. Beech and lime, though not native to Ireland, are also common there. Farmland hosts a variety of semi-natural vegetation of grasses and flowering plants. Woods, hedgerows, mountain slopes and marshes host heather, wild grasses, gorse and bracken.

Article:","completion":"Title: How to Install a Water Filter System Under Your Faucet: A Step-by-Step Guide Introduction Water filter systems offer a range of benefits, including ensuring that you and your family consume clean and healthy water. These systems work by removing contaminants and impurities from your tap water, improving its taste and smell. In addition, a water filter system can help you save money by reducing your reliance on bottled water. To get the best results from your water filter system, it is crucial to install it properly. This article will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to position the base system, mount the collar, insert the filter cartridge, and flush out the new cartridge. Step 1: Position the Base System Beneath the Faucet Start by choosing the area under your sink where you want to install the water filter system. Ensure there is enough space to accommodate the system and that you have easy access for maintenance and filter changes. Once you have found the perfect spot, position the base system in such a way that it is beneath the faucet. Positioning it directly below the faucet ensures that the water flows seamlessly through the system and into the outflow pipe. Step 2: Twist on the Mounting Collar The mounting collar is essential for securing the water filter system in place. Hold the mounting collar above the base system and twist it onto the designated area on the base. The twisting motion will lock it securely, adding stability to the filter system and preventing it from moving during water flow. Step 3: Insert the Filter Cartridge into the Filter Cup The filter cartridge is a key component within the water filter system, as it helps remove impurities and contaminants from the water. To install it, first, locate the filter cup and ensure it is clean and free of debris. Next, hold the filter cartridge by its ends and gently insert it into the filter cup following the manufacturer's guidelines/instructions. Make sure the cartridge is seated correctly in the filter cup. Step 4: Check the Cartridge Once you have inserted the filter cartridge into the filter cup, you must check its position. Double-check that the cartridge is inserted correctly and that it is not misaligned or damaged in any way. It is essential to ensure that the filter cartridge is functioning effectively to remove impurities from your tap water. Step 5: Flush Out the New Cartridge Before you start using the water filter system, you must flush out the new cartridge. This process helps remove any particles, dust, or residue that may be present in the cartridge from manufacturing and shipping. To flush out the new cartridge, turn on the faucet and allow water to flow through the system for a few minutes. During this time, do not consume the water, as it may still contain some unwanted particles. Once the initial flushing process is complete, your water filter system is ready for use. Conclusion Installing a water filter system under your faucet is a relatively simple process that can drastically improve your household's water quality. By following these steps to position the base system, install the mounting collar, insert the filter cartridge, and flush out the new cartridge, you will enjoy clean and healthy water in no time. Remember to maintain your water filter system and replace the filter cartridge according to the manufacturer's recommendations to ensure optimal performance and maximum benefits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On 23 February 1763, slaves on Plantation Magdalenenberg on the Canje River in Berbice rebelled, protesting harsh and inhumane treatment. They torched the plantation house, then went to other plantations to mobilize other enslaved Africans to join the rebellion. Cuffy, an enslaved man at Lilienburg, another plantation on Canje, is said to have organized them into a military unit. As plantation after plantation fell to the slaves, the Dutch settlers fled northward and the rebels began to take over control of the region. For almost a year, the rebels held on to southern Berbice, while the whites were able to hold on to the north. Eventually only about half of the white population that had lived in the colony remained. The rebels came to number about 3,000 and threatened European control over the Guianas. Other key figures among the rebels include Atta, Accara, and Accabre. The insurgents were eventually defeated in the spring of 1764 with the assistance of troops from neighbouring French and British colonies and from Europe. Answer this question: How many more whites than Amerindians were there?","completion":"There were 346 whites and 244 Amerindians in the colony of Berbice. To find out how many more whites there were than Amerindians, we can subtract the number of Amerindians from the number of whites. So, 346 whites - 244 Amerindians = 102.

Background: Curved Air are a pioneering English progressive rock group formed in 1970 by musicians from mixed artistic backgrounds, including classical, folk, and electronic sound. The resulting sound of the band was a mixture of progressive rock, folk rock, and fusion with classical elements. Along with High Tide and East of Eden, Curved Air were one of the first rock bands after It's a Beautiful Day and the United States of America to feature a violin. Curved Air released eight studio albums, the first three of which broke the UK Top 20, and had a hit single with \\"Back Street Luv\\" (1971) which reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. Context: Having retained a good working relationship, Sonja Kristina and Mike Wedgwood formed a new band with Kirby Gregory (electric guitar), Eddie Jobson (keyboards, violin), and Jim Russell (drums). Jobson had come from a band called Fat Grapple, who had been one of Curved Air's support acts on tour. This new band played a much more conventional brand of rock than the former Curved Air, with almost none of the classical influences of that group. However, on the suggestion of manager Clifford Davis, they continued using the name Curved Air so as to give them a commercial leg up. Kristina later commented: What I wanted to do with the band at the time was get more of a rock edge to it, and Kirby's guitar playing really excited me - he was just really wild. And Jim was the same way, a very solid rock drummer. Mike and I really wanted to continue, and it was our manager Clifford Davis who said we would do a better business continuing to call the band Curved Air. So we kept the name and followed along the same pattern as before, as a writer's band. Everybody in the new band contributed material except for Jim Russell, who really wasn't a writer. Before it had mainly been Darryl and Francis, but I had managed to get some of my compositions in. The use of the Curved Air name was not enough, however. Whereas all three of the original Curved Air's albums had broken the UK top 20, the new band's sole album, Air Cut, failed to even chart. Due to artistic differences with Jobson, Kirby Gregory and Jim Russell both left the group to form Stretch. Warner Brothers realized that the current Curved Air was in essence not the same band they had signed, and so the remaining trio recorded a demo tape for the label. The demos failed to convince Warner Brothers, and they discontinued the contract. (These demos were later issued as part of the Lovechild record.) With no contract and only half a lineup, in summer 1973 Curved Air broke up. Jobson replaced Eno in Roxy Music, while Wedgwood joined Caravan. Question: How did that demo do. Whats the answer?","completion":"The demo that Curved Air recorded for Warner Brothers didn't do well. The record company wasn't convinced by the demo and decided to discontinue the contract with the band. As a result, Curved Air broke up in summer 1973.

He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom.

Pernell Whitaker (born January 2, 1964) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1984 to 2001, and has since worked as a boxing trainer. He is a four-weight world champion, having won titles at lightweight, light welterweight, welterweight, and light middleweight; the undisputed lightweight title; and the lineal lightweight and welterweight titles. In 1989, Whitaker was named Fighter of the Year by The Ring magazine and the Boxing Writers Association of America. From 1993 to 1997, The Ring ranked him as the best active boxer in the world, pound for pound. On February 20, 1999, Whitaker suffered his first convincing defeat against the much bigger, much fresher Felix Trinidad, gamely taking the Puerto Rican the distance in an attempt to win Trinidad's IBF welterweight title. The fight began with both boxers displaying aggressive styles, which included excessive pushing. In the following rounds, both boxers used their jabs most of the time, with Trinidad gaining an advantage when Whitaker attempted to attack inside, eventually scoring a knockdown in round two. In the fourth, fifth and sixth rounds the fighters exchanged combinations. Later in the fight, both boxers fell to the canvas in what were ruled as \\"accidental slips.\\" On the seventh round, Whitaker displayed more offense, trading power punches with Trinidad, but the champion retained control in the fight's tempo during the eight, ninth and tenth rounds. In the last round, Whitaker, with a badly swollen right eye, displayed a purely defensive stance, avoiding his opponent throughout the round while Trinidad continued on the offensive until the fight concluded. The judges gave the champion scores of 117-111, 118-109 and 118-109. His last fight came on April 27, 2001, against journeyman Carlos Bojorquez. Whitaker, the former lightweight, entered the ring at 155 pounds. He broke his clavicle in round four and was forced to retire; at the time of the stoppage Whitaker was trailing in all the judges' scorecards by 28-29. Following this fight, Whitaker officially announced his retirement. He finished his professional career with an official record of 40-4-1 (17 knockouts). In 2002, The Ring ranked Whitaker as the 10th Greatest Fighter of the Last 80 Years. On December 7, 2006, Whitaker was inducted in the International Boxing Hall of Fame along with contemporaries Roberto Duran and Ricardo Lopez.

Translate to English","completion":"Both Sudan and South Sudan need to address massive humanitarian needs. In both countries, there are extensive humanitarian challenges that require significant attention and support from the international community. These challenges stem from a variety of factors, including the impact of civil wars, political instability, economic crises, and natural disasters like severe droughts and floods. First and foremost, the issue of displacement affects millions of people in Sudan and South Sudan. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are more than two million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Sudan and around 1.6 million IDPs in South Sudan, as of 2021. Large numbers of refugees have also fled to neighboring countries, such as Uganda, Ethiopia, and Kenya. Many of these individuals live in overcrowded camps, have limited access to basic services like healthcare and education, and face protection risks. Another major challenge is food insecurity. The civil wars and ongoing conflict, as well as widespread poverty in the region, have negatively affected agricultural production and hindered humanitarian access to many locations. In South Sudan, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network estimated in November 2021 that over seven million people are in need of humanitarian food assistance, representing more than half of the population. On the other hand, Sudan has faced a series of crises in recent years that have increased food prices, making it difficult for millions of Sudanese households to afford adequate nutrition. Ensuring access to water, sanitation, and hygiene is also crucial to the wellbeing of communities in both countries. Many IDP and refugee camps struggle to provide safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities, leading to the potential spread of waterborne diseases like cholera and diarrhea. In addition, the lack of proper sanitation infrastructure can also contribute to conflicts over limited resources and heighten protection risks. Healthcare is another area that demands attention in both Sudan and South Sudan. The healthcare systems in both countries have been severely affected by years of conflict. In South Sudan, only around 44% of the population has access to healthcare services, while in Sudan, the situation is slightly better with about 70% having access. But, the ongoing economic crisis in Sudan is taking a toll on the healthcare system. A shortage of medical supplies, insufficient funding, and damaged infrastructure all contribute to the problem. As a result, there is an increased risk of disease outbreaks and limited access to essential health services. Finally, education is another area where both countries face challenges. According to UNICEF, more than 2.2 million children in South Sudan are out of school, which is one of the highest rates of out-of-school children in the world. Similar challenges exist in Sudan, where around 3.6 million children are also out of school. Efforts to provide education for children are hampered by a variety of factors, such as inadequate infrastructure, a lack of teachers and learning materials, and ongoing conflict and insecurity. Given these pressing humanitarian needs in both Sudan and South Sudan, it is vital that the international community not only provides financial and material support but also seeks lasting political solutions to the underlying issues that contribute to these crises. A focus on peacebuilding, fostering resilience, and addressing the root causes of conflict and displacement will be essential in enabling both countries to overcome these immense challenges and secure a better future for their people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sun had already set, casting an orange and pink glow across the sky, as both Jason and William took their seats at the old wooden table in the back garden. The meal that lay before them was a sight to behold - plates full of roasted chicken, creamy mashed potatoes, and steamed vegetables, accompanied by a hearty loaf of bread. While Jason tore into his food, ravenous after a long day of work, beads of sweat formed on his forehead. He couldn't think of the last time he had eaten so hungrily, but it was clear his body needed the nourishment. In between large forkfuls, he kept glancing at William, concerned for his friend. William, however, did not touch his food. He simply sat there, staring at the feast before him with a vacant expression. His stomach grumbled, betraying the hunger he felt - but he couldn't bring himself to eat. It was clear that something weighed heavily on his mind, but he refused to share it with Jason. Jason, in between mouthfuls of food, tried to engage his friend in conversation. \\"Will, is everything all right? You've barely touched your meal and you've just been staring off into space.\\" Preoccupied with his thoughts, William barely registered Jason's words. With a deep sigh, he shook his head, as if to clear away the fog that had settled in his mind. \\"I'm sorry, Jason.

ROLAND NARROWED HIS EYES AND STARED UPWARD INTO THE DARKNESS, across the top of Mont Segur toward the Cathar fortress. Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered. Roland caught a glimpse of the sergeant's horrified face and heard his scream as the boulder struck him, crushing him to the ground. Question: What is probably the sergeant's status at the end of the story? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"The sergeant is most likely dead by the end of the story. The narrative describes a situation in which a huge boulder, launched by a stone-caster from the enemy's Cathar fortress, hits the parapet where Roland and his comrades are positioned. The stone, described as being as big as a wine barrel, strikes the sergeant, crushing him to the ground. Given the size and force of the thrown boulder, this would almost certainly result in fatal injuries. Therefore, it can be inferred that the sergeant is probably killed by this assault. The sudden and violent nature of this event underlines the serious dangers faced by these crusaders in their siege against the Cathar stronghold, and gives the reader a very stark reminder of the hazards of medieval warfare. The sergeant's death emphasizes the urgency of the situation and reinforces the tension that Roland feels knowing that his beloved Diane is in the besieged fortress, under threat not only from the ongoing siege but also from the potential massacre that would follow if the stronghold fell to the crusaders. This tragic event showcases the harsh realities of war, where laughter and camaraderie can instantly be replaced by loss and grief."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - garage - movies - in europe - paris - bus Explain why a human would choose \\"in europe\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"\\"In Europe\\" is an option that a human might choose to answer the question of what kind of tour someone is likely to see the Eiffel Tower on. However, the most accurate and specific answer would be \\"Paris,\\" as the Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France. Here's why a human might choose the \\"in Europe\\" option instead: 1. General knowledge: Someone may choose \\"in Europe\\" if they're aware that the Eiffel Tower is in Europe but unsure of the specific city or country it's located in. They may recognize that the other options (garage, movies, bus) aren't relevant and choose \\"in Europe\\" because it's the general area where the landmark exists. 2. Contextual association: The Eiffel Tower is one of Europe's most iconic landmarks, and some people might associate it with Europe as a whole rather than specifically with Paris. If someone isn't confident in their geography but knows that the Eiffel Tower is a famous European attraction, they may choose \\"in Europe\\" as the answer. 3. Misunderstanding the question: If a user isn't clear on the question's intent, they might think that \\"in Europe\\" refers to a wide-ranging tour of Europe that happens to include the Eiffel Tower. In this sense, \\"in Europe\\" would still be a correct answer, though \\"Paris\\" would be more appropriate. 4. Lack of knowledge on other options: For some people, the Eiffel Tower might not be well-known enough to pinpoint it to a specific location. In this case, they might choose \\"in Europe\\" because it seems like the most general answer compared to the other options, which are unrelated or too specific. 5. Regional identification: Sometimes, people may identify certain landmarks as representative of a specific region rather than a particular city. This could be because these iconic structures possess a cultural or historical significance that spans beyond their immediate location. In conclusion, while \\"in Europe\\" might be an option that some people choose to answer the question of what kind of tour someone is likely to see the Eiffel Tower on, the most accurate and specific answer would be \\"Paris\\" because that's where the landmark is located."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who warned that other composers were interested in adapting La Tosca? is inside the article: The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti. Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini. One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand..., can you guess it ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Sardou In the text, it says \\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer.\\" Victorien Sardou is the person who warned that other composers were interested in adapting La Tosca."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: Around the beginning of the 20th century, William James (1842–1910) coined the term \\"radical empiricism\\" to describe an offshoot of his form of pragmatism, which he argued could be dealt with separately from his pragmatism – though in fact the two concepts are intertwined in James's published lectures.

Answer the following question: Article: As skies are filled with millions of migrating birds, European scientists say the seasonal wonder appears to be strange: The fatter the bird, tile better it flies. The results of their study led to a theory opposite to a central one of aerodynamics , which says that the power needed to fly increases with weight. For birds, obviously, the cost of flying with heavy fat is much smaller than we used to think. Researchers found that red knot wading birds double their normal body weight of 100 grams before making their twice-a-year nonstop flight between the British Isles and the Russian Arctic. Distance: 5,000 kilometers. Another study in the magazine Nature measured the advantage of flying in an aerodynamic group which allows birds to save energy by flying smoothly and quietly in the lead bird' s air stream. Flying in groups, their heart rates were 14.5 percent lower than flying alone, according to Henri, a French scientist. The findings help explain how birds complete difficult migrations. Researchers had thought that thinner, stronger birds would have the best chance to survive. The first study suggests that building up fat to be burnt as fuel during the migration is worth more than the energy it takes to carry the additional weight. In the study, researchers said their team studied the birds flown at different body weights during 28 simulated flights. They forced a small amount of special water into the birds' bodies so that they could measure the amount of energy burnt during the flight. Question: A _ red knot wading bird has a better chance to survive during its migrating flight. Yes or no, is the answer \\"fatter\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"fatter.\\" The study conducted by European scientists found that red knot wading birds have a better chance of survival during their migration flights when they double their normal body weight before embarking on their journey. This finding contradicts the central theory of aerodynamics, which states that the power required to fly increases with weight. The researchers discovered that for birds, the cost of flying with heavy fat is much lower than previously believed. This suggests that accumulating fat as fuel for migration is more advantageous than the energy required to carry the additional weight. Red knot wading birds, doubling their normal body weight of 100 grams, embark on their twice-a-year nonstop flight that covers 5,000 kilometers between the British Isles and the Russian Arctic.

The heart rates of birds flying in groups were found to be 14.5 percent lower than those flying solo, according to Henri, a French scientist. These findings help explain how birds complete their challenging migrations. Prior to this discovery, researchers believed that thinner, stronger birds had the best chance of survival. In conclusion, the studies show that a fatter red knot wading bird has a better chance of survival during its migration flight due to the additional fat reserves providing energy and the lower cost of flying with extra weight than initially thought."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: April 2-May 2 is the worst 30 day period for me. The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go. I started really living again instead of just existing. But when April 2 came this year, I found that I was back in my memories. It was easier to deal with this time because of the way I had changed over the last year.

The stream then thought, \\"I've been through countless obstacles. I should have no problem crossing this desert!\\" But when she decided to start her journey, she found herself gradually disappearing into the mud and sand. After numerous tries, she found it was all in vain and was very upset. \\"Maybe it's my destiny ! I'm not destined to reach the vast ocean in the legend, \\" she murmured sadly to herself. At this time, a deep voice came, saying, \\"If a breeze can cross the desert, so can a river.\\" It was the voice of the desert. Unconvinced, the little stream replied, \\"That's because a breeze can fly, but I can't.\\" \\"That's because you stick to what you are. If you're willing to give it up, and let yourself evaporate into the breeze, it can take you across, and you can reach your destination,\\" said the desert in its deep voice.

In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people.

It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (; 27 October 1919 27 July 1980), known as Mohammad Reza Shah, was the Shah of Iran from 16 September 1941 until his overthrow by the Iranian Revolution on 11 February 1979.

Alberta's mother Mary, a strong-willed and compassionate woman, started researching everything she could about anemia, determined to find a way to improve her daughter's health. Her father, John, took Alberta to countless medical appointments, seeking the best treatment possible. Alberta's younger brother James also wanted to help. Despite his young age, he felt responsible for his sister because he had always been her protector. James started tagging along with Alberta and their father to every medical appointment, constantly asking questions and listening keenly to what the doctors had to say. During this entire journey, Alberta's family made it a point to remain positive and focused on promoting Alberta's emotional well-being. They believed that if Alberta had a strong, positive mindset, it would only give her the best chance to combat the weakening anemia. Together, they tackled Alberta's anemia head-on, and their powerful, unified support gradually helped her regain her health. With time, Alberta started feeling better and was able to return to her normal life. She knew, though, that this would not have been possible without the unwavering love and strength provided by her family. Through this trial, the bonds between Alberta and her family only grew stronger than ever. They learned that it was not just the limitations of their bodies, such as Alberta's anemia, that defined their strength. The strength of their love and unity as a family truly outshined any physical weaknesses they faced. In the end, it was the anemia that was weak, as it stood no chance against a family so full of love and determination.

Article: If you want the benefits of medical marijuana without the \\"unwanted side effects\\" of cannabis, new research should leave you on a high note. According to a research report appearing in the April 2015 issue of The FASEB Journal, fenofibrate, also known by the brand name Tricor®, may benefit a wide range of health issues, such as pain, appetite stimulation, nausea, as well as immune and various psychiatric and neurological conditions. This suggests that fenofibrate may be the starting point for a new class of cannabis-like drugs to treat these types of conditions. \\"By illustrating the relationship between fenofibrate and the cannabinoid system, we aim to improve our understanding of this clinically important drug,\\" said Richard S. Priestley, Ph.D., a researcher involved in the work from the School of Life Sciences at the University of Nottingham Medical School in Nottingham, United Kingdom. \\"Our study provides the basis for the investigation of new drugs targeting these important receptors.\\" To make this discovery Priestly and colleagues cultured cells containing cannabinoid receptors and exposed them to a tracer compound, which binds to cannabinoid receptors. They found that fenofibrate was able to displace the tracer, suggesting that it also binds to the receptors. Furthermore, they discovered that fenofibrate actually switched the cannabinoid receptors \\"on,\\" not only in these cells, but also in sections of intestine. This led to the relaxation of the tissue in a way that mimicked what marijuana does. Despite the fact that fenofibrate has been used for many years, and its mechanism of action was presumed to be through a completely different family of receptors, this suggests that at least some of the effects of fenofibrate may be controlled by cannabinoid receptors. Furthermore, these cannabinoid receptors may be a future target for drugs used to treat pain and a variety of immune and psychiatric diseases. \\"It may be difficult to persuade people in Colorado, Washington, and the District of Columbia that there are people who want the beneficial effects of marijuana without actually getting high,\\" said Gerald Weissmann, M.D., Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal, \\"but there are people who do not want to get stoned just to get the relief that marijuana brings.

The Jacobite army invaded England in early November, reaching Derby on 4 December, where they were forced to retreat by a lack of expected English support, by superior numbers of government forces, and by differences in opinion amongst the Jacobite command. Despite victory at Falkirk Muir in January 1746, the Battle of Culloden in April ended the Rebellion and significant backing for the Stuart cause. Charles escaped to France but was unable to win support for another attempt and died in Rome in 1788. Answer this question: How many months did it take for the Jacobite army to reach Derby?","completion":"The Jacobite rising of 1745 began on 19 August 1745 when Charles Edward Stuart launched the rebellion at Glenfinnan in the Scottish Highlands. The Jacobite army reached Derby on 4 December 1745. To calculate the number of months it took for the Jacobite army to reach Derby, we can count the months between August and December: 1. September (from August 19th to September 18th) 2. October (from September 19th to October 18th) 3. November (from October 19th to November 18th) 4.

A team of researchers at Ohio State University, US, has found sad movies can make people happier, Science Daily reported last month. Many people find tragedies make them realize how good their own lives are, the study showed. \\"People seem to use tragedies as a way to reflect on the important relationships in their own lives,\\" said Silvia Knobloch-Westerwick, leader of the study. \\"Tragic stories often focus on themes of eternal love, and this leads viewers to think about their loved ones and count their good and helpful things.\\" In the study, researchers gathered 361 college students and showed them the 2007 movie, Alonement. The movie is about two lovers who are separated and finally die during Worid War II. Before and after the movie, the students were asked questions measuring how happy they were with their lives. Researchers also asked them before, afier and three times during the movie to measure various emotions, including sadness. Researchers found that the sadder students felt while watching the movie, the more likely they were to think about real people they had close relationships with in life. This increased their happiness afier watching the movie. Knobloch-Westerwick explained that negative moods make people more thoughtful. \\"Positive emotions show that everything is fine, you don't have to worry, you don't have to think about problems in your life,\\" she said. \\"But negative emotions, like sadness, make you think more critically about your situation.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"If the air is not converted to oxygen in the lungs, it is directly impacting a step of the process in the respiratory system. The primary purpose of the lungs is to facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which is necessary for the human body to function properly. This exchange occurs in the alveoli, tiny air sacs within the lungs, where oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is released from the blood into the air sacs to be exhaled. Several factors or conditions can result in the disruption of the oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the lungs, such as: 1. Respiratory diseases: Conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or pneumonia can impair lung function, thus affecting the ability of the lungs to efficiently deliver oxygen to the bloodstream or remove carbon dioxide. 2. Impaired alveolar function: Conditions like emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis can damage the alveoli and hinder gas exchange. 3. Hypoxia: Inadequate oxygen supply to the body can be a result of high altitudes, smoke inhalation, or various medical conditions that impede the lungs' function. 4. Airway obstruction: Mucus, foreign objects, or swelling can block the airways, disrupting the flow of air and potentially leading to inadequate oxygenation of the blood. When the lungs' ability to convert air to oxygen is directly impacted, it can have severe consequences on the body's overall function, as oxygen is critical for cells to generate energy, maintain body temperature, and perform numerous other essential biological processes. A lack of oxygen may lead to shortness of breath, fatigue, confusion, and in severe cases, organ failure and death. Immediate medical intervention may be necessary to address any conditions that are directly impacting the lungs' ability to convert air to oxygen and ensure proper respiratory function is maintained."},{"prompt":"Question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Good Ever good filemanager ever seen\\" Answer:","completion":"2"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Some of the energy of the car was lost to friction. (b). Some of the energy of the car was destroyed. (c). The amount of kinetic energy increased. (d). The amount of useful energy increased.","completion":"To find the best explanation for why the car stops, let's analyze each option. (a). Some of the energy of the car was lost to friction. - When the car runs out of fuel, the engine is no longer providing the force to keep the car in motion. Even though it's on a level road, friction between the tires and the road surface, as well as air resistance, work against the car's motion. This causes the car's kinetic energy to be converted into heat, eventually bringing the car to a stop. (b). Some of the energy of the car was destroyed. - According to the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be destroyed, only converted from one form to another. Thus, this option is incorrect.

Step 2: Compare it to the list of categories given I will now assess the relevance of the title to each category: - Company: Unlikely, as it doesn't include typical company indicators such as \\"Inc.\\" or \\"Corp.\\" - Educational Institution: Unlikely, as it doesn't resemble a school or university name. - Artist: Possible, as it could be the name of an artist. - Athlete: Possible, as it could be the name of an athlete. - Office Holder: Possible, as it could be the name of a person holding a political or administrative position. - Mean of Transportation: Unlikely, as it doesn't resemble a vehicle or transportation model name. - Building: Unlikely, as it doesn't resemble a building name. - Natural Place: Unlikely, as it doesn't resemble a natural location name. - Village: Unlikely, as it doesn't resemble a village or city name. - Animal: Unlikely, as it doesn't resemble an animal name. - Plant: Unlikely, as it doesn't resemble a plant name. - Album: Unlikely, as it doesn't have typical album title characteristics like a theme or wordplay. - Film: Unlikely, as it doesn't have typical film title characteristics. - Written Work: Unlikely, as it doesn't have typical written work title characteristics. Step 3: Narrow down potential categories based on relevance The possible categories include: Artist, Athlete, and Office Holder. Step 4: Choose the most suitable category Since \\"Norman G.

Russian news reports say Verzilov a member of Russian punk protest group... (Associated Press) MOSCOW (AP) — A member of Russia's Pussy Riot protest group says a severely ill fellow activist was being taken to Germany on Saturday for treatment after his suspected poisoning. Maria Alekhina told The Associated Press that Pyotr Verzilov was being flown to Berlin, but she did not give details. Independent news site Meduza reported that Verzilov's partner, Veronika Nikulshina, said a doctor from a Berlin clinic who is friends with the ill man's father suggested medical care outside Russia. Verzilov was hospitalized in Moscow on Tuesday and had remained in intensive care, Pussy Riot members said this week. Alekhina told the AP he regained consciousness Friday. She also said she thinks he was poisoned for political reasons. Verzilov, Nikulshina and two other Pussy Riot members served 15-day jail sentences for running onto the Moscow field where soccer's World Cup final was being played in July. Their protest of what they described as the excessive powers of Russia's police briefly disrupted the match with a very large broadcast audience. Verzilov's fell ill as new allegations arose over the March nerve-agent poisoning of a Russian former double agent and his daughter in the British city of Salisbury. British authorities last week named two men — alleged to be agents of Russia's military intelligence service — in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. The authorities showed surveillance-camera images of the pair in Salisbury. The two men told Kremlin-funded satellite TV channel RT on Thursday they were in Salisbury only as tourists, to see the city's noted cathedral, and denied working for military intelligence. Several Kremlin opponents have died from poisoning or suspected poisoning during the past 15 years. Alexander Litvinenko, a former member of Russia's domestic security service, succumbed slowly in London after ingesting a radioactive isotope in 2006. He fell ill hours after meeting with two Russians whom Britain claimed were the assassins. Journalist Anna Politkovskaya, a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, became sick after drinking tea on an Aeroflot flight in 2004. She was travelling to southern Russia to try to help negotiate the Beslan crisis in which Chechen militants took hundreds of schoolchildren hostage. Poison was mentioned as a possible cause of her symptoms. Politkovskaya survived, and was shot to death in the elevator of her apartment building two years later. Vladimir Kara-Murza, a prominent opposition figure, nearly died of kidney failure after a suspected poisoning in 2015 and fell severely ill again in 2017. ___ Jim Heintz in Moscow contributed to this story. ||||| Alexander Zemlianichenko / AP / Scanpix / LETA Doctors at Moscow Sklifosovsky Institute treating Pyotr Verzilov have ruled out the risk of a brain hemorrhage, Verzilov’s partner, fellow Pussy Riot member Veronika Nikulshina, told Meduza. He was hospitalized on September 11 in critical condition after the sudden loss of his vision, speech, and mobility. Earlier on September 13, the news agency Interfax reported that Verzilov was “in fact, in a pre-stroke condition,” saying his blood work revealed “no drugs other than the ones the doctors gave him.” Nikulshina calls these claims “absurd nonsense,” saying that doctors at the Sklifosovsky Institute specifically evaluated Verzilov’s stroke risk and ruled it out “conclusively.” Elena Verzilova, Pyotr’s mother, told Meduza that her son’s ultrasound and CT scan “showed no vascular changes whatsoever.” “This is absolutely poisoning. Poisoning by . It’s something like the atropine Cyclopentolate — what’s found in medicines. But the issue here is the large dosage,” Nikulshina told Meduza. According to Elena Verzilova, “these aren’t the kind of drugs that are easy to remove [from his system].” Verzilov is currently unconscious in intensive care. According to friends, he’s in “medicated sleep,” because he “starts to become overactive when awake,” raising his blood pressure. Doctors apparently haven’t ruled out putting Verzilov on a ventilator. His friends say new information won’t be available until the morning of September 14, when his latest test results are in. A member of Pussy Riot and the publisher of the investigative news website Mediazona, which conducts often daring reporting on Russia's criminal justice system, Verzilov has been a prominent figure in Russia’s anti-Kremlin opposition movement since the late 2000s, when he performed in the controversial “Voina” artist-activist group alongside his then wife, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova. On September 11, paramedics brought Verzilov to Moscow’s Bakhrushin City Clinical Hospital, where he was treated at the toxicology wing before being transferred to the Moscow Sklifosovsky Institute on September 13.

Review: 'Jersey Boys' generally falls flat updated 11:07 AM EDT, Fri June 20, 2014 Vincent Piazza, Erich Bergen, John Lloyd Young and Michael Lomenda play the Four Seasons in \\"Jersey Boys,\\" directed by Clint Eastwood. (EW.com) -- Nine years ago, Frankie Valli was rescued from oldies-station oblivion with the smash Broadway musical \\"Jersey Boys.\\" The show chronicles the real-life rise-and-fall-and-rise-again of four crooners from the mobbed-up mean streets of 1960s New Jersey who called themselves the Four Seasons and cranked out a seemingly endless string of hit records, including the love ditty ''Sherry,'' the triumphant ''Walk Like a Man,'' and the bouncy bubblegum bop of ''Big Girls Don't Cry.'' The songs are timeless. But so are a lot of songs from that Motown and Phil Spector era. What made the Four Seasons magical was Valli's voice -- an impossibly high-pitched nasal falsetto that sounded like a prepubescent angel who'd huffed a tank of helium. With \\"Jersey Boys' \\" receipts still pouring in on the Great White Way, the notion of adapting the musical into a splashy song-and-dance Hollywood biopic must have been too juicy to resist. In fact, the only thing that might seem surprising about the \\"Jersey Boys\\" movie is the man squinting behind the camera, Clint Eastwood. But the pairing actually makes more sense than you'd think. Anyone who saw Eastwood's 1988 Charlie Parker film, \\"Bird,\\" knows that the guy's always been a not-so-closeted hepcat with a discerning set of ears. The biggest problem is that the film, written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, never makes a convincing case for why Valli the man or the singer matters beyond the music in the way that \\"Ray\\" and \\"Walk the Line\\" did for Ray Charles and Johnny Cash. Such are the perils of adapting a somewhat one-dimensional stage show. Fortunately, Eastwood is far wiser on the casting front. As Valli, John Lloyd Young is pretty close to perfection. That's no shocker, really, as he won a Tony in 2006 for his portrayal of Valli on the boards. With his slicked-back pompadour and wardrobe of sharkskin suits, Young looks more like the late Bruno Kirby than Valli. But when he opens his mouth, you believe you're listening to the real deal. He finds every ounce of sweat, aftershave, and salad dressing that made up Valli's one-of-a-kind voice. As his fellow Four Seasons, Michael Lomenda, Erich Bergen and Vincent Piazza are equally spot-on, even if all of their bada-bing lingo occasionally makes them sound like they're competing in a Chazz Palminteri impersonation contest. (Both Lomenda and Bergen starred in the stage version as well.) Eastwood has never been the kind of filmmaker to grab you by the lapels or hot-dog with flashy storytelling tricks. You can walk in halfway through just about any of his movies and know exactly where you are. His laid-back traditionalism has always been part of his appeal, though. And in chronicling the careers of Valli & Co., he charts a predictably linear through-line: the band's hardscrabble Italian-American roots, which lead them to a sentimental wiseguy (Christopher Walken) who takes them under his wing; their first flirtation with fame; the downward slide of excess, money trouble, and infighting; and a redemptive third act in which they let bygones be bygones when they're inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. The movie's decades-spanning scope requires the 34-year-old Young to play Valli from age 16 to 60. As good as he is, he isn't done any favors by Eastwood's makeup team. You'd think that after all the grousing over Leonardo DiCaprio's distracting mugful of old-age putty in \\"J. Edgar,\\" the director would have paid more attention to the unconvincing wrinkles and jowls in the final stretch of \\"Jersey Boys.\\" But alas. Still, as flat and pitchy as the film sometimes feels, what saves it are those nostalgic, soaring doo-wop numbers (especially ''Sherry'') and Eastwood's measured doses of directorial playfulness, such as when the actors cheekily break the fourth wall and talk directly to the audience, as they did on Broadway. This trick doesn't always work, but when it does, and Valli or one of his bandmates turns to the camera, winks, and dishes about how the reality of events clashes with what we're actually witnessing on screen, it gooses the film with a giddy jolt of jukebox electricity.

Options: - possessing - plethora - enough - satisfaction - availability Explain why a human would choose \\"enough\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human would choose \\"enough\\" to answer the question above because it is the most appropriate and contextually accurate option among the given choices. The question focuses on the insufficiency of supplies, which led to the inability to finish the job despite the effort put in by the individuals involved. The word \\"enough\\" directly addresses this aspect of quantity and sufficiency in relation to the supplies needed to complete the task. Let's analyze each of the other options to understand why \\"enough\\" is the best choice: 1. Possessing: This option doesn't fit well into the context of the question. The word \\"possessing\\" refers to having or owning something, but it doesn't imply the insufficiency of the supplies in relation to the completion of the job. Conversely, it could be interpreted as if they had the supplies, but the question indicates they didn't have the necessary supplies to finish the job. 2. Plethora: This option also doesn't fit the context of the question. \\"Plethora\\" denotes an abundance, excess, or large quantity of something. Using this word would imply that the individuals had more than enough supplies, which contradicts the main idea expressed in the question, i.e., the lack of supplies was the reason why the job wasn't completed. 3. Satisfaction: The term \\"satisfaction\\" refers to a feeling of contentment or happiness when a desire or expectation has been fulfilled. It doesn't directly address the aspect of supply sufficiency and could be considered irrelevant in the given context. 4. Availability: Though this option might seem relevant initially, it doesn't precisely imply the insufficiency of supplies. \\"Availability\\" implies whether the supplies can be accessed or obtained rather than referring to the required quantity for the completion of the job. It is possible that the supplies were available, but the individuals did not have enough of them. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"enough\\" as the answer to this question because it accurately reflects the insufficiency of supplies, which is the primary focus of the question, and fits the context perfectly. The other options either do not address the pertinent aspect of supply quantity or do not align with the given situation and its requirements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Its first line-up consisted of singer and rhythm guitarist Kai Hansen, bass guitarist Markus Grosskopf, lead guitarist Michael Weikath, and drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg. After the release of a self-titled EP and their debut album Walls of Jericho in 1985, it expanded into a quintet with the addition of singer Michael Kiske, Hansen choosing to focus on guitar instead. Under this line-up, they released the Keeper of the Seven Keys albums (1987 and 1988), which established Helloween as a notable heavy metal band and led to the creation of the power metal subgenre. The year 2000 saw the release of The Dark Ride, a more experimental and darker album than their previous releases. It came complete with downtuned guitars and a gruffer singing style from Deris. Immediately following the tour, Helloween parted ways with guitarist Roland Grapow and drummer Uli Kusch. One version of events states that Weikath, Deris, and Grosskopf felt that Kusch and Grapow, in particular, were spending more time on and paying more attention to their new side-project, Masterplan (Grapow's output on Helloween albums had dropped to barely one song per album by that point); since the others believed that Kusch and Grapow were not one hundred percent dedicated to Helloween, they were dismissed. They were replaced by guitarist Sascha Gerstner (ex-Freedom Call, Neumond) and drummer Mark Cross (ex-Metalium, Kingdom Come, At Vance, Firewind), culminating with the recording of another studio album, titled Rabbit Don't Come Easy, in 2003. The band met Sascha via a recommendation by producer Charlie Bauerfeind. According to Grosskopf, one day he was recording something with Freedom Call \\"and later on we called him up and he went to first meet Weiki because it was very important that Weiki finds a player that he can play with and also communicate and understand. [...] So we got him on the island where we recorded and let him hang out with us a little and then he decided 'Good, let's go'.\\" Later in 2012, on an interview with Metal Shock Finland's Chief Editor, Mohsen Fayyazi, Roland stated: Cross could not finish the album due to mononucleosis, completing only two tracks; the drum tracks were completed by Motorhead's Mikkey Dee. Stefan Schwarzmann, former drummer of Running Wild and Accept would shortly thereafter take over the drumming duties. Despite a somewhat tepid response to the album, Helloween nonetheless completed a successful world tour, highlighted by the return of classic songs such as \\"Starlight\\", \\"Murderer\\", \\"Keeper of the Seven Keys\\" and \\"How Many Tears\\" to the setlist. Additionally, the band toured the United States for the first time since 1989, playing to sold-out crowds at nearly every venue.

Your task is to summarize them. Picking up on the ancestral tradition, South Carolinians have spent much of the last two years asserting various forms of independence from the federal government and attempting to block different federal laws. Now a state senator from the Palmetto State has decided it’s time for South Carolina to create its own currency. State Sen. Lee Bright (R-Roebuck) says that federal spending and increased monetary intervention by the Fed have placed the entire US Federal Reserve system on a path to monetary collapse. And when the crash comes, state residents will need to rely on the stable South Carolina currency to weather the storm. “If folks lose faith in the dollar, we need to have some kind of backup,” Bright told Stephen Largen of the Spartanburg Herald-Journal on Friday. Bright’s proposed legislation states that “many widely recognized experts predict the inevitable destruction of the Federal Reserve System’s currency through hyperinflation in the foreseeable future; and … South Carolina can avoid or at least mitigate many of the economic, social, and political shocks to be expected to arise from hyperinflation, depression, or other economic calamity related to the breakdown of the Federal Reserve System only through the timely adoption of an alternative sound currency that the state’s government and citizens may employ without delay in the event of the destruction of the Federal Reserve System’s currency. The legislation calls for the creation of a joint legislative subcommittee which would study the “the need, means, and schedule for establishing such an alternative currency.” Others in the state are less than impressed with the idea. “It’s a waste of time; it’s a waste of resources,” says Phil Bailey, direct of the state Senate Democratic Caucus. “I mean who’s paying for this study? Will they be paid in actual dollars or gold doubloons?” (ed.note: Special thanks to TPM Reader TK for sending along word of this developent.) ||||| Continuing a pattern of attempts to assert South Carolina's independence from the federal government, State Sen. Lee Bright, R-Roebuck, has introduced legislation that backs the creation of a new state currency that could protect the financial stability of the Palmetto State in the event of a breakdown of the Federal Reserve System. Bright's joint resolution calls for the creation of an eight-member joint subcommittee to study the proposal and submit a report to the General Assembly by Nov. 1. The Federal Reserve System has come under ever-increasing strain during the last several years and will be exposed to ever-increasing and predictably debilitating strain in the years to come, according to the legislation. “If there is an attempt to monetize the Fed we ought to at least have a study on record that could protect South Carolinians,” Bright said in an interview Friday. “If folks lose faith in the dollar, we need to have some kind of backup.” The legislation cites the rights reserved to states in the Constitution and Supreme Court rulings in making the case that South Carolina is within its rights to create its own currency. “The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the states may adopt whatever currency they desire for the purposes of performing their sovereign governmental functions, even to the extent of adopting gold and silver coin for those purposes while refusing to employ a currency not redeemable in gold or silver coin that Congress has designated ‘legal tender.'...” Bright's legislation states. The legislation claims “many widely recognized experts predict the inevitable destruction of the Federal Reserve System's currency through hyperinflation in the foreseeable future.” Per the legislation, South Carolina's new currency could consist of “gold or silver, or both.” Bright said in explaining his introduction of the legislation that Virginia and Georgia are considering similar measures to protect their states against economic calamity in the event of the collapse of the Federal Reserve System. Phil Bailey, the director of the state Senate Democratic Caucus, described the currency bill as a distraction from the real issues facing the state. “Not any thing in that bill is going to create a job or improve education,” Bailey said Friday. “It's a waste of time; it's a waste of resources. I mean who's paying for this study? Will they be paid in actual dollars or gold doubloons?” Bright responded by saying that his proposal is “something we ought to study” and “if there's no support for the bill in the body, it won't go anywhere.” Bright's bill has been referred to the Senate Finance Committee, but he said he's working with Sen. David Thomas, R-Greenville, on the legislation, and Thomas could redraft it so that it's referred to the Banking and Insurance Committee, of which Thomas is the chair. Bright also has introduced legislation in the ongoing legislative session that would make a firearm, firearm accessory or ammunition that is commercially or privately manufactured in South Carolina and does not leave this state exempt from federal regulation, including registration. During the 2010 session, Bright sponsored legislation passed by the state Senate that in addition to affirming South Carolina's Second-, Ninth- and 10th-amendment rights, also targeted federal health care legislation by saying state residents are not subject to any law that interferes with patients' rights to choose their own health care provider or pay for medical services directly. “If at first you don't secede, try again,” Bright said with a laugh after the legislation passed last year. Secession-style language and proposals seeking to transfer power from the federal government to states and localities have become increasingly common in recent years during the fight over federal health care reform, perhaps most notably in Texas, where Republican Gov. Rick Perry in 2009 suggested the Lone Star State could secede in the future should the federal government not change its fiscal polices. |||||","completion":"The text primarily details the proposal by State Sen. Lee Bright of South Carolina to develop an independent state currency. This action is an extension of South Carolina's efforts to assert its independence from the federal government and prevent the potential impact of a collapse of the Federal Reserve System on the state's economy. Bright believes that the US Federal Reserve System is heading towards a monetary collapse due to federal spending and increased intervention by the Fed. In anticipation of such an event, he argues that having a stable South Carolina currency would help residents weather the crisis. He proposes the creation of a joint legislative subcommittee to investigate the establishment of such a currency. This bill posits that numerous experts predict the inevitable breakdown of the Federal Reserve System's currency due to hyperinflation in the foreseeable future. To insulate itself from the economic, social, and political aftermath of such a development, South Carolina must adopt an alternate sound currency that the state government and citizens can use immediately if and when the Federal Reserve System's currency is destroyed. The proposed currency could consist of gold, silver, or both, and echoes suggestions that Virginia and Georgia are considering similar measures. Bright's legislation cites the rights reserved to states in the Constitution and Supreme Court rulings supporting the states' right to adopt their currency for executing independent government functions. However, Phil Bailey, director of the state Senate Democratic Caucus, criticizes the idea as a diversion from pressing state issues and as a wasteful use of time and resources. In the past, Bright has also proposed legislation to exempt locally manufactured firearms, accessories, or ammunition from federal regulations. He has pushed for more power to be transferred from the federal government to states, especially in the field of healthcare.

Online acquaintances wished fair winds and following seas to Joshua Hakken as he fled to Cuba, a strange refuge for a professed fan of Ron Paul. Hakken, his wife and their two sons, 2-year-old Chase and 4-year-old Cole, were at a marina on the communist-ruled island when CNN found them aboard their small sailboat Tuesday. Florida authorities believe Hakken sailed there after abducting the two boys from the Tampa home of their grandmother, who was granted custody after Hakken's 2012 arrest on drug charges in Louisiana. \\"This all just seems like the government is yet again making real criminals out of non-violent peaceful freedom lovers,\\" wrote one commenter on \\"Adam Vs. The Man,\\" a libertarian web forum. The family's Cuban sojourn may be short-lived, as the government there announced Tuesday that it would hand them over to U.S. authorities. A man identifying himself as Hakken -- \\"a father, a registered professional mechanical engineer and a veteran of the USAF\\" -- joined the Adam Vs. The Man discussion board in February 2012 under the handle \\"Sailingbull.\\" \\"I am absolutely devoted to life, liberty, the rights of the individual and the Constitution of the United States of America,\\" he wrote. \\"Mr. Ron Paul is the ONLY politician I have ever admired or supported. It is unimaginable what the forces at be are doing and want to do to him.\\" Paul, the former Texas congressman, ran for president as a Republican in 2008 and 2012 and once as the Libertarian Party nominee, in 1988. Hakken vounteered to help Paul supporters scout out campsites near last year's Republican convention in Tampa, posting photos of site possibilities on the message board. CNN has not been able to independently confirm Hakken's identity on site, and Adam Vs. The Man founder Adam Kokesh did not respond to requests for comment. But in a post last week, after news that Hakken was wanted in connection with the abduction, he noted, \\"I feel like we're in a position to help here. Maybe to reach out to him. Certainly seems like a stupid way to go about this, regardless of what your moral assessment is.\\" Both Hakken and his wife, Sharyn, held professional engineering certificates -- hers in civil engineering, his in the mechanical and fire-protection specialties, according to state records. After high school, he attended the Air Force Academy in Colorado from June 1996 to May 1998, academy spokesman Meade Warthen told CNN. Online, Hakken said he left because of a previously undiagnosed spinal condition; Warthen said the academy couldn't comment on the reason for his withdrawal. The couple's legal woes began last June with what police called a \\"disturbance\\" at a hotel in Slidell, Louisiana, just east of New Orleans. \\"When police arrived, both Mr. and Mrs. Hakken were acting in a bizarre manner that alarmed officers,\\" a Slidell police statement recounts. \\"They were talking about 'completing their ultimate journey' and were traveling across the country to 'take a journey to the Armageddon.' Let it be noted that both of their children were present in the hotel room at the time.\\" Police said they found both drugs and weapons in the room and called in the state Office of Child Services, which \\"determined that the children were in danger\\" and took them into their custody. Hakken was charged with marijuana possession, possession of drug paraphernalia and the use of a controlled substance around minors; \\"Officers also took custody of several weapons for safe keeping.\\" The Office of Child Services told CNN it would not comment on the case. The children were put into foster care with a family in Tangipahoa Parish, north of Lake Pontchartrain. Two weeks after the arrest, the foster mother called 911 and told dispatchers, \\"I need a cop now. I have a guy at my house with a gun.\\" \\"I have two foster children, and it's their dad ... I don't hear banging, but I'm not getting out 'til a cop car gets here,\\" she said. Hakken left without the boys, who later were sent to live with Patricia Hauser, Sharyn Hakken's mother, in Tampa. On April 2, a Louisiana court terminated the couple's parental rights, investigators say. The following day, Hillsborough County authorities say Hakken entered Hauser's home, tied her up and took off in her Toyota Camry with the boys. Three and a half hours later, surveillance video captured their recently-purchased sailboat heading into the Gulf of Mexico. CNN's Kim Segal and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.

Then all the people who acted in the film went off for lunch. I got my food and joined them, and the criminal, who had moments before been so scary, took his seat beside me and told us many funny jokes. A table of adults surrounded me, but I was never uncomfortable talking with strangers. I worked with these people and they worked with me. We talked, we laughed, we got to know each other and sometimes we became friends. At the end of the day we all went our separate ways, but we had been drawn close by working together to make this play. After the show was broadcast, my friends asked if I had been scared of the criminal. At first this sounded funny. He was, after all, a kind and intelligent man.

Question: What did Beef say they would find to make Spencer's sister's Christmas better? Movie plot title: Unaccompanied Minors Movie plot: Spencer Davenport and his sister Katherine must fly from California to Pennsylvania on Christmas Eve to spend the holidays with their dad, an environmentalist. Unfortunately, during their layover at the Hoover International Airport in Chicago, a massive blizzard grounds all planes and cancels all flights, and the siblings are sent to the anarchic UM (unaccompanied minors') room, where they meet Christmas-spirited smarty-pants Charlie Goldfinch, surly tomboy Donna Malone, arrogant rich girl Grace Conrad, and mysterious Beef Wellington. Charlie, Spencer, Beef, Grace and Donna sneak out, and proceed to enjoy themselves around the airport. When they are caught by the airport security guards and returned to the UM room, they find that the other minors, Katherine included, have been sent to a lodge down the road, and that the grouchy head of passenger relations, Oliver Porter â whose trip to Hawaii is among the canceled flights â intends for the kids to spend Christmas Eve in the UM room. Knowing that it will break Katherine's faith in Santa Claus if she does not receive a present by the next morning, Spencer asks the others to help him get a present for his sister in return for a plan to escape. With Spencer's plan, the minors give Zach Van Bourke, the friendly clerk watching them, the slip, but Mr. Porter grows desperate to get the kids back, and sends all the airport guards to find them. After Donna and Grace get into a fight, Spencer decides that they're going to have to put their differences aside and work together as a team, and Beef leaves to go and get a Christmas tree.

My first impression would be this is Beowulf only with all the good bits of fighting Grendel and dragons intact, making it one thrill ride from start to end. Written by Frederic Lanoir and Arthur Qwak, the two of them had created a fantastical landscape that becomes a character in itself within their story, with its ever changing environment made up of small spheres of land floating around, which can either be wastelands, or globes of greenery. The story's a simple one, which tells of a land which is cowering in the expectation of a mighty dragon's unwanted visit to plunder and destroy, and the resident knights have all but been annihilated. Enter the king's granddaughter Zoe (Marie Drion) who gathers Lian-Chu (Vincent Lindon), a huge brute with immense strength but truly a gentle giant, and his partner-in-arms Gwizdo (Patrick Timsit), who balances the partnership with his cunning brain. Lian-Chu and Gwizdo (together with their pet creature which too proudly spews incipient fires) share a common dream of owning a farm land and spending idyllic days tending to their farm animals in retirement, but in order to do that comes the requirement of being financially free, hence their career in monster-extermination which doesn't exactly pay off. That's basically the whole gist of it, but what makes this film a spectacle, is its CG graphics, which is solidly rich, detailed, and an eye-popping marvel to behold. It has some wonderfully crafted set action pieces that were painstakingly designed to draw you into the thick of the action,, and during those fight sequences, there's nary a boring moment. Photo-realistic moments of non-existent landscapes make you put aside the fantasy of make-belief, and it's easy to be in awe of the landscape which goes beyond the usual three-suns and a kaleidoscope of flying thingamajigs (here's having at you George!) And I couldn't get enough of the finale battle as well, though the usual brick-bats will find some fault at the indestructibility of the principle characters.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Why the early 2015 college football rankings like ASU, Arizona Updated JAN 13, 2015 4:50p ET Late night host Jimmy Kimmel's pick for the Arizona State Sun Devils to win the College Football Playoff on Monday was ludicrous. So here's FOX Sports football analyst Petros Papadakis being equally high on the Sun Devils while bringing us closer to reality. Papadakis included ASU as one of his four teams for next year's playoff. Bold, yes. Out of the realm of possibility? No. With Marcus Mariota leaving Oregon for the NFL, the Pac-12 South champion in 2015 could have a shot at making the College Football Playoff. Getting out of the division will again be the tricky part, but both Arizona schools are positioned to be in the mix. Arizona won the division title in 2014 because of the math, but fans were still left wondering which Pac-12 South team was the best. UCLA finished 10th in the final USA Today Coaches poll of the season, ahead of 14th-ranked ASU and 17th-ranked Arizona. The Bruins also finished 10th in the Associated Press poll, again in front of 12th-ranked ASU and 19th-ranked Arizona. USC and Utah weren't far behind. Vetting the final rankings is a process for bragging rights more than a useful projection for next season, but that's why we're moving on with the help of some smart college football folks. Here are where three experts pick the Wildcats and Sun Devils heading into 2015: FOX Sports' Stewart Mandel: ASU (12th), Arizona (17th) ESPN's Mark Schlabach: Arizona (13th), ASU (15th) USA Today's Paul Myerberg: ASU (11th), Arizona (15th) Now, to what factors have helped the rivals gain positive reviews heading into 2015, and why both ASU and Arizona should challenge for the Pac-12 South title: Coaching staff continuity can't be overlooked, and it's an important factor for Arizona and Arizona State. Rich Rodriguez's close-knit coaching staff seems stable, while Todd Graham's lead assistant, offensive coordinator Mike Norvell, didn't receive a head coaching offer strong enough to pull him out of Tempe. Meanwhile, the Utah Utes wait anxiously to see if reports of head coach Kyle Whittingham wanting out will come true. Even if they don't, Utah took a big blow when offensive coordinator Dave Christensen left for Texas A&M despite a successful first season with the Utes. The Utes also lost defensive coordinator Kalani Sitake and defensive line coach Ilaisa Tuikai. USC should be in decent shape in the second year under Steve Sarkisian, though the Trojans did lose offensive line coach Tim Drevno, who will become Jim Harbaugh's offensive coordinator at Michigan. And there will always be rumors that UCLA coach Jim Mora could leave for the NFL, though nothing to this point seems past the point of speculation. Do-it-all Sun Devil D.J. Foster will return foe his senior year with ASU, and the Sun Devils know what they'll get out of quarterback Mike Bercovici. Sixteen starters will be back for Graham's team, and that's good enough reason for Papadakis to make a surprising pick despite the departure of receiver Jaelen Strong. At Arizona, quarterback Anu Solomon will likely return as a smarter, more determined player in 2015 after he put the blame on himself following the Wildcats' Fiesta Bowl loss to Boise State. Rodriguez hasn't handed him the starting job, but it would be a surprise if he wasn't behind center with stud running back Nick Wilson by his side. And the Wildcats can't be discussed without mentioning linebacker Scooby Wright, who piled up numerous national awards as a sophomore. Elsewhere in the Pac-12 South, there are significant holes to fill. UCLA will move on without Brett Hundley leading the offense, while Utah will miss standout defensive end Nate Orchard. USC returns Cody Kesler at quarterback but will need to replace defensive end Leonard Williams, running back Buck Allen and receiver Nelson Agholor. If there is any team equipped to deal with such losses, it's the Trojans. USC is arguably the favorite to win the division, and part of the reasoning is its fourth-ranked recruiting class, per Scout. Graham's incoming class at ASU is ranked 20th -- the third-best in the Pac-12 and behind only the Trojans and No. 9 UCLA. Arizona's class finds itself down the ladder at 35th, but there's something to be said for Rodriguez's eye for talent. Just look at Wright, and it's clear the Wildcats know what types of players fit their system and identity, even if the number of stars don't impress.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Pa Reporter. Chris Kirk shot a bogey-free final round to clinch the Deutsche Bank Championship at TPC Boston with Rory McIlroy unable to mount a challenge on the final day. The American, who was joint third with McIlroy and Jason Day on 10 under going into the final day, carded five birdies in a final-round 66 to beat Australia's Geoff Ogilvy and fellow Americans Russell Henley and Billy Horschel by two shots. 'Biggest win I ever had,' Kirk said on pgatour.com shortly after sealing victory on 15 under overall. 'I may be a little bit more calm, but I was still freaking out a bit inside.' Glory: Chris Kirk (right) is presented with the winner's trophy by CEO of Deutsche Bank Jacques Brand. What might have been: Rory McIlroy trudges off the 18th green after a disappointing final round. Kirk's victory in the second of the four play-off events means the 29-year-old American now leads the FedEx Cup standings. It is only his third PGA Tour career title. He wasted no time in eating into Henley's two-shot overnight lead by birdieing the third and fourth holes, while a further birdie on the ninth meant he had picked up three shots in the opening nine holes. Kirk made par on the next three before birdieing again on the 13th and repeating the feat for the fifth and final time of his round on the 16th before finishing with two more pars. In the swing: Kirk takes his approach shot on the sixth hole at TPC Boston on Monday. In the long grass: World No 1 McIlroy hits out of trouble on the sixth hole on his way to a fifth place finish. Going for the flag: Kirk chips to the second green during the final round of the Deutsche Bank Championship. Best man won: McIlroy congratulates Kirk after their round on the biggest win of his career to date. Kirk's victory gives United States captain Tom Watson plenty to ponder ahead of the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles later this month. Watson chooses his three wildcard picks on Tuesday and Kirk has done his chances of selection no harm at all. 'I definitely put myself in contention for one,' Kirk said when asked about his Ryder Cup chances. 'If I get picked, great. If not, I'm still happy with my win today.' World No 1 McIlroy, who had catapulted himself into contention with a flawless seven-under 64 on Sunday, could not secure his fourth title in five tournaments after recording four bogeys in his final-round 70 to finish joint fifth with Australia's John Senden on 11 under. They were two shots shy of the second-placed trio of Ogilvy, Henley and Horschel. Martin Kaymer and Day were tied for seventh on 10 under, while Sweden's Carl Pettersson and Jimmy Walker of America were two of seven players tied for ninth place on nine under. World No 2 Adam Scott had to be content with a joint 16th-placed finish with six others on eight under, while England's Ian Poulter was a further shot back to finish alongside Jim Furyk and Rickie Fowler. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A golfer named Chris Kirk played a really great game and won the Deutsche Bank Championship at a place called TPC Boston. He didn't make any mistakes and scored five birdies in the final round, which helped him win. Rory McIlroy, another golfer who is very good, didn't play as well as he wanted to on the last day and didn't win.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Their cheery song brightens many a winter's day. But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much. Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \\"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \\"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying \`You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However, some birds thrive in noisy environments. A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery. It is thought that they are capitalising on their predators fleeing to quieter areas. A:","completion":"Which factor is primarily causing robins to sing at night and potentially affecting their health according to the study conducted by Dr. David Dominoni? A. Noise pollution from cities B. Territorial disputes with other birds C. Artificial light from street lamps, takeaway signs, and homes D. Presence of heavy industrial machinery Explanation: The article mentions that Dr. David Dominoni's study has found that artificial light from sources such as street lamps, takeaway signs, and homes affect robins' biological clock, causing them to be wide awake and sing when they should be asleep. As a result, lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Summarize the following: If you are continuing to have difficulty with managing your anxiety and triggers, therapy may be a beneficial option to help you better handle your symptoms. Professional counselors and therapists are trained specifically to help with coping skills such as anxiety triggers. Find therapists in your area by getting a list of providers through your health insurance. Consider contacting your school counselor, university counseling center, or your work’s Employee Assistance Program for referrals to counseling. Find out about if the therapist has expertise in your anxiety triggers. You can even ask the therapist what kind of evidence-based practices they use. Different types of therapy techniques include CBT, DBT, Solution Focused, Strengths Based, and Prolonged Exposure Therapy. Research the techniques the therapist uses to learn more about them. There may be other treatment options to help with your anxiety if it continues to impair your daily life. Unavoidable anxiety triggers mean that you may have to encounter certain people or situations regularly and feel overwhelmed often. Talk with your health care provider or a mental health specialist about medication options if other strategies are not working for you. A doctor or psychiatrist can prescribe medications to help with your symptoms. Talk with your primary care provider about options or a referral to a specialist for advice. Talk with a mental health specialist about your medication treatment, and whether it has been beneficial. Often a combination of medication and therapy are best for severe anxiety. Many people face anxiety that is overwhelming and unavoidable. Depending on the type of anxiety that you’re facing, talk with a counselor or therapist about support groups in your area. Support groups are often less expensive than individual therapy. Working as a group on your anxiety symptoms can help you feel less isolated or judged. A support group is a safe space to engage with others about your concerns. Many support groups are led by trained mental health professionals or peer support specialists who have been through the same anxious feelings as you. Avoid isolating yourself when anxiety hits. Often this action will in turn make you feel less willing to handle anxiety the next time. After an anxiety-provoking situation has occurred, instead focus on turning to friends or family that support and reassure you. Have two or three friends or family that you can call when you’re feeling anxious or overwhelmed. Talk with them in advance about them acting as your “calling buddies.” Do activities with your friends or family. If you are hesitant to do things in groups, then find activities to do with just one friend or family member. Trust and confide in them. The people that love and care about you often want to be helpful and supportive as you learn to handle your anxiety.","completion":"You may consider therapy if you are having difficulties managing anxiety and triggers.

Please answer the following question: This article: The dominating colours in the Cottage Garden are hot saturated shades of red, orange, and yellow, a colour scheme that both Sackville-West and Nicolson claimed as their own conception. Lord considers it as much a traditional \\"cottage garden as Marie Antoinette was a milkmaid\\". Here, as elsewhere, Sackville-West was much influenced by William Robinson, a gardener she greatly admired and who had done much to popularise the concept of the cottage garden. It contains four beds, surrounded by simple paths, with planting in colours that Sackville-West described as those of the sunset. Plants include a range of dahlias, a particular favourite of Nicolson's, and the red-hot poker, which he despised. In a 1937 letter to his wife he observed, \\"I think the secret of your gardening is simply that you have the courage to abolish ugly or unsuccessful flowers. Except for those beastly red-hot pokers which you have a weakness for, there is not an ugly flower in the whole place.\\"The Herb Garden contains sage, thyme, hyssop, fennel and an unusual seat built around a camomile bush. Known to the family as Edward the Confessor's chair, it was constructed by Copper, the Nicolson's chauffeur. Originally laid out in the 1930s, the garden was revitalised by John Vass in the years immediately after the Second World War. The Lion Basin in the centre of the garden was brought back from Turkey in 1914.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. and the situation: In central Ireland there are two farms next to two very similar lakes, and both farms use the same fertilizer to grow crops. The farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis and so the farmer doesn't need to water his crops as much. The farm that is adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all though. Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get. Answer the following question: Which lake will have more dead zones? A:","completion":"Lake Montopeke is more likely to have more dead zones. This is because the farm next to Lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis, which dissolves the fertilizer in the soil. The runoff from the rain then carries the dissolved fertilizer away, and it ultimately ends up in the nearby Lake Montopeke. This introduction of nitrogen from the fertilizer promotes excessive algae growth in the lake. As the algae use up carbon dioxide and then die, decomposers break down the dead tissue, using up the oxygen in the water. This process can lead to the creation of dead zones, or areas with too little oxygen to support most aquatic life. On the other hand, the farm adjacent to Lake Costanza receives less rain, and as a result, there is less opportunity for runoff carrying dissolved fertilizer into the lake. Therefore, Lake Costanza is less likely to be subjected to the same degree of nutrient enrichment and subsequent dead zone formation as Lake Montopeke."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

This is where the Rev. and Mrs. Austen live with their family. While everyone else is sound asleep, Jane is up writing. She then gets up and wakes the entire household by playing loudly on the piano. The noise startles both Robert and Cassandra. Cassandra is Jane's sister and Robert is her fiance. Both Robert and Cassandra run out of their own rooms to see what the noise is and Robert catches a glimpse of Cassandra in her night gown which prompts the latter to smile slyly and then rush back to her own room.Mrs. Austen, who was trying to sleep, complains that Jane needs a husband. Rev. Austen, lying next to her, comments that because he has set an example of perfection, Jane can not be satisfied with anything less. The couple then playfully banter before rising for church.Meanwhile, Tom Lefroy is in London. He is the nephew of a very prominent judge but enjoys sowing his wild oats. Tom spends a lot of his time boxing, drinking, and enjoying the company of prostitutes and mistresses. His family is very poor, but his stern uncle has taken him under his wing in hopes that Tom will prove to be a respectable lawyer one day. Tom is friends with Henry Austen, a recent Oxford graduate who will be returning home soon.One day, Tom comes in late to court where his uncle is presiding. It is the last straw. His uncle speaks with him in private, saying that he is fed up with Tom. As punishment, he is sending Tom to the country side where Henry lives (as well as some other members of the Lefroy family.)Back in the country, there is a small gathering to celebrate Henry's recent graduation and homecoming. The Austen's distant and widowed cousin Eliza is there.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Determine where your property line is before you start so that you don't accidentally go over. The best advice is to hire a Registered Land Surveyor in your home state to mark the property line for you before you begin construction. Your city or town usually does not keep very detailed records of your property's boundary information. GIS (geographic information system) maps and Assessors maps are highly inaccurate when it comes to property boundaries. You can search for PropertySurvey Pins on your property. These are also located on the corners of a lot. Just because an old fence or other “assumed” property boundary wasis in place that does not always mean that it is correct. Choose a fence height before getting too far into the project. Six foot is normal for a privacy fence, a livestock fence four feet high is usually sufficient, and picket fences are often three feet high. Fence height is important in the early stages, as it determines things like post hole depth. Most cities have a height ordinance, so be sure to check this before you choose your fence height. Place stakes at the corners roughly where you wish your fence to go. Tie a string around the stakes and run the string between stakes. Use a square or square-level to make sure that the corners\\" where our stakes are placed are squared (the two sides form a 90° angle). You can also square the corners by measuring the strings. Measure 3' on one side and 4' on the other. If the distance between the two marks (diagonally) is equal to 5', then the corner is square. Measure out lengths of 8' or less along the strings once you've square your corners and stake those locations to indicate the location for your support posts. You generally want to take the total distance and divide it by 8 but if you have a length of fence that is not divisible by 8, you'll need to break it down into smaller sections. For example, a 24' fence would need 2 middle posts to create the three 8' sections, but a 25' fence would need 3 middle posts at 6.25' for each section in order to look even and be structurally sound. To find the length and number for odd fence lengths, go up to the next number of posts and then divide the total length of the fence by the number of resulting sections. Use a post-hole digger to dig holes at the locations you staked. The posts will need to be buried at least 33% as deep as they are tall (example: an 8' high fence needs a hole 2.5' deep), so your hole will need to be at least that depth plus a few extra inches. The hole should be wide enough that there is room around the post when you put it in. Because soil conditions vary, and the height of the fence, the type of fencing, and other factors must be considered in determining how deep the post should be, you will have to calculate the hole depth for yourself. Place 3-4\\" of gravel at the bottom of the hole. Place the post in the hole and get it into alignment. Check to make sure that the corners are still square, use a post leveler to make sure it is straight, and make sure it is sitting at the correct height. Carefully holding your post in place, pour in instant concrete until the hole is 2/3 full. Add water to the top and use a stirring stick to mix the cement. Prop the post into place (stabilize using temporary nailed boards if necessary) and allow the concrete to set following the manufacturer's instructions. Fill any remainder of the hole with dirt once the concrete has set. Pull a builder's line from one end post to the other, at an equal height above the ground, preferably at the top of the post (if your posts were placed correctly). This will help you keep the height of the fence the same along the way. Cut 2x4 rails (or horizontal support boards) to the appropriate length to reach between the centers of the posts. If you can, use a single rail for the entire length of the fence section. Rails should be no more than 24\\" apart, so most fences will have 2-3 rails. Attach the rails using decking screws. With your support boards in place, you can attach your pickets (vertical boards, also called privacy boards). There are many different styles and ways of doing this, depending on how you want your fence to look. The most basic is a board on board fence, where the fence boards are nailed (using a nail gun, nailed at the support boards) with the distance of less than one board between them. Place the first board up and then use a level to “plumb” (vertical level) the board. Then, nail or screw the board in place. Use a spacer and then place the next board. Use the level periodically to check that it is “plumb.” These boards are usually 1X6 rough sawn lumber but you can buy other pre-cut fencing boards as well. If nailing the boards by hand, use 8d spiral shank galvanized nails. Once you're done, you will want to treat the boards to increase the longevity of your fence. You can paint your fence, stain it, or simply apply a weather-proofing finish to keep your fence looking great for years to come. Enjoy! This will usually either contain silicone solids, or linseed oil. If you plan on painting a finish paint, stick with an oil-based sealer, and use an oil-based polyurethane paint or exterior enamel for the finish paint.","completion":"To build a fence, it is crucial to first determine your property line by hiring a Registered Land Surveyor. Make sure to choose the fence's height beforehand, keeping in mind local height ordinances. Start by placing stakes at the corners of the area you want to cover and tie a string between them, ensuring the corners are squared and forming 90-degree angles. You can also use the 3-4-5 rule to square the corners. Once the corners are squared, measure out lengths of 8 feet or less along the strings to mark the locations for your support posts. Use a post-hole digger to dig holes at these locations. The holes should be deep enough to bury a suitable portion of the post, which is dependent on various factors such as fence height, soil conditions, and the type of fencing. Place gravel at the bottom of each hole and position the posts accordingly. Use a post leveler to ensure the posts are straight and aligned. Pour instant concrete into the hole up to 2/3 of its depth, mix with water, and let it set. Once the concrete has set, fill the rest of the hole with dirt.

American stories speak of Johnny Appleseed, who went throughout America collecting apple seeds and planting apple trees. He had a great love for nature and went through fields and farms adding richness and beauty to the country. One of the first sayings taught to school children is, \\"An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\\" This short saying encourages children to eat fresh fruit to keep healthy. If someone always says good words to a person, people will call him an _ . This, however, is not a good name. If someone is very dear to us, we say that he or she is the \\"apple of our eye\\".

The band claims to play \\"loud, heavy, noisy, punk rock\\" and is influenced by 1980s hardcore punk and post-hardcore bands. The band have released several 7\\" singles and four albums, and are currently signed to Sub Pop. In March 2013, Pissed Jeans was named one of Fuse TV's 30 must-see artists at SXSW. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Post-hardcore is a punk rock music genre that derives from hardcore punk, maintaining hardcore's aggression and intensity, but emphasizes a greater degree of creative expression initially inspired by post-punk and noise rock. Like post-punk, the term has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. The genre took shape in the mid to late 1980s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots. - Noise rock is a style of experimental rock rooted in noise music. The genre, which gained prominence in the 1980s, makes use of the traditional instrumentation and iconography of rock music, but incorporates atonality and especially dissonance, and frequently discards typical songwriting conventions. Noise rock developed from early avant-garde music, sound art, and rock songs featuring extremely dissonant sounds and electronic feedback. The New York no wave scene, featuring such artists as Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks in the late 1970s, was an essential development in noise rock. - Hope For Men is a 2007 album by Pissed Jeans . The lyrics of many of the songs are about very mundane subjects , such as eating ice cream and scrapbooking , in sharp contrast to the frenzied vocals and loud , off - key instrumentals . The tracks \`\` Scrapbooking '' and \`\` The Jogger '' are essentially spoken - word tracks , the latter with a crashing guitar backdrop . - Sub Pop is a record label founded in 1986 by Bruce Pavitt. In 1988, Sub Pop Records LLC was formed by Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman in Seattle, Washington. Sub Pop achieved fame in the late 1980s for first signing Nirvana, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and many other bands from the Seattle alternative rock scene. They are often credited with taking the first steps toward popularizing grunge music, and have continued to achieve critical and commercial success in the new millennium, with bands such as Fleet Foxes, Foals, Beach House, The Postal Service, Flight of the Conchords, Sleater-Kinney, Blitzen Trapper, No Age, Wolf Parade and The Shins on their roster. In 1995 the owners of Sub Pop sold a 49% stake of the label to the Warner Music Group. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats.

But while this monumental event begins to unfold, it is marred by the ongoing security guard fiasco that has entangled the city in recent weeks. In this article, we take a glimpse at the journey the flame will embark on, led by a Royal Marine commando, and discuss the somber backdrop of the security guard crisis that continues to overshadow the upcoming Olympic Games. The Flame's Arrival: The Olympic torch relay holds a special place in the hearts of sports enthusiasts and casual onlookers alike, as it represents the unity, dedication, and indomitable spirit of athletes worldwide. As such, the organizers have orchestrated a grand entrance for the flame, with a Royal Marine commando bringing it into the Tower of London via helicopter. This thrilling spectacle will undoubtedly draw the attention of Londoners and the world, serving as an awe-inspiring start to a week-long relay leading up to the Games themselves. Torchbearers and the 200-mile Journey: Over the course of this week, the Olympic flame will be transported through 200 miles of London streets, passed from one torchbearer to another. Each torchbearer has been carefully selected, many due to their inspiring stories and dedication to their communities. As they carry the torch, they will simultaneously represent and celebrate the spirit of the Olympic Games, embodying the values of perseverance, teamwork, and sportsmanship that have come to be synonymous with this international event. The Security Guard Fiasco: Unfortunately, as the Olympic flame makes its way through the city, its bright glow has been tarnished somewhat by the ongoing fiasco regarding security guards for the Games. The buildup to the Olympics has been plagued by scandals involving the contractors responsible for providing security, with reports of insufficient guards, undertrained staff, and compromised safety measures. This has led to increasing concerns over the safety of the athletes, spectators, and the city itself during the Games, casting an unfortunate shadow over what should be a time of global unity and celebration. Conclusion: In the face of the security guard fiasco, the Olympic flame's journey through London serves as a beacon of hope and inspiration.

Answer based on context: During the Ottoman period, the citys population of Ottomans Muslims (including those of Turkish people and Albanians origin, as well as Bulgarian Muslim and Greek Muslim convert origin) grew substantially. According to the 1478 census Selânik (), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had 6,094 Greek Orthodox households, 4,320 Muslim ones, and some Catholic. No Jews were recorded in the census suggesting that the subsequent influx of Jewish population was not linked to the already existing Romaniote Jews community. Soon after the turn of the 15th to 16th century, however, nearly 20,000 Sephardic Jews immigrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain by the 1492 Alhambra Decree. By c. 1500, the number of households had grown to 7,986 Greek ones, 8,575 Muslim ones, and 3,770 Jewish. By 1519, Sephardic Jewish households numbered 15,715, 54% of the citys population. Some historians consider the Ottoman regimes invitation to Jewish settlement was a strategy to prevent the ethnic Greek population from dominating the city. How many more Jewish households were there in Selânik in 1519 than there had been in 1500?","completion":"In the year 1500, there were 3,770 Jewish households in Selânik. By the year 1519, the number of Jewish households had increased to 15,715. To find out the increase in the number of Jewish households from 1500 to 1519, you can simply subtract the number of Jewish households in 1500 from the number in 1519. So, 15,715 (the number in 1519) minus 3,770 (the number in 1500) equals 11,945. Therefore, there were 11,945 more Jewish households in Selânik in 1519 than there had been in the year 1500. This significant increase may be attributed primarily to the influx of Sephardic Jews who migrated to Greece from the Iberian Peninsula following their expulsion from Spain under the 1492 Alhambra Decree. This historical event led to a considerable shift in the population composition of Selânik, with Sephardic Jewish households constituting 54% of the city's total population by 1519. The Ottoman regime’s invitation to Jewish settlement could have been viewed as a strategic move to counterbalance the ethnic Greek population and prevent it from dominating the city."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: What are the worst examples of false advertising you've seen? Did you fall prey to their claims? Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome.

Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the object that the musician who married the daughter of a senior British army officer was believed to be the first to take seriously? Sir Edward William Elgar, 1st Baronet (; 2 June 1857 – 23 February 1934) was an English composer, many of whose works have entered the British and international classical concert repertoire. Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies. He also composed choral works, including The Dream of Gerontius, chamber music and songs. He was appointed Master of the King's Musick in 1924. Although Elgar is often regarded as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married the daughter of a senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, The Dream of Gerontius (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory. In his fifties, Elgar composed a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took many years to achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras. Elgar's music came, in his later years, to be... A:","completion":"Enigma Variations"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in the given situation is that the lungs remove more oxygen from the air than usual. Let's analyze the steps and determine how this specific perturbation might affect the process of oxygen diffusion into cells from capillaries, focusing on the distinction between direct, indirect, and no impact on the process. 1. Air goes into the lungs: This step remains unchanged because the perturbation only affects the amount of oxygen removed from the air, not the physical process of air entering the lungs. 2. The lungs remove more oxygen from the air: This is the supposed perturbation and directly impacts this step of the process. The increased efficiency in oxygen removal leads to a higher concentration of oxygen in the air within the lungs, which might result in the increased availability of oxygen to diffuse. 3. Oxygen diffuses from alveoli in the lungs to the bloodstream: With a higher concentration of oxygen in the lungs resulting from the perturbation, the diffusion from alveoli to the bloodstream will be indirectly impacted. Higher concentration gradients tend to increase the rate of diffusion, thereby potentially allowing more oxygen to enter the bloodstream. 4. Hemoglobin in red blood cells attaches to the oxygen: Increased oxygen concentration in the bloodstream means that there is more available oxygen for hemoglobin to bind. Since the concentration of hemoglobin remains constant, this step will be indirectly impacted, and the overall oxygen-carrying capacity increases. 5. Red blood cells carry oxygen all around the body: Functionally, this step shouldn't be affected but with an increased oxygen-carrying capacity, the amount of oxygen transported will increase indirectly. This could lead to more oxygen being delivered to the tissues and cells throughout the body. 6. Oxygen diffuses into cells from capillaries: This final step will be indirectly impacted by the perturbation. The increased concentration of oxygen in the bloodstream results in a higher oxygen partial pressure in the blood. According to Fick's law of diffusion, this will increase the rate of diffusion from capillaries into cells, leading to more oxygen being available for cellular respiration. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation directly impacts the step of removing oxygen from the air in the lungs. This, in turn, indirectly impacts several other steps in the process of oxygen diffusion into cells from capillaries, ultimately leading to more oxygen being available for diffusion into the cells."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: - Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere - Some is reflected back into space - The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth - Heat radiates from Earth to space - Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases - This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere What might be the last step of the process?

Context: U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors.

In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea.

After cutting off the power, wiring a light is simple.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the following conclusion: After cutting off the power, wiring a light becomes a simpler process. The main reason for cutting off the power is to ensure safety while working with electrical wiring. With the power off, we can follow the subsequent steps to wire a light without the risk of electrical shock. Here's a step-by-step guide to wiring a light after cutting off the power: 1. Gather the necessary tools and materials, such as a screwdriver, wire stripper, wire nuts, and the light fixture itself. 2. Identify the wires in the ceiling box. Typically, you will find a black or red wire (hot/live), a white wire (neutral), and a green or bare copper wire (ground). 3. Carefully strip the insulation from the ends of the wires, exposing about half an inch of the conductive core. 4. Follow the light fixture instructions to correctly attach the wires. Usually, this involves connecting the black or red wire from the ceiling box to the black or red wire from the light fixture (hot/live wires); the white wire from the ceiling box to the white wire from the light fixture (neutral wires); and the green or bare copper wire from the ceiling box to the green or bare copper wire from the light fixture (ground wires). 5. Use wire nuts to secure each connection, ensuring a strong and safe connection. 6. Gently fold the wires back into the ceiling box, taking care not to pinch them. 7. Attach the light fixture base to the ceiling box according to the manufacturer's instructions. 8. Install the light bulbs and any additional components, such as a cover or shade. 9. Turn the power back on at the junction box by switching the breaker so the fuse for the circuit supplying electricity to the fixture reads \\"on.\\" 10. Test the light switch to ensure the wiring is correct and the light functions as intended. By following these steps, the process of wiring a light becomes manageable and relatively simple once the power is off."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article based on this summary: – In what Deadline calls a \\"shock ruling,\\" Midnight Rider director Randall Miller was set free Wednesday from a Georgia jail after serving only half of his plea-deal term for his role in the death of a 27-year-old camera assistant, the AP reports. The early release was due to prosecutors recently discovering that state law doesn't permit an inmate to serve more than one year at a state jail (as opposed to a prison), leading a judge to modify Miller's sentence from two years to one, Variety reports. The judge also took into account the fact that Miller's lawyers—who the Hollywood Reporter says tried to get him out twice before—and the DA's office had struck a \\"two-for-one\\" agreement of possible early release for good behavior before Miller entered his plea last year. Miller, who had pleaded guilty to criminal trespassing and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Sarah Jones, will continue his 10-year probation, which includes a mandate saying he can't direct a film or otherwise have any supervisory role overseeing safety in a film production. On Feb. 20, 2014, Jones was working on the set of the Gregg Allman biopic, filming a scene on train tracks in Wayne County, Ga., when she was struck by a train and killed, per the Reporter; eight others were injured, Variety notes. The movie production company had reportedly been denied access to the tracks and shot there anyway, leading to Miller becoming the first known filmmaker to be convicted and jailed for an on-set death. Jones' parents tell Variety they initially agreed to the plea deal placing Miller in jail instead of prison due to his health and say they never would have agreed to it if they had known he'd be released after one year. \\"We don't mean to inflict more pain to Mr. Miller's family,\\" Jones' father, Richard Jones, said in court Wednesday. \\"It's about making the film industry a better, safer place.\\" Others expressed their outrage more forcefully. \\"It's a complete miscarriage of justice and merely a slap on the wrist,\\" one of Jones' former colleagues tells the Reporter. \\"One year in jail is hardly accountability.\\"","completion":"\\"Midnight Rider\\" Director Randall Miller's Shock Early Release: Examining the Controversy and Its Impact on Film Industry Safety In a surprising turn of events, \\"Midnight Rider\\" director Randall Miller was released from a Georgia jail on Wednesday, after serving only half of his plea-deal term for his role in the tragic death of 27-year-old camera assistant Sarah Jones on the film set in 2014. This unexpected early release has sent shockwaves through the film industry and has sparked intense debate on the need for increased safety measures and accountability in film production. Miller's early release was due to the recent discovery by prosecutors that Georgia state law does not allow an inmate to serve more than one year in a state jail, as opposed to a prison. This led to a judge modifying Miller's sentence from two years to one, as reported by Variety. The Hollywood Reporter also noted that the judge took into account a \\"two-for-one\\" agreement of possible early release for good behavior that Miller's lawyers had previously struck with the District Attorney's office before he entered his plea last year. The ramifications of Jones' tragic death and Miller's subsequent early release extend far beyond the individuals involved, with significant implications on the film industry at large. The events have brought critical attention to on-set safety and accountability, seeing as the production company had reportedly been denied access to the train tracks where Jones was killed, but proceeded to film there regardless. This disregard for safety ultimately led to Miller becoming the first known filmmaker to be convicted and jailed for an on-set death. Jones' parents, who initially agreed to the plea deal placing Miller in jail instead of prison due to his health, told Variety they would not have agreed to the deal had they known he'd be released after one year. In a statement, Jones' father, Richard Jones, expressed his hopes for the film industry to learn from this tragedy: \\"It's about making the film industry a better, safer place.\\" As the film community grapples with the fallout from this shocking ruling, various stakeholders are raising their voices in frustration and disappointment. One of Jones' former colleagues told the Reporter, \\"It's a complete miscarriage of justice and merely a slap on the wrist. One year in jail is hardly accountability.\\" Despite his early release, Miller is still subject to the conditions of his 10-year probation, which includes a mandate stating that he cannot direct a film or have any supervisory role overseeing safety in film production. In light of this controversial ruling, the broader film industry must now reflect on the importance of prioritizing safety on sets, learning from the tragic loss of Sarah Jones, and ensuring that such a tragedy never occurs again. As Richard Jones poignantly stated, the ultimate goal must be to make the film industry a better, safer place for all those involved. Success will be measured not just in the prevention of future on-set accidents, but also in the establishment of clear, well-enforced safety protocols that protect everyone working in film production. With safety at the forefront of the conversation, the industry will move forward with a greater sense of responsibility, learning from this heartbreaking incident and working to ensure on-set safety for every member of a production crew."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.

Write an article based on this \\"You can set up a network between 2 PCs directly without access point You have to use a crossover ethernet cable\\"","completion":"Title: Setting Up a Direct Network Between Two PCs Without an Access Point: The Power of Crossover Ethernet Cables Introduction In today's interconnected world, setting up a network between computers is a common task among users wishing to share resources or connect to the internet. Typically, this involves using an access point, such as a router or a switch, to facilitate communication between the devices. However, many people are still unaware of the fact that it is possible to establish a direct network between two PCs without using an access point. One solution is by utilizing a crossover Ethernet cable. In this article, we will explore the benefits of setting up a direct network, how it works, and the step-by-step process for setting one up using a crossover Ethernet cable. Why Set Up a Direct Network? There are several advantages to setting up a direct network between two computers: 1. Cost Savings: By skipping the need for additional hardware, such as routers and switches, users can save money on equipment. 2. Simplified Setup: A direct network is easier and faster to set up than a traditional network. 3. Direct Data Transfer: A direct connection allows for faster transfer of data between the two connected computers, as it bypasses the need for an intermediary device. 4. Increased Privacy: In a direct connection, there is no chance of third-party interference, making it a more secure way to transfer sensitive data. Understanding Crossover Ethernet Cables The key to creating a direct network between two PCs without an access point lies in the use of a crossover Ethernet cable. Unlike standard Ethernet cables, which have identical pin configurations on both ends, crossover cables have different pin configurations. This unique design allows two devices (such as PCs) to communicate directly with each other, without the need for an intermediary device. Setting Up a Direct Network using a Crossover Ethernet Cable Step 1: Obtain a Crossover Ethernet Cable To set up a direct network between two PCs, you will first need to purchase a crossover Ethernet cable. These cables are available at most electronics stores and online retailers. Make sure to choose a cable of appropriate length, depending on the distance between the two computers. Step 2: Connect the Crossover Ethernet Cable Connect one end of the crossover Ethernet cable into the Ethernet port on the first PC, and the other end into the Ethernet port on the second PC. Step 3: Configure the IP Addresses For the direct connection to work, you will need to assign static IP addresses for both PCs. To do this in Windows, follow these instructions: 1. Open the Control Panel and navigate to Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings. 2. Right-click on the Ethernet connection and select \\"Properties.\\" 3. Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and click on \\"Properties.\\" 4. Choose \\"Use the following IP address\\" and enter an IP address for the first PC (for example, 192.168.0.1) with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. 5. Repeat this process for the second PC, choosing a slightly different IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.2). 6. Click \\"OK\\" to finish the configuration. Step 4: Test the Connection To verify whether the direct network has been set up successfully, try pinging the other PC. To do this, open the Command Prompt and type \\"ping\\" followed by the IP address of the other computer (e.g., \\"ping 192.168.0.2\\"). If the line says \\"Reply from...\\", it means the connection is successful. Conclusion Setting up a direct network between two PCs without an access point is not only possible but relatively simple with the help of a crossover Ethernet cable. This method offers a cost-effective, easy-to-implement solution for users who need a direct connection between computers to transfer data at high speeds and with increased privacy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gregory James \\"Greg\\" LeMond (born June 26, 1961) is an American former professional road racing cyclist who won the Road Race World Championship twice (1983 and 1989) and the Tour de France three times (1986, 1989 and 1990). He is also an entrepreneur and anti-doping advocate. LeMond was born in Lakewood, California, and raised in ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, near Reno. He is married and has three children with his wife Kathy, with whom he supports a variety of charitable causes and organizations. LeMond is a longtime vocal opponent of performance-enhancing drug use. He first spoke on-record against doping in cycling after winning the 1989 Tour de France. LeMond received intense criticism in 2001 when he publicly expressed doubts about the legitimacy of Lance Armstrong's Tour success after learning of his relationship with Dr. Michele Ferrari. His outspokenness placed him in the center of the anti-doping controversy. LeMond has consistently questioned the relationship between riders and unethical sports doctors like Ferrari, and has pointed out that doping products ultimately victimize the professional cyclists who make use of them. Said LeMond: \\"When I speak out about doping people could translate it and think it was about the riders. Actually I feel like I am an advocate for the riders. I look at them as being treated like lab rats that are test vehicles for the doctors. The doctors, the management, the officials, they're the ones that have corrupted riders. The riders are the only ones that pay the price.\\" LeMond's most notable conflicts have been with fellow Tour riders Lance Armstrong and Floyd Landis. He has also been critical of Alberto Contador, the UCI, and its former president, Pat McQuaid. In December 2012, LeMond claimed that a change needed to be made at the head of leadership for the UCI, and stated if called upon he would be willing to take the position himself if necessary to lead cycling out of the mire of doping. Said LeMond: \\"It is now or never to act. After the earthquake caused by the Armstrong case another chance will not arise. I am willing to invest to make this institution more democratic, transparent and look for the best candidate in the longer term.\\" McQuaid rejected LeMond's call for new leadership and was dismissive of LeMond. Ultimately McQuaid was defeated in his bid for a third term by British Cycling president Brian Cookson at the September 2013 UCI Congress in Florence, Italy.

Article: Getting enough vitamin C in your diet is key to getting all its benefits. Vitamin C supplements are measured in micrograms—see part one for the required amounts of vitamin C for different people. Many foods contain vitamin C, and consuming these can help you increase your vitamin C intake. Raw pineapple has 16mg of vitamin C, asparagus has 31 mg, raw broccoli has 89 mg, sun-dried tomatoes in oil have 101 mg, and raw parsley has 133 mg. Citrus is an especially good source of vitamin C. One cup of grapefruit, for instance, provides an entire day's worth of vitamin C, while a glass of orange juice is the equivalent of 165 percent of your daily vitamin C intake. Fresh squeezed orange juice or a physical orange is better for you than processed orange juice. What's more, the vitamin C in citrus will help curb stress by lowering stress hormone levels and possibly by reducing blood pressure, boost your energy by helping you to absorb iron better, and provide other essential phytonutrients that work in tandem with vitamin C, some of which aid memory. Check out the nutritional chart produced by your government's health department with respect to recommended daily intake of vitamin C. You'll be surprised how easy it is to vary your diet to include plenty of vitamin C sources. In the United States, the National Institutes of health have some recommendations. Vitamin C does not last in storage, so it is steadily lost the longer it is stored. As such, be prepared to eat your food as fresh as possible rather than leaving it to linger in the refrigerator or pantry. For example, leaving your broccoli in the fridge and then boiling it will reduce the vitamin C content considerably, compared to freshly picking the broccoli and steaming it that same day. It's good to grow your own vegetables if possible, even if you just grow broccoli on a balcony or potatoes in a bag or barrel. Wash fresh fruits and vegetables and then allow them to dry. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator and eat them within a few days. Do not soak them or store them in water because the vitamin C dissolves out of the plant into the water. Vitamin C also leaches out in cooking water. Fresh food is the best source of vitamin C and most fruit and vegetables contain vitamin C. In particular, aim to eat food from the cabbage family, red and green peppers, potatoes, blackcurrants, strawberries, citrus fruit, and tomatoes. This includes broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts and collard greens. Eat the vegetables raw or steam them, using only a small amount of water to maximize the amount of vitamins the vegetables retain. Have a salad with spinach leaves instead of lettuce. Spinach is a better source of vitamin C when eaten raw. Toss in green and red bell peppers and tomatoes for added vitamin C. Vegetables lose micronutrients when cooked. Potatoes are also a good source of vitamin C. In spite of what you may have heard, the skin does not have the highest concentration of vitamin C, but its fiber is good for you. When having a baked potato, be sure to also eat the skin. Juice is calorie dense and you lack the roughage and other benefits of eating the fruit when consuming it as juice. However, you can enjoy juice as a means of increasing your vitamin C intake by doing the following: Juice with pulp is better for you than juice without it because vitamin C is better absorbed if it is consumed in the presence of bioflavonoids, which are found mostly in fruit pulp. Make fresh squeezed orange juice or purchase frozen concentrate instead of premixed, ready-to-drink refrigerated cartons.

We have: -162 * k - 335 + 5519 = 0 First, we want to move 335 and 5519 to the other side, so we have: -162 * k = -5519 + 335 Now, -5519 + 335 is like having 5519 sour candies and adding 335 sweet candies. We still have 5184 sour candies, so we get: -162 * k = -5184 Now, we want to find how many times -162 can fit into -5184. It's like dividing all those sour candies into 162 groups. The number of candies in each group is: k = -5184 / -162 When we divide two sour candies (- signs) together, we get a sweet candy (+ sign). So we have: k = 5184 / 162 When we divide 5184 by 162, we get 32. So our final answer is: k = 32 Good job, little champ!

He drives into town, where he shoots a policeman (Officer Philip Forsell; in the film the character is identified only as Hyatt) on his beat, then drives to a police impound yard and shoots the officer on duty (dialogue identifies him as Wally Johnson). At a luncheonette, as he washes his hands, he momentarily flashes a police badge belonging to Detective Sgt. Stan Boyle (William Bryant). When a car pulls up, Boyle goes outside and gives the driver a satchel containing the 9mm and proceeds to his own car â but is shot in the back by the unseen driver. Seattle Police Department, and the head of the homicide investigation, Captain Edward Kosterman (Eddie Albert), believe the shootings are the work of street militants; Kosterman orders an immediate dragnet. Elsewhere, Detective Lieutenant Lon \\"McQ\\" McHugh (Wayne) escapes an attempt on his life by a professional hit man named Samuels. McQ had been woken minutes before by a phone call to him on his boat, telling him of the shootings of his longtime partner and the two other police officers.

Please answer the following question: Sperm had to swim from male to female reproductive organs for fertilization, and if fertilization occurs, the fertilized eggs are now described as pre-embryos or zygotes. Given these facts, sperm had to swim from what to what reproductive organs for zygotes to occur. among the following options: - barnacles - male to female - animals - ocean water - male to male - mouth of rivers - female to male - female to female Answer:","completion":"In order for fertilization to occur and zygotes to form, sperm must swim from the male reproductive organs to the female reproductive organs. This process is essential for sexual reproduction in animals, including humans. In the context of the provided options, sperm must swim from \\"male to female\\" reproductive organs to achieve fertilization and eventually form zygotes. Here is a detailed explanation of the process: 1. Sperm production: The process begins with the production of sperm cells in the male reproductive organs, specifically within the testes. The sperm cells undergo maturation and are stored in the epididymis, where they become motile and capable of fertilizing an egg. 2. Ejaculation: During sexual intercourse, sperm cells are released from the male reproductive system through ejaculation. The sperm cells are mixed with seminal fluid produced by the accessory glands, forming semen. The semen functions as a vehicle for the sperm, providing nutrients and protection as they travel through the female reproductive system. 3. Sperm meets egg: To reach the female reproductive organs, sperm must swim through the vagina and then ascend the cervical canal into the uterus. From the uterus, the sperm must navigate through the fallopian tube(s) in search of the mature egg released from the ovary during ovulation. Only a small fraction of the ejaculated sperm will successfully navigate this intricate path. 4. Fertilization: Once a sperm cell encounters an egg, it must penetrate the outer layers of the egg and fuse with it, thereby releasing its genetic material into the egg. This fusion is called fertilization, and it results in the formation of a single-celled zygote. 5. Zygote formation and development: After fertilization, the new zygote begins its development process, starting with cell division. As the cells continue to divide and specialize, the zygote transforms into a blastocyst and then an embryo. If implantation into the uterus lining is successful, it will grow into a fetus and eventually a fully formed offspring. In summary, for zygotes to form, sperm must successfully swim from the male reproductive organs to the female reproductive organs, where fertilization of an egg can occur. This essential process forms the basis of sexual reproduction in animals."},{"prompt":"Generate a question that has the following answer: The Duke and his crew for the following movie plot: A simple group of commercial flyers, post WWII, one plane is downed in uncharted Canadian tundra, dead of winter, wicked cold.

Summarize: Not content with filling stadiums around the world, and selling more than 100 million records, the face-painted, fire-breathing US hard rockers also have their own navy. Every autumn Kiss hire a huge cruise liner to sail around the Caribbean for a week with 2,300 of their diehard fans. This year will be their sixth voyage, or Kiss Kruise VI. The band perform two shows on the ship, and fans get to meet and hang out with the four band members. There are 13 bars on board, plus 12 restaurants, a swimming pool, a gym, a spa, a casino, an indoor theatre and a tattoo parlour for getting a new Kiss ink work. Members of the so-called Kiss Navy fly into Miami from around the world to attend, and Kiss vocalist and bass guitarist Gene Simmons says the cruise is one of the highlights of his annual calendar. \\"It's rock and roll all night and party every day,\\" he says. \\"Anyone who has ever been on one of our cruises comes back raving to their friends. \\"Imagine 2,300 crazy friends, swimming, shopping, gaming and visiting exotic ports of call with us.\\" While Kiss might not be to everyone's taste, the rock group has helped to transform the once staid world of cruise lines. Whereas cruises were traditionally the preserve of elderly holidaymakers, over the past decade - and especially in the past five years - there has been an exponential growth in the number of \\"themed cruises\\" - cruises aimed at people with a specific interest. This has opened up the world of cruising to a much younger demographic, and given the cruise industry hundreds of millions of dollars in additional earnings. From music cruises - at which Kiss are leading the way - to cruises for people with specific political views, or cruises for poker players, or fans of Italian food, there is a ship sailing for pretty much everyone. For example, if you are passionate about your constitutional right to bear arms, you might be tempted to join the Freedom Alliance and National Rifle Association's cruise down the River Danube in June. Guest speakers include US Republican politician - and former speaker of the US House of Representatives - Newt Gingrich. Or if you are transgender, Transgender Vacations organises cruises around the Caribbean. Disney holds regular sailings for fans of the Star Wars movies, where you can dress up as a stormtrooper or ewok and meet some of the actors. Howard Moses, founder and president of the Cruise & Vacation Authority, says that more than 700 themed cruises now set sail around the world each year, compared with less than 30 a decade ago. \\"Themed cruises are absolutely by far the biggest growth area in the industry,\\" says Mr Moses, whose organisation is based in the US state of Georgia. \\"It has enabled the cruise industry to reach beyond people who are our traditional customers, to people who are passionate about a certain subject. \\"For music cruises, there can be a very young crowd. \\"And for the political cruises we joke that the attendees are often people who said they would never go on a cruise, yet they have the time of their lives, and are the first to lead the conga line.\\" At Atlanta-based Sixthman, the world's largest organiser of music cruises, its communications manager Alaidriale Derway says the business has just wrapped up its busiest ever spring sailing season, with 10 back-to-back cruises. Sixthman now has more than 500 acts on its books, including Kiss. Other acts for whom it organises cruises include Weezer, Paramore, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Kid Rock. The company charters the ships and helps to organise support acts. Ms Derway says: \\"More and more artists want to get involved. \\"Cruises are a great way for artists to interact with their fans in a much more intimate environment, and collaborate with each other. \\"In terms of the cost for a fan, they pay a set fee, and then pretty much everything is free except for alcohol and soda. All the food is included unless someone wants to pay for more speciality dining.\\" She adds: \\"Lots of people really hesitate to do the whole cruise thing, there is still a bit of a stigma attached, but you can really connect with people who are passionate about the same things as you are.\\" While the music cruise industry is very much based in the US, themed cruises are also a growing phenomenon on the other side of the Atlantic. Mike Bugsgang, chief executive of the UK-based Association of Group Travel Organisers, says there has been a big rise in the number of cruises that include visits to locations that have featured in well-known movies. One such cruise organised by Fred Olsen Cruise Lines is called \\"UK Scenes from the Silver Screen\\". Sailing around the UK and Ireland, the itinerary includes trips to settings from TV series Game of Thrones and the Harry Potter movies. Back in the US, Kiss' Gene Simmons doesn't just have to prepare for performing live on the Kiss Kruise, he also has to brush up on his wedding officiating. An on-board extra for Kiss' hard-partying fans is the chance to splice more than just the mainbrace. They can tie the marital knot, with Mr Simmons or a fellow band member performing the service. But one thing a Kiss Kruise is not is restful. As Mr Simmons admits: \\"It's tough to get to sleep on the cruises... it is fair to say, both the band and the fans are completely exhausted once we leave the cruise.\\"","completion":"Themed cruises, aimed at passengers with specific interests, are experiencing exponential growth and transforming the cruise line industry.

Article: Owls are some of the world's greatest hunters. From head to feet, owls' bodies are built to hunt. Scientists are studying all the things that make owls such great hunters. Most owls hunt at night. The birds have excellent hearing, which helps them find their next meal in the dark. Owls have one ear that is larger and set higher than the other. When an owl hears a sound, it listens closely. Is the sound lounder in its right ear or left ear? Does the upper or lower ear detect the sound first? The information helps the owl find the location of its prey without ever seeing it. Owls don't depend just on their hearing to hunt. After a sound draws an owl's attention, it zeroes in with sight. Many birds have eyes on either side of their heads. But an owl's eyes face forward, like a person's. Images from each eye combine to form a 3-D picture, similar to how we see. That helps owls better judge a prey's size, distance, and speed. An owl's eyes are so large that they can gather lots of light. That helps the owl see better when hunting at night. An owl's eyes are also fixed in their sockets . It can't roll them like we can. Instead, an owl keeps prey in its sight by turning its head. Owls can move their beads nearly upside down and turn them 270 degrees around. Their necks have 14 vertebrae . That's twice as many neck bones as a person has. The blood vessels thread through holes in an owl's vertebrae. The researchers found that these holes are very large so that the extra space provides an air cushion that protects the vessels. Detecting prey is only the first step for owls. Next they must catch their meals. An owl can fly inches over your head and you can't hear anything. The secret to owls' silent flight is their feathers. Fine \\"hairs\\" cover the surface of an owl's wing feathers. And the feathers' edges have soft barbs . Together, they make the sound of air rushing over the owl's wings quieter and less clear. Question: The shortcoming of an owl's fixed eyes can be made up by its _ . Options: A: large head B: strong legs C: body size D: flexible neck A:","completion":"The shortcoming of an owl's fixed eyes can be made up by its flexible neck. This is because owls have the ability to turn their heads nearly upside down and rotate them 270 degrees around, thanks to their 14 vertebrae in their necks.

Dell closed plants that produced desktop computers for the North American market, including the Mort Topfer Manufacturing Center in Austin, Texas (original location) and Lebanon, Tennessee (opened in 1999) in 2008 and early 2009, respectively. The desktop production plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, received US280 million in incentives from the state and opened in 2005, but ceased operations in November 2010.

Born into a prominent and wealthy family on May 29, 1917, John Fitzgerald Kennedy was the second of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy's nine children. Joseph Kennedy, his father, was a well-known businessman and political figure, while his mother, Rose, was a socialite and philanthropist. Together, they created a nurturing environment that supported their children's education and development in various aspects of life. The Kennedy family, famous for their political and public service contributions, played an important role in shaping young John's interests and ambitions. Growing up in Brookline, Kennedy attended the Edward Devotion School and the Noble and Greenough Lower School, both located in the local area. The family lived in a Georgian-style mansion at 83 Beals Street from 1917 to 1920, and this house is now a National Historic Site known as the John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site. In 1927, when Kennedy was 10 years old, the family moved to a larger estate in the more affluent suburb of Riverdale in Bronx, New York. In New York, Kennedy briefly attended the private Riverdale Country School before transferring to the Catholic boys' school, Canterbury School, located in New Milford, Connecticut. After completing eighth grade there, Kennedy was sent to the prestigious Choate Rosemary Hall, a boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut, where he spent his high school years. While studying at Choate, Kennedy developed his interests in politics, history, and leadership and also faced some health challenges, including a diagnosis of the autoimmune disorder called Addison's disease. Upon graduation, Kennedy went on to attend three different higher education institutions, due to several reasons, including health and academics. These institutions were the London School of Economics, Princeton University, and eventually, Harvard University. It was at Harvard that he completed his undergraduate degree in international affairs and wrote his senior thesis, “Appeasement at Munich,” which later became the best-selling book “Why England Slept.” In addition to his academic pursuits, Kennedy's upbringing included a focus on physical fitness, athletic competitions, and outdoor activities like sailing and swimming. Spending summers at the large family estate in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, he and his siblings were encouraged to be highly competitive and to develop strong interpersonal skills. These experiences undoubtedly helped shape the resilient, charismatic leader that John F. Kennedy eventually became. In conclusion, while John F. Kennedy's upbringing took place across several locations within the United States and beyond, it was in Brookline, Massachusetts, where he spent his earliest years, and the Boston area remained an integral part of his life and personal identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Departures (Japanese: okuribito, Hepburn: Okuribito, \\"one who sends off\\") is a 2008 Japanese drama film directed by Yojiro Takita and starring Masahiro Motoki, Ryoko Hirosue, and Tsutomu Yamazaki. Loosely based on Coffinman, a memoir by Shinmon Aoki, the film follows a young man who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a nokanshi--a traditional Japanese ritual mortician. He is subjected to prejudice from those around him, including from his wife, because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death. Eventually he earns their respect and learns the importance of interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work. Japanese funerals are highly ritualized affairs which are generally--though not always--conducted in accordance with Buddhist rites. In preparation for the funeral, the body is washed and the orifices are blocked with cotton or gauze. The encoffining ritual (called nokan), as depicted in Departures, is rarely performed, and even then only in rural areas. This ceremony is not standardized, but generally involves professional morticians (Na Guan Shi , nokanshi) ritually preparing the body, dressing the dead in white, and sometimes applying make-up. The body is then put on dry ice in a casket, along with personal possessions and items necessary for the trip to the afterlife. Despite the importance of death rituals, in traditional Japanese culture the subject is considered unclean as everything related to death is thought to be a source of kegare (defilement). After coming into contact with the dead, individuals must cleanse themselves through purifying rituals. People who work closely with the dead, such as morticians, are thus considered unclean, and during the feudal era those whose work was related to death became burakumin (untouchables), forced to live in their own hamlets and discriminated against by wider society. Despite a cultural shift since the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the stigma of death still has considerable force within Japanese society, and discrimination against the untouchables has continued. Until 1972, most deaths were dealt with by families, funeral homes, or nokanshi. As of 2014, about 80% of deaths occur in hospitals, and preparation of the bodies is frequently done by hospital staff; in such cases, the family often does not see the body until the funeral. A 1998 survey found that 29.5% of the Japanese population believed in an afterlife, and a further 40% wanted to believe; belief was highest among the young. Belief in the existence of a soul (54%) and a connection between the worlds of the living and the dead (64.9%) was likewise common. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: what is the cultural background?","completion":"The cultural background of \\"Departures\\" is deeply rooted in traditional Japanese culture, where death and everything related to it is considered unclean or a source of kegare (defilement). This is evident in the fact that people who work closely with the dead, such as morticians, are often subjected to prejudice and discrimination.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What were the full names of the two people who were suspected of committing the murders in the Avenue Range Station massacre?, using the article: The Avenue Range Station massacre was the murder of a group of Aboriginal Australians by white settlers during the Australian frontier wars. It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi...., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","completion":"The full names of the two people who were suspected of committing the murders in the Avenue Range Station massacre are James Brown and his overseer, Eastwood. They were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Article:","completion":"**Impersonators Cause a Stir at Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony** As the world turned its gaze towards the Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Pyeongchang last Friday, a peculiar sight caught the attention of the audience and media alike. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un seemed to be in attendance. In reality, they were professional impersonators who sparked a commotion in the stands and were promptly escorted out by security. \\"We wanted to surprise everyone and bring world peace and then we’re being escorted out by security guards, which I think is really unfair,” said the Kim Jong Un impersonator, later identified as Howard. “Doesn’t everyone want peace?” The pair was mobbed by reporters, seeking reactions and insights into their unexpected presence. As commented humorously by the Los Angeles Times, this scrum of reporters proved that \\"reporters in other countries chase stupid stories, too.\\" Howard and his counterpart, Trump impersonator Dennis Alan, kept up their charade while interacting with the press. In character as Kim Jong Un, Howard claimed that he and the fake Trump were \\"getting along great\\" and expressed his belief that their real-life counterparts would feel the same if they ever meet. \\"Because in my opinion, they're pretty much the same person,\\" he stated. He even joked about their respective nuclear buttons, saying, “Both of our buttons are very big. We both agree on that, so there’s going to be peace.” Though briefly detained by security, the impersonators were allowed back to their seats after they proved they had legitimately purchased tickets for the ceremony. \\"We paid good money for it. We’re not thieves, you know. I can afford it. We’re rich,\\" said Howard, still portraying the North Korean leader. While their stunt might have been a lighthearted attempt to bring levity and promote peace, it highlighted the stark absence of official interaction between the US and North Korean delegations at the Olympic Games. Despite the ongoing tensions between North Korea and the US, the Olympics provided an opportunity for diplomacy and dialogue between North and South Korea, which marched together under one unified flag during the opening ceremony. It remains to be seen if the goodwill and cooperation displayed at the Winter Olympics will translate into lasting progress in inter-Korean relations, or if the impersonators’ momentary unity will be the only semblance of peace we will witness during these tumultuous times. Regardless, the memorable appearance of Howard and Dennis Alan at the opening ceremony has reminded the world of the importance of striving for peace and unity, even in the face of overwhelming opposition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To arrive in time to open his tiny store at 8:30, he needed to leave our apartment at 6:30. After all, he had to take a bus and then the subway. The last journey was a long walk through a neighborhood much of which was full of the smell of rubbish. I learned: it is very important to work. No excuse. When I was 12, I would, on some Saturdays, go to my father's store to help out. After helping set up the outside clothing display, for the rest of the day, I'd watch to make sure no one stole anything.

Help as much as you can. Question: In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

Premise: Los Angeles's closest mountain retreats are Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead, which lie east of the city less than two hours away. Hypothesis: Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead are the closest mountain resort near Los Angeles. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, let's first examine both the premise and the hypothesis closely. Premise: \\"Los Angeles's closest mountain retreats are Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead, which lie east of the city less than two hours away.\\" The premise states two key pieces of information: 1. Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead are the closest mountain retreats to Los Angeles. 2. These retreats are less than two hours away from the city and are located east of it. Hypothesis: \\"Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead are the closest mountain resort near Los Angeles.\\" This hypothesis suggests that Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead are the closest mountain resorts to Los Angeles, which aligns with the first piece of information mentioned in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis seems to be directly related to the information provided in the premise. Now, to analyze if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to determine if there is any discrepancy, contradiction, or missing information between the two statements. Upon close inspection, both the premise and the hypothesis convey the same core idea – that Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead are the closest mountain retreats/resorts to Los Angeles. There is no contradiction or information gap between the two statements. The only difference is in the wording used, wherein the premise uses \\"retreats\\" and the hypothesis prioritizes \\"resort.\\" However, it becomes apparent from the context that these terms are being used interchangeably and refer to the same locations – Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead. In conclusion, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, as it is directly supported by the information provided and maintains the same core idea about the proximity of these mountain retreats/resorts to Los Angeles. This assertion remains consistent between the premise and the hypothesis, and there is no discernible discrepancy, contradiction, or missing information."},{"prompt":"Choose from: 1). No. 2). Yes.

B). the same meaning.","completion":"B). the same meaning. The word \\"proficiency\\" essentially refers to a high degree of skill, competence, or expertise in a particular subject matter or field. In both phrases - \\"To attain (or to reach) proficiency\\" and \\"A test of proficiency in English\\" - proficiency carries the same meaning, albeit used in different contexts. In the first phrase, \\"To attain (or to reach) proficiency,\\" proficiency signifies the goal or skill level one aims to achieve in a certain area (it could be any field, not just limited to English). It implies that one works towards honing their skills and acquiring mastery or competence in a specific field or subject. In the second phrase, \\"A test of proficiency in English,\\" proficiency still means a high level of skill and competence, but it is applied specifically to the context of the English language. The phrase refers to an examination that evaluates one's English language skills, ultimately determining if the individual possesses a strong command of the language. While the contexts of the two phrases may be different - one is related to the broader idea of striving for excellence, while the other is focused on assessing language skills - the core meaning of \\"proficiency\\" remains the same in both instances: the ability to demonstrate a high level of skill, competence, or expertise in a particular subject or field."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This belief was central to his political philosophy, as evident in his famous work, \\"The Republic.\\" Plato's arguments on the ideal government began as a response to the political turmoil and moral decline of Athenian society during his lifetime. He sought to establish a government that would be ethical, wise, and just. Plato argued that a well-ordered, harmonious society could only be achieved if it were governed by individuals who had a deep understanding of abstract concepts like justice, goodness, and beauty. He believed that only philosophers possessed the necessary intellectual capacity and moral disposition to attain such an understanding. In \\"The Republic,\\" Plato introduces the idea of the Philosopher-King, ruling over his imagined utopian society called Kallipolis. He asserts that in order to create a just society, the rulers must be philosophers, as they possess knowledge of the Forms (ideal essences of things). Philosophers, in Plato's view, are those who love wisdom and have a desire for truth. They have the ability to see the \\"big picture,\\" which is crucial for enabling them to make moral, ethical, and rational decisions for the common good. According to Plato, philosopher-kings would be able to create and maintain a just society because they are guided by wisdom and rationality, rather than by personal or financial interests. They value knowledge and understand the true nature of reality, allowing them to make better-informed decisions that benefit the entire community. Furthermore, since philosopher-kings have no personal desires or motives, they would be less likely to become corrupt. Plato’s concept of the philosopher-king revolves around his Theory of Forms, which includes the notion that reality consists of two realms: the visible world of particulars, which we perceive with our senses, and the unchanging, eternal world of the Forms. It is the knowledge of the Forms that philosophers possess and the ordinary people lack. In the education system of Kallipolis, potential philosopher-kings would undergo a rigorous and extensive educational program, which would involve both intellectual and physical training. This program would ultimately serve to develop the philosopher's mind and character. Notably, the educational curriculum included subjects like mathematics, astronomy, dialectics, and physical education. After completing their education, the philosopher-kings would apply their acquired wisdom and leadership skills to govern society fairly and effectively. Although Plato's idea of philosophers running the government has been influential in the history of political thought, it has also been criticized. Critics argue that it is impractical and elitist, as it assumes that philosophers would be somehow immune to corruption and that their rule would be inherently superior. Additionally, there are concerns regarding the lack of representation and democratic values in such a system. In conclusion, it was Plato who believed that only philosophers should run the government, as they possessed the wisdom, intellectual capacity, and moral disposition required for effective and just governance. His ideal government, as portrayed in \\"The Republic,\\" is centered around the philosopher-king who would cultivate a harmonious and morally upright society, free from the instability and failings of its contemporaneous reality."},{"prompt":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Step 2: Linking heat, thermal energy, and related concepts Heat is the flow of thermal energy between two objects, and it flows from an area of higher temperature to an area of lower temperature. When heat is absorbed by an object, its thermal energy increases. Step 3: Analyzing the choices - Matter: The amount of matter in an object is related to its mass and volume, which generally don't change when heat is applied. - Speed: The speed of an object is not directly related to the flow of heat or increase in thermal energy. - Color: While some materials may change color when heated, this is not a universal effect, nor is it directly related to an increase in thermal energy. - Temperature: When an object gains thermal energy with the flow of heat, its temperature rises as the energy causes the particles to move faster and increase their kinetic energy.

Jones returns to his teaching position at Marshall College, where he is interviewed by two Army Intelligence agents. They inform him that the Nazis are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the University of Chicago. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant; the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra is the key to finding the Well of Souls, a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried. The agents authorize Jones to recover the Ark to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it. He travels to Nepal and discovers that Abner has died, and the headpiece is in the possession of Ravenwood's daughter Marion.

As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

Jimmy Answer:","completion":"Title: The Secrets of Shadow Street Genre: Mystery/Thriller Plot: Nicole Adams, a tenacious investigative reporter, is working in an enigmatic urban city plagued by a series of high-profile crimes conducted by a mysterious criminal syndicate known only as \\"The Umbra.\\" Despite the police's inability to solve these crimes, Nicole is determined to bring the truth behind these crimes to light. Little does she know that her close friend, Jimmy Haynes, is her informant, and holds secrets that could shake the very foundation of the city. The story begins with a grisly murder in a dark alley in the heart of the city. The victim has obvious ties to The Umbra, but nobody seems to have any information about their activities. Nicole, determined to expose the truth, begins her investigation. Her search for reliable information proves fruitless until she starts receiving anonymous tips on her personal phone. The informant, Jimmy, is revealed to be a childhood friend, who eventually developed a double life as a master hacker working with The Umbra. Feeling guilty, he decides to share insider information with Nicole, to save his city from devastation. Nicole, growing increasingly skeptical of the unknown identity of her informant, continues her investigation while unknowingly getting closer to unveiling the identity of her own trusted confidante. As their bond strengthens, Nicole and Jimmy face numerous dilemmas as she closes in on not only The Umbra but also the truth of her informant's identity. Confronted with the potential betrayal of a close friend, Nicole must weigh the value of her friendship against the need for justice for the victims of The Umbra's crimes. The climax of the story occurs when it is revealed that The Umbra's leader, a powerful and influential figure in the city, plans to bring chaos to the metropolis in a finale to their hidden reign of terror. With time running out, Jimmy must make a life-altering decision: reveal his secret to Nicole, and risk both their lives to bring down The Umbra, or forever live with the consequences of his actions. Together, Nicole and Jimmy, cornered by The Umbra's henchmen, face off against the syndicate, risking their lives to save their city and put an end to The Umbra's reign of terror once and for all. In the end, they succeed in their mission, but Jimmy's true identity is exposed. He must confront the consequences of his actions, while Nicole grapples with the reality that her closest ally was once her greatest nemesis. For some, the story ends with redemption when Jimmy faces trial and finally makes amends for his mistakes. For others, it is the tale of two friends willing to do whatever it takes to save their city, even at the cost of their own lives. And for still others, The Secrets of Shadow Street is a reminder that we all must bear the consequences of the choices we make, no matter how well-intentioned they may be."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Dreams are like stars .. you may never touch them but if you follow them they will lead you to your destiny. ||||| The four-minute video in Korean and English was credited to Destiny Pictures, but owner of firm with same name said he had ‘no involvement’ The National Security Council has said that it made the video Donald Trump showed to Kim Jong-un at their Singapore summit on Tuesday in an unorthodox effort to persuade him of the benefits of denuclearisation. The four-minute video in Korean and English was made in the style of an extended action movie trailer and portrayed Kim and Trump as men of destiny with the future of the world in their hands. The video, which Trump showed to the press after playing it on an iPad for Kim, is credited to “Destiny Pictures Productions”, prompting a flurry of press inquiries to a film production company of that name in California. 'The bromance of the century': Trump's bizarre trailer for his summit with Kim | Peter Bradshaw Read more Mark Castaldo, the company’s founder, said in an email it had “no involvement in the video”. “Woke up to 100’s of e-mails and calls from all over the world. Crazy” Castaldo said in a tweet, adding that he was trying to find out “why they used my company name”. Garrett Marquis, an NSC spokesman said in a statement: “The video was created by the National Security Council to help the president demonstrate the benefits of complete denuclearization, and a vision of a peaceful and prosperous Korean peninsula.” When asked about the decision to present the video as made by a non-existent company, an NSC spokesman said there would be no further comment. “From my understanding, they were just using ‘Destiny Pictures’ as a play on words. It just so happens there’s a studio by that name in California,” said Ned Price, a former NSC spokesman. “Leave it to this White House to fail to conduct basic due diligence. And that, of course, leaves aside the fact they thought it prudent to try to out-North-Korea North Korea in the propaganda department. “The whole enterprise reeks of amateurism and comes off as an attempt to check the box on a harebrained idea that presumably originated in the oval office,” Price added. The video shows the possibilities of North Korea’s future if it renounces nuclear weapons, with a rapid succession of colourful images of advanced technology and happy people. It contrasted that with an alternative reality in which the regime stayed on course with the development of its arsenal. That future was shown in grainy black and white images of US warplanes in the air and missiles launching. The choice between the two scenarios was Kim’s, the film implied. “A story about a special moment in time. When a man is presented with one chance that may never be repeated,” the narrator says. When asked about the film at a press conference on Tuesday, Trump defended it as a masterstroke which he had sprung on Kim and his entourage. “We had it made up,” the president said. “I showed it to them today. Actually during the meeting. Toward the end of the meeting. I think he loved it. “We had it on cassette. An iPad,” Trump said. “They played it. About eight of their representatives were watching it. I thought they were fascinated by it. I thought it was well done. I showed it to you because that is the future.” ||||| White House Just when you thought things couldn’t get any weirder, President Donald Trump today released a video about the future of U.S.-Korean relations that looks like a cross between a Michael Bay movie and a corporate infomercial. “It is cod spiritual gibberish,” wrote a columnist with the British newspaper, The Spectator, “But clearly, in some peculiar way, it works.” As cheesy as the video is, it’s precisely the vision of a high-energy planet that poor nations generally, and North Korea particularly, need right now. The video draws a striking contrast between the current, low-energy North Korea, and a future high-energy one. For decades, anti-nuclear environmentalists have insisted that there aren’t enough resources for all humans to live prosperous lives, while pro-nuclear environmentalists have pointed out that nuclear power allows for universal prosperity and a shrinking of humankind’s environmental footprint. Trump’s video clearly embraces the high-energy vision, even referencing population challenges. “Seven billion people inhabit planet Earth,” says the narrator over scenes of population-dense cities. The video presents a positive vision of all the things nuclear energy can power: an abundant grocery store; speedboats; incubators for babies; skyscrapers along a beach; robots in factories; and people being scanned inside of MRIs. ||||| “And I explained, I said, ‘You know, instead of doing that, you could have the best hotels in the world right there.’ Think of it from a real estate perspective.” Mark McKinnon, a seasoned political ad maker who ran media for President George W. Bush’s campaigns, said the video was “obviously quite shlocky” for a broader audience, but could be effective in influencing its intended target. “At bottom, it’s very good storytelling — something obviously Trump understands,” Mr. McKinnon said. Citing the former governor of Texas ousted by Mr. Bush, he added: “Ann Richards used to say, ‘Dumb it down so my mama can understand it.’ Or you know, so a foreign dictator can. Over all, a pretty creative and clever move.” But veteran diplomats and foreign policy scholars were warier. “I was speechless when I first saw it,” said Alexander R. Vershbow, who served as ambassador to South Korea under Mr. Bush. “Pure Trump with Hollywood production values, showing what Kim Jong-un and North Korea would be like if they make the fateful choice to trade in their nukes for economic prosperity.” Sung-Yoon Lee, a Korean studies professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, was even less impressed, calling it “eerily reminiscent of second-rate South Korean government promotional videos.” In fact, although the White House said it was made by the National Security Council, he said he instinctively suspected the South Koreans might have created it and gave it to Mr. Trump. “Will it have any impact?” he asked. “Most likely, this patronizing act will give Kim a good laugh. It may also irritate and, paradoxically, reassure him at the same time — in the knowledge that his two adversaries are utterly clueless.” Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said he thought it would fall flat. “I was gobsmacked by it,” he said. “It seems unlikely that a man who ruthlessly ordered the murder of his half brother with a nerve agent is likely to be beguiled by a film trailer and decide to abandon the nuclear-armed missiles that are a centerpiece of his propaganda.” ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"So, WARCZone is like a big box where people put special files called WARCs, which help save parts of the internet.

Write an article based on this summary: Two Chinese citizens have been killed and another wounded in a suspected bomb attack in Laos, say Chinese state media.","completion":"Title: Suspected Bomb Attack in Laos Results in the Death of Two Chinese Citizens and Leaves a Third Wounded Introduction In recent news, a suspected bomb attack occurred in Laos, claiming the lives of two Chinese citizens, while leaving another wounded, according to the Chinese state media. This incident highlights the escalating tensions in the region and has prompted concerns among safety and security experts. This article examines the details and possible implications of this tragic event as well as the impact it may have on the fragile relations between China and Laos. The Incident The unfortunate event took place near the Lao-Vietnamese border, a popular destination among Chinese tourists. According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, the attack unfolded when a group of Chinese citizens traveling in a minibus were targeted in an explosion. A preliminary investigation by local authorities in Laos suggests that the bomb was planted along the roadside and was remotely detonated. The victims of the attack have been identified as Chinese nationals, highlighting potential motivations for this crime. The injured individual was transported to a nearby clinic, where they received emergency medical treatment. Their condition is stable but remains under observation. Reaction and Impact on China-Laos Relations The Chinese government has expressed concern over the safety of Chinese nationals living and traveling in Laos. Officials from both the Chinese embassy in Laos and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs have called for a thorough investigation into the attack and requested full cooperation from the Lao authorities. This call for action underscores the significance of the incident and its potential ramifications on China’s ties with Laos, a country heavily dependent on China for investment and infrastructure support. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through its spokesperson, urged the Laotian government to take effective measures to ensure the security of Chinese citizens and their assets in the country. While there have not been any explicit accusations against the Lao government, it goes without saying that failure to act could strain the China-Laos relationship. The Lao government has condemned the attack and extended its condolences to the Chinese government and the families of the victims. Laos authorities have assured China of their full cooperation with the investigation, in a bid to bring the perpetrators to justice. Possible Motives The motive behind the suspected bomb attack remains unclear, as no group has claimed responsibility so far. However, some speculations exist that conflict or disagreements arising from China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investments could have played a role in the incident. Laos is a key partner of China's BRI projects in Southeast Asia, primarily in terms of infrastructure development. Consequently, there are concerns that local unrest or dissatisfaction could have spurred this attack to undermine China's position in Laos. Additionally, ethnic and political tensions continue to exist in the border regions of Laos, which is further exemplified by a history of sporadic violence. This situation could contribute to the involvement of a group or groups with specific local grievances, aiming to send a message either to China or the Lao government. Conclusion The recent suspected bomb attack that claimed the lives of two Chinese citizens and injured another puts further strain on the relations between China and Laos. While the motive behind the attack remains unclear, it has succeeded in conveying an alarming message prompting both governments to act urgently to ensure the security of Chinese nationals in Laos. As the investigation progresses, it is crucial for China and Laos to cooperate closely in order to identify the perpetrators and maintain the delicate balance in their relations. This incident is a reminder that regional security tensions require constant vigilance by all relevant stakeholders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Would \\"This was one of the most controversial acts of the 1850 compromise and heightened Northern fears of a \\" slave power conspiracy\\".\\" be a reasonable answer? Choices: 1. No; 2. Yes; The answer is:","completion":"2. Yes; The Fugitive Slave Law, also known as the Fugitive Slave Act, was passed by the United States Congress and enacted as part of the Compromise of 1850. The primary goal of this law was to address the issue of runaway slaves by requiring their return to their owners in the South. It was one of the most controversial acts of the 1850 compromise and indeed heightened Northern fears of a \\"slave power conspiracy.\\" The Compromise of 1850 was a set of five bills that aimed to resolve the sectional conflict between the Northern and Southern states. This conflict had arisen in the aftermath of the Mexican-American War, as new territories were acquired, and disputes arose over their status as slave or free states. The Fugitive Slave Act was enacted as one of the five component bills of the Compromise to address this matter. The Fugitive Slave Act made it a federal offense for individuals to assist or harbor escaped slaves, and it mandated that state and federal officials aid in the capture and return of these slaves to their owners. In addition, the law provided for the use of federal commissioners to adjudicate claims of fugitive slaves, without the right of these alleged escapees to a trial by jury or the presentation of any evidence on their own behalf. The Northern states, which were generally opposed to slavery, found the Fugitive Slave Act particularly onerous. Abolitionists, including groups such as the Underground Railroad, had long been assisting slaves in their escape and relocation to the free states or Canada, and this law effectively forced them to violate their moral convictions in order to avoid prosecution. This situation only served to further polarize the country, leading to an increase in tension between the North and the South. In this context, it is entirely reasonable to say that the Fugitive Slave Act was one of the most controversial acts of the 1850 compromise and heightened Northern fears of a \\"slave power conspiracy.\\" The passage of the law, as well as its subsequent enforcement, generated widespread uproar in the North and fueled a growing divide between the two regions, which would eventually contribute to the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"Title: \\"A Disappointing Experience - 1/5 Stars\\" As a long-time avid reader, I was excited to try out the at.tomtasche.reader app. However, despite its promising premise, it turned out to be one monumental blunder rather than functional utility. The following points elucidate why I'm leaving a 1-star rating: 1. User Interface and Navigation: The primary letdown was the app's user interface and navigation. The layout was confusing, with various buttons congested on the screen without proper labeling. I struggled to find basic options like \\"Open File\\" and \\"Search.\\" The color scheme and font choices were anything but appealing, making the reading experience aesthetically displeasing. 2. File Compatibility and Handling: As someone with a diverse e-library, I was sorely disappointed to discover that the app only supports PDF files. In this era, an e-reader should be capable of opening multiple file formats like EPUB, MOBI, and even DOCX. Additionally, the app struggled to read large files and constantly crashed on numerous instances. 3. Performance and Stability: The at.tomtasche.reader app was nowhere near what I'd hoped it would be in terms of performance. Pages took an unbearably long time to load, and scrolling was far from smooth. Frequent crashes during usage heightened my frustration, leading me to question whether it was even optimized for devices or not. 4. Lack of Features: This e-reader lacks essential features that are standard on competitor apps. There's no option to adjust font size or type, nor can users modify the background color for a more comfortable reading experience. Even basic functionalities like bookmarking and searching are either unavailable or too hard to find. 5. Customer Support and Updates: After facing numerous problems with this app, I tried reaching out to customer support expecting prompt assistance. Alas, my queries remained unanswered for an unreasonably long time. It is apparent that customer satisfaction isn't high on their list of priorities. The app has also not received updates to address existing issues, which only solidifies my discontentment. Ultimately, my experience with at.tomtasche.reader was an exasperating one. It's apparent that the development team lacks effort and intention to create an enjoyable, functional e-reader app. With so many competitors in the market, it's hard to justify using this app, let alone recommending it to others.

Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation -93*m and 266*m are like terms, so we add them together: (-93 + 266) * m + 16325 = -480*m 173 * m + 16325 = -480 * m Step 2: Move the terms with m to one side of the equation and constants to the other side Now, we want to move the -480*m term to the left side of the equation. To do this, we can add 480*m to both sides of the equation: 173*m + 480*m + 16325 = -480*m + 480*m 653*m + 16325 = 0 Step 3: Move the constant term to the right side We want to isolate the m term, so we need to move the constant term 16325 to the right side of the equation. We can accomplish this by subtracting 16325 from both sides of the equation: 653*m + 16325 - 16325 = 0 -16325 653*m = -16325 Step 4: Solve for m Now, we have an equation with only one term containing m.

It was so named by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey , following their survey of 1948 -- 49 , because of the continuous avalanches from the hanging glaciers above the corrie . - Coronation Island is the largest of the South Orkney Islands, long and from wide. The island extends in a general east-west direction, is mainly ice-covered and comprises numerous bays, glaciers and peaks, the highest rising to . - The South Orkney Islands are a group of islands in the Southern Ocean, about north-east of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. They have a total area of about . The islands are claimed both by Britain (as part of the British Antarctic Territory since 1962, previously as a Falkland Islands Dependency), and by Argentina as part of Argentine Antarctica. Under the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, sovereignty claims are held in abeyance. - Snowpack forms from layers of snow that accumulate in geographic regions and high altitudes where the climate includes cold weather for extended periods during the year. Snowpacks are an important water resource that feed streams and rivers as they melt. Therefore, snowpacks are both the drinking water source for many communities and a potential source of flooding (in case of sudden melting). Snowpacks also contribute mass to glaciers in their accumulation zone. - In fluid dynamics, a gravity current is a primarily horizontal flow in a gravitational field that is driven by a density difference, hence gravity currents also sometimes being referred to as \\"density currents\\". When a gravity current propagates along a plane of neutral buoyancy within a stratified ambient fluid, it is known as a Gravity Current Intrusion. Typically, the density difference is small enough for the Boussinesq approximation to be valid. Gravity currents can be either finite in volume, such as the release from a dam break, or continuously supplied from a source, such as in doorway or lava flows. - An amphitheatre or amphitheater is an open-air venue used for entertainment, performances, and sports. The term derives from the ancient Greek (\\"amphitheatron\\"), from (\\"amphi\\"), meaning \\"on both sides\\" or \\"around\\" and (\\"thétron\\"), meaning \\"place for viewing\\". - Snow pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when it precipitates from clouds and accumulates on surfaces, then metamorphoses in place, and ultimately melts, slides or sublimates away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts, seasonally, and causes runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater. - The Antarctic Peninsula is the northernmost part of the mainland of Antarctica, located at the base of the Southern Hemisphere. At the surface, it is the biggest, most prominent peninsula in Antarctica as it extends from a line between Cape Adams (Weddell Sea) and a point on the mainland south of Eklund Islands. Beneath the ice sheet which covers it, the Antarctic Peninsula consists of a string of bedrock islands; these are separated by deep channels whose bottoms lie at depths considerably below current sea level. They are joined together by a grounded ice sheet. Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of South America, lies only about away across the Drake Passage. - In earth science, erosion is the action of surface processes (such as water flow or wind) that remove soil, rock, or dissolved material from one location on the Earth's crust, then transport it away to another location. The particulate breakdown of rock or soil into clastic sediment is referred to as \\"physical\\" or \\"mechanical\\" erosion; this contrasts with \\"chemical\\" erosion, where soil or rock material is removed from an area by its dissolving into a solvent (typically water), followed by the flow away of that solution. Eroded sediment or solutes may be transported just a few millimetres, or for thousands of kilometres. - The British Antarctic Territory (BAT) is a sector of Antarctica claimed by the United Kingdom as one of its 14 British Overseas Territories, and is the largest. It comprises the region south of 60°S latitude and between longitudes and , forming a wedge shape that extends to the South Pole, overlapping the Antarctic claims of Argentina (Argentine Antarctica) and Chile (Chilean Antarctic Territory). - A valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it. - A cauldron (or caldron) is a large metal pot (kettle) for cooking and/or boiling over an open fire, with a large mouth and frequently with an arc-shaped hanger. - The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean or the Austral Ocean, comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica. As such, it is regarded as the fourth-largest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean. This ocean zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters. - An avalanche (also called a snowslide or snowslip) is a rapid flow of snow down a sloping surface. Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical failure in the snowpack (slab avalanche) when the forces on the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening (loose snow avalanche). After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they entrain more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which is a type of gravity current. - Argentine Antarctica is a sector of Antarctica claimed by Argentina as part of its national territory consisting of the Antarctic Peninsula and a triangular section extending to the South Pole, delimited by the 25° West and 74° West meridians and the 60° South parallel. This region overlaps with British and Chilean claims in Antarctica; however, all claims are suspended by the Antarctic Treaty System, of which Argentina is a founding signatory and permanent consulting member, with the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat being based in Buenos Aires. - Orkney, also known as the Orkney Islands, is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, situated off the north coast of Great Britain. Orkney is 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of the coast of Caithness and comprises approximately 70 islands, of which 20 are inhabited. The largest island Mainland is often referred to as \\"the Mainland\\". It has an area of , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles. The largest settlement and administrative centre is Kirkwall. - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula. - Fluvial is a term used in geography and geology to refer to the processes associated with rivers and streams and the deposits and landforms created by them. When the stream or rivers are associated with glaciers, ice sheets, or ice caps, the term glaciofluvial or fluvioglacial is used. - A cirque (French, from the Latin word \\"circus\\") is an amphitheatre-like valley formed by glacial erosion. Alternative names for this landform are corrie (from Scottish Gaelic \\"coire\\" meaning a pot or cauldron) and cwm (Welsh for \\"valley\\", pronounced \\"coom\\"). A cirque may also be a similarly shaped landform arising from fluvial erosion. What is the relationship between 'avalanche corrie' and 'landform'? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Avalanche Corrie is a specific type of landform. It is an ice-filled cirque, or corrie, located near the south coast of Coronation Island in the South Orkney Islands. This landform got its name due to the continuous avalanches from the hanging glaciers above the corrie. A landform, in general, refers to any natural feature on the Earth's surface, such as mountains, valleys, or plateaus. In this case, the Avalanche Corrie is a landform shaped primarily by glacial erosion and the continuous avalanches it experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It frustrated Randy that Joel would oversleep so often but","completion":"it was a situation that he'd come to accept after months of dealing with his roommate's tardiness. They had been friends since grade school, and despite the flaws Randy saw in his friend, there was also a loyalty that couldn't be shaken. However, when they decided to become roommates for their college years, Randy had no idea how much of an impact Joel's habit would have on their daily lives. Randy began to analyze the root of the problem. He had noticed, on multiple occasions, that Joel had a penchant for staying up late. Whether it was finishing an assignment at the eleventh hour, binge-watching a series or playing video games until the early hours of the morning, Randy realized that Joel was operating under an unhealthy cycle of sleep deprivation. This, in turn, made it difficult for him to wake up on time, leaving Randy to fill in the blanks when it came to dividing shared responsibilities. Over time, the frustrations began to wear on both of them. Joel knew that his actions were impacting his friend and roommate, but he couldn't seem to break the habit. Time and time again, Randy would attempt to discuss the issue with Joel, offering suggestions on how to improve his sleeps schedule, such as setting multiple alarms, using innovative sleep aid apps or adjusting his bedtime routine. Despite his supportive efforts, nothing seemed to change. Randy began to feel the weight of his friend's bemusement on his own life. Their friendship, once filled with laughter and camaraderie, started taking a toll as their interactions became increasingly centered around the issue of oversleeping. Late-night study sessions would inevitably devolve into arguments, and shared meals became less and less frequent as the tension grew between them. Eventually, Randy realized that he could not bear the growing resentment that was building between them. He didn't want to risk losing a lifelong friendship over Joel's tardiness. As difficult as it was for him to accept, Randy began looking for new ways to get a handle on the situation. One day, Randy happened upon an article about coexistence and tolerance. He took the time to introspect and reassess his understanding of his friend's struggle. It dawned on him that perhaps there was more to Joel's problem than just a refusal to change his habits. He knew how much Joel valued their friendship, and it was unlikely that Joel would willingly jeopardize it. Determined to salvage their bond, Randy broached the subject with Joel in a more empathetic manner. He approached the conversation with an open mind and a willingness to truly understand what factors were playing a role in his friend's struggle. For the first time in months, they sat down and discussed the matter without anger. To Randy's surprise, Joel opened up about his anxieties and how they were affecting his sleep. These were factors Randy had never considered before, and he couldn't help but feel a renewed sense of compassion for his friend. Together, they began to work on a plan to improve Joel's sleep schedule and cope with his anxieties. It was a slow process, with occasional setbacks. But as time went on, they found ways to compromise and help each other. Patience and understanding replaced frustration, and their friendship began to flourish once again. It frustrated Randy that Joel would oversleep so often, but as they worked through the issue together, he discovered the value of empathy and the importance of unwavering support. Not only did they grow stronger as individuals, but their bond as friends became unshakable - a testament to the power of facing life's challenges with mutual care and understanding."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"Was Origin published sooner in Swedish or Italian?\\" Context: \\"The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Royal Swedish Ballet offers an innovative ‘Juliet and Romeo’: One for today There are few tragedies more haunting than the death of innocents, as Shakespeare, Euripides and the daily news remind us. One of the best known of these tragedies gains new power through a moving and boldly original treatment. “Juliet and Romeo” is Swedish choreographer Mats Ek’s version of the ill-fated lovers’ tale, told in a way that honors its Renaissance source while tying it directly to today’s world. The Royal Swedish Ballet gave this 2013 work its North American premiere on Wednesday at the Kennedy Center Opera House. Ek’s ballet has little in common with those heavily draped and chandeliered productions of the Shakespeare story that most balletgoers know. Ek’s characters look pretty much like us, in their slacks, skirts and ponytails. There are no pointe shoes. The teenage boys behave like teenage boys, goofing around and punching each other. It is always night here. The set has a stripped-down look, with a smoky, shadowy stage and forbidding walls that bring to mind cities under siege. This could be modern-day Syria or Iraq, or a U.S. town in crisis. The Capulets patrol their turf on Segways, with the rigid bearing that we instantly recognize as policelike. The music is not the familiar Prokofiev, but Tchaikovsky. In a previous conversation, Ek told me he found that Tchaikovsky evoked young love beautifully, though there wasn’t much in the way of true violence and aggression in his music. Ek needed the violence, too, but love was most important. He chose his excerpts well, and they were splendidly performed by the Opera House Orchestra. Ek took his flip-flopped title from an early short story, “Giulietta e Romeo,” which was probably one of Shakespeare’s sources. Having given his heroine top billing, he also gave her moxie and strength. Again and again it is Juliet who takes the most decisive action and who stands up to her parents. In this austere world, Mariko Kida’s Juliet is the lone bright spot. We first see her wearing yellow, hopping about like a puppy and teasing her Nurse. Ana Laguna, the extraordinarily expressive dancer who is Ek’s longtime muse (and wife), gave the role of the Nurse a grounded moral force. Throughout the ballet she is a witness to the key moments, often peering from the shadows. In her 60s, with her long gray hair in a thick braid, she is also a vigorous and deeply musical member of the cast, matching the bounding Mercutio and Benvolio, for instance, step for step. Her presence highlighted one of the many glories of this company and this production: Not everyone looks alike. There are dancers of varying ages, sizes (Jerome Marchand’s Mercutio towers over Jokuto Kodam’s Benvolio) and backgrounds, with some more trained in ballet, others in modern dance. It takes time to adjust our ears when we’re at a Shakespeare play, and in the same way, it may take a short while to feel engaged by Ek’s unique physical expression: the long, stretched-out lunges, the blown-back torsos and moments when everyone rolls on the floor. It is Ek’s genius, however, that his weighted, earthy, unusual moves arouse vivid emotions. When Mercutio, Benvolio and Anthony Lomuljo’s sweet Romeo are messing around, you ache for them. Especially the big, tattooed Mercutio, who roughly pushes the other two away, yet also yearns for their company. An unnameable change is in the air — we see how the boys sense it, in their intentionally awkward, artless responses to the music, in the way they link arms and take comfort in being together. The giddy beauty of young love is Ek’s high achievement here, but so is the ugliness of hatred, which Ek depicts with equal inventiveness and immediacy. It’s easy, therefore, to link this ballet with what’s going on in today’s world. Age-old frictions and factions continue to tear loved ones apart: The same day that “Juliet and Romeo” opened at the Kennedy Center, this newspaper’s front page told the story of an Israeli woman fatally knifed in her kitchen by a teenage Palestinian boy. Both her family and his spoke poignantly of their grief, confusion and loneliness in the aftermath. That Ek’s ballet seems to anticipate, respond to and add more layers to such heartbreaking violence speaks to his masterful command. How acutely he communicates something real in the make-believe world of the stage. In fact, his art draws us in not by making us believe, but by making us feel. By expressing the yearning, resistance, helplessness — and the hopefulness — of love. Hope is Ek’s coda, as it was Shakespeare’s, and as it must be ours, too. The Royal Swedish Ballet performs “Juliet and Romeo,” by Mats Ek, in the Kennedy Center Opera House through Saturday. Tickets: 29-129. 202-467-4600 or kennedy-center.org. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about a special ballet performance called \\"Juliet and Romeo\\". It is performed by the Royal Swedish Ballet and it is a new version of the famous love story of Romeo and Juliet. The ballet has a modern look and feel to it, with the characters wearing everyday clothes and dancing in a way that looks like real life. The story is still about love and tragedy, but it is shown in a way that connects to the world we live in today.

The following points can help explain why this perception is derived from the text: 1. Word choice: The use of words like \\"bloated\\" and \\"stretches\\" in the sentence indicates that the plot of the story or movie is being criticized for being unnecessarily long and possibly unwarranted. These words evoke a sense of excess, which is often considered as a negative trait. 2. The comparison of running time: Mentioning that the running time is stretched about 10 minutes longer than it should be suggests that the plot is excessive and could have been more concise. This indicates dissatisfaction with the way the story has been structured or paced, and therefore adds to the negative perception of the sentiment. 3. Implication of wasted time: By pointing out the additional 10 minutes of running time, the sentence implies that the extra length does not contribute to the overall quality of the story. This can be perceived as a criticism, meaning that the time spent watching or listening to the story may have been wasted or not well-utilized. 4. Lack of praise or positive descriptions: The sentence does not offer any positive or complimentary feedback on the plot. As it is solely focused on the negative aspects, the sentiment is more likely to be perceived negatively. Overall, the sentiment in this sentence can be considered as negative, as it critiques the plot of a story or movie for being excessively long and potentially wasteful. The word choice and implications in the text contribute to this perception and make it evident that the author does not deem the additional running time as valuable or worthwhile."},{"prompt":"Information: - The Gesta comitum Barcinonensium et regum Aragoniae ( \`\` Deeds of the counts of Barcelona and kings of Aragon '' ) is a Latin chronicle composed in three stages by some monks of Santa Maria de Ripoll and recounting the reigns of the Counts of Barcelona from Wifred I ( 878 -- 97 ) to James II ( 1291 -- 1327 ) , as late as 1299 . It is the fawning history of the dynasty known as the House of Barcelona . In presenting the rulers of the county of Barcelona as the descendants of Charlemagne , the monks sought to justify their independent policy with respect to the King of France , their nominal sovereign . The Gesta is the chronological backbone . The first composition was made between 1162 and 1184 and ended with the reign of Raymond Berengar IV ( 1131 -- 62 ) . In the late thirteenth century it was continued through the reign of James I ( 1213 -- 76 ) . An abridged version in the Catalan language was produced sometime between 1268 and 1283 . The final Latin version was edited in 1303 -- 14 and included the reigns of Peter the Great ( 1276 -- 87 ) , Alfonso the Generous ( 1287 -- 91 ) , and James II. Except for the first composition , all surviving versions are later copies , today preserved in the Arxiu de la Corona d'Aragó , in the Biblioteca de Catalunya , and in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France . A copy of one of the latter was taken to France by Pierre de Marca and published in 1688 by Étienne Baluze . - The Kingdom of Aragon (, ) was a medieval and early modern kingdom on the Iberian Peninsula, corresponding to the modern-day autonomous community of Aragon, in Spain. It should not be confused with the larger Crown of Aragon, that also included other territories the Principality of Catalonia (which included the County of Barcelona and the other Catalan Counties), the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, and other possessions that are now part of France, Italy, and Greece that were also under the rule of the King of Aragon, but were administered separately from the Kingdom of Aragon. - Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier. - The House of Barcelona was a medieval dynasty that ruled the County of Barcelona continuously from 878 and the Crown of Aragon from 1137 (as kings from 1162). From the male part they descend from the Bellonids, the descendants of Wifred the Hairy. They inherited most of the Catalan counties by the thirteenth century and established a territorial Principality of Catalonia, uniting it with the Kingdom of Aragon through marriage and conquering numerous other lands and kingdoms until the death of the last legitimate male of the main branch, Martin the Humanist, in 1410. Cadet branches of the house continued to rule Urgell (since 992) and Gandia. Cadet branches of the dynasty had also ruled Ausona intermittently from 878 until 1111, Provence from 1112 to 1245, and Sicily from 1282 to 1409. By the Compromise of Caspe of 1412 the Crown of Aragon passed to a branch of the House of Trastámara, descended from the \\"infanta\\" Eleanor of the house of Barcelona. - A dynasty is a sequence of rulers from the same family, usually in the context of a feudal or monarchical system but sometimes also appearing in elective republics. The dynastic family or lineage may be known as a \\"house\\"; which may be styled \\"royal\\", \\"princely\\", \\"comital\\", etc., depending upon the chief or present title borne by its members. Historians periodize the histories of many sovereign states, such as Ancient Egypt, the Carolingian Empire and Imperial China, using a framework of successive dynasties. As such, the term \\"dynasty\\" may be used to delimit the era during which the family reigned and to describe events, trends, and artifacts of that period (\\"a Ming-dynasty vase\\"). The word \\"dynasty\\" itself is often dropped from such adjectival references (\\"a Ming vase\\"). - Provence (Provençal: \\"Provença\\" in classical norm or \\"Prouvènço\\" in Mistralian norm) is a geographical region and historical province of southeastern France, which extends from the left bank of the lower Rhône River to the west to the Italian border to the east, and is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the south. It largely corresponds with the modern administrative \\"région\\" of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, and includes the \\"départements\\" of Var, Bouches-du-Rhône, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and parts of Alpes-Maritimes and Vaucluse. The largest city of the region is Marseille. - The Principality of Catalonia, is a historic territory and a medieval and early modern political entity in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula, mostly in Spain, with an adjoining portion in southern France. Between the 13th and the 18th centuries it was bordered by the Kingdom of Aragon to the west, the Kingdom of Valencia to the south, the Kingdom of France and the feudal lordship of Andorra to the north and by the Mediterranean sea to the east. - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire. - The County of Barcelona was originally a frontier region under the rule of the Carolingian dynasty. By the end of the 10th century, the Counts of Barcelona were \\"de facto\\" independent, hereditary rulers in constant warfare with the Islamic caliphate of Córdoba and its successor states. The counts, through marriage alliances and treaties, acquired the other Catalan counties and extended their influence along Occitania. Barcelona formed the nucleus of the emergent Principality of Catalonia. In 1164, the count of Barcelona, Alfons I, inherited the Kingdom of Aragon (as Alfonso II). Thenceforward, the history of the county of Barcelona is subsumed within that of the Crown of Aragon, but the city of Barcelona remained preeminent within it. - An era is a span of time marked by character, events, changes on earth, etc. When used in science, for example geology, an \\"era\\" denotes a clearly defined period of time of arbitrary but well-defined length, such as for example the Mesozoic Era frozen m 252 Ma66 Ma, delimited by a start event and an end event. When used in social history, eras may for example denote a period of some monarch's reign. In colloquial language, eras denote longer spans of time, before and after which the practices or fashions change to a significant degree. When era is extended to a calendar system, it is known as a calendar era. In Sanskrit or Indian culture eras are known as yugas. - Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Occitania (, , , , also sometimes lo País d'Òc, \\"the Oc Country\\") is the historical region in southern Europe where Occitan was historically the main language spoken, and where it is sometimes still used, for the most part as a second language. This cultural area roughly encompasses the southern half of France, as well as Monaco and smaller parts of Italy (Occitan Valleys, Guardia Piemontese) and Spain (Aran Valley). Occitania has been recognized as a linguistic and cultural concept since the Middle Ages, but has never been a legal nor a political entity under this name, although the territory was united in Roman times as the \\"Seven Provinces\\" and in the early Middle Ages (\\"Aquitanica\\" or the Visigothic Kingdom of Toulouse) before the French conquest started in the early 13th century. Currently about 200,000800,000 people out of 16 million living in the area are either native or proficient speakers of Occitan, although the languages more usually spoken in the area are French, Italian, Catalan and Spanish. Since 2006, the Occitan language has been an official language of Catalonia, which includes the Aran Valley where Occitan gained official status in 1990. - A prince is a male ruler, monarch, or member of a monarch's or former monarch's family. \\"Prince\\" is also a hereditary title in the nobility of some European states. The feminine equivalent is a princess. The English word derives, via the French word \\"prince\\", from the Latin noun \\"princeps\\", from \\"primus\\" (first) + \\"capio\\" (to seize), meaning \\"the chief, most distinguished, ruler, prince\\". - The House of Trastámara was a dynasty of kings in Spain , which first governed in Castile beginning in 1369 before expanding its rule into Aragón, Navarre and Naples. They were an illegitimate cadet line of the House of Ivrea. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - The Catalan counties were the administrative divisions of the eastern Carolingian \\"Marca Hispanica\\" and southernmost part of the March of Gothia created after its Frankish conquest. The various counties roughly defined what came to be known as the Principality of Catalonia. - The Bellonids, sometimes called the Bellonid Dynasty, were the counts descendant of the Goth Belló who ruled in Carcassonne, Urgell, Cerdanya, County of Conflent, Barcelona, and numerous other Catalan and Septimanian counties and marches in the 9th and 10th centuries. His most famous grandson was Wilfred the Hairy, who founded the House of Barcelona, rulers of the County of Barcelona from 878, and since 1164 the Crown of Aragon, until the end of the reign of Martin the Humane in 1410. - The Low Countries is a coastal region in western Europe, consisting especially of the Netherlands and Belgium, and the low-lying delta of the Rhine, Meuse, Scheldt, and Ems rivers where much of the land is at or below sea level. This wide area of Western Europe roughly stretches from French Gravelines and Dunkirk at its southwestern point, to the area of Dutch Delfzijl and German Eastern Frisia at its northeastern point, and to Luxembourg and French Thionville in the southeast. - A chronicle (from Greek , from , \\"chronos\\", \\"time\\") is a historical account of facts and events ranged in chronological order, as in a time line. Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. This is in contrast to a narrative or history, which sets selected events in a meaningful interpretive context and excludes those the author does not see as important. - The Carolingian dynasty (known variously as the Carlovingians, Carolingus, Carolings or Karlings) was a Frankish noble family with origins in the Arnulfing and Pippinid clans of the 7th century AD. The name \\"Carolingian\\" (Medieval Latin \\"karolingi\\", an altered form of an unattested Old High German word *\\"karling, kerling\\", meaning \\"descendant of Charles\\", cf. MHG \\"kerlinc\\") derives from the Latinised name of Charles Martel: \\"Carolus\\". The dynasty consolidated its power in the mid 8th century, eventually making the offices of mayor of the palace and \\"dux et princeps Francorum\\" hereditary, and becoming the \\"de facto\\" rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the Merovingian throne. In 751 the Merovingian dynasty, which had ruled the Germanic Franks was overthrown with the consent of the Papacy and the aristocracy, and a Carolingian Pepin the Short was crowned King of the Franks. The Carolingian dynasty reached its peak in 800 with the crowning of Charlemagne as the first Emperor of Romans in over three centuries. His death in 814 began an extended period of fragmentation of the Carolingian empire and decline that would eventually lead to the evolution of the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire. - The Crown of Aragon was a composite monarchy, also nowadays referred to as a confederation of individual polities or kingdoms ruled by one king, with a personal and dynastic union of the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona. At the height of its power in the 14th and 15th centuries, the Crown of Aragon was a thalassocracy (a state with primarily maritime realms) controlling a large portion of present-day eastern Spain, parts of what is now southern France, and a Mediterranean \\"empire\\" which included the Balearic Islands, Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, Southern Italy (from 1442) and parts of Greece (until 1388). The component realms of the Crown were not united politically except at the level of the king, who ruled over each autonomous polity according to its own laws, raising funds under each tax structure, dealing separately with each \\"Corts\\" or \\"Cortes\\". Put in contemporary terms, it has sometimes been considered that the different lands of the Crown of Aragon (mainly the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia and the Kingdom of Valencia) functioned more as a confederation than as a single kingdom. In this sense, the larger Crown of Aragon must not be confused with one of its constituent parts, the Kingdom of Aragon, from which it takes its name. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot).

Answer this question: who discovered that the nuclei of atoms contained neutrons that carries no charge??","completion":"The discovery of the neutron and the realization that it resides within the atomic nucleus are attributed to James Chadwick, a British physicist who made this groundbreaking discovery in 1932. The journey towards this discovery, however, was preceded by numerous critical findings and collaborative efforts from other brilliant minds in the world of physics. Before diving into Chadwick's discovery, it is essential to understand the background and some earlier discoveries in atomic structure. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scientists made a series of significant breakthroughs that unraveled the mysteries of atomic structure. In 1897, the British physicist J.J. Thomson discovered the electron – a negatively charged subatomic particle. His work led to the development of the \\"plum pudding\\" model of the atom, which proposed that the atom consisted of negatively charged electrons dispersed in a positive \\"soup\\" much like plums in a Christmas pudding. This model was later challenged by the work of Ernest Rutherford, a physicist from New Zealand. Rutherford's famous Gold Foil Experiment (performed in 1909 with Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden) revealed that most of an atom's mass was concentrated in a central positive core, which he later termed the nucleus. This led to the conception of the \\"Rutherford model,\\" where electrons orbit the dense, positively charged nucleus, much like planets orbit the sun. Another critical figure in the story of the neutron is the Danish physicist Niels Bohr. Bohr's work built on Rutherford's atomic model, refining it by incorporating the principles of quantization and suggesting that electrons occupied specific energy levels around the nucleus. Despite these advancements in understanding the atom, the model could not explain the atomic mass discrepancies or the behavior of isotopes. The final piece of the puzzle came in 1932 when James Chadwick, a student of Rutherford, performed a series of experiments at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England. Chadwick hypothesized that the nucleus contained another neutral particle (neutron), which would account for the atomic mass disparity and the existence of isotopes. He reached this conclusion after studying the high-energy particle emission from radioactive decay. Chadwick observed that when beryllium was exposed to alpha particles, it emitted a stream of unidentified particles, which he called neutrons. In his experiments, Chadwick employed the radioactive substance polonium to emit alpha particles, which struck a beryllium target. The beryllium emitted the mysterious, high-energy particles, which then interacted with a paraffin wax, as it was thought that hydrogen nuclei would be useful in detecting the neutral particles thanks to their similar masses. As the particles passed through the wax, they caused protons to be ejected. The ejected protons’ energy was observed and measured, indicating that these emitted neutrons had no charge. Chadwick's discovery of the neutron was an essential milestone in atomic and nuclear physics. The identification of an uncharged particle residing in the atomic nucleus paved the way for many subsequent advancements, such as nuclear fission, the development of atomic weapons, and nuclear power generation. This discovery also contributed significantly to the development of modern atomic theory and understanding the behavior of isotopes, which are crucial in various fields, including biology, chemistry, medicine, and materials science."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After everyone has left and they are no closer to an answer, Annie realizes that one person did not come to the dinner, so Jackie pays a late-night visit to the only absentee: the reclusive Ned Devine (Jimmy Keogh). He finds Ned in his home in front of the TV, still holding the ticket in his hand, a smile on his face and dead from shock. That same night, Jackie has a dream that the deceased Ned wants to share the winnings with his friends, as he has no family to claim the ticket.

Gerard Brantsen was one of the Dutch signatories to the treaty ending a war that began in what year? The answer to this question is:","completion":"To answer this complex question, we must first examine the historical figure Gerard Brantsen and identify which war was ended with the treaty he signed. Gerard Brantsen (1735-1809) was a Dutch diplomat and politician in the 18th-19th century. His most significant contribution was to the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which marked the end of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War was a conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, and commenced on December 20, 1780. The war was primarily driven by commercial rivalries and political tensions that emerged from the American Revolutionary War. At this time, the Dutch Republic, in an attempt to protect their trade interests, sought to provide military assistance and resources to the newly established United States of America. This support of the rebellious colonies angered Great Britain and consequently led to the escalation of hostilities between the two European powers. The Treaty of Paris, which ended the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, was signed on September 3, 1783. The negotiations brought together the major powers involved in the American Revolutionary War. Delegates from the United States, France, Spain, and the Dutch Republic were present to deliberate the terms for reestablishing diplomatic relations and resolving territorial disputes. Gerard Brantsen, acting as one of the Dutch envoys, played a significant role in the negotiation process.

In the early part of the 20th century, San Diego hosted two World's Fairs: the Panama-California Exposition in 1915 and the California Pacific International Exposition in 1935. Both expositions were held in Balboa Park, and many of the Spanish/Baroque-style buildings that were built for those expositions remain to this day as central features of the park. The buildings were intended to be temporary structures, but most remained in continuous use until they progressively fell into disrepair. Most were eventually rebuilt, using castings of the original façades to retain the architectural style. The menagerie of exotic animals featured at the 1915 exposition provided the basis for the San Diego Zoo. During the 1950s there was a citywide festival called Fiesta del Pacifico highlighting the area's Spanish and Mexican past. In the 2010s there was a proposal for a large-scale celebration of the 100th anniversary of Balboa Park, but the plans were abandoned when the organization tasked with putting on the celebration went out of business.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? (CNN) -- This is the time of the year when everyone can channel their inner Dick Vitale. Just make sure not to startle your co-workers if you start yelling, \\"Awesome, baby!\\" Everyone in the entire country, starting on Selection Sunday when the NCAA Tournament brackets are revealed, becomes a college basketball expert. From President Obama to that annoying woman in accounting who lets her corgie make the picks (and still somehow wins the office pool), we're all about to pretend we know more about Cinderella than the prince himself. So if you're just now beginning to pay attention, here is an A-to-Z primer of what you're going to find in your brackets. If that doesn't seem like a long drought, consider: The","completion":"last time a team with a losing record made it to the NCAA Tournament was back in 1999 when Florida A&M stunned the college basketball world. Since then, there have been numerous attempts for lesser-known programs (or Cinderellas, as they're often called) to defy the odds and make it to the Big Dance. This year promises to be no exception, as several potential dark horse contenders are poised to make their mark on the national stage. But amid all the Cinderella stories and bracket-busting upsets, there remains a certain level of predictability within the NCAA Tournament. Powerhouse programs such as Duke, Kentucky, and Kansas are perennial fixtures on the brackets, and their success often sets the pace for the rest of the field. However, part of the tournament's appeal lies in the fact that anything can happen once the first round begins, setting the stage for what has become one of the most exciting sporting events in the United States. One crucial aspect of filling out a winning bracket is to understand the mechanics of the seeding process. Teams are ranked from 1 to 16 within four different regions – East, West, Midwest, and South – depending on their performance during the regular season and conference tournaments. This seeding determines their matchups in the tournament. While the higher-ranked teams generally have better odds of advancing to later rounds, they must navigate through a minefield of potential upsets at the hands of lower-seeded squads that have nothing to lose. Often, it is these matchups that help form the enduring legends of the tournament, as fans and pundits alike revel in the unexpected triumphs of the underdog. Another crucial concept to grasp is that of the tournament's one-and-done nature. Unlike the professional leagues, there are no best-of-seven series in college basketball – each game is a single-elimination affair, meaning that one bad performance can spell the end of a team's season. This high-stakes atmosphere is what fuels the intensity and passion behind the NCAA Tournament, as both players and fans alike are all too aware of the fact that one wrong move or one unlucky bounce could send a championship contender packing. In summary, succeeding in your office pool or finding your inner Dick Vitale requires a blend of basketball knowledge, an understanding of the tournament structure, and a healthy dose of good fortune. It's important to pay attention to patterns and trends throughout the season to make educated guesses on which teams are poised to pull off an upset, but remember that no strategy is foolproof in the ever-unpredictable world of March Madness. As you prepare to fill out this year's bracket, take some time to learn about the participating teams and enjoy the stories they will inevitably bring to the tournament. Whether you choose to root for the underdog or stick to the safe and familiar path of backing the established powerhouses, the NCAA Tournament is a nearly month-long celebration of the very best that college basketball has to offer. And who knows – with a little luck and the right amount of bracket savvy, you may just find yourself atop the office pool standings and proudly proclaiming \\"Awesome, baby!\\" for all to hear."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we infer the following? The Grand Duchess Kira of Russia was born on 25 August 1914.","completion":"To infer the birth date of Grand Duchess Kira of Russia from the given information, we must examine the provided facts and determine if there is enough evidence to support the conclusion. Step 1: Analyze the given information. We know the following: - Prince Louis Ferdinand Oskar Christian of Prussia was born 25 August 1944. - He was the fifth of seven children of his parents, Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia and Grand Duchess Kira of Russia. Step 2: Consider the possibilities. The information provided does not mention any specific birth dates for either of his parents, including Grand Duchess Kira of Russia.

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2, Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance. Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994, Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets.

Please answer this question: Whom did Idi Amin depose in the 1971 coup in Uganda?","completion":"Idi Amin deposed President Dr. Apollo Milton Obote in the 1971 coup in Uganda. The coup occurred on January 25, 1971, while Obote was attending a Commonwealth summit meeting in Singapore. Amin, who was serving as commander of the Ugandan Army under President Obote, orchestrated the coup in his absence, seizing control of the government and installing himself as the new head of state. Apollo Milton Obote was Uganda's first post-colonial Prime Minister from 1962 to 1966, and then he served as the President from 1966 until his overthrow in 1971. He played a significant role in Uganda's early post-independence political landscape, leading the country through initial years of nation-building and laying the terms of internal governance. As a founder and leader of the Uganda People's Congress (UPC), Obote's first term focused on finding revenue sources, alleviating poverty, and fostering national unity. However, his consolidation of power, particularly through the 1966 crisis which led to the suspension of the Ugandan Constitution and his shift from prime minister to president, created tensions and vulnerabilities within the government and military. Idi Amin, who was a trusted military confidant of Obote, had risen through the ranks of the armed forces, thanks to his loyalty and effectiveness in implementing military actions against Obote's political rivals. While Obote believed that Amin's loyalty would keep the military in check, Amin's aspirations and ambitions began to cause divisions, eventually leading to the coup in 1971. Amin's ascendancy to power and his brutal regime, which lasted from 1971 to 1979, marked a dark period in Uganda's history. His rule was characterized by widespread human rights abuses, extensive bloodshed, political and ethnic persecution, extrajudicial killings, and the expulsion of minorities, particularly Asians, from the country. Experts estimate that between 100,000 and 500,000 people lost their lives under Amin's regime, making it one of the most horrific and tyrannical periods in Africa's modern history. In 1979, Amin was eventually overthrown by a coalition of Ugandan exiles and the Tanzanian army. Obote, who was living in exile in Tanzania, returned to Uganda in 1980 and was re-elected as the president. However, his second term faced numerous challenges, and he struggled to regain the trust and support of the populace. Obote was ultimately deposed again in 1985 following a military coup led by General Tito Okello. Obote fled to Zambia, where he spent the rest of his life in exile until his death in 2005. Overall, the 1971 coup that brought Idi Amin to power was a destabilizing event in Uganda's history and significantly impacted the political, social, and economic trajectory of the country for decades to come. The reign of these two leaders, Obote and Amin, is a testament to the complexity of post-colonial African politics and the lasting legacies of their time in office."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Answer:","completion":"The airway and the lungs are part of the Respiratory System. The primary function of the respiratory system is to take in oxygen from the environment and expel carbon dioxide from the body. This process is usually done through breathing. The Respiratory System is composed of various organs and structures, including: 1. Nasal cavities and nose: Filters, warms, and moistens the incoming air. 2. Pharynx (throat): Serves as a passageway for both food and air. 3. Larynx (voice box): Allows vocalization, and prevents food from entering the trachea. 4. Trachea (windpipe): A major tube that carries air to the lungs. 5. Bronchi and Bronchioles: These are smaller branches that carry air from the trachea into the lungs. 6. Lungs: These are two large organs that perform the gas exchange, allowing oxygen to enter the bloodstream and carbon dioxide to be removed from the bloodstream and exhaled. 7. Alveoli: These are small sacs within the lungs where the actual gas exchange happens. In the process of respiration, the human body draws in fresh air into the lungs, absorbs oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. It is a critical system for sustaining life because all cells, tissues, and organs in the body require a constant supply of oxygen to generate the energy needed for body functions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With a newfound appreciation for life, they thwart Lucius' plans for world domination and expose the Cryptic Tetrad's secret to the world. The movie ends with the revelation that the real treasure was the unique knowledge and experiences they gained along their journey, and the bonds they forged with their companions.

Background: Dev was born Dharam Dev Anand on 26 September 1923 in the Shakargarh tehsil of the Gurdaspur district in Punjab (British India). His father Pishori Lal Anand was a well-to-do advocate in Gurdaspur District Court. Dev was the third of four sons born to Anand. One of Dev's younger sisters is Sheel Kanta Kapur, who is the mother of film director Shekhar Kapur. Context: In the sixties, Dev Anand acquired a romantic image with films such as Manzil and Tere Ghar Ke Samne with Nutan, Kinaare Kinaare with Meena Kumari, Maya with Mala Sinha, Asli-Naqli with Sadhana Shivdasani, Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai, Mahal with Asha Parekh and Teen Deviyaan opposite three heroines Kalpana, Simi Garewal and Nanda. In the film Teen Deviyaan, Dev Anand played a playboy. His first colour film, Guide with Waheeda Rehman was based on the novel of the same name by R. K. Narayan. Dev Anand himself was the impetus for making the film version of the book. He met and persuaded Narayan to give his assent to the project. Dev Anand tapped his friends in Hollywood to launch an Indo-US co-production that was shot in Hindi and English simultaneously and was released in 1965. Guide, directed by younger brother Vijay Anand, was an acclaimed movie. Dev played Raju, a voluble guide, who supports Rosy (Waheeda) in her bid for freedom. He is not above thoughtlessly exploiting her for personal gains. Combining style with substance, he gave an affecting performance as a man grappling with his emotions in his passage through love, shame and salvation. He reunited with Vijay Anand for the movie Jewel Thief, based on the thriller genre which featured Vyjayanthimala, Tanuja, Anju Mahendru, Faryal and Helen and was very successful. Their next collaboration, Johny Mera Naam (1970), again a thriller, in which Dev was paired opposite Hema Malini was a big hit. It was Johnny Mera Naam which made Hema Malini a big star. In 1969, he was a member of the jury at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival. Question: Did the film do well for him? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the film \\"Johny Mera Naam\\" did well for Dev Anand. The film was a big hit and was successful.

Does \\"vegetate\\" mean the same thing in these two sentences? The fields vegetate vigorously. The bacterial growth vegetated along.","completion":"The term \\"vegetate\\" does carry a connection in meaning for both sentences, but there are distinctions in how it is used and the specific meanings it conveys in each context. In the first sentence, \\"The fields vegetate vigorously,\\" the term “vegetate” is used to describe the growth and flourishing of plants or crops in the fields. This usage is more aligned with the original definition of vegetate, which involves plant life growing and developing in a healthy manner. In this context, \\"vegetate\\" communicates the idea that the fields are teeming with life, plants are thriving, and there is a sense of strong, robust growth. In the second sentence, \\"The bacterial growth vegetated along,\\" the term \\"vegetate\\" takes on a different nuance of meaning. Here, the word is utilized to describe the growth and expansion of bacterial colonies or populations. Although \\"vegetate\\" still conveys growth, its connection to plant life is less prominent in this sentence, and the emphasis is more on general growth processes. In this context, \\"vegetate\\" primarily indicates that the bacteria are growing, reproducing, and spreading.

What is the answer??","completion":"We want to find the value of p in the equation 0 = 8819*p - 176697 + 1146787. To do this, we follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the constants. Add -176697 and 1146787. 1146787 - 176697 = 970090 Now we have: 0 = 8819*p + 970090 Step 2: Isolate the term with p. To do this, we need to subtract 970090 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 970090 = 8819*p + 970090 - 970090 Which simplifies to: -970090 = 8819*p Step 3: Solve for p. To find the value of p, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 8819. -970090 / 8819 = 8819*p / 8819 This gives us: p = -110 The solution to the equation 0 = 8819*p - 176697 + 1146787 is p = -110."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kayla made sure to mold the wooden table well for Christine's purchase because","completion":"she knew how important this table was to her friend. Christine had been searching for the perfect table for months, ever since she’d moved into her new house. She had an image in her mind of a beautiful, handcrafted wooden table, one that would last for generations and be a centerpiece for family gatherings, get-togethers, and heartfelt conversations with friends. Kayla, a skilled woodworker herself, had always been an advocate of quality craftsmanship and had a deep-rooted passion for creating things with her own two hands. She had spent years honing her skills in order to establish a flourishing business. When Christine reached out to her with her request, Kayla knew it was more than just a simple purchase from a friend; she was providing Christine something meaningful that would connect their friendship and families for years to come. It was her way of showing her love and support, while also demonstrating her incredible artistry. Kayla decided to use high-quality, reclaimed wood for the table, as its inherent warmth and character would only add to its charm. She knew that Christine had a beautiful open kitchen with an industrial-chic design, so a blend of rustic and contemporary styles would be the perfect match. The wood was sourced from an old barn that had been taken down in a nearby town; it immediately caught Kayla’s eye for its natural beauty and history. In order to create a one-of-a-kind piece that would stand the test of time, Kayla began by planning out her design meticulously. She envisioned a long, sturdy table, with an elegantly arched base and thick, solid legs that gave it both stability and an air of majesty. The intricate details and embellishments would be understated yet exquisite, hinting at the great care and thought that went into its creation. As she began to work on the table, Kayla quickly realized that her friend’s timeline for the purchase was fast approaching. Christine was hosting a large family dinner in just a few weeks to celebrate her parents' anniversary. To ensure that the table would be ready in time, Kayla immersed herself in the process, working long hours without rest. She painstakingly sanded, carved, and polished the wood, transforming the reclaimed timber into a stunning piece of furniture. As the table started to take shape, Kayla made sure that each corner and edge was perfectly smoothed out. The table had to have a refined, seamless beauty that would catch the light and create an inviting atmosphere in Christine’s home. Every detail was important, from the precise alignment of the wooden planks, to the masterful joinery techniques Kayla employed. This craftsmanship was both a testament to her friend’s refined taste as well as a showcase of her own skill. In the final days leading up to the deadline, Kayla’s dedication never faltered. Although her hands were calloused and her muscles sore, she quietly reveled in the satisfaction of her labor. The table’s incredible transformation was nearing completion, and she was proud of what she had accomplished. With great care, she applied a rich, natural finish to the wood, sealing and protecting it for years to come. On the morning she was meant to deliver the table, Kayla took a step back and admired her handiwork. She had imbued the table with all her love, care, and skill – and it showed. Knowing that she had created not just an ordinary table, but a cherished heirloom, Kayla smiled and thought of the countless memories that would be shared around it. When the day finally arrived for Christine to receive her new wooden table, Kayla knew she had surpassed her friend’s expectations. As they marveled at the table, it became apparent just how special this piece was – the careful craftsmanship, the warm and sturdy wood, and the love that bound the friends together. Kayla felt proud and grateful for the opportunity to create something so significant for her dear friend, and as laughter and conversation filled Christine’s home that night, the table’s presence was the perfect reminder of their connection and the love that united them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977).

A:","completion":"Based on the given information, it remains unclear whether the option \\"cellulose\\" correctly answers the question \\"what sort of molecules are used for absorbing light energy by plants?\\", especially since the statement confirms that complex molecules are involved in the process. To provide a more comprehensive and detailed response, let's first consider the primary function of cellulose in plants. Cellulose is a complex carbohydrate and the main structural component of plant cell walls. While it plays a critical role in maintaining a plant's physical strength and support, cellulose lacks the ability to absorb light energy. Instead, plants primarily use light-absorbing molecules called pigments to fulfill this function. These pigments are responsible for capturing light energy, which is then converted into chemical energy via photosynthesis. Chlorophyll, which gives plants their green color, is the most prominent and essential pigment in this process, although other pigments such as carotenoids (yellow, orange, and red pigments) also contribute to light absorption. Chlorophyll absorbs light in the red and blue parts of the visible light spectrum, and through a series of complex reactions within chloroplasts, converts the absorbed energy into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which are then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and other organic molecules. These products are vital to the plant, as they provide energy and structural building blocks for further growth and development. In conclusion, while cellulose is an essential component of plant structure, it is not primarily involved in light absorption. Rather, the process relies on pigments such as chlorophyll. Therefore, given the available answer options and presupposing that complex molecules absorb light energy in plants, the correct answer would not be \\"cellulose.\\" Instead, the answer should involve pigments like chlorophyll and carotenoids that are directly responsible for the light absorption and photosynthesis processes in plants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So many questions were asked of referee Michael Oliver that his head will be buzzing well into the week as he analyses what he got right and what he should work on. The penalties 1. Marouane Fellaini on Sergio Aguero (42mins) - A clear penalty as the Belgian kicked the Manchester City forward on the Achilles from behind. For Felliaini to then turn and have a go at Aguero was disgraceful. There were some suggestions on Twitter that Fellaini spat at Aguero as he lay on the turf. However, it looked like saliva falling from his mouth as he shouted at the striker. Joe Hart approaches","completion":"Michael Oliver, intent on preventing any further escalation between the two teams. The Manchester City goalkeeper stands tall and forcefully urges Fellaini to back off. Oliver senses that the situation is escalating and doesn’t hesitate to brandish a yellow card for the Belgian midfielder's reckless challenge and unsporting behavior. The half-time whistle blows, and tensions are high as both teams head to their respective dressing rooms. The managers, knowing the importance of this derby, give impassioned speeches to their players, urging them to remain focused and disciplined on the pitch. As the second half kicks off, both teams return to the field with fierce determination. City, the aggrieved party after the controversial penalty decision, look to make amends and take control of the game. After a series of chances, they finally break through in the 63rd minute. Raheem Sterling jinks his way past a defender and serves an inch-perfect cross for Sergio Aguero, who makes no mistake in putting the ball into the back of the net. The Etihad erupts in celebration, as Manchester City take the lead 1-0. Both teams continue to battle it out, but the intensity of the derby gets the better of them. In the 78th minute, following a dangerous tackle, scuffles break out between several players — a testament to the high stakes and emotions associated with this match. Oliver, having a difficult evening, shows a red card to Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera for a studs-up challenge on David Silva. Now down to ten men, United's desperation grows. They fight valiantly to find an equalizer, and in the 85th minute, they do just that. A cross from the right wing finds the head of Marcus Rashford, who expertly guides the ball past Joe Hart. The score is now level at 1-1. With the fans on the edge of their seats and the clock ticking down, it seems as though the match could be headed for a draw. However, both teams are determined to find a late winner as extra time approaches. A relentless back-and-forth battle ensues, with neither team willing to relent. Finally, deep into added time, a moment of individual brilliance unfolds. Kevin De Bruyne finds himself with the ball outside the United penalty area. He assesses the situation, takes a calculated touch, and unleashes a curling shot that whistles past the outstretched arms of David de Gea and nestles into the far corner of the net. The Etihad erupts in euphoria once more, as Manchester City takes the lead just as the referee signals for full time. The story ends with Manchester City claiming a dramatic 2-1 victory in a thrilling, hard-fought, and heated derby.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Grifters Context: Lilly Dillon (Angelica Huston) is a veteran con artist. She works for a bookmaker, Bobo Justus (Pat Hingle), making large cash bets at race tracks to lower the odds of longshots. On her way to La Jolla for the horse races, she stops in Los Angeles to visit her son Roy (John Cusack), a small-time grifter whom she has not seen in eight years. She finds him in pain and bleeding internally after one of his victims caught him pulling a petty scam and punched him in the stomach. When medical assistance finally comes, Lilly confronts the doctor, threatening to have him killed if her son dies. At the hospital, Lilly meets and takes an instant dislike to Roy's girlfriend, Myra Langtry (Annette Bening), who is a few years older than her son. Lilly urges her son to quit the grift, saying he literally does not have the stomach for it. Because she leaves late for La Jolla, she misses a race where the winner was paying 70â1. For this mistake, Bobo burns her hand with a cigar. Myra, like Roy and Lilly, plays all the angles. When her landlord demands payment of late rent, she uses her sex appeal to lure him into bed and forget the rent. She makes a similar offer to a jeweler (Stephen Tobolowsky) to get what she wants for a gem she is trying to pawn. Upon leaving the hospital, Roy takes Myra to La Jolla for the weekend. On the train, she notices him conning a group of sailors in a rigged dice game. Myra reveals to Roy that she is also a grifter and is looking for a new partner for a long-con operation. Myra describes her long association with another man, Cole (J. T. Walsh), and how they took advantage of wealthy marks in business cons, including a greedy oil investor, Gloucester Hebbing (Charles Napier). A flashback scene in a plush office building culminates in a fake FBI raid with a fake shooting of Myra to discourage Hebbing from going to the police.

To achieve this, the consulting team works in close collaboration with the client's tax advisors and other consultants, so that they can collectively identify and implement the most effective strategy for addressing the challenges facing the client. In practical terms, this might involve regularly scheduled meetings, e-mail exchanges or video calls, where all parties can share their insights and perspectives on the client's situation. The team might also use project-management tools to keep track of milestones, deadlines, and action items. This process typically begins with an in-depth analysis of the client's situation, including their business operations, financial status, legal structure, and other relevant factors. This information is used to create a tailored strategy that takes into account the client's specific needs, goals, and constraints. Once the strategy is in place, the consultants, tax advisors, and other experts start working on specific tasks, such as conducting market research, analyzing potential risks, and evaluating alternative solutions. They also monitor the progress of the project, making changes and adjustments as needed to ensure that the client's objectives are met. Throughout the process, there is continuous communication and feedback among all parties involved. This allows the consultants to stay informed of any changes in the client's circumstances or in the overall market environment, and to adapt their recommendations accordingly.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: What would you do if you were lost in the dark forest at night? The first sensible lesson is that you shouldn't bother trying to find your way in the dark at all, but just stay put until dawn. Because then you won't trip over things? No, mainly because you'll have an idea of direction. The sun rises in the east. But you will be amazed at how many people forget they know that. Apparently, the area underneath a holly bush provides a good makeshift shelter -- they are thick, and evergreen. The next thing to do -- or rather not to do -- is panic, for the obvious reason that unless there is someone there to hear you scream, it will get you nowhere. Just try to think of nice, happy things. There is always a point in films when a person who is lost in the desert or the snow, dehydrated and exhausted, comes across a set of their own footprints and realizes they have just walked in a huge, round circle. It is wrong to owe it to the unequal strengths or different lengths of your legs. Experiments prove that, without the sun or the moon (or landmarks) as a fixed guide, lots of small errors add up over time so the brain can't correctly identify the \\"straight ahead\\" direction. To just get out of somewhere, pick a spot on the horizon and just head for it. There are several ways to find directions in the dark, and by far the best is to establish north using the stars. Most people can identify the Plough, which is part of Ursa Major. It looks a lot like a saucepan. The Plough rotates through the sky, but let's imagine the saucepan lying horizontally , with its handle on the left. You need to trace a line from the star at the right-hand base of the pan, through the star at the right-hand rim , and follow it upwards; the north star is roughly five times the distance between those two \\"pointer\\" stars.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Exorcist III Context: The film begins with the point of view of someone wandering through the streets of Georgetown, a voice informing us \\"I have dreams... of a rose... and of falling down a long flight of stairs\\". The point of view shows a warning of evil about to arrive later that night at a church. Demonic growls are heard, leaves and other street trash suddenly come flying into the church as a crucifix comes to life. It then cuts to Lieutenant William F. Kinderman (George C. Scott) at a crime scene, where a 12-year-old boy named Thomas Kintry has been murdered.Kinderman takes his friend, a priest named Father Dyer (Ed Flanders), out to see their mutually favorite film It's a Wonderful Life. Kinderman later relates the gruesome details of the murder of the young boy he was investigating that morning, including his crucifixion. Another murder soon takes place; a priest found decapitated in a church. Dyer is shortly hospitalized and found murdered the next day, with the words \\"IT'S A WONDERFULL LIFE\\" written on a wall in Dyer's blood.At each murder scene, the fingerprints at the crime scenes do not match up, indicating a different person was responsible for each. Kinderman tells hospital staff the reason for his unease: fifteen years ago the vicious serial killer, \\"The Gemini\\" (Brad Dourif), was executed; with every victim he cut off the right index finger and carved the Zodiac sign of Gemini into the palm of their left hand. Kinderman noticed the hands of the three new victims and verified that the Gemini's sign has been there. The Gemini Killer also always used an extra \\"L\\" in his notes sent to the media, such as \\"usefull\\" or \\"carefull\\". Furthermore, to filter out false confessions, the original Gemini Killer's true mutilations were kept a secret by the Richmond police's homicide department; the newspapers were made to wrongfully report that the left middle finger was severed and that the Gemini sign was carved on the back of the victim.Kinderman visits the head of the psychiatric ward, Dr. Temple (Scott Wilson), who relates... A:","completion":"The Gemini Killer, also known as James Venamun, was able to inhabit the body of a fellow inmate in the psychiatric ward named Patient X, who was revealed to be Damian Karras (Jason Miller), the priest from the original Exorcist film. Karras, having survived being possessed by the demon Pazuzu, had amnesia and was being cared for by Dr. Temple. After The Gemini Killer's execution, his soul was sent to Karras' comatose body by the demonic forces trying to exact their revenge. As James Venamun, The Gemini Killer sought spiritual guidance from his master, Satan himself, while occupying the body of Damian Karras. Upon transferring his soul into the body, the Gemini Killer proceeded to commit a series of horrific murders, mimicking his previous modus operandi and targeting the victims with ties to the Georgetown exorcism and the individuals who participated in it. It should be noted that the Gemini Killer did not inhabit the body of a child in the movie, but rather the body of the adult priest, Damian Karras. There was, however, a child victim mentioned in the film - Thomas Kintry, who was killed by the Gemini Killer. What makes The Exorcist III stand out is the investigative aspect of the story, which focuses on the character of Lieutenant Kinderman unraveling the mystery of the Gemini Killer's resurrection and possessing Damian Karras' body. As Kinderman delves deeper into the case, he comes to confront the Gemini Killer, who confirms that he is responsible for the recent murders and that he has been acting on demonic orders. Eventually, as Kinderman tries to confront the Gemini Killer and save Karras, an exorcism is performed by another priest, Father Paul Morning (Nicol Williamson).

U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter made the comment in a news conference in Kabul with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who has previously called on Obama to \\"re-examine\\" the withdrawal plan to ensure his country has the support it needs to maintain security gains. Carter arrived in Afghanistan's capital on Saturday during his first foreign trip since being sworn in as defense secretary four days ago.

The bilateral security agreement (BSA) came into force after a long period of negotiations and aimed to provide the much-needed security and stabilization to the country grappling with insurgency and terrorism. The agreement established a framework for continued United States' military presence in Afghanistan, which has been essential in supporting and training Afghan security forces while conducting counterterrorism operations. This was a crucial development for the Afghan government and the people of Afghanistan, seeking a steady partnership with the United States in their efforts to build a secure and prosperous nation. Since then, both nations have actively collaborated in strengthening the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), targeted operations against the Taliban and terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS, and efforts in advancing the peace process. Despite the agreement, the initial plan to withdraw virtually all U.S. troops by the end of 2016 loomed over Afghanistan, creating concerns about the country's security situation and its capacity to maintain hard-won gains against insurgent forces. Therefore, the potential extension of the U.S. troop presence beyond 2016, as indicated by Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, could provide much-needed reassurance to Afghanistan's leadership and its people. In the long run, any decision to extend the U.S.' military commitment in Afghanistan will greatly depend on several factors, such as the ANDSF's ability to effectively counter threats, the country's progress in combating corruption, and its efforts to foster a culture of good governance and democracy. It is essential for Afghanistan and the United States to maintain a strong partnership based on trust, cooperation, and mutual respect, so as to ensure a secure and stable future for the war-torn nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although issued a day after their scheduled posting, the invoices are still being issued within the 5-business days. {I'd forgotten about Labor Day when I set up the schedule.} Transmission Customers will observe adjustments for an error on in May 2000 Settlement Adjustment invoices that were issued in July. The total adjustment amounted to 2,081,568.11 and was allocated across 2,261,753.08 MWh. Customers may validate their respective adjustments by computing their ratio shares of the 2,081,568.11 using 2,261,753 MWh as the denominator in their respective ratios of their May 2000 load. The reason the denominator of the ratio share appears small is because the pay out of this adjustment is to the Transmission Owners. In order not to assess the TO's a proportionate share of the 2,081,568.11, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment, their withdrawals have been excluded from the ratio share. Transmission Owners should observe a credit on their invoices based upon their respective megawatt-mile coefficients for the period.

The initial billing runs for August 25th were done without considering ConEd's sub-zonal load. As a result, it appeared as though there was no load in the ConEd sub-zones on the 25th and all DAM purchases and bilateral transactions in those sub-zones were sold back to the market in real time causing the Schedule 1 residual adjustment to be grossly inflated.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\" or simply \\"the King\\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Snejana Farberov. A cross-dressing male housekeeper, known as Ms Puppy, has pleaded guilty to beating to death a gay couple from Denver. Daryl Rasmussen, 58, pleaded guilty Friday to counts of second-degree murder. Rasmussen was sentenced to 30 years in prison, and 13 other charges against him – including first-degree murder - were dismissed. Scroll down for video. Guilty: Daryl Rasmussen, 58, known as Ms Puppy, was sentenced to 30 years in prison as part of a plea deal in the double murder of a gay couple. According to prosecutors, Rasmussen bludgeoned to death Ronald Ford, 63, and his long-time boyfriend, 56-year-old Ramiro 'Rome' Sanchez, in their Denver home in late January 2011. The cross-dresser also stole the slain couple's 1997 Dodge Caravan and used their credit cards and identifies. The victims’ bodies were discovered a week apart in mid-February. Both are survived by a number of grown children. Rasmussen, aka Ms Puppy, had been homeless when the Denver couple hired him in 2010 to be a housekeeper and caregiver to Sanchez, who was disabled. Sanchez and Ford were killed in their home in the 120 block of Stuart Street in Denver with blows to the head, according to court documents. Ingrate: Rasmussen (left), who had been homeless, was hired by the couple in 2010 as a housekeeper and a caregiver to Ramiro Sanchez, 56 (right), who was disabled. Gruesome discoveries: Ronald Ford's body was found inside the couple's Denver home February 11, 2011, and Sanchez was discovered a week later hidden in the basement. Ford's body was found inside the house February 11. Sanchez was discovered a week later hidden in the basement under a pile of bags. Before Sanchez was found dead, it had been suggested that he and Rasmussen may have run away together. Speaking to The Denver Channel in February 2011, Heidi Coleman, one of Ford's four children, said that it was a relief to know that her father's partner of 18 years did not play a part in his murder. Denver Post reported that Daryl Rasmussen fled after the murders but was arrested six months later in Palm Springs, California, after a patron in a local bar overheard him introduce himself as Ms Puppy. In court Friday, Daryl Rasmussen spoke very little, only saying he was sorry for what happened, CBS Denver reported. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A man named Daryl Rasmussen, who dressed like a woman and was called Ms. Puppy, admitted to hurting and causing the death of a couple in Denver. He used to work for them as a housekeeper and caregiver. After the incident, he took their car and used their credit cards. He ran away, but eventually, he was found and arrested. The judge said he has to stay in prison for 30 years as a punishment. The families of the couple were relieved to know the truth and that justice was served."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Tammy wound up in the hospital and was diagnosed with a serious brain injury. Rob suffered only a mild concussion. Which person had a greater chance of suffering permanent brain damage? Hint: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Tammy has a greater chance of suffering permanent brain damage. While both Tammy and Rob sustained head injuries in the accident, Tammy's injury was described as a serious brain injury, while Rob only suffered a mild concussion. Serious brain injuries have a high possibility of causing permanent damage. These injuries result from an external mechanical force (e.g., a blow or jolt to the head) or penetration (e.g., a bullet or shattered skull). Consequences of serious brain injuries can include difficulty with speech, body movement control, personality changes, and issues with mental abilities such as memory. Treatment options for serious brain injuries may involve medicines, counseling, and other interventions aimed at helping individuals recover or adapt to their disabilities. However, given that Tammy's injury has been classified as \\"serious,\\" her likelihood of experiencing lasting brain damage is higher than Rob's, who only faced a mild concussion."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},Y={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],D={key:0},E={key:1};function j(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",Y,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
