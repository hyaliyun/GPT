Here are possible answers to this question: - exercise - dehydration - breathing hard - sweat - trip and fall I believe the correct choice is \\"sweat\\", here's why: A:","completion":"Running is a great workout, it really works up a sweat. The correct choice among the given options is indeed \\"sweat,\\" and there are quite a few reasons as to why this is the case. 1. Increased Heart Rate and Blood Flow: When you run, your heart rate increases, and your blood vessels dilate to push more blood and oxygen to your muscles. This increased circulation creates heat as a result of the metabolic processes within your muscles. 2. Regulation of Body Temperature: Your body seeks to maintain an optimal temperature, typically around 98.6°F (37°C). When you run, the internal heat generated during the activity causes your body's temperature to rise. To combat this rise in temperature, your body produces sweat. Sweat is your body's natural coolant; as it evaporates from your skin, it helps to dissipate heat and maintain your body's optimal temperature. 3. Cooling Mechanism: As mentioned earlier, sweat is a way for your body to cool itself down. The evaporation of sweat from your skin's surface removes excess heat and allows you to maintain a stable body temperature even during intense physical activities such as running. 4. Releasing Toxins and Waste Products: Sweating also serves as a means to release toxins and waste products from your body. When you engage in any form of physical activity, your body produces metabolic waste products that need to be eliminated. Sweating is an effective way for your body to remove these waste products from your system. The other options given, while related to running, do not represent the primary outcome being sought in the question: - Exercise: Running is indeed an exercise, but in this context, it doesn't work up an \\"exercise.\\" Exercise is an activity or a process, not an outcome of running. - Dehydration: Running can lead to dehydration if you don't replenish the fluids and electrolytes lost through sweat. However, dehydration is a potential negative consequence of running rather than something that running specifically \\"works up.\\" - Breathing hard: While running can cause you to breathe harder due to the increased oxygen demand, it's not the primary outcome the question is looking for. Breathing hard is a physiological response to the demands placed on your body during running, not something that running works up. - Trip and fall: Although trips and falls can happen while running, they are not an inherent result of the activity itself. Tripping and falling is an external factor or accident and doesn't describe the natural outcome being sought in the question. To summarize, running is a great workout that works up a sweat due to the increased heart rate, blood flow, and the need to regulate body temperature. The other options, while related to running, do not represent the core outcome being sought in the question. The correct choice among the given options is \\"sweat\\" due to the physiological processes involved and the role it plays in cooling the body during physical activity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person Joseph arranged a contract for? ? Janet Jackson was born on May 16, 1966 in Gary, Indiana, the youngest of ten children, to Katherine Esther (née Scruse) and Joseph Walter Jackson. The Jacksons were lower-middle class and devout Jehovah's Witnesses, although Jackson would later refrain from organized religion. At a young age, her brothers began performing as the Jackson 5 in the Chicago-Gary area. In March 1969, the group signed a record deal with Motown, and soon had their first number-one hit. The family then moved to the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated to pursue a career in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio.At age seven, Jackson performed at the MGM Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. A biography revealed her father, Joseph Jackson, was emotionally withdrawn, and told her to address him solely by his first name as a child. She began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976.In 1977, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family and later got a recurring role on Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey from seasons three to six. Jackson also played the role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series, largely due to the emotional stress of her secret marriage to R&B singer, James DeBarge. Jackson later elaborated on her time on the show in an interview with Anderson Cooper, revealing that the cast would occasionally play pranks on her, but she spoke fondly of them.When Jackson was sixteen, her father and manager Joseph Jackson, arranged a contract for her with A&M Records. Her debut album, Janet Jackson, was released in 1982. It was produced by Angela Winbush, René Moore, Bobby Watson of Rufus and Leon Sylvers III, and overseen by her father Joseph. It peaked at No. 63 on the Billboard 200,...

Possible A: meeting, cinema, meditation center, men's room, restaurant Why is \\"meditation center\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Meditation center\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons: Firstly, the question asks about a location where a person, particularly a 'gentleman', can go to 'relax'. In the literal sense, relaxation is the state of being free from tension and anxiety. Meditating is a widely recognized way to obtain a deeply restful and relaxed state. It reduces stress, controls anxiety, enhances self-awareness, promotes emotional health and lengthens attention span among many other benefits. Meditation centers are designed expressly for this purpose. They provide a serene and peaceful environment that allows people to relax in a profound manner. In these centers, individuals are typically taught different meditation techniques to quiet the mind and relax the body, leading to improved physical and mental health. The notion of a 'gentleman' invokes the idea of a dignified, well-mannered and considerate person who takes care of himself both physically and mentally. The practice of meditation aligns with this persona as it is a self-improvement activity that requires discipline, commitment, patience and attentiveness - all qualities that coincide with the idea of a gentleman. Compared to other alternatives like 'meeting' and 'men's room', 'meditation center' makes most sense as a destination for relaxation. A meeting, while being a social event, can often involve work or formal discussions which might not lead to relaxation. A men's room, meanwhile, is typically associated with basic hygienic needs rather than offering a space for relaxation. Therefore, 'meditation center' fits better with the narrative of where a gentleman might go to relax, utilizing a natural, time-honored method that properly aligns with the characteristics generally associated with a gentleman. The other options like 'cinema' and 'restaurant' may too provide relaxation, entertainment and satisfaction respectively. However, the effects achieved through a visit to a meditation center, such as tranquility, self-awareness and reduced stress levels, are arguably more profound and enduring. This could lead to a more holistic form of relaxation, aligning with the capabilities and interests of a modern gentleman who values not only physical but also mental wellbeing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sun beams down on him, warming his face and casting shadows on the pavement, and the wind rustles through the trees above, providing a pleasant soundtrack for the boy's innocent frolics. The truck behind him, which is parked alongside the curb, remains stationary. The driver is inside, enjoying a brief rest after making a delivery to a nearby store. He discreetly observes the boy through his rearview mirror, momentarily transported back to his own childhood memories of carefree play. A nostalgic smile crosses the driver's face; the boy's infectious enthusiasm reminds him of simpler times. As the boy continues to play, his mother emerges from their home, carrying a glass of refreshing lemonade. She walks over to her son, trying not to disrupt his game but also wanting to make sure he stays hydrated in the warm afternoon sun. She calls out his name, and the boy pauses his hopping to turn and see her approaching. \\"Mommy!\\" he exclaims with delight, his face lighting up even more than before. He quickly hops off the last square and runs to his mother, eagerly accepting the lemonade. Taking a big gulp, he lets out a satisfied \\"Ahh!\\" and beams a grateful smile up at his mother. She returns the smile and gently ruffles his hair, proud of her son and happy to see him engaged in a fun yet simple activity, away from the screens and modern distractions. The truck driver, still watching the scene unfold, realizes he should be on his way. He starts the engine and carefully shifts gears, pulling back onto the road at a slow, steady pace.

The movie revolves around the seedy lowlife of Las Vegas, with Stanley Tucci starring as the casino boss in a much-talked-about performance. While some reviewers believe that Tucci's acting and some of the fight scenes might be worth the price of a ticket, others think that even Tucci could not save the movie from being just another bust. Betsy Sharkey at the Los Angeles Times appreciates Tucci's performance, saying that he \\"makes even bad films better just by being there.\\" However, she also highlights that the film is not a royal flush or full house. On the other hand, Bruce DeMara at the Toronto Star believes that Wild Card is more likely to receive positive reception than the Goldman novel's 1986 adaptation, which starred Burt Reynolds. DeMara mentions that director Simon West allows the story to unwind at a measured pace, with Statham being more interesting than usual. He also believes that the fight scenes are well choreographed and fun to watch. Despite this, Nicolas Rapold at the New York Times is not a fan of Statham's acting, stating that his thick voice and inexpressive demeanor give off an air of brain fog rather than gritty blues. While he acknowledges Statham's excellent fighting skills, Rapold believes that West cannot create any tension between the action scenes. The film becomes a series of sulks and wallops, which even Tucci's casino boss character and Hope Davis' blackjack dealer character cannot save. Variety's Scott Foundas says the film has a lively opening scene but fails to maintain the momentum throughout, ambling episodically from vigilante revenge fantasy to mismatched buddy movie. The plot's \\"disparate narrative strands\\" never really come together, and although Tucci and Davis provide the only unpredictable sparks, the movie is generally less wild than staid. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Jason Statham movies, you might enjoy Wild Card for its action-packed fight scenes and some standout performances. However, critics widely agree that the film lacks compelling storytelling and leaves much to be desired in terms of cohesive plotlines."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Of course, the most unforgettable classmate I had was also the most vicious bully. I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner? He was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him. Most definitely the most unforgettable classmate. Question: At the end of the story, the bully is probably: Options: A. Now a teacher B. Now an article writer C.

Way back in 2006, when Facebook was a young whelp and I had a newborn who steadfastly refused to sleep at night, I would sit and connect with old friends from university and high school, many of whom I had not seen or spoken with in more than a decade. One of those people was Scott. Scott was a super nice guy. He was a year ahead of me at university. He was a bit socially awkward but you really couldn’t hope to meet a more genuine individual. Like most people, Scott had had some ups and downs in his life. At some point he found religion. Like he really, really found it. Now, I am somewherere between an agnostic and an atheist but my attitude is generally live and let live. But Scott couldn’t do that. Almoost every day he would send me some sort of message. “What do you pray about?” I don’t. “God loves you, he gave his son for you, why don’t you love Him?” Because I don’t believe He or his Son exist. “What are you going to say when you die and stand before Satan instead of God?” Missed that by a mile, didn’t I? This went on for a few months. His questions became increasing unhinged and the only thing that mattered to him were his beliefs. Mine were of no consequence. I had asked him, politely at first and then more assertively, to stop bombarding me with his attempts to convert me or to witness to me. All to no avail. Finally, I’d had enough and decided I had better things to do. I pulled the plug and unfriended Scott. He’s sent me several friend requests over the years, all of which I have summarily ignored.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many points were scored in the second half?","completion":"Title: A Deep Dive into Second Half Scoring: An Analysis of Points Scored in Basketball Introduction Basketball is a game that keeps its fans on the edge of their seats with its fast-paced nature and high-scoring performances. However, when reflecting on a match, many enthusiasts may find themselves asking, \\"How many points were scored in the second half?\\" In this article, we will dive into various aspects of second half scoring and understand its significance in determining the outcome of a basketball game. Understanding Basketball Scoring To grasp the concept of second half scoring, it is important to first understand the basic structure of a basketball game. A standard game is divided into four quarters of 12 minutes each in the NBA, while college basketball has two 20-minute halves. The sum of points scored in the third and fourth quarters (or just the second half in college basketball) makes up the \\"second half scoring.\\" Significance of Second Half Scoring The second half is often seen as a crucial period for teams, as it is an opportunity to make adjustments and shift momentum. Coaches analyze their opponents' first-half performance and make strategic changes to exploit weaknesses and capitalize on strengths. Therefore, it becomes essential for teams to maintain or improve their level of play in the second half and respond effectively to the opponent's adjustments. Factors Influencing Second Half Scoring 1. Fatigue: As the game progresses, players' energy levels tend to deplete, affecting their performance and decision-making abilities. Teams that can manage their stamina better have a higher chance of scoring more points in the second half. 2. Coaching Adjustments: The strategic changes that coaches make during halftime play a significant role in determining second half scoring. Those who can read the game better and adapt quickly are more likely to see an increase in scoring from their team. 3. Bench Depth: A deep bench is essential to maintain a high-level of play throughout the game. When the starting five players tire, a strong bench can step up and contribute to scoring, ensuring a continuous flow of points. 4. Psychological Factors: The mental state of the players can also impact second half scoring. A team that is behind at halftime might be motivated to catch up, leading to an aggressive offensive approach and potentially more points. Calculating Second Half Scoring To calculate the points scored in the second half, follow these steps: 1. Record the scores at the end of the first half. 2. Record the final scores at the end of the game. 3. Subtract the first half scores from the final scores for each team. 4. Add the resulting numbers for both teams. Example: First Half: Team A - 50 points, Team B - 45 points Final Scores: Team A - 105 points, Team B - 98 points Second Half Scoring: Team A: 105 - 50 = 55 points Team B: 98 - 45 = 53 points Total Second Half Points: 55 (Team A) + 53 (Team B) = 108 points Conclusion In conclusion, the points scored in the second half is a key aspect of the overall performance of a basketball team. With various factors such as fatigue, coaching adjustments, bench depth, and psychological factors influencing the outcome, the second half can make or break a team's chances of success. As every game is different, it is essential for fans and analysts to carefully consider the aforementioned factors when trying to understand and predict second half scoring patterns in basketball."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Question: \\"What doesn't UTC have to do twice a year?\\" Context: \\"Some applications standardize on UTC to avoid problems with clock shifts and time zone differences. Likewise, most modern operating systems internally handle and store all times as UTC and only convert to local time for display.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) doesn't have to adjust for daylight saving time (DST) twice a year. In many countries, local clocks are set forward by one hour in the spring (\\"spring forward\\") and set back one hour in the fall (\\"fall back\\") to extend evening daylight in the summer. This is known as daylight saving time. UTC, however, is the time standard used in aviation, computing, navigation, weather forecasting, and many other fields. It stays constant all year round and does not change due to daylight saving. Therefore, it does not have to \\"spring forward\\" or \\"fall back\\" like other time zones do. This is one reason why it's common for computer systems and applications to internally handle and store times in UTC, as stated in your context. By using a time standard that doesn't change, it helps to avoid potential confusion or problems caused by these daylight saving adjustments, such as those that could arise with syncing data or scheduling tasks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who thinks someone in the lab is apart of the heist? Maharis A:","completion":"Step 1: Establish the main characters - Maharis, a skilled and perceptive forensic investigator at a high-tech lab - Dr. Cooper, the brilliant yet mysterious head scientist of the lab - Jenny, an enthusiastic and dedicated lab technician who is new to the team - Detective Smith, a seasoned detective who is working closely with Maharis and the team on a high-profile heist case Step 2: Set up the heist background The plot begins with the aftermath of a daring, high-profile heist, where a team of skilled criminals manages to steal a valuable prototype from a top-secret facility. The heist leaves very little evidence behind, and the authorities are left puzzled about how the thieves pulled it off. Step 3: Introduce the lab connection Due to the nature of the heist and the advanced technology used by the criminals, the authorities turn to an advanced, privately-funded forensic lab to help crack the case. Maharis, Dr. Cooper, and Jenny are part of the team that is tasked with analyzing the scarce evidence from the crime scene and figuring out how the criminals managed to pull off the heist. Step 4: Maharis gets suspicious Maharis, being very observant and skilled in his craft, starts noticing small inconsistencies in the lab findings and has a nagging feeling that someone in the lab might be involved in the heist. Initially, these inconsistencies are dismissed by Dr. Cooper as errors or coincidences, but Maharis becomes more and more convinced that the connection is real. Step 5: Investigate the lab members As Maharis shares his suspicions with Detective Smith, they start conducting a covert investigation into the lab's staff, looking into backgrounds and searching for any potential links to the heist. Jenny becomes an early suspect due to her recent arrival, but Maharis is reluctant to suspect her, as they have developed a close friendship during the investigation. Step 6: Conflicting loyalties Throughout the story, Maharis struggles with his dedication to solving the case and his loyalty to his colleagues, unsure of whom to trust. He tries to balance his investigative work with his growing relationship with Jenny, while also trying to maintain his professional relationship with Dr. Cooper. Step 7: The revelation As the investigation unfolds, Maharis uncovers a link between Dr. Cooper and the heist's mastermind, revealing that Dr. Cooper had been secretly providing information and technology to the criminals to help them pull off the heist. Maharis confronts Dr. Cooper, who attempts to justify his actions, saying that the stolen prototype holds important information that could revolutionize the world and that the government was planning on using it for its own gain, rather than sharing it with the public. Step 8: The culmination Maharis is left with a difficult decision – bring Dr. Cooper to justice or help him expose the government's dark secrets. Maharis decides to do both, by arresting Dr. Cooper for his involvement in the heist, but simultaneously making the information contained in the stolen prototype public. This choice allows Maharis to uphold the law while also acting in the best interest of the general public. Step 9: Resolution With Dr. Cooper's arrest and the release of the prototype's information, Maharis sees significant changes in the scientific community and government policies. Jenny, now cleared of suspicion, remains a close, trusted friend of Maharis. The movie ends with Maharis reflecting on the consequences and realizing that his actions have made a lasting positive impact on society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In one study,researchers in the United States examined information on more than 1000 people.The people had taken part in a long-term study of sleep disorders. Some people slept less than five hours a night.They had 15 percent higher blood levels of a hormone called ghrelin than people who slept eight hours.And they had 15 percent less of the hormone leptin.Experts say ghrelin helps make people feel hungry;leptin makes you feel full. The scientists say these hormonal changes may be a cause of obesity in Western societies.They note the combination that limitation is common and is widely available. The results were not affected by how much people exercised.People who are awake longer have more time to burn energy.But the researchers say loss of sleep may increase hunger especially for high-calorie foods,so people gain weight.It seems that,for survival,the body may be designed to store more fat during times with less sleep. Researchers from Stanford University in California and the University of Wisconsin did the study.They found that the best amount of sleep for weight control is 7.7 hours a night.

Dutch woman Hendrikje van Andel-Schipper was born in 1890 and became the word's oldest person in May 2004 before her death in August the following year. What made her even more remarkable was the fact she remained mentally sharp right up until her death. Miracle: Scientists are examining the DNA of Hendrikje van. Andel-Schipper to try and discover how she remained so mentally sharp until her. death aged 115. She showed no signs of Alzheimer's disease which most experts assume would be inevitable for someone of her years. Nor did she suffer from may other conditions normally associated with people who live over the age of 100 such as hardening of the arteries. The Dutch woman has become the oldest person to have her complete genetic code sequenced. Now, six years after her death she has become the oldest person to have her complete genetic code sequenced as scientists hope to unlock the secrets to her good health and longevity. Ms van Andel-Schipper was an avid supporter of Ajax Football Club and attributed her old age to not smoking, pickled herrings and limiting alcohol to 'a small advocaat with cream on Sundays and holidays'. A team from VU University medical centre in Amsterdam have now begun comparing her DNA in an attempt to understand how genetic mutations develop in blood and brain tissue. Dr Henne Holstege, who is leading the study, said she hoped to discover if it was Ms van Andel-Schipper's genes that protected her from common age-related conditions or if it was down to other factors. Following her death in 2006 Ms van Andel-Schipper's brain was examined by Dr Holstege's father Gert, a neuroscientist at the Universtiy of Groningen, who was shocked to discover no signs of Alzeimers or dementia. He said: 'That came as something of a surprise. 'Everybody was thinking that when you have a brain over 100 years, you have a lot of problems. 'This is the first (extremely old) brain that did not have these problems.' In 1972, the then 82-year-old Van Andel called the University of Groningen in order to donate her body to science. She called them again at age 111 because she worried she might no longer be of interest. Dr Holstege senior tested her mental. abilities at the age of 112 and 113 and although she had problems with. her eyesight, she was alert and performed better than the average 60 to. 75-year-old. Keys to a long life: Ms Van Andel-Schipper's advised no smoking, a glass of Advocaat on Sundays and plenty of pickled herring. The project to fully sequence her genome using Life Technologies' Solid sequencing platform begun a year ago and the results were presented at the International Congress of Human Genetics in Montreal yesterday. Ms van Andel-Schipper was born prematurely weighing only 3.5 pounds and her family feared she wouldn't survive. She lived at home until the age of 47 and married tax inspector Dick van Andel who died in 1959. She had no children. All her siblings lived past 70, and her mother died at the age of 100. She finally died of gastric cancer having already survived breast cancer. Asked what advice she would give to people who want to live a long time, she once quipped: 'Keep breathing.'

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The financial crisis is reminding Americans of a lesson they first learned in childhood: Share and share alike. They are sharing or swapping tools and books, cars and handbags, time and talent. The renewed desire to share shows up in a variety of examples: A car-sharing service has had a 70 percent membership increase since the crisis occurred. Some companies encouraged his employees to take vanpooling. Governments are putting bikes on the street for public use. How-to-swap Web sites are increasing quickly. The economy reflects the way Americans have cut back, especially on daily items: Department store sales dropped 1.3 percent in June. People are not buying cars, and as a result, auto sales dropped 27.7 percent last month. They are not paying others to do what they can do themselves -- Home Depot reports increased attendance at in-store do-it-yourself clinics. And although paint sales are down in general, according to Sherwin-Williams, individual consumers are still buying. When Tom Burdett needed to cut some tiles at his home outside Annapolis, he refused to buy expensive tools. So he asked his neighbors and friends for help. Sure enough, someone had just what he needed. And when that friend needed help fixing a satellite dish, Burdett volunteered to help. The sharing mind-set is not new to the American culture, but many Americans give it up when the nation changed from an agricultural society to an industrial one, said Rosemary Hornak, a psychology professor at Meredith College in Raleigh, N.C. They moved farther from their families and did not have time to connect with new neighbors because they worked so much, she said. Neighborhood conversations tell more of the story as the movement grows organically in communities across the Washington region and the nation. On one street in Arlington, for example, neighbors are collecting their separate money for mulch and dividing it among themselves. Question: What is the text mainly about? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The text is mainly about how the financial crisis has led Americans to adopt a sharing mindset and engage in sharing or swapping various items and services, such as tools, books, cars, and talents. This has resulted in an increase in car-sharing services, vanpooling, and other initiatives to save money and reduce spending on daily items.

Here's a question: If there is a stale smell in the air coming from the kitchen, what should one check for the source of the smell? Here are possible answers to this question: - bathroom - house - cupboard - space shuttle - surface of earth I believe the correct choice is \\"cupboard\\", here's why: A:","completion":"The stale smell in the air coming from the kitchen may have various possible sources, but among the options you have provided, the most likely source is the \\"cupboard\\". Let's explore each of these options and the reasoning behind the correct choice: 1. Bathroom: While it is possible for smells to travel between rooms, if the smell is specifically noticed in the kitchen, it is less likely to be originating from the bathroom. Bathrooms have their own specific odors, typically related to moisture and plumbing issues. In this situation, the source of the smell is likely to be kitchen-related. 2. House: While the entire house could be the source of the smell, this option is rather vague and broad. A stale smell could be related to various factors throughout the home, such as dampness, poor ventilation, or mold. However, since the smell has been specifically identified as coming from the kitchen, it's essential to narrow down the search to that area. 3. Cupboard: This is the most likely source of the smell among the options provided. Food items, particularly perishables, are often stored in kitchen cupboards. It's possible that something has spoiled, expired, or been forgotten in the cupboard, leading to the stale smell. It's important to check the cupboard, remove any items that may be causing the odor, and clean the area thoroughly to freshen the air. 4. Space Shuttle: This is an unlikely source of the smell, as it is not related to the kitchen or the home environment. While there could be odors in a space shuttle, they have no direct connection to the stale smell in your kitchen. 5. Surface of Earth: Similar to the \\"space shuttle\\" option, this is not relevant to the situation. The surface of the earth is broad and includes various sources of odors, but it is not specific enough to pinpoint the cause of the stale smell in the kitchen. In conclusion, the correct choice for the source of the stale smell coming from the kitchen is the \\"cupboard\\". Reasons for this include the spoilage or expiration of food items that may have been stored in the cupboard. It's essential to inspect the contents of the cupboard, remove any offending items, and clean the area thoroughly to eliminate the smell and improve the air quality in the kitchen. Keep in mind that there may be other sources of smells in the kitchen, so if the smell persists after addressing the cupboard, it could be necessary to further investigate other areas, such as the refrigerator, pantry, or garbage disposal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are many different kinds of heroes, but they all seem to have two things in common. First, heroes, by their actions, show the great possibilities of human nature. Second, heroes can also stand the test of time, and their achievements will not be easily forgotten. Because of these good points, we need to choose our heroes carefully. Olympic sports star Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who is believed to be a hero, warns young people to be careful of making athletes heroes. She hopes that if someone tries to copy her, it will be because she has achieved her goals by working hard. Joyner-Kersee says that a hero should be someone who has an influence on another person's life. Poet Maya Angelou believes that a hero encourages people to treat others well and to be concerned about the greater good. A hero should show politeness, courage, patience, and strength all the time. A hero should encourage others to follow him with actions that improve the world, even if only in small ways. Author Daniel Boorstin suggests that, \\" _ are people who make news, but heroes are people who make history.\\" Thus, if a person is truly worthy to be called a hero, he or she will not be soon forgotten. We all need heroes. We need to be able to respect people who have been there, done that, and succeeded. Many times the greatest heroes are the people we deal with every day -- relatives , friends, and neighbors -- who will keep going when it is easier to give up. The parent who puts her or his family ahead of herself or himself, the teacher who will make more money at another job but chooses to help others -- all these people can be considered as heroes.

Shorten led Labor at the 2016 federal election at which the Liberal/National Coalition retained majority government. - The Premier of New South Wales is the head of government in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The Government of New South Wales follows the Westminster system, with a Parliament of New South Wales acting as the legislature. The Premier is appointed by the Governor of New South Wales, and by modern convention holds office by virtue of his or her ability to command the support of a majority of members of the lower house of Parliament, the Legislative Assembly. - New South Wales (abbreviated as NSW) is a state on the east coast of :Australia. It borders Queensland to the north, Victoria to the south, and South Australia to the west. It has a coast line with the Tasman Sea on its east side. The Australian Capital Territory is an enclave within the state. New South Wales' state capital is Sydney, which is also Australia's most populous city. , the estimated population of New South Wales was 7.5 million, making it Australia's most populous state. Just under two-thirds of the state's population, 4.67 million, live in the Greater Sydney area. Inhabitants of New South Wales are referred to as \\"New South Welshmen\\". - Sydney is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania. Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds the world's largest natural harbour, and sprawls towards the Blue Mountains to the west. Residents of Sydney are known as \\"Sydneysiders\\". Sydney is the second official seat and second official residence of the Governor-General of Australia and the Prime Minister of Australia and many federal ministries maintain substantial presences in Sydney. - Neville Kenneth Wran, (11 October 1926 20 April 2014) was the Premier of New South Wales from 1976 to 1986.

Among these representatives, the members of the lower house of Parliament, known as the Legislative Assembly, hold the key to determining the appointment of the Premier of New South Wales. The Premier of New South Wales is the head of government in the state and by modern convention, holds office by virtue of his or her ability to command the support of a majority of members of the Legislative Assembly. This usually means that the leader of the political party or coalition with the most seats in the Legislative Assembly becomes the Premier. In summary, the New South Wales state election plays a crucial role in determining which individual will become the Premier of New South Wales, as it is through this election process that the political party or coalition with the majority in the Legislative Assembly is identified – and it is the leader of this majority party or coalition who assumes the role of Premier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the Southwest became part of the U.S., explorers continued to look for good east–west routes along the 35th parallel. In 1853, a crew led by U.S. Army Lieutenant Amiel Whipple surveyed along a sandy wash in the northern part of the Petrified Forest. So impressed was Whipple by the petrified wood along the banks of the arroyo that he named it Lithodendron Creek (Stone Tree Creek). Geologist Jules Marcou, a member of the Whipple expedition, observed that the petrified trees were from the Triassic.A slightly later route along the parallel was a wagon road, built between 1857 and 1860, that involved experimental use of camels as transport. In the late 19th century, settlers and private stagecoach companies followed similar east–west routes. Homesteaders who stayed in the area developed cattle ranches on the grasslands, and cattle grazed in the Petrified Forest until the mid-20th century.Also close to the 35th parallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the founding of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route 66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985. The park has preserved within its boundaries a small grassy section of the road. Interstate 40, which crosses the park, replaced the older highway.

From the moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was met with a warm and welcoming ambiance as the soothing tunes of light jazz played in the background. The beautiful combination of dim lighting and contemporary decor created a perfect dining atmosphere. The staff at 'Culinary Delights' were attentive, knowledgeable, and professional. Our waiter, Mark, provided excellent suggestions which helped guide our meal choices to suit our preferences, ensuring an unforgettable gastronomic experience. We began our gastronomical journey with a plate of assorted artisanal cheeses paired perfectly with a selection of fine wines, which Mark had recommended. We then delved into beautifully presented and delightful appetizers, such as the crispy calamari and a creamy, rich lobster bisque which we couldn't help but rave about. The star of the show was undoubtedly the main course. I opted for the slow-cooked lamb shank, which was cooked to perfection, melt-in-your-mouth tender, and bursting with exquisite flavors. My partner settled for the pan-seared sea bass, served with asparagus, saffron-infused risotto and a delectable lemon-butter sauce that truly elevated the dish to gastronomic heights. And let's not forget the dessert – a rich yet balanced white chocolate raspberry cheesecake that ended the meal on an indelible high. Our taste buds were thoroughly satisfied, and we left already eager to plan our next visit. In conclusion, 'Culinary Delights' surpassed all expectations, resulting in a truly memorable evening of remarkable flavors and impeccable service.

She sang the theme song under the pseudonym Ellen Shaw, a decision she made due to contractual obligations and concerns about how her involvement with the children's show might affect her image. Despite this, her distinctive voice and style are instantly recognizable in the theme song. The show's creator, Paul Reubens, confirmed in interviews over the years that Lauper was indeed the vocalist behind the theme song. Pee-wee's Playhouse was an innovative and colorful children's program that aired from 1986 to 1990. The show was created by and starred Paul Reubens as the eccentric character Pee-wee Herman. The show was critically acclaimed for its unique approach to children's television during its time, and it quickly gained a cult following, with fans appreciating its mix of surreal humor, elaborate set designs, and pop-culture references. The show's theme song, \\"Pee-wee's Playhouse Theme,\\" perfectly encapsulated the whimsical and imaginative nature of the series. The lyrics, accompanied by Lauper's energetic vocals and Mothersbaugh's catchy melody, invited viewers to join Pee-wee and his friends in their magical playhouse, where anything could happen. The theme song remains a popular and memorable part of the show, and it continues to be a nostalgic favorite for those who grew up watching Pee-wee's Playhouse."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Experts believe the vessel could be the UB-85, a sub that sank in 1918, according to official records. However, naval folklore suggests it may have been attacked by a \\"sea monster\\". The entire crew of the U-boat is reported to have abandoned ship due to the \\"monster attack\\". Once aboard the British ship HM Drifter Coreopsis, their commander, Captain Krech described their encounter. He is said to have spoken of a beast with \\"large eyes, set in a horny sort of skullâ€¦with teeth that could be seen glistening in the moonlight\\". He apparently claimed that the sub was so damaged in its battle with the \\"monster\\", it could no longer submerge. However, Dr Innes McCartney, a historian and nautical archaeologist who helped identify the wreckage, does not believe the tale. \\"In reality, the real sea monster was the U-boat, here trying to sink ships,\\" he said. He added: \\"The submarine was caught on the surface at night, recharging its batteries. \\"It saw the patrol ship coming. It attempted to do a crash dive to get away. \\"Once the submarine was under water, it rapidly started flooding from above so they had no option but to blow all the compressed air they had, bring the submarine to the surface at which point all they could do was surrender.\\" The historian said tales of sea monsters and haunted U-boats came about due to secrecy surrounding exactly what happened during the first U-boat war which meant that period was \\"ripe for conspiracies\\". He said the stories were often concocted as a result of journalists and ex-Navy men \\"talking late at night, after having a nice time\\". Dr McCartney said there were at least 12 British and German submarines known to have sunk in the Irish Sea. He said: \\"The features of this particular wreck, which is largely intact, confirm it as a UBIII-Class submarine, of which we know of two which were lost in the area - the more famous UB-85 and its sister boat UB-82. \\"While I can conclude that this wreck is likely to be one or the other, they would be practically impossible to tell apart, aside from the numbers painted on them in service, now obviously long gone. \\"Unless a diver can find a shipyard stamp, we cannot say definitively, but yes, we're certainly closer to solving the so-called mystery of UB-85 and the reason behind its sinking - whether common mechanical failure or something that is less easily explained.\\" The historic discovery was made by engineers involved in the Â£1bn Western Link project to lay a subsea power line between Ayrshire and the Wirral. The 385km (239miles) long cable will carry renewable energy produced in Scotland to England and Wales. The engineers found the wreckage 120m north-west of the centre of the planned route, off the Stranraer coast. It is about 45m long, with debris spilling from the stern. Gary Campbell, the keeper of the Official Sightings Register of the Loch Ness Monster, said it was \\"entirely feasible\\" that a large sea creature disabled the submarine. \\"The World War One report from the captain of the British ship HMS Hilary a year earlier makes it clear that sea farers at that time were well aware of large sea 'monsters' that could be harmful to their ships,\\" he said. \\"The area of sea where the attack took place has a history of sea monster sightings - they have ranged from the north coast of Wales to Liverpool Bay. What the German captain said could well be true.\\" Scottish Power Transmission and the National Grid are working together on the Western Link project to lay the undersea cable. Peter Roper, of Scottish Power, said: \\"The images we get back from the subsea scans are incredibly detailed, but we obviously need to be aware of what lies beneath before we can start laying a power cable. \\"In all the years I have been building power lines, I can say that this is the most extraordinary discovery.\\" National Grid's Graham Edwards said: \\"The Western Link is a very significant project for the UK and has required careful planning in all aspects, but particularly in the laying of high-voltage cables in the sea, where we are working hard to minimise our impact on the environment. \\"During construction we take great care over archaeology, whether on land or at sea, and it's always exciting to record a significant find and help to shed new light on our history - especially one with such a good tale involved!\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"Remarkable sonar images have revealed a largely intact missing World War One submarine off the Galloway coast, believed to be the UB-85, which sank in 1918.

While posing in our costumes the night before, we knew something was wrong, just not how wrong. Grandma's house was the central gathering place of my family. Sunday lunches, birthday dinners, Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas -- all were our traditions, with her as hostess. While my parents were busy running their small business, there were many nights when Grandma fed me and put me to bed in her spare room, until they came to get me. I spent my summers at Grandma's and I went everywhere with her. I couldn't imagine a time when she wouldn't be around me. Then November 1, 1991 began her month-long stay in the hospital--she suffered from a rare infection called nocardia asteroides. After being born in the year of the Great Depression, living through World War II, raising three kids, and being widowed at the age of 48, Grandma never expected to live into her seventies. The infection in her brain seemed to confirm that she wasn't long for this world. But that's not the end of her story. A team of doctors successfully removed the abscess , and Grandma even made it into a local medical journal. Her doctor called her \\"the brain lady\\". Grandma celebrated her 85thbirthday in March this year. In the almost 23 years since her recovery, she's seen two of her four grandchildren get married and welcomed three great-grandsons. Although they damage something in her house, she loves it when my two boys come over. And while I know they make her day, seeing her love blossom for another generation makes my day too.

India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives.

They weren’t necessarily mad, as in crazy, but they were very angry. They were large dogs, and they attacked my legs, knocking me down. I knew it was very dangerous to be down on the ground, as I was most vulnerable. I covered my genitalia, my neck and my face, as I struggled to regain my feet. Fortunately, during my fall, I saw a large tree branch on the ground near me. I grabbed it, and starting beating the dogs with it. I managed to land a few good hits. As I was hitting the dogs, their owner (my client) came outside, stood on her porch and laughed at me. When she saw me hitting her dogs with a stick, she called the dogs off of me. I asked her why her dogs attacked me, and why she laughed at me. She said that she had just given her dogs a big steak bone and they were upset when I came near and attacked me. I asked her why she would set me up in this way when she knew I was on the way over. She admitted that she wanted to see what happened, and she said that when she saw what happened she thought that it was funny. I did not keep the appointment with her.

It turns out, one of our friends has created a fake account, bringing laughter and amusement to our social media experience. In this article, we'll take you through the process of creating a fake Facebook account, choosing a legacy contact, getting a few willing friends in on the prank, sending in a memorialization request, and waiting for the confirmation. Please note that this is solely for entertainment purposes and should be carried out responsibly and respecting Facebook's terms of use. Step 1: Create a Fake Facebook Account The first step in this prank is to create a fake Facebook account. Keep in mind that while creating this account, you should avoid using any real information to maintain the lighthearted nature of the prank. Be creative and have fun with the name, perhaps choosing a hilarious pun or a well-known fictional character. Once you have filled out the required fields and agreed to Facebook's terms, your fake account is ready. Step 2: Choose a Legacy Contact A legacy contact is someone who manages the account of a person who has passed away. In the context of this prank, you'll want to choose a close friend who is in on the joke and is willing to take on the role of your legacy contact. It is essential to communicate clearly with your chosen friend to ensure that they understand their responsibilities and the prank's purpose. Step 3: Get a Few Willing Friends To add authenticity to your fake account, you'll want to get a few friends in on the prank. These friends will be responsible for interacting with the account and providing some social proof that the account exists. Ask these friends to send friend requests and engage with your fake account's posts and photos to create the illusion that this account is real and active. Remind these friends of the prank's purpose and to keep it lighthearted. Step 4: Send in a Memorialization Request Once you've established your fake account and garnered some willing friends, it's time to take the prank to the next level. Navigate to Facebook's Help Center and locate the memorialization request form. Fill out the necessary information, including the fake account's URL, your relationship to the account owner, and the date of passing. Be sure to use a fake date of passing that is consistent with the account's activity. Step 5: Wait for the Confirmation After submitting your memorialization request, it's time to wait for Facebook to review it and send a confirmation. During this time, keep your friends updated on the prank's progress, and remind them of their roles in maintaining the account's authenticity. Once you receive the confirmation from Facebook, your prank will officially be listed as a memorialized account, creating a unique, lighthearted memory that you and your friends can look back on and cherish. Conclusion By following these steps, you and your friends can create a memorable prank by faking a Facebook legacy account. Remember to keep the prank lighthearted and fun, and ensure that all participants are aware of their roles in the prank. Enjoy the process, and take pride in creating a memorable, shared experience for your friend group."},{"prompt":"Is this product review positive? Title: a downward spiral.

David Frum: GOP effort to defund Obama's health plan is going nowhere. He says it makes more sense to focus on the key flaws of Obamacare. Republicans should push to make sure the plan has cost-control features, he says. He says it makes sense to broaden funding so most Americans pay for it. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Focus on the Flaws: A Better Approach for the GOP to Tackle Obamacare The Republican's ongoing campaign to defund and ultimately dismantle the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare, has been met with staunch resistance and limited success. Notably, conservative commentator David Frum argues that this strategy is ultimately a dead-end for the GOP and recommends a more pragmatic approach. Rather than fruitlessly pursuing the quixotic goal of dismantling President Obama's landmark health reform legislation, Frum suggests that Republicans should instead focus their efforts on identifying and addressing the key flaws within the legislation. This approach has the potential to be both more effective and beneficial as the GOP engages in a constructive dialogue aimed at improving the law, rather than just seeking to destroy it. One of the most pressing issues the GOP should address within the Affordable Care Act is the lack of substantial cost-control measures. Although the legislation, at its core, seeks to improve access to healthcare for millions of Americans, long-term sustainability is a critical concern for the current system. Enacting cost-control features would not only ensure that the program remains financially viable, but it would also help reduce the overall cost of healthcare for both the government and individuals. By focusing on this aspect, Republicans can demonstrate their fiscal responsibility and contribute valuable ideas to help maintain the United States' commitment to accessible healthcare. In addition to cost-control measures, Frum emphasizes the importance of developing a more widespread and sustainable funding system for the Affordable Care Act. Currently, the financial burden of the legislation is shouldered primarily by higher-income Americans through various taxes and fees. Frum argues that broadening funding sources to include a larger share of the American population would distribute the cost more equitably, ensuring the continuation of the program and easing the financial pressure on any one group. In this context, Republicans could promote the idea of a broader funding base as consistent with their core principle of fairness. By calling for more widespread financial contributions, the GOP would be framing its approach as a matter of each American doing their part to contribute to the collective goal of providing accessible healthcare to those in need. This narrative could resonate with many Americans from various political backgrounds, which is a testament to the wisdom of Frum's approach. By shifting their focus from the outright repeal of Obamacare to addressing its shortcomings, Republicans have the opportunity to present themselves as responsible stewards of the nation's healthcare system. As Frum suggests, engaging in constructive dialogue and refining the law would not only better serve the interests of the American people, but it could also forge a more unified approach to healthcare reform. Instead of continuing the polarizing and ultimately futile effort to defund Obamacare entirely, Republicans would be wise to heed David Frum's advice. Addressing the program's key flaws, implementing cost-control measures, and advocating for broader funding would demonstrate the GOP's commitment to meaningful and sustainable healthcare reform. This pragmatic approach could yield tangible improvements to the law that benefits millions of people across the political spectrum, enhancing the quality of healthcare for all Americans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rick Scott signed into law Tuesday. “The goal of this is to make sure we don’t waste taxpayers’ money,” Scott said. “And hopefully more people will focus on not using illegal drugs.” The new law fulfills a campaign pledge from Scott, but has raised legal questions. The ACLU of Florida has signaled it might sue over the law. “Once again, this governor has demonstrated his dismissal of both the law and the right of Floridians to personal privacy by signing into law a bill that treats those who have lost their jobs like suspected criminals,” said ACLU of Florida director Howard Simon. The law, which goes into effect on July 1, will mean about 4,400 drug tests per month, according to the Department of Children & Families. Taxpayers will reimburse welfare applicants for negative drug tests, which can cost between 10 and 25. Positive tests will carry an immediate six-month ban on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. A second positive test will result in a three-year ban on state assistance. Other details in the law: • The Department of Children & Families must inform applicants that they can avoid a drug test if they do not apply for benefits. • The state must assure each applicant “a reasonable degree of dignity while producing and submitting a sample.” • Parents who fail drug tests can get benefits for their children by naming a state-approved designee to collect the money. That designee must also pass a drug test. About 233,000 Floridians applied for cash assistance in 2009-10, including 114,000 families, according to DCF statistics. This month, 93,170 Floridians received cash assistance, a drop of 8.3 percent from a year ago. Scott on Tuesday also signed a bill banning fake bath salts that could be ingested as drugs. The legislation was pushed by Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. ||||| When Gov. Rick Scott signed the welfare drug testing bill Tuesday, he referred to it as a way for taxpayers to make sure their money is spent properly. \\"We want to give people an incentive to not use drugs. As we know, more people on public assistance use drugs than the public at large so hopefully this will give them another reason not to use drugs,\\" said Governor Scott. One day later, the new law is already under attack. The Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has filed a federal lawsuit, claiming the bill violates people’s fourth amendement rights. \\"It’s not even random drug testing. It's drug testing of all people who apply for public assistance and you can't do that without suspicion of something,\\" said President of the Greater Bay Area of the ACLU, Bill Pritchard. Department of Children and Families spokesperson, Terri Durdaller, believes the law will help curb drug abuse. \\"From the departments standpoint, the positives are that we are being respectful of tax dollars and that we're truly getting drug-addicted parents the services that they need,\\" said Durdaller. And the Governor is standing but the new policy. \\"The drug screen of welfare recipients will absolutely withhold, be withheld constitutionally. It's the right thing for taxpayers. It's the right thing for the citizens of the state that need public assistance. We don't want to waste any money,\\" said Governor Scott. The drug testing only applies to those receiving money from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. It does not apply to people receiving food stamps although Scott says the state may consider that in the future. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"In Florida, people who want to get cash help from the state government now have to take a drug test first. The governor, Rick Scott, signed a new law that makes it necessary for people to give samples of their urine, blood, or hair for drug testing. He says that this will make sure that the state's money is not wasted, and it will encourage people to not use illegal drugs. However, some people think that this law is unfair and not respectful of people's privacy. Now, about 4,400 drug tests will be done each month. If people pass the drug test, the state will pay them back for the test's cost. But if they fail the test, they won't get any help for six months. If they fail the test again, they won't get help for three years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Set your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit, or 160 degrees Celsius. Move the racks to the middle position. Scrub the potatoes under running water to remove dirt, and cut off any green areas. You can leave the flavorful skin on, or peel it if you prefer a uniform appearance. Russets and Yukon Gold are two good options for this recipe. Avoid waxy or boiling varieties, since these tend to fall apart or cook unevenly. Uneven slices are much more difficult to cook, since the thin slices will burn before the thick ones are ready. Use a mandoline set to ⅛ inch (3 mm), or a slicing disc attachment on a food processor. If you don't have either of these, sharpen a knife as much as possible and cut by hand. Keep the mandoline surface wet to keep the starch from sticking to the surface. Use a corrugated knife or mandoline blade if you prefer wavy chips. This size makes a thick-cut, crunchy chip, similar to store-bought kettle-cooked chips. You can cut the slices thinner with mandoline, but thin slices burn more easily. Starch molecules are essentially long chains of sugar, and just like sugar, they caramelize and turn brown when heated. If you prefer a light-colored potato chip with no burnt flavors, parboil the slices first to get rid of some starch: For every two large or three medium potatoes, combine 2 quarts (2 liters) water and 2 tbsp (30 mL) white vinegar in a large pot. The vinegar stops the potatoes falling apart. Bring to a boil. Add potato slices and cook for exactly three minutes. Cook for one or two minutes instead if slices are thinner than ⅛ inch (3 mm). Drain potatoes and transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Pat dry, then leave on paper towels for five minutes to finish drying. Move slices occasionally for even drying. Grease heavy-gauge baking sheets or roasting pans with a light layer of olive oil, butter, or cooking spray. Thin, lightweight baking sheets may warp in the oven or burn the chips. If these are your only option, let the sheets warm in the oven as it preheats, and cover the entire surface with chips. Brush or spray on a little bit more oil or butter over the slices, or just flip them over once on the greased pan. See below for additional flavor ideas. Check on the chips frequently, since the cooking time can be unpredictable due to differences in potato variety. Rotate the pan halfway through for even cooking. Remove chips as soon as they are completely dry and the edges are starting to turn golden brown. You can leave them to brown a little more if you prefer them that way. If some slices brown more quickly than others, remove them with tongs and continue baking the rest. This cooking time is for ⅛\\" (3mm) slices. Thicker slices may take much longer to cook. Transfer your homemade baked potato chips onto paper towels to absorb the excess grease. Leave them uncovered to finish crisping as they cool. Homemade potato chips will turn soft sooner than store-bought chips. Keep leftovers in airtight containers in a dry, cool location.

She is dressed in casual, comfortable clothing suitable for chores and has her hair tied up in a ponytail to keep it out of her face. The kitchen is modern and spacious with hints of a minimalist design, which gives a sense of cleanliness and order. The most logical next event in this scenario is as follows: After the woman has spent a considerable amount of time scrubbing and removing any dirt, stains, or debris from the sink area, she will move on to another part of the kitchen that requires cleaning. Based on the location of the sink on the island, she is likely surrounded by other frequently used appliances and surfaces. This may include the stovetop, oven, countertops, or refrigerator. The woman will take the cleaning supplies and begin to inspect the stovetop for any burnt or dried food particles. She may first use a paper towel to wipe away any loose particles. Once the larger debris has been removed, she will spray the stovetop with a cleaning solution, allowing it to soak for a moment to help break down any stubborn stains or grease. While waiting for the cleaner to work, she may take this opportunity to look around the kitchen to evaluate what other tasks need to be accomplished. Returning to the stovetop, the woman will scrub with the sponge, focusing on any particularly grimy areas. She might be using circular motions, applying a bit of elbow grease to ensure everything is thoroughly cleaned. Afterward, she will rinse the sponge and wipe down the stovetop once more to remove any residue from the cleaning solution. After ensuring that the stovetop is spotless, she proceeds to clean the oven. Depending on the type of oven, she might use a specialized cleaner or the same solution used for the stovetop. She would then scrub the interior, paying close attention to the racks and any problematic areas. Following this, she could tackle the oven door, ensuring no marks are left behind. Taking a step back to survey her work, the woman moves on to the countertops, spraying them with an appropriate cleaning solution. She might first clear any clutter, dishes, or cookware that obstruct access to the countertops. Using the sponge, she'll wipe the countertops clean, focusing on any indentations or areas where crumbs may accumulate. Finally, the woman will clean the front of the refrigerator, likely using a damp cloth or paper towel, and the appropriate cleaning solution. She may also decide to clean the inside shelves and compartments, especially if any spills or food particles are present. After successfully completing her kitchen cleaning, she may move on to other rooms or take a break and enjoy the sense of accomplishment from her newly spotless kitchen. The woman's determination and attention to detail throughout her task will ensure she achieves the desired level of cleanliness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. N.B.A. Finals â Russell Westbrookâs Nerd Glasses The shirt, adorned with images of singing and dancing hipsters dressed in funky pastels — suspended in a jazzy jam session of horn and bass players, with random cars zooming past — was an N.B.A. finals fashion statement begging to go viral. Westbrook tied together the ensemble with what has become his signature accessory, a pair of lensless oversize red eyeglass frames, which make him look like a cross between the preppy Carlton Banks of “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” and the geeky Steve Urkel of “Family Matters.” Yes, the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Miami Heat have more at stake than determining who has the keener sense of style. But their postgame stage doubles as a runway of sorts for competing geek-chic styles that have become the rage in a league that was put under a dress code in 2005. Call it retro (and it is). Call it an ode to the geek, a nerdy blast from the past with pseudo-metrosexual overtones and hip-hop influences by Lil Wayne, Chris Brown and Kanye West. Call it a backlash that evolved from Commissioner David Stern’s edict seven years ago as the N.B.A. fought to save its image after the brawl between the Indiana Pacers and the Detroit Pistons (perhaps a judgment better left to sports cultural experts). But do not call it a trend originated by Westbrook, who nonetheless claimed ownership of the eyewear-as-accessory movement Wednesday. “I’ve been wearing glasses since I’ve been in the league,” he said. “I think everybody else just started wearing them now.” LeBron James offered a bemused look when informed of that E! News flash. “No, that’s not right,” James said. “There’s no stories behind it. It’s a look. It’s a fashion thing. But he absolutely didn’t start it. I know I’ve been wearing mine for about two years now. I don’t know who started it. None of us started it. It could have started back in the ’70s or ’80s. Fashion comes and goes over decades.” Dwyane Wade was slightly demure on the subject. “I’m sure it was done,” Wade said. “Spike Lee has been wearing glasses for a long time. I don’t know if they’re prescription or not. Trends, they come and go, and people get on board with them or they don’t. With the nerd glasses in the N.B.A., it’s just something fun to do right now. I’m sure next season it’ll be out the window.” Still, the stars of these finals were preening post-Game 1 in their interpretations of the look. James exuded a detached South Beach cool with a pink checkered shirt, thin red tie and jeans overlapped with a suede lavender sport jacket. Kevin Durant bore a resemblance to Will Smith in “Men in Black,” parting the curtain for his postgame news conference in a black suit, white shirt and skinny black tie. “I just like ‘Men in Black,’ ” Durant said. Wade kept it casual with an all-black outfit, without a tie. He and Durant might have been headed to the same cocktail reception for the opening of an art gallery. Except for Westbrook, all included matching pocket squares. All, too, broke out the lensless eyeglass frames. To a man, they agreed they were not trying to make a cultural statement. “Just like everybody, we all have something that we like outside of what we do,” Wade said. Wade recalled how his father, a deliveryman, often made his rounds dressed in a suit, imparting a sense of work ethic and professionalism, not to mention style, to his son. “I just put a little spin on it, you know, have a little fun with it, and over the course of time my tastes have changed, and I take more risk,” said Wade, who has attended fashion shows in Paris and Milan, among other style capitals. Game 1 ensembles, though, seemed understated, suggesting an attempt to limit distractions. These are the finals, after all, and style and social networking appear to be secondary. Westbrook sent pictures of his outfits via Instagram before games early in these playoffs, but has not done so recently. Fashion aside, James has not posted any Twitter updates since April 27. Durant’s Twitter feed went dark after May 1. The glue, though, is the faux glasses. “It’s their swag,” said James Harden, whose elongated beard inspired its own Twitter account and Facebook page. “It’s funky, and it’s fresh. Some different styles with Russell, I don’t recommend. But that’s my guy.” Harden on Wednesday called the look “hip-hop and a kind of old-school blend mixed together.” Asked to weigh in, Serge Ibaka could only laugh and smile. “It’s his style. I can’t say nothing. If he thinks he looks good, he looks good. Why not?” Westbrook took the eyewear to another level during the Western Conference semifinals with the Los Angeles Lakers when he broke out a Lacoste fishing lures polo shirt — accessorized with the same lensless red frames he wore Tuesday night. That led to perhaps Westbrook’s best fashion quotation to date: “I see better without them,” he said, the day after igniting the Thunder in the third quarter, scoring 12 of his 27 points, and nearly pulling off a triple-double with 11 assists and 8 rebounds. On Wednesday, Westbrook was asked how his style had been received so far by women, who will perhaps be the ultimate arbiters of how long the latest N.B.A. fashion trend lasts. “I don’t really notice a difference, not yet at least,” he said without skipping a beat. “But I just got a style of my own, and I’m going to keep it that way.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about NBA players and their fashion trends, particularly focusing on Russell Westbrook's signature accessory, lensless oversized red eyeglass frames.

Summarize this article in one sentence. A heavy blanket made from fleece or felted-wool could be ideal, but you can use any type of blanket for this. Fold the blanket in half first, and make sure that all of the edges and corners match up. Next, cut right along the fold, then set one of the halves aside. Take one of the halves, and fold the bias tape over the raw edge. The raw edge should be sandwiched inside the bias tape, nestled right against the fold. The color can match your blanket, or it can contrast it. You can also use ribbon for this, if you'd like something fancier. Consider folding the ribbon in half, and then ironing it. This will create a crease, similar to what bias tapes have. Choose a thread color that matches the bias tape, then sew it down using the straight stitch on your sewing machine. Sew as close to the inside edge of the bias tape as you can. Be sure to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. This will keep the stitching from unraveling. Spread the blanket half down in front of you, with the bias-taped edge facing up and away from you. Next, fold the bias-taped edge down towards you by 8 inches (20.32 centimeters). Make sure that the jacket is centered, and that the collar is aligned with the top, folded edge of your blanket. You will use this as a guide for the placement of your sleeves. If you don't have a jacket, you can use a loose-fitting sweatshirt or T-shirt instead. Fold the sleeves on your jacket inward. Next, take a sewing pin, and place it just below your jacket's sleeve, right next to the body. Take another sewing pin, and place it right above the sleeve, right next to the shoulder. Repeat for the other sleeve on the other side of the jacket. You can use a tailor's chalk or tailor's pen for this. These will be your cutting lines for the arm holes. For a more tailored finish, cut the slits into ovals instead. Set the blanket aside when you are done. Fold the blanket in half first, so that the blanket's original side edges match up; the raw edge should be on one side, and the finished edge should be on the other. Cut the blanket in half, using the fold as a guide. Take the raw edge you just cut, and fold it towards the blanket's finished side edge. You should now have something that resembled a sleeve, with a raw end and a finished end. You will be sewing the raw end into the blanket; the finished end will make the cuff. Measure the sleeve against your arm, placing the cuff against your wrist (or wherever you want the sleeve to end). If the sleeve is too long, place a sewing pin at the shoulder, then cut it down. Measure your other sleeve against the one you just cut. This will ensure that both sleeves are the same length. Keeping the sleeve folded, place the narrow, raw end against one of the arm holes. It should be ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) wider. If it is too wide, make a mark along the raw edge, then cut the sleeve accordingly. Repeat with the other sleeve. Remember, the finished sleeve needs to be ½-inch (1.27-centimeters) wider, to allow for seam allowances. Consider tapering the sleeves slightly towards the \\"cuff\\" for a more tailored look. Use the straight stitch on your sewing machine, and a needle and thread tension suitable for the fabric you are working with. If your fabric is not made out of fleece or felt, zigzag stitch over the raw edges of the seam; this will keep it from fraying. Align the raw end of the sleeve with the sleeve hole. Next, pin the sleeve in place, all the way around the arm hole. If the arm hole is too big, position the sleeve so that the excess fabric is at the bottom. Next, use a needle and thread to close up the hole. Tie the thread off and snip off any excess. If the sleeve is too big, position the sleeve so that the excess fabric is at top. Use a needle and thread to gather the excess fabric until it fits in the sleeve hole. Tie the thread off when you are done, and pin the sleeve in place. Remove the sewing pins as you sew. Again, if the fabric you are using is the kind that frays, bind the edges with a zigzag stitch. Your coat is now complete. If you want to get even fancier, you can add buttons or snaps to the front. You can wear the coat with the collar flattened down, or tucked up against your neck.","completion":"This article provides a comprehensive guide on creating a DIY coat from a blanket by cutting and sewing it, attaching sleeves, and adding optional details like buttons and cuffs for a tailored finish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To better understand why this is the case, let's dissect the sentence and explore ways to improve its structure and clarity. Original sentence: \\"Which temple did Athena contemplate the reason that her devotees had built?\\" This sentence attempts to convey that Athena was thinking about or reflecting upon the reasons her devotees built a temple. There are some issues related to grammar and word order that make it confusing. Issue #1: The verb \\"contemplate\\" is not used appropriately in the sentence. Solution: Using verbs such as \\"wonder\\" or \\"consider\\" would better suit the intended meaning. Issue #2: \\"The reason that\\" is awkward and unclear in this context. Solution: Replace this with a clearer and more simplified phrase such as \\"why\\" to make the sentence more comprehensible. Issue #3: The sentence structure is difficult to understand. Solution: Rearrange the sentence components to make it more coherent. Taking these issues and their solutions into account, we can rewrite the sentence as: Revised sentence: \\"Which temple did Athena consider and wonder why her devotees had built?\\" With the revised sentence, it is now clearer that the focus is on Athena thinking about or reflecting upon the reasons her devotees had built a specific temple.

Today, I'm going to tell you about something that happened in a place called Fort Hood, Texas. You know what a church is, right? It's a place where people go to pray and feel close to God. Well, around the area of Fort Hood, more people than usual went to church, because something sad happened in their neighborhood. In some of the churches, people prayed for the family of a man named Major Hasan. He did something that's very hard to understand and explain - he hurt a lot of people in their community. So, the people in church were asking God to help Major Hasan’s family try to understand and handle what happened. There are lots of churches in the town nearest to Fort Hood, called Killeen. In fact, there is one church for every 245 people who live there! When more people than usual go to church, it's because they want to find comfort and support from God and their friends during difficult times. Major Hasan, the man who did the bad thing, is very sick in the hospital. He can't talk or breathe on his own, so doctors are helping him. The people who work with the police, called the FBI, are trying to figure out if he should be charged with a crime for what he did.

Answer the following question: Given the fact that: Pigments in the skin act like a filter that can prevent the skin from making vitamin D. As a result, people with darker skin need more time in the sun than people with lighter skin to make the same amount of vitamin D. Answer the question: Two friends are headed to the beach, Mike and John. Mike is white, and John is black. Both want to make the same amount of vitamin D through sun exposure. The person who will take longer to make the amount of vitamin D is Mike or John? Answer:","completion":"John will take longer to make the same amount of vitamin D. Justification: As per the information given, pigments in the skin act like a filter that reduces the amount of vitamin D the body can produce from sunlight. Therefore, the darker the skin (meaning the more melanin it has), the more sunlight is blocked from reaching the layers of skin where vitamin D production takes place. As stated, people with darker skin need more time in the sun than people with lighter skin to make the same amount of vitamin D. In this scenario, Mike is described as white, which implies he has lighter skin, and John is black, implying he has darker skin. Following the principles we've discussed, John, having darker skin, would require more time in the sun to produce the same amount of vitamin D as Mike, who has lighter skin. Thus, John will need more time under the sun compared to Mike to make the same amount of vitamin D."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q:- Cells with chlorophyll in them capture the light energy - Plants absorb carbon dioxide through their stoma - Plants absorb water through their roots and other parts of themselves - Plants absorb minerals through their roots - Plants convert these inputs into sugars - Sugars can be used as energy sources - Oxygen and water are also produced - Excess water and oxygen are released through stoma and other parts of the plant. What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the process described above is the light-dependent phase of photosynthesis, which begins when cells with chlorophyll capture light energy. Photosynthesis is a crucial process that enables plants to convert sunlight into chemical energy, which they use to grow, reproduce, and perform various other functions. This energy is stored in the form of sugar molecules, like glucose, that the plants can later utilize as a source of energy. The process can be divided into two main stages: the light-dependent phase and the light-independent phase (also known as the Calvin cycle). During the light-dependent phase, chlorophyll and other pigments within the chloroplasts of plant cells capture light energy in the form of photons. These pigments, primarily chlorophyll a and b, are located in the thylakoid membranes. The captured light energy is then used to excite electrons within the chlorophyll molecules. This excitation leads to the generation of high-energy electrons that are transferred along a series of proteins collectively called the electron transport chain. As these high-energy electrons move through the electron transport chain, they lose energy, which is used to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane. This creates a proton gradient that drives the production of ATP, an essential energy molecule for various cellular processes. Meanwhile, water molecules are broken down into oxygen gas, electrons, and protons through a process called photolysis. The oxygen gas produced as a byproduct is released through the plant's stoma, while the electrons generated are used to replenish the lost electrons in the chlorophyll molecules. Moreover, another molecule, NADPH, is generated during the light-dependent phase by transferring electrons from the electron transport chain to the NADP+ molecule. Both ATP and NADPH are then used for the subsequent light-independent phase (Calvin cycle) to produce sugars. In conclusion, the first step of the described process is the capturing of light energy by chlorophyll-containing cells. This is the initial stage of the light-dependent phase of photosynthesis and is essential for converting light energy into chemical energy that can be used by the plant for various biological processes, including sugar synthesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The song was recorded during the band's \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" period, but remained unreleased until it was included on the \\"Yellow Submarine\\" soundtrack. It was released as a single in 1972 in European countries such as France and Germany, backed by \\"Hey Bulldog\\". - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - Apple Corps Ltd (informally known as Apple) is a multi-armed multimedia corporation founded in London in January 1968 by the members of the Beatles to replace their earlier company (Beatles Ltd) and to form a conglomerate. Its name (pronounced \\"apple core\\") is a pun. Its chief division is Apple Records, which was launched in the same year. Other divisions included Apple Electronics, Apple Films, Apple Publishing and Apple Retail, whose most notable venture was the ill-fated Apple Boutique, on the corner of Baker Street and Paddington Street in central London. Apple's headquarters in the late 1960s was at the upper floors of 94 Baker Street, after that at 95 Wigmore Street, and subsequently at 3 Savile Row. The latter address was also known as the Apple Building, which was home to the Apple Studio. - Apple Records is a record label founded by the Beatles in 1968, as a division of Apple Corps Ltd. It was initially intended as a creative outlet for the Beatles, both as a group and individually, plus a selection of other artists including Mary Hopkin, James Taylor, Badfinger, and Billy Preston. In practice, by the mid-1970s, the roster had become dominated with releases by the former Beatles as solo artists. Allen Klein managed the label from 1969 to 1973. It was then managed by Neil Aspinall on behalf of the four Beatles and their heirs. He retired in 2007 and was replaced by Jeff Jones. - All Together Now is a feature - length documentary that chronicles the making of The Beatles and Cirque du Soleil collaboration project Love . The film details the story behind the unique partnership between The Beatles and Cirque du Soleil that resulted in the creation and launch of the Love stage show and the double Grammy - winning album of the same name . The film is dedicated to the memory of Neil Aspinall , a former assistant to the band and eventual head of Apple Corps . - LennonMcCartney was the songwriting partnership between English musicians John Lennon (9 October 19408 December 1980) and Paul McCartney (born 18 June 1942) of the Beatles. It is one of the best known and most successful musical collaborations in history, with the Beatles selling over 600 million records, tapes and CDs as of 2004. Between 1962 and 1969, the partnership published approximately 180 jointly credited songs, of which the vast majority were recorded by the Beatles, forming the bulk of their catalogue. - Magical Mystery Tour is an album by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a double EP in the United Kingdom and an LP in the United States. Produced by George Martin, both versions include the six-song soundtrack to the 1967 film of the same name. The EP was issued in the UK on 8 December 1967 on the Parlophone label, while the Capitol Records LP release in the US occurred on 27 November and featured eleven tracks through the addition of songs from the band's 1967 singles. The EP was also released in Germany, France, Spain, Yugoslavia, Brazil, Australia and Japan. The first official release as an eleven-track LP in the UK did not occur until 1976. - \\"Hey Bulldog\\" is a song by the Beatles which first appeared on the \\"Yellow Submarine\\" soundtrack album in 1969. Credited to LennonMcCartney but written primarily by John Lennon, it was finished in the studio by Lennon and McCartney. The song was recorded during the filming of the \\"Lady Madonna\\" promotional video, and like \\"Lady Madonna\\", is one of the few Beatles' songs based on a piano riff. It had a working title of \\"You Can Talk to Me\\". Although the \\"Yellow Submarine\\" album had a mixed reception, \\"Hey Bulldog\\" was generally considered its highlight song. - George Harrison, (25 February 1943 29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: What is likely the job of the people who conducted the study at Deakin University? Options: - They are most likely researchers at the university. - not enough information - They are probably the owners of a facility that makes macaroni and cheese. - They are most likely world famous chefs. === The correct answer is A:","completion":"They are most likely researchers at the university."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is?","completion":"Catherine of Braganza was the queen consort of King Charles II of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Born on November 25, 1638, in Lisbon, Portugal, she was a Portuguese Infanta and the daughter of King John IV of Portugal and his wife, Queen Luisa María Francisca de Guzmán. Catherine married King Charles II on May 21, 1662, following the English Restoration that put Charles back on the English throne. The marriage was a diplomatic alliance between England and Portugal, strengthening their bond against the rival powers of France and Spain. It also involved the transfer of Bombay and Tangier's strategic port to England, which played a vital role in the growth of the British Empire. As a Catholic, Catherine faced significant religious challenges in predominantly Protestant England. She was often at the center of controversy and faced accusations of involvement in various plots against the monarchy. Despite the hardships, she contributed to expanding Charles II's cultural tastes, introducing tea-drinking to the English court. King Charles II ruled the English throne from 1660 until his death on February 6, 1685. Although Catherine and Charles did not have any children together, Charles had several illegitimate children from various mistresses. After Charles II's death, Catherine lived the rest of her life as a dowager queen, primarily remaining in England. She outlived her husband by more than twenty years, passing away on December 31, 1705, in Lisbon, Portugal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome.

Yelp Review (Negative): Title: Disappointing Experience at The Riverside Café I rarely write reviews, but I felt compelled to share my experience at The Riverside Café. Although well-renowned and appreciated in the town, my visit there last Saturday evening with my family was far from pleasing. We arrived at the café around 7 pm and were greeted by a seemingly uninterested host who took almost 10 minutes to assign us a table despite several open seats. The café's ambience is usually trendy and enjoyable, but this time around, it was incredibly noisy, making it difficult for us to have a proper conversation. Our waitress, though friendly, took an unusually long time to attend to our table. The menu had a variety of dishes, but I was disappointed to learn that they had run out of some key ingredients and could not serve their signature pasta dish. After finally placing our order, we had to wait for nearly an hour for the food to arrive. Our primary reason for dining at The Riverside Café has always been its delicious food, but this time, the dishes served were a real letdown. The grilled chicken was overcooked and dry, and the vegetable lasagna lacked seasoning. In addition to the poor food quality, the portions were smaller than usual. Another issue was that throughout the dinner, we rarely saw our waitress, making it difficult to request a few missing items for our table or refill our empty water glasses. Also, it was evident that the staff was overworked and too busy to provide their usual attentive service. In conclusion, the whole dining experience was a major disappointment - a stark contrast to the many enjoyable meals we have had here in the past. I sincerely hope that The Riverside Café takes this feedback seriously and returns to its previous high standards. Until then, we will be exploring other options for dining out in our town. Rating: 2 out of 5 stars --- II. Yelp Review (Positive): Title: Exceptional Dining Experience at The Garden Bistro I recently dined at The Garden Bistro for my anniversary, and it was an absolute delight. From the moment my partner and I entered the restaurant, we were truly impressed by the beautiful interior, lush greenery, and soft lighting, creating an intimate and romantic atmosphere. Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted by the host, who promptly seated us at a table by the window with a fantastic view of the garden. Our waiter, Michael, was incredibly courteous, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. He offered excellent wine recommendations and provided detailed descriptions of each dish, which made it easy for us to make our selections. I opted for the pan-seared scallops as an appetizer, while my partner chose the French onion soup. Both dishes arrived promptly, beautifully plated, and with a generous serving size. The scallops were cooked to perfection, and the soup had a rich, savory broth topped with wonderfully melted cheese. For our entrees, we shared the filet mignon with truffle mashed potatoes and the wild mushroom risotto. The steak was tender and cooked precisely to our liking, and the risotto had a bold, earthy flavor that left us craving more. The portions were well-sized, leaving us ample room to indulge in their divine chocolate lava cake for dessert. In addition to the outstanding food, our waiter Michael never missed a beat. He checked on us frequently, ensured that our wine glasses were always filled, and went out of his way to make our anniversary celebration truly special. His professionalism and genuine care for our experience greatly added to our memorable evening. Overall, The Garden Bistro surpassed all our expectations and provided an unforgettable dining experience. We highly recommend this gem to anyone in search of excellent food, great service, and a beautiful atmosphere. We will undoubtedly be returning soon to taste more of the exceptional dishes this bistro has to offer. Rating: 5 out of 5 stars"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

During ancient times, Gibraltar was regarded by the peoples of the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, probably in the hope of securing safe passage through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.The Rock was revered by the Greeks and Romans as one of the two Pillars of Hercules, created by the demigod during his tenth labour when he smashed through a mountain separating the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. According to a Phocaean Greek traveller who visited in the sixth century BC, there were temples and altars to Hercules on the Rock where passing travellers made sacrifices. The Spanish later symbolised the importance of the Pillars of Hercules with a heraldic device consisting of a pair of columns with a scroll wrapped around them – a symbol that became the sign and the related Portuguese cifrão ().To the Ancient Romans, Gibraltar was known as Mons Calpe, a name perhaps derived from the Phoenician word kalph, \\"hollowed out\\", presumably in reference to the many limestone caves in the Rock. It was well-known to ancient geographers, but there is no known archaeological evidence of permanent settlements from the ancient period.

Many popular songs contain lyrics such as 'kill the batty boy' Article:","completion":"Title: The Struggle of LGBTQ+ Community in Jamaica: Krissy's Story In a world seemingly growing more accepting and connected every day, it is astonishing to come across heart-wrenching stories of individuals facing adversity due to their true identity. Krissy, a 21-year-old homeless individual from Jamaica, highlights the shocking reality of life as a gay person in a country where homophobia is still widespread. Krissy, along with many others, struggles daily to come to terms with the overwhelming stigmatization and violence faced by the LGBTQ+ community in Jamaica. Krissy's traumatic journey began at the tender age of twelve when she gathered the courage to come out to her family. The fear of bringing disgrace and being stigmatized led her to leave her family home, opting instead for a life of homelessness rather than subject her loved ones to ridicule and discrimination. Finding solace in a storm drain, Krissy has eked out an existence, surviving solely on the kindness and occasional support of friends and strangers. Although forced to face the harsh elements and uncaring society alone, Krissy managed to find a friend in Sachaberry, a fellow LGBTQ+ individual who shared the same dark reality. Unfortunately, the tenuous link to human connection was shattered when Sachaberry fell victim to a brutal attack. She was ambushed by a gang and stabbed four times, further cementing the ever-present threat faced by those who identify as LGBTQ+ in Jamaica. Homophobia remains rampant in Jamaica, with 80 percent of the population reportedly admitting to having homophobic beliefs. The intolerance is prevalent in various aspects of societal life, ranging from popular music to the country's own legal system. Disturbingly, many popular songs contain lyrics promoting violence against LGBTQ+ individuals, such as \\"kill the batty boy,\\" an egregious example of the deep-rooted prejudice that continues to plague the nation. The Jamaican law exacerbates this discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals, with gay sex being punishable by up to ten years of hard labour in prison. This archaic law not only perpetuates the marginalization of LGBTQ+ individuals, but also bolsters the prejudiced beliefs of those who seek to harm and discriminate against them. Krissy's story is a tragic example of the severity of the hatred LGBTQ+ individuals face in Jamaica. Driven from her home and left to fend for herself in a hostile environment, she soldiers on, searching for a sense of belonging and acceptance that is consistently denied. Her story serves as a call to the global community to turn its attention to the plight of LGBTQ+ individuals in Jamaica and across the world. To create lasting change, both the Jamaican government and society need to take decisive action. The government must review and amend discriminatory laws, while society must work to dispel deeply ingrained homophobic beliefs. Furthermore, global human rights organizations should continue to advocate for the rights and welfare of the LGBTQ+ community, providing support and protection to vulnerable individuals like Krissy and Sachaberry. In conclusion, Krissy's harrowing journey sheds light on the gravity of the situation faced by LGBTQ+ individuals in Jamaica. It is essential for the world to take note of Krissy's story and work towards promoting understanding, acceptance, and love, so that one day, all citizens of Jamaica, and beyond, can live their lives openly and without fear of discrimination or violence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On Tony's first visit, however, Brandon makes it clear that he has his own agenda while the teenager lies on the psychiatrist's couch: Tony will be an excellent subject for his experiments with a scopolamine serum he has developed that regresses personalities to their primitive instincts. Brandon believes that the only future that mankind has is to \\"hurl him back to his primitive state.\\" Although Brandon's assistant, Dr. Hugo Wagner, protests that the experiment might kill Tony, Brandon continues and within two sessions suggests to Tony that he was once a wild animal. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that the widowed father shows concern for?, what is it ?

Article: From our smartphones to our latest weaponry, the technology that underpins modern life would be impossible without rare earth metals. The importance of rare earths has only grown as emerging markets increase their demand for technologies made with it, as does the renewable energy industry. The 17 metallic elements are common in the earth-s crust, but the technique used to extract and refine them is labor-intensive, environmentally hazardous and increasingly costly. Thomas Gradael, a professor of geology and geophysics at the Yale School of Forestry Environmental Studies, explains that thecriticality\\" of rare earths was only recently understood after China, which dominates the world-s supply of the minerals, cut exports by 40% in 2010, citing concerns over how polluting the rare earth industry was. Along with colleagues at Yale, Gradael decided to investigate the metals used in modern technologies to determine if there were viable substitutes.\\"Twenty or thirty years ago electronics were being made with 11 different elements,\\" explains Gradael. \\"Today's computers and smartphones use something like 63 different elements.\\" Their findings showed that there were no \\"readily apparent\\" substitutes for a metal that would not compromise on quality or performance. However increased mining for these scarce resources can have some nasty side effects for the environment. China, which has intensively mined for rare earths with little regulation, allowing it to dominate the global industry since 1990, has acknowledged the incredible environmental harm caused by the process. \\"Excessive rare earth mining has resulted in landslides, clogged rivers, environmental pollution emergencies and even major accidents and disasters, causing great damage to people's safety and health and the ecological environment,\\" read a white paper issued by the Chinese cabinet in June last year. Recycling metal has been advocated by some as a possible way of managing these precious resources-the European Parliament adopted a law curbing dumping...

That was the reaction of Jules Spencer, chairman of the Independent Manchester","completion":"I believe the given text is related to sports, particularly football. It seems to be referring to conflicts among shareholders and management involving the Manchester United Football Club. Let me break it down step by step to better understand the context: Step 1: Identify the main topic The main topic seems to be a quote from Jules Spencer, chairman of the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association (IMUSA). IMUSA is a group of Manchester United fans involved in the governance of the club. Step 2: Recognize key stakeholders - Jules Spencer: Chairman of IMUSA - Murdoch: This likely refers to Rupert Murdoch, who tried to buy Manchester United through his company, BSkyB, in the late 1990s but failed. - Magnier and McManus: These are Irish businessmen John Magnier and JP McManus, who owned a significant stake in Manchester United in the early 2000s and were involved in various disputes with the club's management. - Glazer: Malcolm Glazer, an American businessman who eventually bought Manchester United in 2005, leading to significant fan protests. Step 3: Understand the context The quote seems to indicate that IMUSA and its chairman, Jules Spencer, are not afraid of taking on powerful individuals or groups in order to protect the interests of Manchester United fans. They have previously been successful in fighting against the interests of Murdoch, Magnier, and McManus, and are now ready to oppose Glazer if necessary. Step 4: Determine the broader theme The broader theme of this passage is the ongoing struggle between football club fans who are passionate about their team's well-being and wealthy investors who may prioritize financial gain. IMUSA represents the interests of Manchester United fans, and has a history of standing up to investors whose actions may not align with the club's best interests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, very few people were able to enjoy some of history's most important and interesting artifacts . This has changed with an increase in the number of traveling museum exhibitions. King Tutankhamen Artifacts A traveling exhibition of artifacts from the tomb of King Tutankhamen, popularly known as \\"King Tut\\", toured the United States from November 1976 to April 1979. The 55 objects were shown in six cities and were seen by around eight million museum-goers. The second touring exhibit was started in 2007, this time with 130 artifacts and stops in London and three different American cities. However some objects, like the king's golden face mask, are too valuable or too delicate to be transported long distances, so \\"replicas\\" (exact copies of something) are on show. Japanese Color Woodblock Prints The Art Museum at University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, Virginia, has an extraordinary collection of Japanese color woodblock prints . These prints document the period from about 1850 to 1900, a time when Japan was opening itself to Western influences. Before this point, Japan was a closed society that had little communication with the world outside of its borders. These works of art beautifully show the feeling of change and the trend toward modernization. The museum has put together a traveling exhibition of 60 of these prints, which can be borrowed and exhibited worldwide for periods of eight weeks or more.

D'Artagnan is pursued by Gérard and his brothers, who accuse him of blemishing their sister's honor. Gérard had saw his sister kissing D'Artagnan goodbye or as D'Artagnan put it \\"she wanted to give me something to remember her by!\\". At Musketeer headquarters, Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the cardinal's guards have disbanded the musketeers as per the orders of Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry), the King's minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with England. Rochefort confides to the Cardinal that there are three musketeers that have refused to relinquish their duties: Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charlie Sheen).Upon reaching Paris, the headstrong D'Artagnan has a series of chance physical encounters with these same three musketeers, resulting in D'Artagnan accepting a sword duel with each one that very day. D'Artagnan arrives at the Ruins for his first duel and, much to his surprise, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as musketeers. But before the duels can commence, the captain of the cardinal's guard appears with orders to arrest the resistant musketeers. Although D'Artagnan himself is not under arrest, he joins the three musketeers in the ensuing skirmish, implicating himself with them.

Definition: In this task, you are given a abstract of article and corresponding title of an article.

Input: Abstract: Tuberculosis and helminthic infections coexist in many parts of the world, yet the impact of helminth-elicited Th2 responses on the ability of the host to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection has not been fully explored. We show that mice infected with the intestinal helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb) exhibit a transitory impairment of resistance to airborne Mtb infection. Furthermore, a second dose of Nb infection substantially increases the bacterial burden in the lungs of co-infected mice. Interestingly, the Th2 response in the co-infected animals did not impair the onset and development of the protective Mtb-specific Th1 cellular immune responses. However, the helminth-induced Th2 environment resulted in the accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) in the lung. Co-infected mice lacking interleukin (IL) 4Rα exhibited improved ability to control Mtb infection, which was accompanied by significantly reduced accumulation of AAMs. Moreover, IL-4Rα(-/-) mice adoptively transferred with wild-type macrophages had a significantly higher Mtb load in their lungs compared with those that received IL-4Rα(-/-) macrophages, suggesting a direct contribution for the IL-4R pathway to the heightened susceptibility of co-infected animals. The Th2 response can thus enhance the intracellular persistence of Mtb, in part by mediating the alternative activation of macrophages via the IL-4Rα signaling pathway..

A Romanian man has been arrested after sneaking aboard a Wizz Air flight to Spain to visit his girlfriend. Claudiu-Gabriel Costin's plan was foiled after security spotted the light from his phone flashing as he took selfies inside the cockpit. The 30 year-old man arrived at Cluj international airport in north-western Romania, crept past security, got onto the runway and clambered into a stationary plane that was due to travel to Spain. Claudiu-Gabriel Costin climbed on board a Wizz Air flight in Romania in the hope he would get to Spain. 30 year old wanted to visit his girlfriend but the flashing light from his phone gave him away as he took snaps. He uploaded the pictures onto Facebook for his girlfriend to see with a song called 'I'd like to get to you' Under the cover of darkness no one immediately saw the stowaway as he boarded the plane. The incident is especially embarrassing for airport officials given that they were on heightened security alert after a dangerous criminal had escaped from a local prison. According to Romanian Times, Costin hadn't been able to book a ticket, so decided to take matters into his own hands. He said: 'I wanted to visit my girlfriend who lives in London but when I tried to book a ticket, they had all sold out. 'I haven't seen her for weeks now and I miss her very much so I decided that no matter what, I would go and see her.' However Costin, who is listed on his Facebook page as a life coach, grew bored of waiting for the flight to take off so started taking photographs. After entering the pilot's cockpit he took snaps of himself, the controls and the Wizz Air flight log book before posting them on Facebook where his girlfriend Aline Haskil, 27, would see them. He also posted a song by Romanian pop-rock band Bere Gratis called 'I'd like to get to you'. Although claiming he wanted to visit his girlfriend in London, Costin had boarded a flight that was bound for Spain. An airport spokesperson said: 'It was an evening flight and he was caught after security noticed his camera flash going off inside the cockpit. Costin hadn't been able to book a ticket so decided to take matters into his own hands. Incident was especially embarrassing for airport officials who were on high alert after an escaped prisoner. Costin denies sneaking into cockpit and claims he was invited there by a pilot who offered him sexual favours. 'When they went to investigate they found the man inside. We are looking into the circumstances and how he managed to breach security, get onto the runway and climb abroad the plane without being noticed. 'There was clearly a lapse in security and this will be addressed and sorted out.' Clearly caught in a tricky spot Costin denies sneaking into the cockpit and claims he was invited there by a pilot who then inexplicably offered him sexual favours. He told local authorities: 'I was just wandering around when a pilot appeared and told me to get inside the cockpit and he'd do me a favour. I didn't understand what he meant but then he got his penis out. I was really shocked, and decided I was going to leave town and go and live in a hut in the mountains.' The airport spokesperson said: 'This makes no sense and there was no sign of any pilot.' It is, as yet, unclear what penalty Mr Costin will face. Wizz Air has said: 'Wizz Air confirms that Cluj Airport suffered a security breach unauthorized access to parked and sealed aircraft in the early morning hours 27 January. An individual who is understood to have broken into the airport campus and into a closed aircraft, was subsequently arrested. While this is now a matter for the police, Wizz Air welcomes Cluj Airport's full revision of its security procedures. Passenger safety was ensured at all times as all Wizz Air aircraft are subject to thorough inspection before entering service.' Costin managed to evade airport security staff and get onto the runway at Cluj international airport. Officials have said: 'There was clearly a lapse in security and this will be addressed and sorted out' Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Romanian man Claudiu-Gabriel Costin snuck onto a Wizz Air flight to Spain to visit his girlfriend, but was caught after taking selfies inside the cockpit and airport security noticed the phone's flashing light.

Steve returns to find the bag with their car keys, phone and wallet is missing, soon confirming that their car is gone. Returning to town on foot, they avoid collision with their car, driven recklessly through the woods by the gang's leader, Brett. Finding the gang in the woods after nightfall, Steve demands the return of his belongings, only to be attacked by the knife wielding teens. In the scuffle, Brett's dog is mortally knifed, fuelling Brett's lust for revenge. The couple grab their keys and drive off, but the gang attacks with stones and Steve crashes in the dark forest. Steve is trapped and Jenny runs for help. At daybreak, Jenny sees Steve tied up in barbed wire in a small clearing. Brett forces each (reluctant) teen to torture Steve while female gang member (and Brett's psychopathic equivalent) Paige records it on her phone, so that they now have no choice but to kill him. The gang spots Jenny and gives chase, giving Steve time to free himself. Jenny evades the gang and finds Steve, unable to nurse his many deep wounds and finds an engagement ring, leading Steve to propose even as he is in severe pain. After Jenny again heads off for help, she injures her foot on a large spike, her scream attracting the gang. She soon runs into...

We have -2 * j = 26 - 10 and we need to find what j is. First, let's simplify the right side of the equation. 26 - 10 is the same as having 26 cookies and then eating 10 of them. We'd have 16 cookies left! So, our new equation is now -2 * j = 16. Now, we need to find out what j is. We're going to do the opposite of multiplying by -2, which is dividing by -2. So, let's divide both sides of the equation by -2 to find out what j is. (-2 * j) / -2 = 16 / -2 Since we divided both sides by -2, on the left side, -2 and -2 will cancel each other out, leaving us with just j. j = 16 / -2 When we divide 16 by -2, it's like saying we have 16 apples and we want to share them among -2 people (imagine each person takes away 2 apples from the pile instead of adding apples). We would have -8 apples for each person. So, j = -8. And that's our solution, j is -8! Great job solving this math problem together!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question...what is the effect of the pinhole on visual acuity testing??","completion":"Pinhole visual acuity testing, also known as the pinhole test, is a simple yet effective method to test one's visual acuity. It is primarily used as a diagnostic tool by optometrists, ophthalmologists, and other healthcare professionals to evaluate vision and identify potential eye issues. To understand the effect of the pinhole on visual acuity testing, it is important to delve into the underlying principles of the test and its applications. First, let us discuss the concept of visual acuity and refraction errors. Visual acuity is a measure of the sharpness of the human visual system, which denotes the clarity of vision. It is typically assessed by determining a person's ability to recognize characters or objects on a standardized eye chart from a set distance. Refraction errors, on the other hand, occur when the refraction of light by the cornea and lens does not converge on the retina, leading to blurred vision. There are mainly four types of refractive errors: myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), astigmatism (unequal curvature of the cornea or lens), and presbyopia (age-related loss of near focus). Now, let's explore the effect of the pinhole on visual acuity testing. The pinhole test works on the principle of reducing the size of the blur circle created by refractive errors on the retina. When a person looks through a pinhole, the amount of peripheral light admitted to the eye is minimized, which in turn minimizes the spherical aberration and limits the passage of light rays to a small, central part of the lens. As the pinhole aperture allows only the parallel rays of light to enter the eye, it helps to eliminate the effect of refractive errors, as the peripheral rays (which are mostly responsible for the blur) are blocked. Therefore, the resulting image becomes clearer, sharper, and more focused. In visual acuity testing, the pinhole effect has multiple implications: 1. Identification of refractive errors: A significant improvement in visual acuity when tested with the pinhole indicates that the patient's vision loss is primarily due to refractive errors, which can be corrected with prescription eyeglasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery. 2. Differential diagnosis: In cases where visual acuity does not improve or only shows minimal improvement with the pinhole test, it is suggestive of pathological conditions like macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinal detachment, or cataracts, which may require further diagnostic tests and intervention. 3. Estimation of potential visual acuity: For patients with uncorrected refractive errors or those awaiting cataract surgery, the pinhole test can give an estimate of their potential visual acuity after their issues are corrected. This, in turn, can help guide treatment decisions and set realistic expectations for patients. 4. Quick and cost-effective evaluation: The pinhole test is a valuable tool for testing visual acuity in resource-limited settings or in situations where access to an eye care professional is not possible. In conclusion, the pinhole effect in visual acuity testing fundamentally improves the accuracy of the test by minimizing the impact of refractive errors and allowing for a better assessment of the individual's true visual capacity. This versatile diagnostic technique is particularly beneficial in identifying the presence of refractive errors, differentiating between various eye pathologies, estimating potential visual acuity, and enabling low-cost evaluation of vision in resource-limited settings."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Article: In tough economic times, school counselors don't just wait for students to come to their offices in search of college brochures, health pamphlets or other help. These days, they are looking for at-risk kids to prevent personal or academic troubles before they arise. Nowadays, students and families need the guidance more than ever. Counselors play a steadying role in schools as the economy weighs on families, college admission becomes even more competitive, immigration continues to reshape the population and state-testing pressures many students. They use computers to search through attendance data, grades and standardized test scores for kids who might need extra help. Schlatter, director of guidance and counseling at Prince William County's Woodbridge Senior High School, has checked attendance records against grades and test results to start peer groups for students who are failing classes but not skipping them. She said group counseling is another way to reach more students though it can be difficult. \\"Kids really do start helping and sharing with each other.\\" At Fairfax High School, counselors found through surveys that students who transferred to the school after ninth grade enjoyed school significantly less than those who had been there all four years. The counseling staff set up a special program and group for new arrivals in response, said Marcy Miller, the school's director of student services. Counseling staff members also have started small study groups for students to prepare for state Standards of Learning exams, which Miller said have helped raise test scores.

Context: The White House said Monday that President Donald Trump \\"doesn't believe any of these accusations\\" made by adult film actress Stormy Daniels that she had a one-night affair with the future U.S. leader in 2006 and five years later was threatened to keep quiet about their alleged liaison. Trump spokesman Raj Shah rejected any suggestion that Trump had engaged in wrongdoing because his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, paid the porn star 130,000 from his own funds in hush money shortly before the 2016 presidential election. \\"False charges are settled out of court all the time,\\" said Shah, who faced a barrage of questions from reporters after a lengthy Daniels interview aired Sunday night on 60 Minutes, a CBS News show that drew its biggest ratings in a decade for the spectacle. \\"He's consistently denied these accusations,\\" Shah said of Trump. The spokesman said the 39-year-old Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was \\"inconsistent\\" because she has at various times denied she had a sexual encounter with Trump, but now claims she is telling the truth that she met up with him at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. Shah also dismissed Daniels' claim that in 2011, when she was on her way to a fitness class in Las Vegas with her infant daughter, she was approached by a stranger who threatened her. \\"A guy walked up on me and said to me, 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,' \\" Daniels told journalist Anderson Cooper. \\"And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.' And then he was gone.\\" Trump has yet to comment directly on Daniels' story. However, he posted a Twitter comment Monday that seemed to allude to the controversy. Daniels says the Las Vegas incident occurred shortly after she first tried to sell her story about her encounter with Trump to a tabloid magazine. She said the incident made her fearful for years and that she thought she was doing the right thing when she accepted 130,000 from Trump...

Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process might be the formation of a sedimentary rock. Step-by-step explanation and justification: 1. Wind or water breaks small pieces off of a rock: This is called weathering, where natural forces like wind and water gradually break down rocks into smaller pieces. 2. The wind or water deposits tiny rocks: After the rocks are broken down, they are transported by wind or water and deposited in a new location. This process is called erosion. 3. The rocks become known as sediment: Once the tiny rocks are deposited, they accumulate and become layers of loose particles, which are known as sediment. 4. The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top: As more and more sediment layers pile up, the weight of the layers above causes the particles in the lower layers to be compressed. This process is called compaction. 5. Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve: As the sediment layers become compacted, water within the sediment may carry dissolved minerals from one particle to another. This process fills the spaces between the particles and starts to bind them together, which is known as cementation. 6. Formation of a sedimentary rock: The combination of compaction and cementation transforms the layered sediments into solid sedimentary rocks. This last step is called lithification, which completes the process of sedimentary rock formation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Nations across the globe recognized the importance of fostering diplomatic ties to ensure peace, cooperation, and mutual understanding. This article seeks to explore the number of countries that established diplomatic relations on this crucial date while shedding light on the context and implications of these events. Background The early 1990s was a period of significant geopolitical change, particularly due to the aftermath of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. These global transformations triggered a wave of diplomatic negotiations as new republics emerged and existing nations began to redefine themselves. This climate made January 25, 1992, a crucial date in international relationships, witnessing multiple countries forging vital diplomatic connections. Countries Establishing Diplomatic Relations on 25 January 1992 The exact number of countries that entered into diplomatic relations on January 25, 1992, were three pairs of countries, totaling six countries involved. These nations established ties with one another to promote peace, trade, and collaboration on various international issues. The pairs of nations that established these relationships were as follows: 1. The Russian Federation and the Republic of South Korea Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, Russia emerged as a new political entity and sought to forge relationships with other global powers. Consequently, Russia and the Republic of South Korea officially established diplomatic relations on January 25, 1992, signaling a new chapter in Russo-Korean relations. Before this, South Korea had no diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union due to tensions resulting from the Cold War and divided loyalties on the Korean peninsula. By forging this new bond, Russia and South Korea aimed to foster political, economic, and cultural cooperation for mutual benefit. 2. Georgia and the Republic of Hungary Similarly, Georgia emerged as an independent state after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Determined to build diplomatic ties and enhance international cooperation, Georgia initiated formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of Hungary on January 25, 1992. Both nations viewed this alliance as a means to support bilateral trade, investment, and cultural exchanges. In subsequent years, the international cooperation between Georgia and Hungary further expanded, encompassing various sectors such as education, science, and technology. 3. Armenia and Germany Lastly, Armenia, another former Soviet republic, declared its independence on September 21, 1991, which necessitated the establishment of diplomatic ties with other nations. Consequently, Armenia and Germany officially forged diplomatic relations on January 25, 1992. This relationship marked an essential step for Armenia to gain recognition and strengthen its newly acquired independence. The partnership between Armenia and Germany has continued to grow in various areas, including political, economic, and cultural cooperation. Conclusion Diplomatic relations are vital in fostering understanding, promoting peace, and facilitating cooperation between nations. On January 25, 1992, six countries, forming three pairs of alliances, established diplomatic relationships, signifying the start of new partnerships amidst a period of significant global change. The political transformation and end of the Cold War era catalyzed this critical shift in international relations, leading these countries to seek collaboration and mutual benefit. Today, the alliances formed on January 25, 1992, continue to flourish and play a crucial role in the ever-evolving global landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Who kept their systems of government as separate colonies?\\" Context: \\"In 1901, the Federation of Australia was the process by which the six separate British self-governing colonies of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia formed one nation. They kept the systems of government that they had developed as separate colonies but also would have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. When the Constitution of Australia came into force, the colonies collectively became states of the Commonwealth of Australia.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The six British self-governing colonies that maintained their systems of government while forming the Federation of Australia in 1901 were New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia. Each of these colonies had developed its own distinct system of government, in part shaped by the colony's geographical, social, and economic context. Before the federation, they managed their internal affairs through independent legislative, executive, and judicial systems, which allowed them to cater to the unique local needs and aspirations of their respective populations. With the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, under the Australian Constitution, these colonies transformed into states and became part of a federal system. The key driver behind this was the desire for a unified nation that would have a greater collective influence and enable improved cooperation in matters of national importance, such as defense, trade, and immigration. Yet, the founding states also wanted to maintain their regional autonomy and preserve the governmental structures they had established as separate colonies. Therefore, the Australian Constitution provides for a division of powers between the federal government and the state governments, with each level possessing distinct areas of legislative, executive, and judicial authority. As a result, the state governments retained control over various key aspects of their respective regions, such as healthcare, education, land management, and local infrastructure. This allows them to tailor their policies and services to the specific needs and contexts of their populations, accommodating regional variation and diversity, while also ensuring that their historical sovereignties are preserved. The federal government, on the other hand, is responsible for regulating matters that concern the whole nation, such as foreign relations, defense, and interstate trade. This enables the Australian states to cooperate on issues that transcend regional boundaries and to negotiate with the outside world as a single, unified entity. The bi-level system of government in Australia, with its distinct federal and state jurisdictions, demonstrates the way in which the six original colonies have retained their respective governmental systems, while also contributing to the governance and development of the nation as a whole. This arrangement allows for a balance between regional autonomy and national unity and highlights the importance of accommodating diverse historical, cultural, and political backgrounds within a single political framework."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Image copyright AFP Image caption New York's Macy's department store began its Black Friday promotion on Thursday evening Online purchases appear to be surging in the US and UK during Black Friday as more consumers shun standing in line. This has not stopped US stores reporting massive queues outside their shops, although in the UK there were smaller crowds than a year ago. New York's giant Macy's store said thousands of people queued to get in. In the UK, consultants Experian and retail group IMRG said that online sales were on course to pass £1bn on a single day for the first time. Last year's Black Friday saw shoppers in the UK fighting over bargains, websites crashing and delivery companies struggling to cope. The discount day originated in the US, where it takes place the day after Thanksgiving, traditionally kick-starting the Christmas shopping period. In the US, some retailers started offering deals early and several stores have turned the event into a weekend of discounting. Macy's said about 15,000 shoppers waited outside its Manhattan department store in readiness for its opening on Thanksgiving evening. Amazon offered discounts in the lead up to the shopping event. Image copyright PA Image caption UK stores say shoppers have been behaving well - unlike last year The National Retail Federation, based in Washington, estimates that about 135.8 million Americans will shop during the four-day holiday compared with 133.7 million last year. The US shopping bonanza has spread, not only to the UK and other parts of Europe, but also countries such as Brazil and India. It is still dwarfed by China's Singles Day - the world's biggest online shopping event. On that day earlier this month, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba reported sales worth 91.2bn yuan (14.3bn; £9.4bn), a 60% increase from last year. In the UK, retailers are expecting Black Friday to be the biggest shopping day of the year. Visa Europe said £1.9bn could be spent online and in-store on its cards alone. There were some queues for early opening, but early data suggests there was more interest in internet sales. The BBC's Adam Kirtley, at Debenhams' flagship store on Oxford Street in London, said: \\"The doors opened at 8am and there was a very orderly trickle of people coming in to bargain hunt. No queues, no hassle.\\" However, Debenhams still expects 10 times the footfall in the Oxford Street store compared with an average Friday, he said. Online shopping Some discounts were posted on retailers' websites from midnight and online sales in the first hour of the day were more than double last year, according to data from PCA Predict. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US National Retail Federation expects 135.8 million Americans to go shopping for deals this weekend Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \\"It looks as if Black Friday spending has been more spread out this year and more weighted to online, but every indication is that the combined event will be bigger than last year overall. \\"It is too soon to say whether the retail sector will be any better off in net terms once the dust settles.\\" Analysis: Emma Simpson, BBC business correspondent It could not have been more different from last year. At Currys in Brentford this morning, there were fewer than two dozen shoppers queuing for bargains. The manager told me more folk were ordering online and picking up in store later. Overall, Black Friday seems a bit more subdued. It is clear retailers have learnt the lessons from last year. Security has been beefed up. Tesco's in-store deals, for instance, have been very tightly managed to avoid a repeat of last year's chaos. A number of retailers have been running Black Friday deals for the last few days to try to avoid a massive peak in orders today. But it will still be a huge, probably a record breaking day for sales. The question is, is this the peak for Black Friday in the UK? Last year was the first time retailers really embraced this US tradition and, for many, it simply distorted Christmas spending instead of delivering bumper profits. 'Unsustainable' Media caption What is Black Friday Some retailers in the UK decided not to take part in the event this year. Supermarket chain Asda, which started Black Friday promotions in the UK in 2013, was among them. Asda did, however, announce a three-day fuel price cut taking its unleaded petrol price to 99.7p per litre. David Blair, of global brand consultancy Fitch, said the fact Asda had pulled out of Black Friday in the UK suggested its US parent company, WalMart, did not think Black Friday had a future in the UK. Some analysts feel the event has distorted Christmas spending, pulling it forward at a time when retailers traditionally charged full prices. James Miller, senior retail consultant at Experian Marketing Services, said: \\"There is little doubt Black Friday has dramatically changed the way people shop in the run-up to Christmas and has created an expectation of deep discounts that arguably did not exist before.\\" A report by LCP Consulting suggests almost a third of retailers in the UK and US think Black Friday is \\"unprofitable and unsustainable\\". There have also been some signs of a backlash against the relentless marketing drive from retailers. One online campaign entitled Buy Nothing Friday suggests that, instead of shopping, people should \\"go for a walk and enjoy the crisp autumn breeze\\". Meanwhile, the Booksellers' Association is encouraging independent book shops to run \\"Civilised Saturday\\". ||||| LONDON — The biggest shopping day of the year is rapidly approaching, but for most of us, it's a shopping day that’s best avoided. A spending frenzy of £2 billion is anticipated this Friday in the UK, with over 15 million bargain hunters expected to hit high streets. Booksellers across the UK are taking a stand against the chaos of Black Friday — and the bad behaviour that has now become part and parcel of the retail day — and have concocted an appealing alternative: Civilised Saturday.

A little too enthusiastically, it seems. Now, some retailers are even trying to dial back some of the frenzy they unleashed just a few years after introducing the whole idea. That is because, for a nation that prides itself on its decorous behavior, last year was ugly. Or, what in America is called a typical Black Friday. At one flagship Asda store in northwest London, part of a retail chain owned by Walmart, one young woman was seen on the floor, desperately clinging to a 40-inch discounted television as several teenagers tried to grab it away. In Middleton, in Greater Manchester, 200 shoppers barricaded themselves in a Tesco store demanding the promised sale goods, even after all the stock had been depleted. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Black Friday is a day where many stores in the United States and United Kingdom offer big discounts to their customers.

This shopping event started in the United States and takes place the day after Thanksgiving, but it has now spread to other countries as well.

Movie title: Marooned Context: Three American astronauts â commander Jim Pruett (Richard Crenna), \\"Buzz\\" Lloyd (Gene Hackman), and Clayton \\"Stoney\\" Stone (James Franciscus) â are the first crew of an experimental space station on an extended duration mission. While returning to Earth, the main engine on the Apollo spacecraft Ironman One fails. Mission Control determines that Ironman does not have enough fuel remaining to use the reaction control system as a backup to initiate atmospheric reentry. Nor is there sufficient fuel to re-dock with the station and wait for rescue. The crew is effectively marooned in orbit. NASA debates whether a rescue flight can reach the crew before their oxygen runs out in approximately two days. There are no backup launch vehicles or rescue systems available at Kennedy Space Center and NASA director Charles Keith (Peck) opposes using an experimental Air Force X-RV lifting body that would be launched on a Titan IIIC booster; neither the spacecraft nor the booster is man-rated, and there is insufficient time to put a new manned NASA mission together. Even though a booster is already on the way to nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station for an already-scheduled Air Force launch, many hundreds of hours of preparation, assembly, and testing would be necessary. Ted Dougherty (David Janssen), the Chief Astronaut, opposes Keith and demands that something be done. The President agrees with Dougherty and tells Keith that failing to try a rescue mission will kill public support for the manned space program. The President tells Keith that money is no factor; \\"whatever you need, you've got it\\". While the astronauts' wives (Lee Grant, Mariette Hartley, and Nancy Kovack) agonize over the fates of their husbands, all normal checklist procedures are bypassed to prepare the X-RV for launch.

I think we will need to determine what levels of insurance and deductibles are needed and then what is the right information to send out in the request for quotes. This is so that everyone is dealing with the same information. I would argue that we should be able to price the deal in the market and then give the group program a right to match the deal. I think the next step is yours, to tell us what levels of insurance and deductibles are needed and then follow that up with the information to go out in the RFP. However, it will be necessary to establish some ground rules. In the event the Operating Company (OC) wishes to secure a \\"market price\\" for their insurance: 1. The OC may nominate a broker to secure pricing. The Broker is subject to CRM's (Corporate Risk Management working for EGS-Enron Global Services) approval. Such approval will not be unreasonably withheld. An appeal of an adverse decision from CRM to the CEO of EGS is possible. 2. CRM will specify and the operating company will supply to CRM, the necessary underwriting information. 3. The OC will specify the types of insurance and coverages, limits, and deductibles they require for their business. 4. CRM will provide the underwriting data and coverage specifications to the competing brokers. 5. The competing brokers will be directed by and report to CRM during the bid process and thereafter, if the broker is appointed. 6. CRM will receive the proposals from the brokers, evaluate and report the results, with recommendations, to the operating company and the appropriate senior manager within Enron. 7. OC will elect the program and price they prefer and CRM will have the right to provide such coverage or direct the appropriate broker in the placement of a separate program. 8. For locations outside the U.S. the OC may request using their nominated broker for servicing their day to day insurance needs, provided the broker becomes a \\"correspondent\\" within the established Enron Broker Network. This will ensure continued co-ordination of the insurance programs. I think a progam like this can get everyone closer to a satisfactory conclusion in the process. Please let me know your thoughts on the proposed program, because obviously we need to get started ASAP.

Step 1: Simplify the equation We start by simplifying both sides of the equation: 4 * u + 39 = -54 + 125 On the right side of the equation, we have -54 + 125, which simplifies to: -54 + 125 = 71 Now, our simplified equation is: 4 * u + 39 = 71 Step 2: Isolate the variable u To isolate u, we need to get it alone on one side of the equation. To do this, we will follow these two sub-steps: Sub-step 1: Subtract 39 from both sides of the equation 4 * u + 39 - 39 = 71 - 39 This simplifies to: 4 * u = 32 Sub-step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 4 (4 * u) / 4 = 32 / 4 This simplifies to: u = 8 So, by following these steps, we have now found the value of u: u = 8"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: What does Rapture meaning in a theological sense? Suggested answer: The other, older use of the term \\"Rapture\\" is simply as a synonym for the final resurrection generally, without a belief that a group of people is left behind on earth for an extended Tribulation period after the events of 1 Thessalonians 4:17. Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"To validate this answer, let us break down the steps to ensure the given information is accurate and relevant to the question. Step 1: Define Rapture in a theological context. Rapture, in Christian eschatology, refers to the transport of believers to heaven at the Second Coming of Christ. In this context, believers will meet Jesus Christ in the air as He returns to Earth. Step 2: Check the reference to 1 Thessalonians 4:17. 1 Thessalonians 4:17 is a Bible verse that describes the event: \\"After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.\\" This verse is relevant as it outlines the Rapture event. Step 3: Evaluate the suggestion that Rapture can be a synonym for the final resurrection. Some Christians indeed view Rapture as the final resurrection, wherein believers are taken to Heaven and those who don't believe are left behind on Earth. However, this is not the only interpretation; there are others who understand Rapture as a separate event from the final resurrection. Step 4: Decide whether to validate the answer. The suggested answer partly captures the meaning of Rapture in a theological context. However, it does not fully address the range of interpretations about Rapture within Christian eschatology. Therefore, it would be better to rephrase the answer as: \\"The term 'Rapture' in a theological sense refers to the transport of believers to heaven at the Second Coming of Christ, as described in 1 Thessalonians 4:17. Some understand it as a synonym for the final resurrection, without a belief that a group of people is left behind on earth for an extended Tribulation period.

(B). positive. Answer:","completion":"Answer: (A). Negative. This statement seems to be carrying a negative sentiment. Several phrases and words in the sentence denote negative emotions. The term 'unpleasant' implies that the debate was filled with discomfort or dissatisfaction among the participants or audience. Similarly, the phrase 'given the drive of a narrative' is commonly associated with the scripting of fictions or dramas, which implies that the debate might have been manipulative or orchestrated rather than being spontaneous and genuine. Additionally, 'acted out' often conveys the sentiment of drama, insincerity, exaggeration or overreaction. The overall sentence does not express any happy, joyful, satisfactory, or positive emotion or sentiment and is hence categorized as negative. It elicits feelings of discomfort, dissatisfaction, and mistrust, which are considered negative emotions. Such negative emotions might be associated with annoyance, anger, frustration, disappointment, or disbelief. However, the perception of sentiment can also depend to some extent on the exact context in which the statement is being used and the perspective of the reader or listener. For example, if the person using this sentence is someone who enjoys drama, then the person might perceive the sentence with a hint of positive sentiment. But even in such a case, the overall sentiment of the sentence would still generally be categorized as negative due to the reasons explained above."},{"prompt":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and his nerdy friend Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) are two dateless teens stuck in Wyatt's rather posh suburban family home on a Friday night.

In 1919 Father James Burns became president of Notre Dame, and in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving away from the university's traditional scholastic and classical emphasis. By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were reluctant to move to a system of electives. Their graduates were shut out of Harvard Law School for that reason.

Bacliff, Texas (CNN) -- Sitting on their front porch in this Houston suburb, Edmond Demiraj and his family seem the picture of a contented family. But the Department of Justice now wants to upend the family: threatening to deport his wife and 19-year-old son back to their native Albania, even though he says federal prosecutors a decade ago promised him help and a Green Card in exchange for Edmond's promised testimony in a human smuggling case against a fellow Albanian immigrant. For the Demiraj family, they believe it will mean great harm, even death, for those deported. A decade ago, Edmond Demiraj (pronounced: dem-EAR-eye) was himself an illegal immigrant. He told CNN he had walked across the U.S. border from Mexico to Brownsville, Texas without any paperwork. He found work as a painter, he says, with a fellow Albanian named Bill Bedini. Not long afterwards, the Justice Department indicted Bedini, accusing him and others of running a human smuggling ring, bringing illegal aliens from Mexico into the United States. Demiraj was named in the original indictment but charges against him were later dropped. Attorneys for the Justice Department based in Houston wanted Demiraj to testify against Bedini. In exchange, Demiraj told CNN that prosecutors promised him and his family protection and promised him a Green Card, which would lead to citizenship. The offer, he says, was verbal and not on paper. \\"I'm ready to work for the U.S. government, whatever they need from me,\\" Demiraj told CNN. But Bedini entered a plea of not guilty, was granted bail and soon fled to Albania, according to the U.S. Marshal's office in Houston. Federal prosecutors didn't need Demiraj's testimony and handed him over to immigration officials, who quickly deported him as well. Answer this series of questions: 1. Where were they sitting? 2.

Individuals aged 18 have the ability to marry in U.S. states except Nebraska (19) and Mississippi (21). In addition, all states, except Delaware and New Jersey, allow minors to marry in certain circumstances, such as parental consent, judicial consent, pregnancy, or a combination of these situations. Most states allow parties aged 16 and 17 to marry with parental consent alone. In most states, children under 16 can be married too. In the 32 states which have an absolute minimum age set by statute, this age varies between 14 and 18, while in 18 states there is no statutory minimum age if other legal conditions are met. Although in such states there is no set minimum age by statute, the traditional common law minimum age is 14 for boys and 12 for girls - ages which have been confirmed by case law in some states. Over the past 15 years, more than 200,000 minors married in US, and in Tennessee girls as young as 10 were married in 2001, before the state finally set a minimum age of 17 in 2018. is there an age limit to get married? Select from: a). no b). yes","completion":"a). no There is no absolute age limit to get married in the United States because some states don't have a legal minimum age of marriage, and the minimum age can vary between states. Most states allow certain circumstances, like parental consent or pregnancy, for minors to get married, and the traditional common law minimum age is 14 for boys and 12 for girls.

He was 99 years old. You have probably never heard of him. He was a professor of public health. More than 50 years ago he produced one of the most famous epidemiological papers of the 20th century. His study showed that bus conductors were much less likely to die of heart disease than bus drivers. Why? Because the conductors spent their working day walking. It seems obvious now but in the middle of the last century doctors were puzzled by the rising numbers of people who got heart diseases. Jerry Morris found one of the main causes: a sedentary lifestyle. He started exercising for a few minutes each day and lived until his 100th year. If you wish to protect your heart, you have to do more than wander in the garden. The exercise needs to be reasonable. Jogging is not for everyone and a round trip to the gym takes a couple of hours, plus the monthly membership fee is only good value if you visit regularly. The answer is simple: walk. A half-hour purposeful walk five times a week will lower your risk of heart disease, diabetes and strokes. Older people sometimes feel they have left it too late. But it is never too late to start and there are no upper age limits. Start gently. Take your time: a 15-minute flat walk in the nearest park, four or five times a week. Within a month or so, you are already beginning to protect your heart. Build the walks up. When you can comfortably walk for half an hour in the park, go further: try following rivers and canals. Regular walkers have their own natural gymnasium. There is no membership fee, just some of the finest scenery in the world. Great Britain is the walker's gym. When you have followed the rivers and canals, and are enjoying walking for a couple of hours, head for the coast. Once again, build it up slowly. When you are comfortable with long coastal walks, you can think of our national parks. Options: A bus conductors are more likely to die of heart disease than bus drivers. B doctors in the 1950s knew why heart diseases kept happening to people. C walking is better than doing sports in a gym because it saves time and money. D British people love walking because they have free gymnasium with finest scenery. Answer: C walking is better than doing sports in a gym because it saves time and money.

In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question.

Tweet:Ugh, can't sleep, I think I have a big problem and will be visiting Lafene or the hospital tomorrow if things don't change","completion":"The sentiment of the given tweet appears to be negative. There are several reasons that lead to this conclusion: 1. The tweet begins with the word \\"Ugh,\\" which is generally used to express frustration, annoyance, or unhappiness. This sets a negative tone right from the start of the message. 2. The phrase \\"can't sleep\\" suggests that the user is experiencing difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. Problems with sleep typically have negative associations, as good sleep is essential to maintaining overall well-being. Consequently, the inability to sleep is often considered to be distressing and undesirable. 3. The user mentions a \\"big problem,\\" which implies that they are facing a serious issue that is causing them distress. They do not elaborate on the nature of the issue, but the use of the word \\"big\\" suggests that it is significant and troubling. 4. The tweet refers to the possibility of visiting \\"Lafene or the hospital tomorrow if things don't change.\\" This statement indicates that the user's problem is severe enough that they believe professional help may be necessary. The mention of the hospital also implies that the issue could be related to their physical health, which can evoke feelings of concern and worry. 5. The phrase \\"if things don't change\\" suggests that there's a sense of uncertainty and urgency regarding the user's situation. The uncertainty adds to the negative sentiment, as it shows the user doesn't know how their problem will evolve and whether they will need to seek medical attention. Given these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that the sentiment of the tweet is negative. The issues raised by the user – difficulty sleeping, a significant problem, and the potential need for medical help – all point to a sense of dissatisfaction, distress, and concern."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are some tips to help you pack. Organize Yourself Make a list. Think of what you need from your head to your toes. When you've done this once, it'll be easier next time. Start Small Consider buying small-size samples of shampoo, toothpaste, and other items at your local store. Make sure they are all sealed tightly. In an emergency, you can purchase them at your destination. But remember that the time you spend buying things at your destination will reduce your visiting time. The Clothing Dilemma Choosing which clothes to bring is probably the hardest packing decision to make. Think once again from head to toe -- hat, shirts, jeans, sneakers, etc. Once you've picked out what you want to bring, think carefully. Do you really need that extra pair of jeans? If so, fine. Don't try to fool yourself. You are the one who will be left holding the bag. Weather is an important factor in your packing. If it's cold, you could wear a jacket, a sweater, a regular shirt, and a T-shirt. Layering up will keep you warm and it will leave more room in your bag. Roll up your casual clothes instead of folding and laying them flat. This leaves more room to pack other things, and keeps your clothes fairly wrinkle-free. Remember how much easier it will be to carry your bag!

Write down exactly what you eat and when you eat it. Make a brief note as to portion sizes as well.","completion":"When recovering from addiction, maintaining a healthy diet is essential to support overall well-being, physical, and mental health. Ensuring that the body receives proper nourishment can promote healing and help mitigate the harmful effects of substance abuse. Once you have started keeping a food journal, the most logical next events involve creating a meal plan, understanding the importance of balance and macronutrients, and incorporating healthy habits into your daily life. 1. Create a meal plan: With the help of your food journal, establish a meal plan that includes regular mealtimes and a diverse range of healthy foods. Consider working with a registered dietitian or nutritionist who can provide guidance tailored to your specific needs. Plan out a week's worth of meals and snacks, including whole grains, lean proteins, leafy greens, and a colorful variety of fruits and vegetables. 2. Understand the importance of balance and macronutrients: Focus on creating a balanced diet that incorporates all the essential macronutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates should primarily come from whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes and are essential for providing energy. Proteins can be sourced from lean meat, poultry, fish, beans, and peas, and they help to repair body tissue and support immunity. Finally, healthy fats including those found in nuts, seeds, and fish are necessary for brain function and absorption of vitamins. 3. Hydration: Drinking enough water throughout the day is crucial for proper bodily functions, particularly during recovery. Aim for at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day. Hydration is essential for maintaining energy levels, flushing out toxins, and supporting digestion and kidney function. 4. Manage sugar and caffeine intake: It is common for recovering addicts to crave sugar and caffeine, but overconsuming these substances can contribute to mood fluctuations or exacerbate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Monitor your intake of sugary foods and beverages, and try to gradually reduce your consumption. Opt for healthier alternatives, such as fruits and herbal teas. 5. Eat small, frequent meals and avoid skipping meals: Eating smaller meals more frequently can help regulate blood sugar levels and alleviate cravings or unhealthy binging. Establish a routine and stick to it. Skipping meals can lead to overeating when hunger finally strikes and contribute to fluctuations in mood and energy levels. 6. Focus on mental health: The connection between mental health and nutrition should not be underestimated. Ensure that your diet includes foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, iron, zinc, and B vitamins to support a healthy brain. Nutrients like tryptophan, found in turkey and beans, can help increase serotonin production, which is essential for maintaining a positive mood and improving sleep quality. 7. Implement proper supplementation: Consult with a healthcare professional or a nutritionist to determine if you may need specific vitamin or mineral supplements to help rebuild and support bodily functions that may have been damaged during addiction. 8. Engage in regular physical activity: Regular exercise can help promote better digestion, improve mood, and relieve stress. Find an activity you enjoy, such as yoga, swimming, or cycling, and aim to incorporate at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity most days of the week. 9. Establish a support system: Eating habits and overall health will greatly benefit from a strong support system. Engage with friends and family members who can help hold you accountable and provide encouragement. In addition, consider joining support groups or seeking therapy to address the emotional aspects of addiction recovery. By following these steps, you can make significant progress in developing healthy eating habits and maintaining a balanced diet during addiction recovery. Prioritizing nutrition and self-care is essential for improving overall well-being and successfully moving forward on your path to recovery."},{"prompt":"I have a new situation: The country of Hinland reduced taxation hoping it would mean more money for government spending. On the other hand, Silvania, a southern country increased taxation hoping they would increase collection amounts. The problem was that Silvanian people increased taxation above the critical rate. But I can use this background: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.

Question: What was the name of the first earth? Movie title: Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths Movie plot: In an alternate universe where the roles of the heroes and villains are reversed from their counterparts in the mainstream DC Universe, heroic analogues of Lex Luthor and the Joker (called the Jester) are stealing a device called the \\"Quantum Trigger\\" from the headquarters of the Crime Syndicate. When an alarm is tripped, the Jester sacrifices himself to allow Luthor to escape and kills J'edd J'arkus and Angelique (alternate versions of Martian Manhunter and Hawkgirl respectively) with a bomb. Luthor is nearly captured by the remaining Syndicate members (Ultraman, Superwoman, Power Ring, Johnny Quick and Owlman) but escapes to the Earth of the heroic Justice League by activating a dimensional travel device. Luthor locates a police station but is mistaken for the evil Luthor. The Justice League is summoned and Superman's x-ray vision confirms Luthor's reversed organs indicate that he is from a parallel Earth and that the evil Luthor is still incarcerated at Stryker's Island. The Justice League take the alternate Luthor to the Watchtower, where they learn of the Syndicate threat. As the Justice League debates the matter, Luthor hides the Quantum Trigger on the satellite.

The film is about the marriage of a gynecologist named David and his wife Marianne . The film 's score was composed by Dag Wirén . - Ernst Ingmar Bergman (14 July 1918 30 July 2007) was a Swedish director, writer, and producer who worked in film, television, theatre and radio. He is recognized as one of the most accomplished and influential auteurs of all time, and is most famous for films such as \\"The Seventh Seal\\" (1957), \\"Wild Strawberries\\" (1957), \\"Persona\\" (1966), \\"Cries and Whispers\\" (1972) and \\"Fanny and Alexander\\" (1982). - The Seventh Seal is a 1957 Swedish drama-fantasy film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Set in Sweden during the Black Death, it tells of the journey of a medieval knight (Max von Sydow) and a game of chess he plays with the personification of Death (Bengt Ekerot), who has come to take his life. Bergman developed the film from his own play \\"Wood Painting\\". The title refers to a passage from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words \\"And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\\". Here the motif of silence refers to the \\"silence of God,\\" which is a major theme of the film. - Fanny and Alexander is a Swedish drama film which was released to cinemas in Sweden on 17 December 1982, written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. The plot focuses on two siblings and their large family in Uppsala, Sweden in the 1900s. It was originally conceived as a four-part TV movie and cut in that version, spanning 312 minutes; a 188-minute cut version was created later for cinematic release, although this version was in fact the one to be released first. The TV version has since been released as a complete film, and both versions have been shown in theaters throughout the world. The 312-minute cut, at five hours and 12 minutes, is one of the longest cinematic films in history. - Cries and Whispers (lit. \\"Whispers and Cries\\") is a 1972 Swedish film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman and starring Harriet Andersson, Kari Sylwan, Ingrid Thulin and Liv Ullmann. The film is set at a mansion at the end of the 19th century and is about two sisters and a maid who watch over their third sister on her deathbed, torn between fearing she might die and hoping that she will. After several unsuccessful experimental films, \\"Cries and Whispers\\" was a critical and commercial success. It received nominations for five Academy Awards. These included a nomination for Best Picture, which was unusual for a foreign-language film. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'genre'.

A Sikh student at Hofstra University filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the United States Army, claiming the service refused to grant him a religious accommodation that would allow him to enlist in his school's ROTC program without shaving his beard, cutting his hair and removing his turban, according to court documents. When Iknoor Singh requested a religious exemption from the military's grooming policies to enlist as an ROTC cadet in April 2013, his request was first denied on the grounds that his noncompliance would have \\"an adverse impact on the Army's readiness, unit cohesion, standards, health, safety, or discipline,\\" court documents said. \\"I couldn't believe the military was asking me to make the impossible decision of choosing between the country I love and my faith,\\" Singh said in a blog post on the","completion":"American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) website. With the support of the ACLU, Singh decided to fight for his right to serve his country without compromising his religious beliefs. His lawsuit gained attention and sparked a debate over the importance of religious accommodations in the military versus the need for strict uniformity for the sake of unit cohesion and discipline. The legal battle continued for several months, with both sides presenting their arguments and evidence. As the case gained nationwide attention, many Sikh-American advocacy groups and veterans joined in supporting Singh's cause, arguing that the military should not discriminate based on religious affiliations. After thorough consideration and an in-depth review of the case, the court ruled in Singh's favor, stating that his religious beliefs and practices should not disqualify him from serving in the ROTC program or the U.S. Army. The judge emphasized the importance of religious freedom and the lack of any evidence supporting the claim that the Army's grooming standards would be negatively impacted by Singh's religious accommodations. In response to the ruling, the Army revised its policies to provide greater flexibility for religious accommodations, paving the way for future soldiers with similar requests. This change not only benefited Singh but also positively impacted the lives of countless other military personnel from diverse religious backgrounds, ensuring that they could serve their country without compromising their faith. Singh went on to complete the ROTC program at Hofstra University with distinction, demonstrating his dedication, discipline, and leadership potential. He was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army and became a symbol of religious tolerance and unity in the military. The story ends on a positive note, celebrating the triumph of religious freedom and diversity in the U.S. military, and reminding Americans that their strength as a nation lies in their unity, despite their differences. Singh's successful fight for his rights echoed throughout the country, inspiring others to advocate for their beliefs and stand up against discrimination, further strengthening the foundations of American democracy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 2: His son Henry II ( pre-1178 died ) , twice Sheriff of Shropshire , held the castles of Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth in 1174 for King John I Lestrange . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences essentially convey the same information, although there are some slight differences in phrasing. Here is a breakdown of the key details within each sentence: 1. In both sentences, the subject is Henry II, the son of the first person mentioned (presumably in a prior sentence). 2. The information about his death is provided differently: in Sentence 1, it is given as \\"died before 1178,\\" whereas in Sentence 2, it is given as \\"pre-1178 died\\". Both phrases indicate that Henry II died before the year 1178, and the knowledge that this happened is essential to grasp the context of the sentences. 3. Both sentences mention that Henry II was twice the Sheriff of Shropshire, meaning that he held this position on two separate occasions. This detail highlights his political and administrative importance during his time. 4. Both sentences also mention that he was in control of the castles of Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth, which further emphasizes his significance and the level of power he held. 5. Finally, both sentences mention that he held these castles for King John I Lestrange in 1174. This detail is crucial, as it establishes a connection between Henry II and King John I Lestrange, a figure of authority in the region during this period. Although the arrangement of a few words varies within the two sentences, the core information conveyed remains the same. Both sentences depict Henry II as a powerful and influential figure, who held the castles of Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth on behalf of King John I Lestrange during his lifetime, specifically in 1174. The fact that Henry II died before 1178 is also consistent in each sentence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Meanwhile, season the veal brisket with salt and pepper on all sides. Add the oil to an oven-safe Dutch oven and heat over medium-high for a couple of minutes, letting it become thinner and easier to spread across the bottom of the Dutch oven. Veal brisket is usually browned while beef brisket is often prepared without being browned. The flavor of veal is improved more dramatically on browning than the flavor of beef, at least as far as oven-cooked brisket is concerned. Add the veal brisket to the hot oil and sear on each side, turning with tongs as needed, until all sides are lightly browned. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes per side. When done, remove the brisket from the Dutch oven and keep warm. Add these ingredients to the remaining oil in the Dutch oil and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions begin to wilt and turn golden and translucent. This should take another 4 minutes or so. If there is little to no oil left in the Dutch oven when you add the vegetables, add another splash of oil so these ingredients can be sautéed in fat. Add the bay leaf, thyme, rosemary, parsley, and white wine to the Dutch oven. Simmer over medium-high heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir the bottom of the Dutch oven, scraping up any stuck bits of veal or vegetables in the process. These small bits are packed with flavor, so you do not want to lose them. If you want to remove the herbs before serving the veal brisket, place them inside a small satchel made of cheesecloth. This is not strictly necessary, though, since the bay leaf is the only one that really needs to be removed and it is usually easy enough to spot and remove on its own. Return the veal brisket to the Dutch oven and add the crushed tomatoes. Cover the pot. Use the lid to your Dutch oven. If it does not have a lid, cover tightly with aluminum foil. This should take about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Keep the Dutch oven covered for the duration of the cooking process, only removing the lid to check for doneness. Check the internal temperature of the brisket with a meat thermometer. The temperature should be between 190 and 200 degrees Fahrenheit (88 to 93 degrees Celsius) when safe and tender enough to eat, and the meat should be easy to pull apart. Remove the veal brisket from the oven and let it rest for 20 minutes before carving and serving it. Slice the brisket across the grain to produce more tender slices of veal. You can also serve the brisket with its cooking juices for a more intense flavor. Skin the fat from the surface of the cooking liquid using a spoon before ladling the liquid over carved slices of meat.

Fact 2: Wollies are made of fur and worn for warmth. Given the two facts above, what physical feature of an animal can help it survive? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, it can be concluded that the physical feature of an animal that can help it survive is its fur (option c). Fur is a crucial aspect of an animal's body that plays a significant role in their survival, particularly in terms of maintaining warmth. Warmth is essential for the physiological processes in an animal's body, as proven by Fact 1. As living organisms, animals need to maintain a stable internal temperature to ensure proper functioning of their vital organs and systems. For cold-blooded animals, this stability depends on the external environment, while for warm-blooded animals, internal heat production maintains their body temperature. Fur provides efficient insulation, trapping warm air close to the animal's body and creating a barrier against the cold. It also acts as an insulator against heat, helping keep the body cool in hot environments. This ability to regulate an animal's body temperature ensures proper metabolic functioning and overall health. Fact 2 highlights the use of fur as a warming material for humans in the form of 'Wollies.' Given that humans utilize fur in clothing to provide warmth, it further emphasizes the importance of fur in helping an animal survive by offering warmth. Besides temperature regulation, fur also has other survival-related functions. It can serve as a camouflage to blend in with the surroundings, protecting the animal from potential predators or hiding it from prey. Furthermore, fur aids in the sensory perception of the environment by helping animals detect changes in air currents and nearby movements. The whiskers of some animals, like cats, are specialized hairs that allow them to perceive their surroundings more efficiently. In summary, considering the two provided facts and the multiple functions of fur, it can be concluded that the physical feature that helps an animal survive is its fur. It is not only instrumental in maintaining warmth and body temperature but also offers additional advantages to improve an animal's chances of enduring various environmental conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This foreign houseplant can be enjoyed by anyone,not just brides. With a little proper attention and careful planning on location,this foreign houseplant, native to Madagascar, can be brought into the home where it can become an interesting focus. Caring for the Hawaiian Wedding Plant is not much different than that of any other houseplants that may already be in your home. The only difference between this type of houseplant and others is the amount of the basic requirements that this foreign houseplant needs to survive and perform beautifully. During the growing season,this plant requires its wet soil,but when winter rolls around, this plant needs its soil to be kept drier. Hawaiian Wedding Plants should also be put in well-drained soil and placed in a location that receives full sun. That the soil must be kept wet does not mean that it should sit in water, so the soil must drain easily or this plant will not survive. Water the plant daily and feed this plant every two to three weeks with a little fertilizer for acid -loving plants. Prune in early spring,even as early as February. If these needs are met,this plant will stay beautiful. The most special feature of this foreign houseplant is its long lasting blooms combined with its unbelievable sweet smell.

Answer the following question: Title: Useless Product review: Did not work at all. Only registers 18.88 and LL. No way to fix. Unfortunately did not try until 60 days after purchase so it goes in the trash. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"The review provided appears to depict the product in an unflattering light for several reasons. Let's break down the various aspects of the review and their implications on the potential consumer's perception of the product. 1. The title, \\"Useless Product,\\" immediately sets a negative tone for the review. By using the term \\"useless,\\" the reviewer is implying that the product does not serve its intended purpose or function, thereby causing dissatisfaction. It instills a sense of unreliability and lack of trustworthiness in the product. 2. The statement, \\"Did not work at all,\\" reinforces the previously established negative tone. This phrase directly communicates to potential buyers that they should not expect the product to function as advertised, which could drastically affect the product's overall reputation and prolong customers' decision-making process in purchasing the item. 3. The mention of \\"registrers 18.88 and LL\\" suggests a specific problem with the product, either with the settings or display. Given that the reviewer does not provide additional details about the device, these numbers could represent error codes or inconsistent readings that are inconsistent with usual functioning. Regardless, it indicates a level of user frustration and lack of satisfaction. 4. The declaration, \\"No way to fix,\\" implies that the reviewer tried to address the dysfunctional state of the product but could not find a solution. This may lead potential customers to perceive poor customer support, ineffective troubleshooting options or even a general lack of quality control in the manufacturing process. 5. Mentioning the 60-day delay in trying the product indicates that the reviewer might have had higher expectations for the product, only to be let down by its performance upon first use. This adds another layer to the unflattering depiction of the reviewed product. 6. The conclusion of the review, stating that the item goes \\"in the trash\\", is a strong condemnation of the product's quality, performance, and usefulness, which conveys the said product holds little to no value. By stating such, the reviewer is indirectly warning potential customers to avoid purchasing the product. In summary, the review reflects a highly negative and unflattering evaluation of the product, with the reviewer indicating that the product is useless, did not work as expected, and insinuating that there are no feasible troubleshooting options. The review portrays the product as unreliable, frustrating, and ultimately not worthy of a purchase. Potential customers reading this review would likely be discouraged from considering the product due to its unflattering depiction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: The Aviator Movie plot: In Houston, 1913, nine-year-old Howard Hughes is warned by his mother of the diseases to which she is afraid he will succumb. Fourteen years later, he begins to direct the movie Hell's Angels. However, after the release of The Jazz Singer, the first partially talking film, Hughes becomes obsessed with shooting his film realistically, and decides to convert the movie to a sound film. Despite the film being a hit, Hughes remains unsatisfied with the end result and orders the film to be recut after its Hollywood premiere. He becomes romantically involved with actress Katharine Hepburn, who helps to ease the symptoms of his worsening obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In 1935, Hughes test flies the H-1 Racer, pushing it to a new speed record. Three years later, he breaks the world record by flying around the world in four days. He subsequently purchases majority interest in Transcontinental &amp; Western Air, aggravating Juan Trippe, company rival and chairman of Pan American World Airways (Pan Am). Trippe gets his friend, Senator Owen Brewster, to introduce the Community Airline Bill, giving Pan Am exclusivity on international air travel. As Hughes' fame grows, he is linked to various starlets, causing a jealous Hepburn to break up with him following her announcement that she has fallen in love with fellow actor Spencer Tracy. Hughes quickly finds a new love interest with 15-year-old Faith Domergue, and later actress Ava Gardner. Hughes secures a contract with the Army Air Forces for two projects: a spy aircraft and a troop transport unit. In 1946, with the \\"Spruce Goose\\" flying boat still in construction, Hughes finishes the XF-11 reconnaissance aircraft and takes it for a test flight. However, one of the engines fails midflight, and the aircraft crashes in Beverly Hills, with Hughes getting severely injured.

Answer the following question: Process: - Networks of trees start forming - The trees die off - The dead material provides nutrients for more trees - The rising trees provide shelter - And more organisms begin to thrive - The ecosystem known as a forest is made. Question: suppose slower growth of bacteria happens, how will it affect LESS forest formation. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"The process you have described indicates that forests are formed through a cyclical growth of trees, where dead trees decompose and produce nutrients that fuel the growth of new trees. This circular pattern fosters various levels of biodiversity, contributing to a complex forest ecosystem. To answer your question about a hypothetical scenario where bacteria growth is slowed, we first need to understand the role bacteria play in forest ecosystems. Bacteria form a vital part of the nutrient cycle in forest ecosystems. They are primarily involved in decomposition—the breaking down of organic matter, such as leaves, wood, and dead organisms. By doing this, bacteria convert complex organic materials into simpler substances that can be reused by other organisms, including trees. So, if the growth rate of bacteria is slowed down, there will be less efficient decomposition in the forest ecosystem. Given that decomposition is a primary source of nutrients needed by trees, a slowed rate of bacteria growth means less availability of nutrients, resulting in less successful tree growth. Regarding your question about how slowed bacteria growth would influence the second effect mentioned (\\"the trees die off\\"), we can infer the following: tree death is in part a natural part of a forest's lifespan and recycling of nutrients. However, if bacteria growth slows—affecting decomposition rates—trees might not receive the necessary nutrients for growth and survival. Slower bacteria growth can therefore lead to a slower rate of tree death, not because the trees are healthier, but because fewer trees are growing to maturity to then die off. By inference, this would subsequently result in less forest undergoing the cycle of growth and death, meaning slower forest formation overall. So this perturbation of slower bacteria growth has a significant effect on the second process mentioned (the dying off of trees), leading towards less forest formation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Zürcher Oberland (\\"Zurich highlands\\") in Switzerland, is the hilly south-eastern part of the canton of Zurich, bordering on the Toggenburg, including the districts of Uster, Hinwil, Pfäffikon as well as the Töss Valley as far as the district of Winterthur. The territory gradually fell under the control of the city of Zurich from 1408 to 1452.

While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \\"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\\". - A landlocked state or landlocked country is a sovereign state entirely enclosed by land, or whose only coastlines lie on closed seas.

Situated where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva. - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet). - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.

Lorry Page, a co-founder of Google, played saxophone in high school. The former World Bank president James D. Wolfensohn has played cello at Carnegie Hall. The connection isn't a coincidence. I know because I asked. I put the question to top-flight professionals in industries from tech to finance to media, all of whom had serious ( if often little-known) past lives as musicians. Almost all made a connection between their music training and their professional achievements. Will your school music program turn your kid into a Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft (guitar)? Or a Woody Allen (clarinet )? Probably not. These are outstanding achievers. But the way these and other visionaries I spoke to process music is interesting. But the key question is: why does that connection exist? Paul Allen offers an answer. He says music \\"establish your confidence in the ability to create.\\" He began playing the violin at age 7 and switched to the guitar as a teenager. Even in the early days of Microsoft, he would pick up his guitar at the end of marathon days of programming. The music was the emotional analog to his day job, both of them show his different creativity. He says, \\"something is pushing you to look beyond what currently exists and express yourself in a new way.\\" For many of the high achievers I spoke with, music functions as a \\"hidden language,\\" as Mr. Wolfensohn calls it, one that enhances the ability to connect different or even opposite ideas.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What's the first name of the person the nightclub singer's fiance set as the target of a bet? from the following article ? Gambler Nathan Detroit seeks to organize an unlicensed crap game, but the police, led by Lieutenant Brannigan, are \\"putting on the heat\\". All the places where Nathan usually holds his games refuse him entry due to Brannigan's intimidating pressure. The Biltmore garage is the only venue where Nathan can hold the game, but its owner requires a 1,000 security deposit, which Nathan doesn't have. Adding to his problems, Nathan's fiancée, Miss Adelaide, a nightclub singer, wants to bring an end to their 14-year engagement and actually tie the knot. She also wants him to go straight, but organizing illegal gambling is the only thing he's good at. Then Nathan spots an old acquaintance, Sky Masterson, a gambler willing to bet on virtually anything and for high amounts. To win the 1,000 security deposit, Nathan bets Sky that he can't take a girl of Nathan's choosing to dinner in Havana, Cuba. The bet seems impossible for Sky to win when Nathan nominates Sergeant Sarah Brown, a sister at the Save a Soul Mission, which opposes gambling. To approach Sarah, Sky pretends that he is a gambler who wants to change. Sky suggests a bargain. He will get a dozen sinners into the Mission for her Thursday night meeting in return for her having dinner with him in Havana.

The United States on Tuesday praised the efforts of South African President Thabo Mbeki who, on the behalf of the African Union, has vied to restart the peace process in the Ivory Coast.","completion":"This is about the United States offering its praise to South African President Thabo Mbeki for his efforts to revive the peace process in the Ivory Coast on behalf of the African Union. To provide a detailed and long answer, we need to understand the context, the key figures involved, the nature of the peace process, and its implications. Context: The conflict in the Ivory Coast, also known as Côte d'Ivoire, began in the early 2000s following a prolonged political instability in the country. The situation escalated into a full-blown civil war in 2002, with various factions fighting for control over the nation and its resources. The conflict was characterized by ethnic clashes, economic disputes, and political rivalries, driving the country into a humanitarian and security crisis. Key Figures: 1. Thabo Mbeki: At the time of this praise, Thabo Mbeki was the President of South Africa and a leading figure in African diplomacy. He was known for his efforts towards peace and stability on the continent and had been actively involved in peace negotiations various African conflicts. 2. African Union: The African Union is an intergovernmental organization consisting of 55 African countries. It was established with the goal of fostering unity, sustainable development, and peace amongst its member states. The African Union has played a vital role in mediating conflicts and fostering peace on the continent. The Peace Process: To help bring an end to the conflict in the Ivory Coast, President Thabo Mbeki spearheaded mediation efforts on behalf of the African Union. His objective was to facilitate dialogue between the conflicting factions in the country, paving the way for a peaceful resolution of the crisis. Mbeki's efforts included engaging with leaders of the warring factions, negotiating ceasefire agreements, and persuading various stakeholders to participate in internationally monitored peace talks. These efforts led to the signing of several accords aimed at ending hostilities, implementing power-sharing arrangements, and setting in motion processes for elections and disarmament. Implications: The United States recognized the importance of Mbeki's efforts, as achieving peace and stability in the Ivory Coast had far-reaching implications for the security of the West African region, the continent, and beyond. A successful peace process could prevent the conflict from spilling over into neighboring countries, reduce the likelihood of further humanitarian crises, and promote sustainable development in the region. Furthermore, a stable Ivory Coast would contribute to the global fight against terrorism, drug trafficking, and other criminal activities that thrive in the context of state fragility. In conclusion, the praise offered by the United States to South African President Thabo Mbeki for his efforts to restart the peace process in the Ivory Coast underscores the significant role played by African-led diplomacy in resolving the conflict. This approach, backed by the support of the international community, demonstrates the potential of diplomatic initiatives in fostering peace and stability in Africa and around the world."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Hans Lundgren was born on 3 November 1957 in Spanga, the son of Sigrid Birgitta (nee Tjerneld), a language teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Spanga until the age of 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland, Angermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Although Lundgren has never competed as a professional bodybuilder, he has been closely associated with bodybuilding and fitness since his role as Drago in the mid-1980s. Bodybuilding.com said, \\"Looking like a man in his 30s rather than his 50s, Lundgren is the poster boy of precise nutrition, supplementation and exercise application that he has practiced for over 35 years.\\" In an interview with them, he claimed to often train up to six days a week, usually one-hour sessions completed in the morning, saying that \\"it's just one hour a day, and then you can enjoy the other 23 hours\\". Although he had begun lifting weights as a teenager, he cites co-star Sylvester Stallone as the man who got him into serious bodybuilding for a period in the 1980s after he arrived in the U.S. Stallone had a lasting influence on his fitness regime and diet, ensuring that he ate a much higher percentage of protein and split his food intake between five or six smaller meals a day. Lundgren has professed never to have been \\"super strong\\", saying that, \\"I'm too tall and my arms are long. I think back then [Rocky IV] I was working with around 300 pounds on the bench and squat.\\" In a January 2011 interview with GQ he announced he is working on releasing his own range of vitamins and supplements. He wrote an autobiographical fitness book, Train Like an Action Hero: Be Fit Forever, published in Sweden (by Bonnier Fakta) on 9 August 2011, offering tips he learned over the years to work out in various situations (with a busy schedule and a lot of traveling).

He cites a better quality of life as having inspired him to maintain his physical fitness. When in Los Angeles he trains at the Equinox Gym in Westwood and when at home in Marbella, Spain, he trains at the Qi Sport Gym in Puerto Banus. Dolph does, however, also like to spar and practice his karate in the gym to keep in top shape aside from weight lifting. He cites dead lifting and squats as the best exercises for muscle building.

Review: Title: \\"Great Concept, Needs Some Improvements\\" I recently started using the org.ppsspp.ppsspp app and found that it has some great features, such as the ability to play a wide variety of games. The interface is relatively user-friendly and easy to navigate. However, there are some areas where the app could use improvement. One issue I encountered was with the app's performance. While it generally runs smoothly, there were instances of occasional slowdown and lag during gameplay. In addition, the app occasionally crashed, which was frustrating. Another area that could use improvement is the app's visual appeal. The design is functional but could benefit from some polish to make it more visually attractive and engaging. This would enhance the overall user experience. Finally, after reading other users' feedback, it seems that some users have reported issues with compatibility and certain games not running properly on the app. It would be helpful if the app developers worked on addressing these issues to ensure a better experience for all users.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is the 45th and current President of the United States, in office since January 20, 2017. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality. Trump was born and raised in the New York City borough of Queens, and earned an economics degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He took over his family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and expanded it to involve the construction and renovation of skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. New Jersey legalized casino gambling in 1977, and Trump went to Atlantic City, New Jersey the following year in order to explore how he might get involved in a new business venture. Seven years later, Harrah's at Trump Plaza hotel and casino opened there; the project was built by Trump with financing from the Holiday Corporation, which also managed the operation. Renamed \\"Trump Plaza\\" soon after it opened, it was at the time the tallest building in Atlantic City. The casino's poor financial results exacerbated disagreements between Trump and Holiday Corp., which led to Trump's paying 70 million in May 1986 to buy out their interest in the property. Trump also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for 320 million; when completed in 1985, that hotel and casino became Trump Castle, and Trump's wife Ivana managed that property until 1988. Also in 1988, Trump acquired his third casino in Atlantic City, the Taj Mahal, then halfway through construction, through a complex transaction with television host and entertainer Merv Griffin as well as the resort and casino company Resorts International. The Taj opened in April 1990 and was built at a total cost of 1.1 billion, which at the time made it the most expensive casino ever. The project was financed with 675 million in junk bonds and was a major gamble by Trump. The project underwent debt restructuring the following year, leaving Trump with 50% ownership. He also sold his 282-foot (86 m) megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been indefinitely docked in Atlantic City while leased to his casinos for use by wealthy gamblers. In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana. THCR purchased Taj Mahal in 1996 and underwent bankruptcy restructuring in 2004 and 2009, leaving Trump with 10% ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties. From mid 1995 until early 2009, he served as chairman of the publicly-traded THCR organization--which was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts--and served as CEO from mid 2000 to mid 2005. During the 1990s, Trump's casino ventures faced competition from Native American gaming at the Foxwoods casino located on an Indian reservation in Connecticut, where it was exempt from the state's anti-gambling laws. Trump stated in 1993 that the casino owners did not look like real Indians to him or to other Indians. Subsequent to that well-publicized remark about the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, Trump became a key investor backing the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots, who were also seeking state recognition. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: did trump manage all the properties or did he have someone doing it for him?","completion":"From the above article, it is evident that Trump did not manage all the properties himself.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

Distributing, Then Confiscating, Condoms I MET her at 2 a.m. on a cold and windy morning in Washington, when she ran over to the outreach van to get a warm cup of coffee. Volunteers were offering condoms and health information to sex workers. She took only two condoms, and I urged her to take more. She told me that although she was worried about H.I.V., she was more afraid of the police. A month earlier, she had been harassed by officers for carrying several condoms. They told her to throw them out. She thought if they picked her up with more than a couple of condoms again, she might be taken to jail on prostitution charges. Her story is not unique. Over the last eight months, Human Rights Watch has interviewed more than 200 current and former sex workers in New York, Los Angeles, Washington and San Francisco. The interviews were part of an investigation into barriers to H.I.V. prevention for sex workers, who, worldwide, are more than 10 times as likely to be infected as the general population. What we found was shocking: While public health departments spend millions of dollars promoting and distributing condoms, police departments are harassing sex workers for carrying them and using them as evidence to support arrests. Many of the women we interviewed asked, “How many condoms is it legal to carry?” One wondered, “Why is the city giving me condoms when I can’t carry them without going to jail?” Some women said they continued to carry condoms despite the consequences. For others, fear of arrest trumped fears of sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. Most of those we interviewed told us they were afraid to carry the number of condoms they needed, and some — about 5 percent — told us they had unprotected sex with clients as a result. Police officers confiscate condoms and prosecutors try to enter them as evidence not because it is official policy to do so, but simply because they have not been trained to do otherwise. An act of the legislature (like one bill pending in the New York State Assembly), or even a directive from a police chief or district attorney, could end the practice immediately. Categories of evidence — like testimony regarding the sexual history of rape victims — are excluded as a matter of public policy in many legal systems. In this case, the value of condoms for H.I.V. and disease prevention far outweighs any utility they might have in the enforcement of anti-prostitution laws. Law enforcement efforts should not interfere with the right of anyone, including sex workers, to protect his or her own health. Later this month, the 19th International AIDS Conference will be held in Washington. The United States’ response to the epidemic will be in the spotlight; it is an opportunity for our government to announce new policies that protect those at risk of H.I.V. infection and to eliminate those that undermine prevention. Police and public health officials both seek to protect individuals and make our communities safer. They can — and should — work together to keep condoms in the hands of those who need them the most. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1. Sex workers are hesitant to carry multiple condoms due to fear of arrest by police, despite being at a higher risk for H.I.V infection. 2. Public health departments distribute condoms, but police departments use them as evidence for arrests, creating a contradictory situation for sex workers. 3. Human Rights Watch interviewed over 200 sex workers in various cities, revealing that the fear of arrest led some to engage in unprotected sex. 4. Police and prosecutors lack official guidelines regarding confiscating condoms or using them as evidence in anti-prostitution cases, possibly a training issue. 5. A legislative act, policy directive, or improved training could prevent the use of condoms as evidence and support H.I.V. prevention among sex workers. 6. The upcoming International AIDS Conference provides an opportunity for the U.S. government to announce new policies that protect those at risk of H.I.V. infection and to eliminate policies that undermine prevention efforts. 7.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is trying to get fit happens, how will it affect more sweat is produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"In order to answer this question, let's break down the process and hypothesis step by step and evaluate the potential effects. Process: 1. As the sweat evaporates, sweat sheds molecules into the air. 2. The sweat changes into a gas. 3. Heat is drawn from the sweat. 4. This process draws heat from the body. 5. The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body. Perturbation hypothesis: If a person is trying to get fit, more sweat is produced. Now, let's analyze the potential effects of the perturbation hypothesis on the process: 1. If a person is trying to get fit, they are likely engaging in physical activities or exercises. As a result, their body will produce more heat, which will lead to an increase in sweating. This supports the perturbation hypothesis that more sweat is produced. 2. The increase in sweat production should enhance the evaporation process, as there will be more sweat present to shed molecules into the air and change into a gas. 3. As the amount of sweat increases, heat will continue to be drawn from the sweat to dissipate the excess thermal energy produced during physical activity. 4. The enhanced evaporation process will draw more heat from the body overall, helping to regulate body temperature. 5. The evaporation of a larger amount of sweat will also cool the remaining sweat on the body more efficiently, further contributing to the effectiveness of this cooling process. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of a person trying to get fit and producing more sweat does have a direct effect on the original process. The increase in sweat production will enhance the evaporation process, leading to more efficient heat dissipation and cooling for the individual."},{"prompt":"Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What can Harper Univeristy hospital be found?\\" is in \\"Within the city of Detroit, there are over a dozen major hospitals which include the Detroit Medical Center (DMC), Henry Ford Health System, St. John Health System, and the John D.

Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection. Alfred Russel Wallace discussed evidence from his Malay archipelago research, including an 1864 paper with an evolutionary explanation for the Wallace line.\\", answer the following question.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the premise \\"A dog runs through the water with a stick while another dog stands there.\\" true if \\"Two dogs are playing.\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"Two dogs are playing\\" does not necessarily make the premise \\"A dog runs through the water with a stick while another dog stands there\\" true. There is just not enough information given to know for sure whether the two scenarios are the same. Allow me to break down the discrepancies: 1. The activities of the dogs: In the first premise, the specific activities of two dogs are described - one is running through water with a stick, and the other is standing. These are specific actions. In contrast, the second premise simply states, \\"Two dogs are playing.\\" This term is broad, and it encompasses a wide range of activities that dogs might engage in when they play. It could include running, jumping, chasing, wrestling, etc. With a stick or without it. 2. The involvement of water: The first premise mentions water, which means that the scenario must be taking place near a body of water large enough for a dog to run through. The second scenario does not mention any water at all. Dogs can play anywhere - inside, outside, in a field, on a pavement et cetera. The presence of water is a very specific detail not accounted for in the second premise. 3. The presence of a stick: The first premise specifically mentions that one of the dogs has a stick. Dogs often play with sticks, but not always. The second premise does not mention a stick, or indeed any play objects at all. Play might involve a stick, a ball, a Frisbee, or simply interaction between the dogs. 4. The action of standing: In the first premise, one dog is standing while the other is running. In the concept of 'play', both or all dogs involved are generally assumed to be interactive, rather than one just standing still. So, while it's not impossible, having one dog just 'stand there' isn't necessarily considered 'playing'. In conclusion, while it does not explicitly contradict it, the premise \\"Two dogs are playing\\" does not provide enough detailed information to confirm the specific scenario of \\"A dog runs through the water with a stick while another dog stands there\\". Both premises can be true at the same time, but they can also be independent of each other. The first premise might be an instance of the second, but the second could be true without the first premise being true as well.

Maxwell's gang, the People's Revolutionary Strike Force (PRSF), plans to use the gas men's uniforms and van as part of an ambitious series of crimes that will make them rich. Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) and his partner Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum), after dealing with a chronic fainter, arrive at a liquor store where robbers have taken hostages. The robbers demand a car with a police radio; the inspector provides one by driving his squad car into the store and shooting the robbers. His superior Captain McKay (Bradford Dillman) reprimands Callahan for \\"excessive use of force\\", injuring the hostages, and causing 14,379 of damage to the store, and temporarily transfers him out of the Homicide unit. While assigned to Personnel, Callahan participates in the interview process for promotions, and learns that affirmative action means that three of the new inspectors will be female including Kate Moore (Tyne Daly), despite her very limited field experience. The PRSF uses the gas company van to steal M72 LAW rockets, Colt M16 rifles, a Taser and other weapons from a warehouse. In the course of the robbery, three people are killed: a security guard whom Maxwell kills for his keys; DiGiorgio, whom Maxwell stabs in the back after he stumbles in on the robbery after discovering the guard's body; one of Maxwell's accomplices is accidentally shot when DiGiorgio's gun goes off.

Riga held talks with chairman Karl Oyston this morning where it was agreed it was time to end the manager’s four-and-a-half month spell in charge at Bloomfield Road. The Belgian’s time at the club has been blighted by constant rows with his chairman and their relationship reached a point of no return over the weekend. Blackpool are expected to part company with beleaguered manager Jose Riga this week. Ex-Birmingham City manager Lee Clark is being sounded out as Riga's replacement at Bloomfield Road. Riga lost eleven of his 16 games in charge after starting the season with just 13 players on the opening day. A statement on the club's website read: 'Blackpool Football Club can confirm that Head Coach Jose Riga has had his contract terminated with immediate effect.' Former Birmingham manager Lee Clark has emerged as the early candidate. Sportsmail understands Clark - sacked by Birmingham City just last week - could be appointed as soon as Wednesday.

But it wasn't a dream. Her phone showed that during the night, Priedeman had read a text message from her friend. She did it while she was fast asleep. Reading and sending text messages while asleep--called \\"sleep texting\\"--is an unusual sleep behaviour, similar to sleepwalking. It's also a growing concern among doctors: young people can't live without their cell phones. One in three teenagers sends more than 100 text messages a day, according to the Pew Internet & American Life Project. And at least four out of five teenagers said they sleep with their phone on or near their bed. Elizabeth Dowdell, a professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, has studied sleeping texting. She said that having a phone nearby all night is a big part of the problem. Andrew Stiehm, a sleep medicine expert with Allina Health in Minnesota, agrees. It's possible for the part of the brain that controls motor skills to wake up, while the part of the brain that controls memory and judgment may be still asleep. That's why some people can perform basic movements ---such as walking, talking, texting or even driving--while they're sleeping. Some of Dowdell's students said that they're disturbed by their nighttime texting behavior. But because sleep texting is _ , it's a difficult habit to break. Dowdell said she knows of some students who wear socks on their hands to keep themselves from texting.

Keurig K-Cup inventor: I ‘feel bad’ for making them Wednesday, March 4, 2015, 3:08 PM The inventor of the popular Keurig K-Cups says he regrets ever making the non-recyclable, single-serve coffee pods, which are piling up in landfills. “I feel bad sometimes that I ever did it,” John Sylvan told The Atlantic. Plastic K-Cups have long been slammed for their environmental impact. Campaigns like “Kill the K-Cups” use dramatic imagery of coffee pod monsters attacking people in the street. Keurig produced enough K-Cups in 2013 to circle the Earth 10.5 times, according to Mother Jones. Keurig has pledged to make all K-Cups recyclable by 2020. But in the meantime, Americans can’t get enough K-Cup coffee. Pod machine sales have exploded since 2008, according to The Atlantic. K-Cup sales drove Keurig Green Mountain’s annual revenue to 4.7 billion in 2014. An estimated one in three U.S. homes has one — but you won’t find a pod-based machine at Sylvan’s house. Sylvan, who was bought out of Keurig in 2007 and has sold his Green Mountain stock, doesn’t use one for his morning java. “They're kind of expensive to use,” he said. “Plus it's not like drip coffee is tough to make.” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The inventor of Keurig K-Cups, John Sylvan, has expressed regret for creating the non-recyclable, single-serve coffee pods due to their detrimental impact on the environment.

The premise specifically states that Lentauw and Yamasami, who were Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. To further analyze the connections between the premise and the hypothesis, let us break down the elements of the premise: 1. Lentauw and Yamasami are Zulu tribesmen. 2. They were in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. 3. While in St. Louis, they entered the marathon. Now, let's examine the hypothesis: \\"The Zulu tribesmen entered the marathon in St. Louis.\\" This statement is essentially a summary of the premise. It draws a direct connection between the Zulu tribesmen and their participation in the marathon that took place in St. Louis. To further support the hypothesis' validity, we can consider some logical inferences: - Since Lentauw and Yamasami are Zulu tribesmen, as mentioned in the premise, their actions directly involve the broader category of \\"Zulu tribesmen.\\" - As their participation in the marathon is explicitly stated in the premise, it can be rightfully concluded that at least some Zulu tribesmen—namely Lentauw and Yamasami—did indeed enter the marathon. - Given that St. Louis is the location of the marathon in question, it is accurate and valid to include this detail in the hypothesis. In conclusion, based on the provided premise, the hypothesis \\"The Zulu tribesmen entered the marathon in St. Louis\\" holds true, as Lentauw and Yamasami, who are Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon while they were in St. Louis for an exhibit about the Boer war.

I loved my aunt Suzy. She was such a kind old lady. I loved going to her house on holiday. She had been sick for the last few years and, though my job had taken me away across the town, I tried to visit her as much as possible. I helped with the shopping, the cooking and the cleaning and taking her pet cat Mazy to the vet. Sad as her passing away was, what happened to Mazy was even more worrying. Because aunt Suzy had no children, there wasn't anyone who seemed to care for her beloved cat friend. I would have taken her in a short time, but my apartment doesn't allow pets. First, we talked with her neighbors. Mr. Jenkins, who was alone and lived across the street, wasn't interested. Joe and Sally who lived next door had a small child with serious skin allergies . My aunt's best friend Molly who had lived just down the road was unable to take care of herself as she had serious health problems. Second, we thought about our family members. My brother Bobby and his wife Jill were _ at once as they aren't cat people. My cousin in California was a bit interested, but we weren't sure about the trip as Mazy was nearly as old as my aunt (in cat years!). Finally, we came to the local humane society to see whether they would be able to help her find a new home. The problem was that most people and families only welcomed a smart little cat into their home, not a dull old one. In the end, we had to put Mazy to sleep. I had spoken with the vet and realized it was possible for the best. It was so hard to lose aunt Suzy and then have nowhere for Mazy to live. A few months went by and I had gone to my aunt's house to clear out some of her belongings. I happened to see her mailman. Jerry and we started to talk about my aunt when he asked about Mazy. I told him that we had to put Mazy to sleep because we couldn't find a home for her. Jerry got really quiet. \\"I promised Suzy that if anything ever happened to her, I'd take care of Mazy\\", he said sadly. \\"Suzy always said she'd told her lawyer the arrangement.\\" Hearing this, my heart sank to my feet and I almost cried.

Birthright citizenship in the United States is acquired by virtue of the circumstances of birth. It contrasts with citizenship acquired in other ways, for example by naturalization. Birthright citizenship may be conferred by jus soli or jus sanguinis. Under United States law, U.S. citizenship is automatically granted to any person born within and subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. This includes the territories of Puerto Rico, the Marianas (Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands), and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and also applies to children born elsewhere in the world to U.S. citizens (with certain exceptions). Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: are you automatically a citizen if born in the us?","completion":"Yes, based on the above text, you are automatically a citizen if born in the United States. This principle of citizenship is guided by the policy of jus soli, which is a right by soil, where citizenship is determined by place of birth. This principle is enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states that \\"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\\" Along with the general territory of the United States, this principle of birthright citizenship also extends to U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico, the Marianas, which include Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Therefore, any person born within these territories is automatically awarded U.S. citizenship. Additionally, this principle also applies in some cases to children born outside the United States to U.S. citizens. This type of citizenship is based on jus sanguinis, or right by blood, where citizenship isn't automatic and is determined by at least one parent's citizenship status. There are certain exceptions to this case, and the laws govern the specifics surrounding birth outside the U.S to American parents. While the aforementioned ways are automatic, there are other ways a person can become a U.S. citizenship which isn't automatic and requires going through a process, such as naturalization. For a foreign-born person who is not a citizen by birth, they must first get a green card (permanent residency) and fulfill certain requirements before they can go through the process of becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen. In sum, the concept of birthright citizenship in the United States operates under the principles of jus soli and jus sanguinis. These principles constitute the main channels for automatic acquisition of U.S. citizenship, hence, if a person is born within the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S, they are automatically awarded citizenship, subject to certain conditions and exceptions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. Several years ago, I taught teenagers with feeling troubles in a group home. These very tough kids often came directly from prison to my classroom. They often wanted to escape from the group home. They were society's \\"throwaway\\" kids--youngsters without families to love and care for them. They desperately needed to receive love. Then I found one thing more important for them. So, when a friend suggested an idea, I thought it would be a great program for my students. The plan was simple. We arranged that every Wednesday morning, I'd bring over my little crew, and they were supposed to clean the runs, wash dog and cat bowls, and feed the animals at our local animal shelter. Then came the risky part of the program. After doing their chores, the youngsters would earn the freedom to walk one of the dogs in the wooded area behind the shelter, where I couldn't even see them. We began the project. Each week, I carefully went over the list of students who had met the requirements. All that week, students worked hard to control their tempers and be cooperative. I emphasized how much the animals needed their love and care. As they served the animals, the youngsters were transforming before our eyes. Never before had they been considered contributing members of society. Yet now these kids begged to volunteer at the shelter. As we had planned, my students walked the dogs, unwatched, in the woods for up to half an hour. I impressed on each of them my trust and respect that they'd bring back the animal in their care safely and on time. Remarkably, I never lost a student or an animal.

In applying statistics to, e.g., a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as \\"all people living in a country\\" or \\"every atom composing a crystal\\". Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. - An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis. Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. There also exists natural experimental studies. - Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384322 B.C.), though \\"analysis\\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development. - In statistics , a generalized additive model ( GAM ) is a generalized linear model in which the linear predictor depends linearly on unknown smooth functions of some predictor variables , and interest focuses on inference about these smooth functions . GAMs were originally developed by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani to blend properties of generalized linear models with additive models . The model relates a univariate response variable , Y , to some predictor variables , xi. An exponential family distribution is specified for Y ( for example normal , binomial or Poisson distributions ) along with a link function g ( for example the identity or log functions ) relating the expected value of Y to the predictor variables via a structure such as g ( operatorname ( E ) ( Y ) ) = beta_0 + f_1 ( x_1 ) + f_2 ( x_2 ) + cdots + f_m ( x_m ) . , ! The functions fi ( xi ) may be functions with a specified parametric form ( for example a polynomial , or a coefficient depending on the levels of a factor variable ) or may be specified non-parametrically , or semi-parametrically , simply as ' smooth functions ' , to be estimated by non-parametric means . So a typical GAM might use a scatterplot smoothing function , such as a locally weighted mean , for f1 ( x1 ) , and then use a factor model for f2 ( x2 ) . This flexibility to allow non-parametric fits with relaxed assumptions on the actual relationship between response and predictor , provides the potential for better fits to data than purely parametric models , but arguably with some loss of interpretability . - In statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment. A statistical population can be a group of actually existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all possible hands in a game of poker). A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population. - Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa (DATA) was a multinational non-government organization founded in January 2002 in London by U2's Bono along with Bobby Shriver and activists from the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign. - A statistical model is a class of mathematical model, which embodies a set of assumptions concerning the generation of some sample data, and similar data from a larger population. A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process. - In statistics, multicollinearity (also collinearity) is a phenomenon in which two or more predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy. In this situation the coefficient estimates of the multiple regression may change erratically in response to small changes in the model or the data. Multicollinearity does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole, at least within the sample data set; it only affects calculations regarding individual predictors. That is, a multiple regression model with correlated predictors can indicate how well the entire bundle of predictors predicts the outcome variable, but it may not give valid results about any individual predictor, or about which predictors are redundant with respect to others. - The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces (often with hundreds or thousands of dimensions) that do not occur in low-dimensional settings such as the three-dimensional physical space of everyday experience. The expression was coined by Richard E. Bellman when considering problems in dynamic optimization. - Nonparametric regression is a category of regression analysis in which the predictor does not take a predetermined form but is constructed according to information derived from the data. Nonparametric regression requires larger sample sizes than regression based on parametric models because the data must supply the model structure as well as the model estimates. - Model selection is the task of selecting a statistical model from a set of candidate models, given data. In the simplest cases, a pre-existing set of data is considered. However, the task can also involve the design of experiments such that the data collected is well-suited to the problem of model selection. Given candidate models of similar predictive or explanatory power, the simplest model is most likely to be the best choice. - A statistic (singular) or sample statistic is a single measure of some attribute of a sample (e.g., its arithmetic mean value). It is calculated by applying a function (statistical algorithm) to the values of the items of the sample, which are known together as a set of data. - In statistics and machine learning, one of the most common tasks is to fit a \\"model\\" to a set of training data, so as to be able to make reliable predictions on general untrained data. In overfitting, a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship. Overfitting occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observations. A model that has been overfit has poor predictive performance, as it overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data. - In statistics, an additive model (AM) is a nonparametric regression method. It was suggested by Jerome H. Friedman and Werner Stuetzle (1981) and is an essential part of the ACE algorithm. The \\"AM\\" uses a one-dimensional smoother to build a restricted class of nonparametric regression models. Because of this, it is less affected by the curse of dimensionality than e.g. a \\"p\\"-dimensional smoother. Furthermore, the \\"AM\\" is more flexible than a standard linear model, while being more interpretable than a general regression surface at the cost of approximation errors. Problems with \\"AM\\" include model selection, overfitting, and multicollinearity. - In statistics, the generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution. The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a \\"link function\\" and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value. What entity does 'generalized additive model' has the relation 'instance of' with? A:","completion":"The generalized additive model (GAM) has the relation 'instance of' with the broader class of statistical models. Specifically, it is a type of semi-parametric regression model that builds on the foundation of generalized linear models (GLMs). In a GAM, the linear predictor depends linearly on unknown smooth functions of predictor variables, allowing for more flexibility in modeling complex data structures and relationships between the response variable and predictor variables."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who was said to be making the church a popular meeting place on campus for undergraduates? is inside the article: Stanford did not employ a full-time professor in religion until 1951 and did not establish a religious studies department until 1973, later than most other universities in the U.S. Earlier courses in religion were largely offered by the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church. David Charles Gardner offered a course in Biblical history and literature beginning in 1907, and by 1910, he was teaching New Testament Greek and Bible classes. Gardner's successor, D. Elton Trueblood, whose goal was the establishment of a non-denominational graduate school in religious studies at Stanford, taught classes about the philosophy of religion. In 1941 Trueblood's efforts to expand the study of religion resulted in the creation of a minor in religion, as well as twenty-one courses offered by him and four faculty members. By 1960, the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church no longer had to run the program, which had expanded to allow students the option of majoring in the study of religion. By the mid-1960s, the religious studies program at Stanford was enjoying \\"enormous success\\".In the 1960s, the study of religion at Stanford began to focus more on social and ethical issues like race and the Vietnam War. Leading this focus was Stanford Memorial Church Dean of the Chapel and Professor of Religion B. Davie Napier, who was \\"a powerful critic of U.S. policy in Vietnam\\". Napier, along with Stanford professors Michael Novak and Robert McAfee Brown, who had previously been faculty members of seminaries, were the subject of a Time Magazine article in 1966, describing \\"the renaissance of faith and learning at Stanford\\". Students crowded into the church to hear anti-war speeches by them, as well as by \\"notables\\" such as Linus Pauling and William Sloan Coffin.

Summarize this article: Instead of meditating to clear your mind, focus on being present in the moment and fully aware of your experiences. Find a quiet comfortable place and spend some time focusing on your thoughts. This will sharpen your mentality and make you feel prepared, both of which can help you stay positive. Tell your mind to be still and do nothing other than think from moment to moment. Researchers have shown that mindfulness can reduce stress. This improves positive thinking by decreasing anxiety, low mood, and low energy associated with stress. Begin focusing on your breaths. Notice how you feel emotionally and physically as you inhale and exhale. Make yourself focus on what is going on around you. While taking thoughtful breaths, use your senses to notice what you see, hear, and feel in the room or space. Ask yourself if your body feels tired, relaxed, or stiff. Pay attention to your thoughts and feelings. Deep breathing is a good way to revisit what consumed most of your thoughts and influenced your feelings throughout the day. Consider working with a therapist trained in CBT. This therapy can help you change your current ways of thinking. Since thoughts strongly influence your outlook, begin to change your negative thoughts into positive ones. To do this, you'll need to start noticing your thoughts. Stop yourself when you begin to think a negative thought and reframe it to become positive. For example, if you're stuck waiting for a bus, appreciate the time you have to unwind or have a conversation with someone else waiting for the bus. It can be helpful to write down these thoughts in order to help you reframe them. For example, you might write down a negative thought (like disliking driving in the rain) to something positive (like getting more practice driving in the rain). Part of being positive is feeling hopeful about the future. Setting goals is a good way to focus on the future. You'll also benefit from a boost in self-esteem when you achieve goals. To improve your chances of successfully meeting goals, make sure the goals are: Written down (Studies shows these are more detailed and likely to be met) Detailed Realistic Created with a timeframe or deadline in mind Worded positively While being positive all the time may sound like a great idea, you need to be realistic with yourself. There will be times in your life when you simply won't feel positive. In fact, situations may come up that make you legitimately sad or angry. However, you can use a positive outlook to deal with painful emotions and give yourself a sense of hope or acceptance. For example, if you just lost a loved pet, you'll probably feel sad or upset. You can still use positive thinking to remind yourself what you have to appreciate, like the time you had with your pet. Or, you can use positivity to remind yourself that this painful time will pass. Summary:","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of mindfulness, positive thinking, and goal-setting for maintaining a healthy mindset and reducing stress. It suggests that being present in the moment and focusing on your experiences can improve your mental clarity and positivity. To achieve this, find a quiet space, concentrate on your thoughts and practice deep breathing. Mindfulness can decrease anxiety, low mood, and low energy associated with stress. Changing negative thoughts into positive ones is another way to stay positive. This can be done by noticing your negative thoughts and reframing them into positive ones, such as appreciating the time you have to unwind while waiting for a bus. Writing down these thoughts may help in the reframing process. Setting goals for the future is also important for maintaining a positive outlook. These goals should be written down, detailed, realistic, have a timeframe, and be worded positively. Achieving these goals can lead to a boost in self-esteem. However, it is crucial to be realistic and acknowledge that you may not always feel positive. Painful emotions are a natural part of life, but a positive outlook can help in coping and finding hope or acceptance in difficult situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Do not look for the Danteum in the Eternal City. In true Dantean form, politics stood in the way of its construction in 1938. Ironically this literature-inspired building can itself most easily be found in book form. Reading this book I remembered Goethe's quote about frozen music. Did Terragni try to freeze Dante's medieval miracle of song? Certainly a cold-poem seems artistically repulsive. Unflattering comparisons to the lake of Cocytus spring to mind too. While I cannot read Italian, I can read some German. After locating the original quotation I discovered that 'frozen' is a problematic (though common) translation of Goethe's original 'erstarrte.' The verb 'erstarren' more properly means 'to solidify' or 'to stiffen.' This suggests a chemical reaction in which the art does not necessarily chill in the transformation. Nor can simple thawing yield the original work. Like a chemical reaction it requires an artistic catalyst, a muse. Indeed the Danteum is not a physical translation of the Poem. Terragni thought it inappropriate to translate the Comedy literally into a non-literary work. The Danteum would not be a stage set, rather Terragni generated his design from the Comedy's structure, not its finishes.

Cost of cigarettes could double under Labor proposal to deter smoking The cost of cigarettes could almost double by 2020 if Labor wins the next election. (AAP) The cost of a packer of cigarettes will almost double by 2020 if Labor wins government, under a new plan to deter smoking. The opposition has said it will continue the increase in tobacco excise from July 1, 2017, delivering four 12.5 per cent increases if it wins the next federal election. The policy would bring Australia in line with countries such as France, New Zealand and the UK in ensuring taxation accounts for at least 75 per cent of the cost of a pack of cigarettes. It's been costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office to raise 3.8 billion over the forward estimates and 47.7 billion over the medium term, Labor says. The costing assumes more Australians will quit smoking compared to the status quo policy scenario. Under the current policy, a pack of 25 cigarettes that costs 24.69 today will cost 29.91 in 2020. Under the proposed changes, it would cost 40.80 by 2020. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said more needed to be done to reduce the \\"unacceptably\\" high levels of smoking, with 2.5 million Australians smoking daily. It's a drain on the health system and a drag on the economy, he said. \\"Ask any parent who smokes whether they want their kids to start smoking as well and of course they'll say no,\\" Mr Shorten said. \\"I want to stop young people taking up smoking and I want more people to quit smoking. \\"Malcolm Turnbull's Liberals want to increase the GST and the cost of everything, including fresh food, school fees and going to the doctor.\\" Opposition health spokesman Catherine King said raising tobacco taxes to more than 75 per cent of the retail price was considered best practice by the World Health Organisation. The 8.3 billion of revenue collected through tobacco taxes in the 2014/15 financial year was dwarfed by the 31.5 billion in annual economic and social costs caused from smoking. Labor's plan still won't cover half that cost. Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen said the announcement would contribute to budget consolidation and fund initiatives in health and other areas.

Using a q-tip, clean the lint from the iPhone's audio port.; 2). You can use a flashlight to double check if you got the lint of not.;","completion":"Both options 1 and 2 are important steps in accomplishing the goal of resolving the issue with your iPhone earbuds not working right. However, they are not mutually exclusive as they serve different purposes in solving the problem. To effectively resolve the issue, you may want to follow a step-by-step approach that combines both options: Step 1: Identify the problem First, make sure that the problem lies in either the earbuds or the iPhone's audio port. You can do this by attempting to use a different set of earbuds or headphones with your iPhone to see if they work. If the other earbuds or headphones work correctly, then the problem lies with the original earbuds. If they also don't work, then the issue is likely with the iPhone's audio port. Step 2: Clean the iPhone's audio port If the problem is with the audio port, carefully use a q-tip to clean any lint, dust, or debris that may have accumulated inside the port. This material could interfere with the connection between the earbuds and the iPhone, causing them to not work correctly. When cleaning, make sure not to push the debris further inside the port. Gently swab around the edges and the interior of the port to remove any foreign matter. Step 3: Double-check the cleanliness of the audio port After cleaning the audio port, use a flashlight to inspect the port visually. Make sure that you have successfully removed all lint, dust, or debris from inside the port. If you still see any remnants of foreign matter, carefully use the q-tip to continue cleaning until the port appears entirely free of any obstructions. Step 4: Test the earbuds again After cleaning and inspecting the port, reconnect your earbuds and see if they work correctly. If they are still not functioning properly, consider testing them with another device to confirm that the issue lies with the earbuds themselves. Step 5: Address earbuds issue If the problem is with the earbuds, inspect them for any visible damage, such as frayed or exposed wires. If you find any signs of damage, you may need to replace them. If there is no apparent physical damage, try cleaning the earbud connectors with a soft, dry cloth to ensure a proper connection between the earbuds and the audio port.

After making sure that all potential routes outside are closed and secured, invite her to have a look around a few more rooms. Gradually allowing access to other spaces will help to lower her anxiety. Keep an eye on her when you allow her to explore more and be on-hand to comfort or play with her if she appears stressed. If you have a cat-leash you could use it to make sure she is unable to make a run for it. If your cat is not used to a leash this could just make her even more stressed out. You can use a plug-in pheromone diffuser to release scents that are designed to calm stressed cats. You can buy these from your local pet store or vet, and they help to create a more reassuring environment after a move. It is a particularly good idea to use one in the room your cat will be spending a lot of time in at the start. Different cats will react in different ways to these diffusers and some may not react at all. You could keep some catnip handy as an alternative. It's important to be relaxed around her, and to allow her plenty of time to adjust to her new surroundings. She might take a while to get back to her old personality, becoming more withdrawn or quiet after the move. Showing patience and sensitivity will help to reduce any anxieties and create a comfortable and welcoming environment. While you gradually introduce her to her new house, it's important that you don't allow her to get outside yet. Keep her in the house for two weeks so she can become fully acclimated to her new surroundings before you let her out. Spending this long in the new house helps to establish it as her new base, and lower the chances of her trying to make her way back to the old house. Take extra care to make sure your don't leave doors or windows open in this period and generally be observant and careful. If you have a very adventurous cat who is desperate to go outdoors, don't give in. Keep her in for a minimum of two weeks; the amount of time depends on the disposition of the individual cat.

After a couple of days, you can begin to allow her to explore more rooms in the house, ensuring all exits are closed and secured. Monitor her stress levels and provide comfort or playtime if needed. Cat-leashes can be used, but only if she is comfortable with them, or consider using pheromone diffusers or catnip to help calm her. It's crucial to remain patient and relaxed around her, allowing her adequate time to adjust to her new environment. Cats may behave differently after a move, appearing more withdrawn or quiet, but your patience and sensitivity will help alleviate anxiety and create a welcoming atmosphere for her. Keep your cat indoors for at least two weeks before allowing her to venture outside. This helps establish the new house as her base and lessens the chances of her trying to return to the old property. Be diligent about keeping doors and windows closed during this time and don't give in to her desire to go outside if she's an adventurous cat.

Fort Myers,Fla.experienced double digit growth in January 2009 over January 2008, based on American Express Travel bookings. Cities like Portland,Ore.are also becoming popular destinations, with Travelocity data showing an increase of 38% over last year. EvenPhiladelphia's star is rising, said Travelocity senior editor Shaw Brown. Brown said it's hard to explain exactly the reason for the _ : it could be a decrease in airfare or hotel prices or excellent marketing. Hotel rates inFort Myersare down about 10%. But hotel rates inPortlandare up, she said. She thinksPhiladelphia's higher popularity is due to good marketing, a decrease in airfare of 16% compared to the overall 8% decrease for domestic flights and more interest in historic destinations in general. FAMILY TRAVEL Rather than take a two-week vacation to Europe, families are going to national parks. David Mandt, spokesman for the Association of Amusement Parks, is cautiously optimistic about the summer season. He said even when gas was 4 a gallon in 2008, people continued to visit theme parks--they simply selected parks closer to their homes. While for years, park operators have used special offers, promotions and discounts to encourage families to visit at a specific time, the deals may be easier to find this year, especially when it comes to packages that include accommodations.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which farmer didn't cause the predation of the crop itself? Barb and Jill practiced small scale farming. Jill farmed the conventional way, while barb used the no-tillage method. Hint: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.

It was triggered by a massive earthquake that killed thousands of others in Nepal. Marisa Eve Girawong, the base camp doctor, was confirmed to have died as a result of the earthquake-triggered avalanche on Mount Everest Saturday, according to Madison Mountaineering. Marisa Eve Girawong (Photo: Madison Mountaineering) Story Highlights Marisa Eve Girawong was killed in an earthquake-triggered avalanche at a Mount Everest base camp Before leaving to work in Nepal in 2014, the township was listed as her place of residence. She was an avid rock climber and mountaineer who was pursuing an advanced degree in mountain medicine. Girawong was a 2009 graduate of Rutgers University-Newark College of Arts and Sciences. The 7.8 earthquake that struck Nepal Saturday took the life of a local woman. Marisa Eve Girawong, a physician assistant, was killed in an earthquake-triggered avalanche at a Mount Everest base camp, according to Madison Mountaineering, a Seattle-based mountaineering company. Before leaving to work in Nepal in 2014, the township was listed as her place of residence. Hundreds of people were climbing Mount Everest at the start of the region's climbing season. There are a reported 17 people dead, including Google executive Dan Fredinburg, and another 61 people injured as the search continues on the world's largest mountain. Saturday's earthquake struck at around noon, just over a year after the deadliest avalanche on record hit Everest, killing 16 Sherpa guides on April 18, 2014. The avalanche was said to began on Mount Kumori, a 22,966-foot-high mountain just a few miles from Everest. It gathered strength as it headed toward the base camp of Everest. About an hour before the avalanche struck, Girawong posted for the last time on Facebook. \\"Day 28 on this arduous journey, snow is falling & my food cravings are at an all time high ... Is a crunchy spicy tuna roll with eel sauce too much to ask for?,\\" she wrote. Many responded to the 28-year-old's post, hoping for her safety and not knowing that the avalanche had taken their friend. Madison Mountaineering's website described Girawong as an emergency room physician assistant who was serving as the team's camp base camp doctor for Everest/Lhoste. Since 2013, she has been involved in expedition medicine training in Scotland as well as participating in wilderness medicine in the Everest region since 2014. She was an avid rock climber and mountaineer who was pursuing an advanced degree in mountain medicine. Previously, she successfully reached the summits of Mt. Wasington and Mt. Rainier, the company's biography said. On April 12, Girawong posted to her Facebook page a photo of herself and Garrett Madison, and wrote \\"Officially the highest I've been so far at 5,550meters/18,300ft. Never made it last year but finally got to the top of Kala Patthar this year with Garrett Madison.\\" According to his profile on Madison Mountaineering, \\"Madison began guiding professionally in 1999 on Mount Rainier, and is now America's premier Everest climber and guide.\\" He, along with the rest of the Madison Mountaineering team, is said to have made it back to either the Everest Camp 2 or Gorek Shep, said an update on the company's website. Madison Mountaineering posted the news on their website's blog with a post headlined \\"Our hearts are broken.\\" \\"It is with deep sorrow and profound grief that we can confirm the loss of our Everest/Lhotse base camp doctor, Marisa Eve Girawong. Eve perished in the aftermath of the avalanche that struck the base camp area following the devastating Nepal earthquake earlier today,\\" said Madison co-founder Kurt Hunter on the website's post. \\"Our thoughts and prayers are with Eve and her family and friends.\\" The company did not release additional information Sunday morning. Girawong was a 2009 graduate of Rutgers University-Newark College of Arts and Sciences where she majored in biology. According to her LinkedIn profile, she was actively involved in the Chinese Student Organization, coordinating the group's China Nite in 2007 and 2008. Before joining Madison Mountaineering in April 2014, Girawong worked at East Orange General Hospital as an emergency room physician assistant. \\"East Orange General Hospital extends our deepest sympathy and prayers to the people of Nepal and the family of Marisa Eve Girawong who previously worked as a physician assistant in our emergency room,\\" said Suzette Robinson, vice president of external affairs at East Orange General Hospital. \\"We are saddened by the loss of Marisa and the nearly 2,000 people who died as a result of this earthquake that left behind mass devastation and staggering levels of damage.\\" According to Girawong's LinkedIn profile, she worked as a physician assistant and graduated with honors for Master of Medical Sciences and Physician Assistant studies at the Saint Francis University in 2012. She also was working on her second Master's degree and postgraduate diploma in mountain medicine at the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom.

Listen in to expedition leader Garrett Madison‘s audio expedition dispatch: Hello! This is Garrett calling in for the Mount Vinson expedition with Jim Lumberg and Garrett Madison (in conjunction with PolarExplorers). Today is January 19th and we have arrived back Union Glacier Camp. We had a great summit yesterday on Mount Vinson, the highest peak in Antarctica. Today we woke up at High Camp, packed up our camp, descended down to Low Camp, and then all the way to Vinson Base Camp. We were very fortunate to be met by a Twin Otter aircraft which then shuttled us 45-minutes back to Union Glacier Camp, the main hub here in Antarctica. The plan is that tomorrow we hope to fly out on the llyshun jet back to Punta Arenas, Chile. Then, in the next few days, be homeward bound. We were very lucky to get out today from Mount Vinson to Union Glacier. We are both doing well, just had a great dinner, and looking forward to some much needed rest. Thanks for following along. We will check in soon. ||||| Rescuers took advantage of clear weather to bring down about 180 climbers trapped for two days on Mount Everest as skies cleared over the world’s tallest peak. Helicopters on Monday moved in to rescue the trekkers, who were about halfway up the mountain when avalanches triggered by a devastating earthquake in Nepal on April 25 destroyed routes back to base camp and left them stranded. Climbers at higher elevations moved down to Camp 1, which has an altitude of about 20,000 feet. From there, helicopters airlifted two people at a time from the mountainside down to base camp in an operation run by the Indian Army, according to Sangeeta Bahl, the wife of one of those stuck at Camp 1. “The base camp has been completely devastated,” Bahl said by phone from New Delhi, relaying details told to her by Ankur Bahl, her husband. “Now they need to get away from there because it’s an avalanche area.” The disaster is the deadliest ever on Everest, with at least 19 people killed, including a Google Inc. executive. Many of the victims were at base camp, which was heavily damaged by boulders, snow and blocks of ice. About 180 climbers stuck about halfway up the mountain needed to be airlifted down to safety, Ang Tshering Sherpa, president at Nepal Mountaineering Association, said by phone on Monday. All those rescued were in good health, he said. Khumbu Icefall Twenty-six U.S. Army Green Berets in Nepal on a previously scheduled training mission with the nation’s military are now assisting in the search for survivors and victims along Everest trails, Colonel Steve Warren, a Defense Department spokesman, told reporters at the Pentagon on Monday. Ankur Bahl, a New Delhi shipping industry specialist, was ascending Everest as part of a quest with his wife to climb the world’s tallest peaks on all seven continents. He told Sangeeta via satellite phone on Saturday that his group of 12 climbers felt the tremors while climbing to Camp 2 from Camp 1 before hanging up because the phone was low on battery. The group was running low on food and fuel. “It’s been the most devastating 48 hours of my life,” Sangeeta said. “I’m a mountaineer myself and know what the conditions can be like up there. We both cried.” The route through the Khumbu Icefall that stands between Camp 1 and base camp became impassable after the avalanches. More than 3,700 people have died altogether in the most powerful earthquake to hit Nepal since 1934. ||||| A group of people estimated in the hundreds remains stranded on the slopes of Mount Everest following the earthquake that struck Nepal on Saturday. Their way back down from higher camps to base camp has been blocked by damage to the route. The mountaineers are huddled together and dug in amid aftershocks posing further risk, and have limited supplies, according to firsthand reports. But what about sending helicopters for them? At least six helicopters landed Sunday morning at Everest base camp—about 18,000 feet above sea level—where they evacuated some of the injured. Choppers reportedly also flew ropes and other equipment to climbers stranded above the Khumbu icefall, which also sits nearly 18,000 feet above sea level. And helicopters have actually made it even to the peak of Everest before, the first time in 2005. Didier Delsalle, who piloted that helicopter, said landing was the hardest part: “I didn’t know if I was touching down on snow above rock or snow above nothing.” Here’s a video of his record trip to the summit—which is at 29,035 feet above sea level. Flying at such altitude is tricky because helicopters don’t operate as safely as fixed-wing airplanes in the lower-density air found higher up in the atmosphere. Pilots who fly helicopters at mountain elevations have to learn to constantly calculate the difference between how much power they need for maneuvers such as taking off, hovering, and landing, and how much power they actually have, with air pressure and temperature critical factors. The damage wreaked by the earthquake and avalanches this weekend, along with poor weather, has complicated the current rescue mission further. “If the weather is decent and you have someone’s GPS coordinates, you generally can fly in and rescue them without a problem,” says Dan Richards, chief executive of Global Rescue, a Boston-based travel risk and crisis-management firm that is engaged in rescue operations underway in Nepal. “That’s under good circumstances—but the last 36 hours have been anything but good.” “The last thing you want to do is to land a chopper in a place where there’s a possibility there can be an avalanche or a landslide,” Richards tells Quartz. Rescuers had halted their efforts on Sunday following an aftershock that registered 6.7 on the Richter scale and triggered additional landslides and avalanches. According to Richards, the earthquake destroyed the facilities of at least one major service that provides pilots and aircraft for rescue operations. The sheer number of people to be rescued and the missions needed to reach them where they happen to be also is straining the infrastructure of Nepal, a country that ranks among the poorest in the world. Climbers remain stranded at camp 1, which sits roughly 19,600 feet above sea level, and at camp 2, located at 21,500 feet. Though camp 2 is within the altitude range where helicopters can fly safely, both the weather and the extent of devastation throughout the country are slowing efforts to reach them. “I believe everyone who is fairly well supplied and uninjured at this point is going to be rescued,” says Richards. “There’s some period of time where evacuees have to shelter in place and that’s what’s happening right now on Everest and in other parts of the country.” ||||| Friends and family on Sunday mourned the Santa Monica-based filmmaker who was among the thousands killed in the massive earthquake that struck Nepal. Tom Taplin, 61, was filming a documentary about the base camp at Mt. Everest when the temblor triggered an avalanche, his wife, Cory Freyer, told NBC News. At least 17 people died in the avalanche, including a Google executive and a doctor from New Jersey. “It’s shocking,” said Freyer, who lives in Santa Monica. “All of his friends, and he has so many friends, every one of them is just devastated. Shocked.” The couple married about three years ago but had been together for more than 24 years, said Freyer, who described her husband as a “larger-than-life person.” “He was a brave guy who supported great conservation efforts,” his cousin, Jonathan Taplin, a professor at USC, said in a Facebook post. Nepal and its people are reeling in the wake of a massive earthquake and a series of aftershocks. A photographer who had operated his own production company for several decades, Taplin had been filming on Mt. Everest for nearly a month, Freyer told ABC News. The Denver native was also a passionate mountaineer, and in the early 1990s, he authored a book about scaling Aconcagua in Argentina, the highest mountain outside of Asia. \\"It sounds trite, but he died doing what he loved doing” Freyer told NBC.

Madison's story was one of several coming off the world's highest peak after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake Saturday unleashed an avalanche that caught climbers just as the climbing season was nearing an end. Play Ashleigh Stumler had just left a Nepali village near Mt. Everest when she said the ground started shaking so violently she thought she was having a dizzy spell and grabbed onto a tree, and then she heard the thunderous sound of a landslide. Stumler, from Charlotte, North Carolina, said she and a woman from Washington, who were on a planned two-week trek, were not far from the village of Pheriche -- a lodge for climbers on their way to Mt. Everest Base Camp -- when the shaking started. \\"At first I was confused on what was happening but holding onto a tree while the earth around us was violently shaking,\\" Stumler told ABC News via email. \\"We heard a nearby landslide and started worrying about friends that we had met along the way.\\" The magnitude-7.8 quake toppled temples and triggered an avalanche on Mt. Everest. A magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit about an hour after the initial earthquake and smaller aftershocks followed in the region for hours. Stumler was not injured and said she hopes to get to Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, to help provide support. \\"The situation is feeling increasingly more serious than the moment I was clinging to a tree yesterday,\\" she wrote. \\"Today's tremor seemed to put my body into some kind of survival mode while desperately trying to reach Lukla [a town with an airport less than 20 miles from Everest] in hopes of getting out.\\" Another survivor, Bhim Bahadur Khatri, told the Associated Press he was in a tent at Mt. Everest when the quake struck. \\"We all rushed out to the open and the next moment a huge wall of snow just piled on me,\\" he said. \\"I managed to dig out of what could easily have been my grave. I wiggled and used my hands as claws to dig as much as I could. I was suffocating, I could not breathe. But I knew I had to survive.\\" He was flown to Kathmandu and taken to a hospital, the AP reported. The quake hit about 50 miles northwest of Kathmandu just before noon local time Saturday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. At least 2,100 people have been killed in Nepal, the country's Interior Ministry told ABC News on Sunday. More than 1,000 others were injured, said the country's finance minister, Ram Sharan Mahat.

This sense of belonging often results in higher levels of cooperation among its residents, leading to a more vibrant and prosperous society. Step 1: Understand the context The given text states that a smaller state is better than a larger country because of the close-knit community and strong cultural identity within the state. Step 2: Expand upon the idea of a close-knit community One of the main factors that contribute to the success of a smaller state is the close-knit community. People living in such areas often know each other on a personal level, forming friendly and supportive relationships with their neighbors. This environment not only fosters a sense of belonging but also encourages people to look out for one another's well-being. Step 3: Discuss the benefits of a strong cultural identity A strong cultural identity forms the foundation for a prosperous society. In smaller states, it is easier for people to maintain and promote their local customs, traditions, and values, as there is usually a greater sense of pride and attachment towards their unique heritage. This collective identity leads to a shared vision for the state's growth and development, sparking innovation and creativity across various fields. Step 4: Highlight the advantages of cooperation among residents Higher levels of cooperation among residents in smaller states can lead to several benefits. For instance, it becomes easier to organize community events, pool resources for local projects, and address common issues or concerns effectively. Moreover, such cooperation can also result in better governance, as local authorities have a deeper understanding of the community's needs and aspirations. Step 5: Concluding thoughts In conclusion, although smaller states may not have the vast resources or land area of larger countries, they offer a sense of community, cultural identity, and cooperative spirit that fosters a prosperous and vibrant society. By focusing on these strengths, smaller states can serve as role models for larger nations, reminding them of the importance of preserving their unique cultural heritage and working together for the common good."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: In my early 20s, I was a one-on-one aide for a couple of teenagers with cerebral palsy. With the first one, I was hired by and worked for the family. I picked the teen up from school every day and took care of him until he was in bed for the night. When he passed away, I took a job with the local school district. My client at the school had spastic quadriplegia. He could talk and was actually very smart, but he had no control over his arms or legs. He couldn’t walk. He was never going to walk. The law requires that special education students be put in the least restrictive classroom environment possible. Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn’t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes. His only accommodation was a one-on-one aide (me), and he was allowed to be late to classes without consequence because we sometimes had to stop in a special room, get him out of his chair, and stretch his legs a little. Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day. Anyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym). And, legally, his aide (me) had to accommodate his participation in every class as much as possible, including gym. Most gym classes began with the students doing laps around the track, then participating in a team sport. He couldn’t do the team sport, but, according to the lawyers involved, he should participate in the “laps around the track” part of gym. So I had to push this kid in a wheelchair around the track for about 15 minutes each day, until the other kids were all done and off doing the next activity. Then he and I were able to leave gym class and go do some physical therapy in his own little room just for that. Because, you know… lawyers and rules. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When did the author work as an aide to someone with spastic quadriplegia?

News article: 'Underworld' awakens the box office with 25.4 million \\"Underworld: Awakening\\" improved upon the opening weekend of its predecessor, 2009?s \\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans.\\" (EW.com) -- 2012 continued its box office winning streak this weekend, as Kate Beckinsale replaced herself at the top of the chart. Her new movie, \\"Underworld Awakening,\\" a 3D fourth installment of the popular vampires vs. werewolves franchise, debuted in first place with 25.4 million, good for a 8,252 per theater average. \\"Awakening\\" improved upon the opening weekend of its predecessor, 2009′s \\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans,\\" which started with 20.8 million (and did not feature Beckinsale), but fell short of 2006′s \\"Underworld: Evolution,\\" which kicked off its run with 26.9 million. Sony/Screen Gems paid 70 million to make the 3D action film, but if past \\"Underworld\\" performances are any indication, \\"Awakening,\\" which earned an \\"A-\\" CinemaScore grade, will have trouble recouping its costs. The first \\"Underworld\\" earned 2.5 times its opening weekend (that's known as a mulitplier of 2.5) and finished with 51.8 million. The second notched a 2.4 multiplier and earned 62.3 million. The third only managed a 2.3 multiplier, a sure sign of sequel fatigue and frontloadedness, and grossed 45.8 million. With Kate Beckinsale back in the picture, \\"Awakening\\" may find a larger total than \\"Lycans,\\" but with a very young audience (only 7 percent were 50 or older), it should continue the frontloaded trend and finish with about 56 million. In second place, George Lucas' passion-project \\"Red Tails,\\" a 58 million film starring Terrence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr. that chronicles WWII's African-American Tuskegee airmen, took off with 19.1 million in its first three days. The strong debut came out of 2,512 theaters, which gave \\"Red Tails\\" a hefty 7,604 per theater average, the second-best in the Top 20. A few weeks ago, these high-flying numbers seemed unlikely. But in the week leading up to release, the film gained momentum. Over the past few days, YouTube views for the trailer swelled, perhaps thanks to Tyler Perry's public endorsement of the film. In a newsletter to his fans dated January 17, Perry urged audiences to see \\"Red Tails.\\" \\"I think we should pull together and get behind this movie,\\" he wrote. \\"Not just African Americans, but all of us.\\" Of course, that's not to undermine Fox's marketing team, which clearly did its job and brought in a broad range of ages. Many films that play primarily to African American audiences (or really, any niche audience) drop quickly in their second week -- Perry's last three \\"Madea\\" films have fallen by an average of 60 percent in their second weekends -- but \\"Red Tails\\" may avoid a similar fate. The film increased by a whopping 40 percent from Friday to Saturday, a healthy sign that the film is playing well with families and shouldn't prove overly frontloaded. Furthermore, audiences enjoyed the film, issuing it an \\"A\\" CinemaScore grade, which will likely help it endure. Who knows where the film will end its flight, but after three days of results, \\"Red Tails\\" seems early in its ascent. Kate Beckinsale's other current release, \\"Contraband,\\" which topped the box office last week, dipped by 50 percent down to 12.1 million, giving the 25 million Mark Wahlberg action vehicle a sturdy 46.1 million ten-day total. It should finish in the 65 million range. \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\\" fared about as expected during its wide release into 2,630 theaters. The 9/11 drama, adapted from Jonathan Safran Foer's novel of the same name, found a lukewarm 10.5 million this weekend, yielding a mild 4,010 per theater average. Audiences generally liked the Warner Bros. picture, giving it an \\"A-\\" CinemaScore grade, but unless \\"Extremely Loud\\" garners a surprising slew of Oscar nominations next week, it's doubtful that the film will climb to impressive numbers. In 2006, another 9/11-themed film, \\"United 93,\\" opened with a similar 11.5 million, and despite good reviews (much better than \\"Extremely Loud's,\\" in fact), it only found 31.5 million overall. A similar result seems likely in this case. Is Sandra Bullock the latest performer to fall prey to the Best Actress Curse? As the legend goes, after an actress wins the coveted Oscar -- Bullock won in 2010 for her role in \\"The Blind Side\\" -- her box office appeal actually decreases. Look at someone like Charlize Theron. Since winning the Oscar in 2004, she has appeared in exactly one hit -- \\"Hancock,\\" a movie which all but ignored her in its ads --and among her other nine releases, the highest-grossing one is, sadly, \\"Aeon Flux\\" with 25.9 million. I'm not going to put too much faith in the curse, but \\"Extremely Loud\\" does mark Bullock's least-attended nationwide debut in 15 years. And for Hanks, the film is his second straight misfire since \\"Larry Crowne,\\" which had to settle for 35.6 million. Difficult subject matter likely kept many audiences at bay. Steven Soderbergh's \\"Haywire\\" started its run in fifth place, pulling in 9 million. The film, which features former MMA fighter Gina Carano, earned a dismal \\"D+\\" CinemaScore grade, despite strong critical reviews overall. (Another well reviewed action film, \\"Drive,\\" earned a similarly unenthusiastic \\"C-\\" grade a few months back.) Relativity shelled out 23 million on the film, but \\"Haywire\\" will have to work hard to earn that number back at the box office. (Also, let's please ignore the inevitable discussion of whether women can open action movies at the box office and look at this week's number one film. Cool?) Further down the chart, \\"The Artist,\\" which expanded from 216 theaters into 662 theaters (that's a 300+ percent uptick in locations) on the heels of its Golden Globe win for Best Picture, increased by a rather disappointing 99 percent. After nine weeks, tons of awards, and a whole lot of press, the black-and-white film has earned 12.1 million against a 15 million budget. Perhaps people just don't want to see a silent movie. \\"The Descendants,\\" meanwhile, is faring much better during awards season. Following George Clooney's Best Actor win at the Globes, the drama increased 17 percent to 2.5 million, despite losing 100 locations, and has grossed 51.3 million. Oh, and a little movie called \\"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 1\\" surpassed the 700 million mark worldwide as well. The vampire franchise has proven remarkably consistent. 1. Underworld Awakening -- 25.4 million 2. Red Tails -- 19.1 million 3. Contraband -- 12.2 million 4. Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close -- 10.5 million 5. Haywire -- 9.0 million 6.

Write a summary based on this article: SAN FRANCISCO -- One firefighter suffered burns to his face and hands while battling a massive blaze at a nine-story condominium tower still under construction Tuesday, fire officials said late in the evening. San Francisco Fire Department Deputy Chief of Operations Mark Gonzales told local news crews that a firefighter on the first ladder truck that arrived at the 5 p.m. blaze \\"got a little burned up there but didn't cop to it until four or five hours later.\\" The firefighter was taken to a hospital and was expected to \\"make a full recovery,\\" Gonzales told KCBS radio. He was one of scores who battled the five-alarm blaze and who were continuing to pour water onto it into the night. PHOTOS: San Francisco fire Despite shooting flames, a dark smoke plume visible for miles and what appears to be the total loss of one building in a 360-unit complex slated for completion later this year, San Francisco breathed a sigh of relief that the conflagration had not caused further damage. “On behalf of the residents of the city and county of San Francisco, I would like to thank Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White and the approximately 150 firefighters from several San Francisco fire stations who responded to what became a five-alarm fire in our Mission Bay neighborhood today,\\" Mayor Ed Lee said in a statement issued late Tuesday. \\"Thanks to the leadership and determined action of our Fire Department, the very real potential of severe damage to other homes, businesses and structures in the neighborhood was avoided,\\" he said. The fire broke out at the condo construction site on 4th Street between China Basin and Mission Rock -- near AT&T; Park -- about 5 p.m. and soon engulfed the structure. The top floors collapsed as crowds gathered at a distance to watch. Sprinklers had not yet been installed in the building, identified in news reports as under development by BRE Properties. Part of the complex survived the blaze, the San Francisco Business Times reported. A cause has not been identified but arson investigators were on the scene and were expected to return Wednesday. \\"We’re told the workers got off around 3:30 p.m. so whatever was burning had about an hour and a half to smolder and get going,\\" Hayes-White told KTVU-TV Channel 2. The Red Cross was assisting residents from a nearby complex that suffered broken windows from the heat and was evacuated. The sprinklers in that building were triggered and are no longer operational, so residents had to find other accommodations Tuesday night. \\"I saw the smoke starting in the corner and all of a sudden, flames engulfed the whole building,\\" Julia Young told KTVU. \\"I knew, time to get out of here.\\" Hayes-White lauded her crew for saving the second building from destruction. \\"This is a great save right here,\\" Hayes-White told reporters. \\"To be able to save this is huge.\\" Mayor Lee encouraged property owners and landlords to use a good Samaritan temporary occupancy residential rent ordinance to help those displaced so that they can more easily find temporary housing, if needed.

The five-alarm fire engulfed the building on Fourth Street near China Basin Street just before 5 p.m., sending black smoke thousands of feet into the sky. Scaffolding melted as chunks of the six-story, 80-foot-tall building fell away. Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White called it the city's largest blaze in several years. Fire officials said the structure was likely to collapse. \\"The open construction of the building allowed for rapid fire spread,\\" said fire Capt. Matthew McNaughton, adding that investigators have not determined what started the blaze. Nearby buildings were evacuated as more than 150 firefighters battled the flames, using about 90 fire trucks and other apparatuses. The roof of UCSF's Mission Bay research building, a block away, briefly caught fire, but it was quickly put out, McNaughton said. One firefighter suffered minor burns, he said, but there were no other injuries. The smoke \\"was like a huge mushroom cloud. It was as high as a plane,\\" said Gary \\"Slim\\" Forte, 38, who was among a large crowd of locals watching the fire. \\"It looked like somebody blew a nuclear weapon.\\" Several dozen residents were evacuated from the Strata apartment building across Fourth Street from the construction site, and about 25 were gathered late Tuesday at an American Red Cross evacuation center at Pier 54. Firefighters still had not contained the blaze by 10:15 p.m. McNaughton said he expected crews to remain on scene until the morning. \\"We have a center core that looks like a volcano,\\" he said. Construction began last year on the building, part of a 360-unit apartment complex being developed by BRE Properties on the west side of Fourth Street. It was set to be completed late this year. BRE Properties officials issued a statement late Tuesday saying they believe the company's insurance should cover the cost of damages. The project stands in the midst of at least four other residential construction projects on or near Fourth Street south of Mission Creek. Together, they contain nearly 900 units. Time to smolder Hayes-White said most of the construction workers ended their day at the building around 4 p.m., but McNaughton said a few were still on the site when firefighters arrived. Fire investigators believe that whatever sparked the blaze had as long as an hour to smolder. The building's sprinkler system had not yet been installed, Hayes-White said, and, as a result, the fire \\"really took off. It went up really quickly.\\" As sections of the building collapsed, firefighters aimed water cannons at adjacent buildings to keep the blaze from spreading to the rest of the neighborhood. \\"This is a great save right here,\\" Hayes-White said, pointing to a building across the street. \\"We were able to put up a water curtain. To be able to save this is huge.\\" Residents and workers in the area described the fire as a quick-moving, monstrous blaze. Carlos Tovar of Manteca was operating a crane 228 feet in the air on another construction project as the apartment building burst into flames. \\"I thought it was just a ladder on fire at first, but then as it really got involved, the heat climbed so quickly I could feel it on my cab,\\" Tovar said. \\"It moved fast, real fast.\\" Watching fire spread Tovar shot video with his smartphone as the flames built from just a flicker in the southeast corner of the structure, climbed to the roof and spread west. He said it soon began gobbling up the top part of the building. As night fell, the smoke became white and the flames lessened, but Hayes-White said the structure was probably a total loss. The building is \\"likely to come down,\\" Hayes-White said. \\"It will collapse. The more it burns, the more water we put on it, the more likely it is to fail.\\" Local residents said the heat blew out windows and radiant heat burned the front of the Strata building. Residents were evacuated from the 192-unit building. Fire Battalion Chief Richard McGee said evacuated Strata residents weren't allowed to return home Tuesday night because the heat from the fire set off Strata's sprinkler system. The system would have to be restored in order to be reactivated, he said. Scott McGrath, 35, rushed back in a taxi from his job in the Financial District to the Strata. He said he was there to save his dog, but firefighters had already cleared the building of pets and people. \\"I'm very appreciative,\\" McGrath said. \\"They were going around and trying to get as many dogs as they could.\\" All around the building where the fire crews attacked, there were rivers of water strewn with debris and broken glass. Some shards were 20 feet from the building. Crews manning three hoses kept up a stream of water on the southeast corner and the south face of the building even as the top floors collapsed. One firefighter manning the crank on his hose wiped his forehead and said, \\"This is big, all right. Real big. Lots of water. That's what does the trick.\\" Clogged streets Davi Lang, 27, lives in a houseboat a block away and saw the flames as they began their first leap into the air. She ran over and watched as the building was consumed. \\"It was huge,\\" she said. \\"I was worried the water they were spraying on it wouldn't even work, it was that huge. The scaffolding was melting, right as I watched. All of a sudden, the top floors just came crumbling down.\\" Lang said the fire engines that rushed to the area first couldn't get through the construction site because the sites are so tightly packed. \\"And a lot of the streets aren't even finished yet,\\" she said. Hundreds of people lined up along China Basin to watch firefighters battle the flames a few blocks to the south. Along Berry Street on the north edge of the fire zone, onlookers kept trying to sneak through the fencing to get a better look at the fire. Security guards shooed them out.

Step 1: Identify the topic - best hall of residence at IIT Kharagpur Step 2: Consider the factors - facilities, amenities, location, community, and personal preferences Step 3: Analyze the topic - The best hall of residence at IIT Kharagpur may vary depending on individual needs and preferences. Some may prioritize facilities and amenities, while others focus on community and location. Now, comparing the answers to both questions: Answer 1: The necessity of wearing a bra depends on personal choice and circumstances. Answer 2: The best hall of residence at IIT Kharagpur depends on individual needs and preferences. No, the answers to these two questions are not the same.

Short general knowledge question: what george washington carver famous for?","completion":"George Washington Carver was an American agricultural scientist and inventor who is best known for his research into and promotion of alternative crops to cotton, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes. He was born into slavery around the time of the American Civil War, struggled to gain an education and went on to become one of the most prominent scientists of his time. Carver developed several hundred industrial uses for crops such as peanuts, sweet potatoes, and soybeans, and he promoted the idea of crop rotation – growing different crops in a field each year – to enrich the soil and produce a better yield, instead of depleting the soil by continuously growing cotton. His work played a significant role in improving the agricultural economy in the South of the United States. He advocated for poor farmers to grow alternative crops both as a source of their own food and as a source of other products to improve their quality of life. Among the many products that Carver developed from peanuts for example, one could list dyes, plastics, fuel for cars, and peanut butter. It's a common misconception that he invented peanut butter - he did not - but he certainly helped popularize it. Carver served for more than 40 years at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) in Alabama, and spent time sharing his knowledge, skills, and faith via agricultural extension work and later through nationwide speaking tours. Though he passed away in 1943, his legacy continues to impact and inspire to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Review: I had high hopes for this product, especially given the premium price. It arrived very quickly from the seller and with excellent packaging. However, usage has been very disappointing ... it just doesn't hold the heat very long, and certainly not for a 20 minute therapeutic session.I rarely write reviews, but felt strongly enough about this product that I wanted to warn others hoping to find relief from chronic neck pain. Answer: A:","completion":"Based on the analysis of the product review titled \\"Doesn't hold the heat!\\" provided, the tone of the review can be characterized as predominantly negative. Although there are some positive aspects mentioned, such as the quick delivery and excellent packaging, the overall tone is dominated by dissatisfaction with the product's performance. To give a detailed account of the factors contributing to the negative tone, let us examine the review. 1. High expectations, unmet: The reviewer starts by stating that they had high hopes, which implies that the product initially seemed promising. However, the fact that it didn't meet expectations generates a sense of frustration among the users, which negatively affects their assessment of the product. 2. Premium price, disappointing results: The product's high price would automatically create heightened expectations regarding its quality and effectiveness. Given that the product doesn't perform as expected, the reviewer perceives it as a bad investment, further worsening their opinion. 3. Key function not fulfilled: It appears that the product's primary purpose is to retain heat for therapeutic use. However, it doesn't maintain the heat for the required time (20 minutes), which renders it less effective or even unusable for its intended usage. This specific shortcoming not only reveals a subpar performance directly but is also likely to be a major sticking point for customers looking for pain relief. 4. Concern and warning for others: The reviewer rarely writes reviews but felt strongly enough about the product's deficiencies to voice their opinion, signaling that their experience was quite negative. They want to make an effort to warn others about the product's unsatisfactory performance, further emphasizing their dissatisfaction. In conclusion, the review exhibits a negative tone with a few positive elements, such as delivery speed and packaging quality. However, the product's inability to meet expectations and perform as advertised, combined with its premium price and crucial functionality issues, overwhelmingly influences the overall negative tone of the review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \\"Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do.\\" Then she recalled hearing him say, \\"Yes sir.\\" She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room. We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15. Among the sources that reflect other important events of that morning, there is no documentary evidence for this call, but the relevant sources are incomplete. Others nearby who were taking notes, such as the Vice President's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, who sat next to him, and Mrs. Cheney, did not note a call between the President and Vice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room. At 10:02, the communicators in the shelter began receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft-presumably hijacked-heading toward Washington. That aircraft was United 93. The Secret Service was getting this information directly from the FAA. The FAA may have been tracking the progress of United 93 on a display that showed its projected path to Washington, not its actual radar return. Thus, the Secret Service was relying on projections and was not aware the plane was already down in Pennsylvania.

Or do you see many other things, such as singing birds, colorful plants and wild flowers? The forest is a whole of its own. It is full of many different living things. But even though they are all different, they have one thing in common: they all need each other in order to live on. The trees feed the forest \\"people\\" by making food in their leaves; by using sunlight to join water and minerals from the soil and air. Their deep network of roots joins the soil together and stops it from dying out, making it possible for living things to live in it. Human beings are like the living things in the forest. We need one another in order to live. We need the farmers to grow our food, railroad and truck drivers to bring it to our shops and clerks to sell it to us. We need people to prepare our food and cook it and others to take our waste things away. Then, of course, we need doctors, nurses, government leaders, mailmen, telephone operators, and many others. We also need other human beings in another way. We need people for friendship, to talk over our problems, exchange ideas. Think how lonely and unhappy you would be if you lived all alone. Life is a matter of giving and taking. We need to help other people as much as we need other people to help us. Think what a good feeling you have when you have done something for someone else.

Colorful plants and wild flowers can also be considered as living things in the forest, and just like the other inhabitants, they too rely on various factors for their sustenance.

Option B: water and minerals – The text states that trees use sunlight to join water and minerals from the soil, to support the growth of various plants and living organisms. Option C: the soil and air – Trees, plants, and flowers all need soil and air to access essential nutrients necessary for their growth and development.

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

The number of eggs to be scrambled depends on the number of people being served, with a general recommendation of two eggs per person. In the first method, scrambled eggs are prepared in a hot pan, and a bagel is sliced and toasted. Smoked salmon slices are then draped over the bagel halves, followed by the addition of the scrambled eggs. An alternative to this method is to add bite-sized smoked salmon pieces directly into the scrambled egg mixture before cooking. The second method involves toasting half an English muffin and layering smoked salmon slices on top. A poached egg is then placed on each half, and a spoonful of hollandaise sauce is poured over the top. Seasoning with salt and pepper is suggested to enhance the taste. The third method suggests mashing half an avocado in a small bowl, leaving a few chunks for texture. Two slices of sourdough bread are brushed with olive oil and placed on a cooking sheet to be toasted in a 350° F (177° C) oven for 5 minutes. The avocado is then divided and spread on the toasted bread slices, followed by smoked salmon and a dollop of sour cream as the final touch.

Write an article based on this summary: Prison officers at 31 jails in London and south-east England are in line for pay rises of up to £5,000, under a £12m package announced by the government.","completion":"Title: Government Announces £12m Package for Prison Officer Pay Raises in London and South-East England Jails Introduction The government has recently announced a £12m package aimed at increasing the salaries of prison officers in 31 jails across London and south-east England. This development highlights the government's recognition of the importance of prison staff in maintaining public safety and addressing issues within the UK's correctional facilities. The Pay Raise Package Under the newly announced funding package, prison officers at the selected 31 jails in London and south-east England could receive pay raises of up to £5,000. This financial boost aims to attract more skilled and dedicated workers to the profession, improving both the efficiency, safety, and overall management of the facilities. Step One: Allocation of the £12m Package The government will determine the distribution of the £12m package among the selected jails. Key factors such as the jail's size, population, and specific needs will play a role in making an informed decision. The funding aims to ensure the establishments are staffed with proficient and trained professionals. Step Two: Determining Pay Raises Following the allocation of the £12m package, the specific pay raises for each prison officer will be determined. Factors such as experience, job responsibility, and performance will be taken into account when deciding the size of an individual's pay raise. Step Three: Implementing the Pay Raises Upon determining the pay raises for each prison officer, the new salary rates will come into effect. This could likely have a positive impact on staff morale, as well as contributing to their overall job satisfaction. Subsequently, this increase in motivation may result in a more dedicated workforce, capable of better handling critical situations and managing the inmate population. Step Four: Monitoring Outcomes To measure the success of the pay raise initiative, the government will need to monitor the outcomes within the targeted jails. Key performance indicators such as reduced staff turnover, improved safety metrics, and enhanced inmate management should be assessed. Regular evaluations will help to ensure the package has achieved its intended goal of improving the quality of correctional facilities and staff performance. Conclusion The £12m funding package for prison officer pay raises in 31 jails across London and south-east England highlights the government's commitment to public safety and its recognition of the critical role played by prison staff. By allocating the funds and implementing sizable pay raises for deserving officers, the government aims to boost staff morale, job satisfaction, and overall performance. Ultimately, it is hoped that these pay raises will lead to safer, better-managed correctional facilities, benefiting both the staff and the inmate population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

His father is a Georgia State Trooper and serves as Athletic Director of Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, a private academy with one of the best high school basketball programs in the country, while his mother played on the inaugural women's basketball team at Morris Brown College. Howard's mother had seven miscarriages before he was born. A devout Christian since his youth, Howard became serious about basketball around the age of nine; when in the eighth grade, he resolved to be selected as the number one pick in the NBA Draft one day. Before he was drafted in 2004, Howard said that he wanted to use his NBA career and Christian faith to \\"raise the name of God within the league and throughout the world\\". He has stated he believes in reaching out to his community and fans and thus contributes substantially in the field of philanthropy. An avid listener of Gospel music, he attends the Fellowship of Faith Church when he is back home in Atlanta and is involved and active with the youth programs at the church. Together with his parents, Howard also established the Dwight D. Howard Foundation Inc. in 2004. The Foundation provides scholarships for students who want to attend his alma mater, Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, and grants to Lovell Elementary School and Memorial Middle School in Orlando, Florida. The Foundation also organizes summer basketball camps for boys and girls, and together with high school and college coaches and players, fellow NBA players are invited to be on hand at the camp. For his contributions in the Central Florida community, Howard received in 2005 the Rich and Helen De Vos Community Enrichment Award. Within the NBA itself, Howard has participated in several NBA \\"Read to Achieve\\" assemblies encouraging children to make reading a priority. In November 2009, the center was named one of the 10 finalists for the Jefferson Awards for Public Service, which awards athletes for their charitable work. In 2009, Howard, along with several other NBA players, joined the Hoops for St. Jude charity program benefitting the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Elsewhere, Howard appeared as a special guest on an episode of the ABC series Extreme Makeover: Home Edition that aired April 2, 2006, in which Ty Pennington and his team built a new home and ministry offices for Sadie Holmes, who operates a social services ministry in the Orlando area. He made another appearance on the show in the October 9, 2011 episode. Along with Sam Worthington and Jonah Hill, Howard appeared in a commercial for the video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Howard, along with Carmelo Anthony and Scottie Pippen, also appeared in the 2013 Chinese film Amazing, a joint venture between the NBA and Shanghai Film Group Corporation.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: Szigeti was an avid champion of new music, and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside the classics. Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty. The reason for Szigeti's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music. Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would... Guess a valid title for it!

The head of European football has told players not to walk off the pitch if they are racially abused, saying any decision to stop a match should be left to the referee. UEFA president Michel Platini's comments come just one week after AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli, who was subjected to \\"monkey chants\\" in a recent match against Roma, told CNN he would leave the pitch if he was abused in future. Balotelli's teammate Kevin-Prince Boateng walked off the field during an exhibition match against a fourth division team in January and while Platini support's Boateng's decision, it is a situation he is keen not to see repeated. \\"It's not a matter for the player to regulate the game and to stop the game; it's a matter for the referee,\\" Platini, who has been president of European football's governing body since 2007, told CNN in an exclusive interview. \\"It's not normal that people in 2013 are being insulted about their color, about the difference of color. It's not normal. It's very tough for the player on the field.\\" But Platini fears that if a team is \\"not happy\\" and is losing a match its players could decide to leave the field for reasons that might having nothing to do with racist abuse. On Thursday, UEFA announced a raft of new racism regulations -- part closures of stadiums, match abandonments and full stadium closures in the event of discriminatory chanting. Clubs would be handed a fine of 65,000, a figure which has drawn criticism as being too meager for football teams which are multi-million dollar businesses. But Platini defended the severity of that financial sanction. \\"It's not a question of money,\\" explained the Frenchman, who said clubs are often left in a difficult position when trying to deal with fans who attend games armed with political agendas. In the past Platini has also faced criticism for his stance on goal-line technology (GLT), with the Frenchman often portrayed as a \\"luddite\\" for opposing the use of a system which FIFA has embraced. GLT debuted at last year's Club World Cup and is set for another run out in June's FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil. But the 57-year-old Platini defended his position, insisting money should be spent on developing the game at grassroots level rather than GLT. \\"It will cost me 67 million to have GLT,\\" continued Platini, who was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1984. \\"I have to put it in all the games in the Champions League and all the games in the Europa League. I have to put it in Kazakhstan, in Manchester and in Turkey. \\"It costs me 67 million, for one goal, two goals a year? I prefer to invest that for the use football in the grassroots.\\" Championed as a possible successor to FIFA president Sepp Blatter at the next election in 2015, Platini would not be drawn on whether he has ambitions to succeed the 77-year-old Swiss. \\"He will be 79,\\" said Platini. referring to how old Blatter will be at FIFA's next presidential elections. \\"If he thinks it's time to stop, it's up to him.\\" If Platini does succeed Blatter as head of football's global governing body, one item on his agenda will be the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, particularly with regard to what time of the year that tournament should be staged. Fears have been raised over playing the tournament in its usual June-July slot, which would see players compete in high temperatures. Platini has long been an advocate of playing the tournament in the European winter, a proposal which has been met with staunch opposition as it would disrupt the traditional season for Europe's major leagues. \\"If I am president of FIFA or not president of FIFA,\\" declared Platini, \\"I will always support we have to play in winter.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article are: 1.

A custom known as the kula exchange or kula ring where great risks are taken to exchange gifts is prevalent in what part of the world?","completion":"The Kula exchange, also known as the Kula ring, is a unique and intricate system of ceremonial gift-giving and exchanging found in a particular part of the world, known as the Milne Bay Province in Papua New Guinea. This region encompasses a collection of islands referred to as the Massim archipelago, which is situated in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, northeast of Australia. The Kula exchange is primarily practiced among the Trobriand, Dobu, Amphlett, and Rossel Islands, as well as several other smaller islands in the area. The Kula exchange has been an essential component of the traditional culture, social life, and economy of these islands for centuries. This customary practice involves the exchange of two types of shell valuables: red shell-disc necklaces called \\"soulava\\" and white shell armbands known as \\"mwali.\\" Participants in the Kula ring often embark on long, perilous sea voyages in wooden canoes across open waters to reach neighboring islands and exchange their Kula valuables. The Kula exchange is primarily about building and maintaining social relationships, forging alliances, and asserting status within the communities of the region. The participants, mainly consisting of male leaders or influential individuals in their communities, are constantly involved in a cycle of giving and receiving gifts. Kula valuables are given with the understanding that the recipient will, at a later time, reciprocate with a gift of comparable value and prestige. This ongoing and reciprocal exchange is essential to maintaining a good reputation and social standing within the Kula ring. Although the Kula exchange may appear as a system of trading valuable items, its primary function transcends simple trade and commerce. The social interactions and symbolic meanings attached to the Kula valuables are far more significant than their economic value. The transactions involved in the Kula practice create an intricate web of social connections, engendering trust and reciprocity among the participants. Bronislaw Malinowski, a renowned anthropologist, is often credited with the discovery and in-depth documentation of the Kula exchange in the early 20th century. Through his studies, Malinowski highlighted the importance of the Kula exchange as a system of social exchange, diplomacy, and relationship-building rather than merely an economic trade. In doing so, his work has had a significant impact on the anthropological understanding of non-market societies and the role of gift-giving in establishing and maintaining social bonds. In conclusion, the Kula exchange or Kula ring is a fascinating custom that has been practiced for centuries in the Milne Bay Province in Papua New Guinea, particularly among the Massim archipelago islands. This unique system of ceremonial and reciprocal gift-giving serves to reinforce social relationships, forge alliances, and maintain the status of participants, making it an essential component of the traditional culture and social life of these island communities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - A cephalopod (pronounced or ) is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , \\"kephalópoda\\"; \\"head-feet\\"). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishermen sometimes call them inkfish, referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology. - A craft is a pastime or a profession that requires particular skills and knowledge of skilled work. In a historical sense, particularly as pertinent to the Middle Ages and earlier, the term is usually applied to people occupied in small-scale production of goods, or their maintenance, for example by tinkers. The traditional terms \\"craftsman\\" and \\"craftswoman\\" are nowadays often replaced by \\"artisan\\" and rarely by \\"craftsperson\\" (craftspeople). - A plantation is a large piece of land (or water) where one crop is specifically planted for widespread commercial sale and usually tended by resident laborers. The crops grown include fast-growing trees (often conifers), cotton, coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar cane, sisal, oil seeds (e.g. oil palms), rubber trees, and various fruits. Protectionist policies and natural comparative advantage have sometimes contributed to determining where plantations were located. - Commercial fishing is the activity of catching fish and other seafood for commercial profit, mostly from wild fisheries. It provides a large quantity of food to many countries around the earth, but those who practice it as an industry must often pursue fish far into the ocean under adverse conditions. Large-scale commercial fishing is also known as industrial fishing. This profession has gained in popularity with the development of shows such as \\"Deadliest Catch\\", \\"Swords\\", and \\"Wicked Tuna\\". The major fishing industries are not only owned by major corporations but by small families as well. The industry has had to adapt through the years in order to keep earning a profit. A study taken on some small family-owned commercial fishing companies showed that they adapted to continue to earn a living but not necessarily make a large profit. It is the adaptability of the fishermen and their methods that cause some concern for fishery managers and researchers; they say that for those reasons, the sustainability of the marine ecosystems could be in danger of being ruined. - Peru , officially the Republic of Peru, is a country in western South America. It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia, in the east by Brazil, in the southeast by Bolivia, in the south by Chile, and in the west by the Pacific Ocean. Peru is an extremely biodiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river. - Corral Bay is a bay in the mouth of the Valdivia River, southern Chile. Its main towns are Corral and Niebla. The mouth of the bay is between Juan Latorre point and Morro Gonzalo, with a width of 5.5 km. All the year the bay is transited by merchant, transport and fish boats. The bay is famous for being one of the most fortified bays in Spanish America in colonial time (see: Valdivian Fort System). - Mariculture is a specialized branch of aquaculture involving the cultivation of marine organisms for food and other products in the open ocean, an enclosed section of the ocean, or in tanks, ponds or raceways which are filled with seawater. An example of the latter is the farming of marine fish, including finfish and shellfish like prawns, or oysters and seaweed in saltwater ponds. Non-food products produced by mariculture include: fish meal, nutrient agar, jewellery (e.g. cultured pearls), and cosmetics. - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. - Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \\"moai\\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Angling is a method of fishing by means of an \\"angle\\" (fish hook). The hook is usually attached to a fishing line and the line is often attached to a fishing rod. Fishing rods are usually fitted with a fishing reel that functions as a mechanism for storing, retrieving and paying out the line. The hook itself can be dressed with lures or bait. A bite indicator such as a float, and a weight or sinker are sometimes used. - Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts. - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on. - Centro de Estudios Científicos (English: \\"Center for Scientific Studies\\") also known by its acronym CECS is a private, non-profit corporation based in Valdivia, Chile, devoted to the development, promotion and diffusion of scientific research. CECs research areas include biophysics, molecular physiology, theoretical physics, glaciology and climate change. The centre was created in 1984 as Centro de Estudios Científicos de Santiago with 150,000 dollars a year for each year of three from the Tinker Foundation of New York City. In 2004-2005 glaciologists from CECS organized the Chilean South Pole Expedition in collaboration with the Chilean Navy and Instituto Antártico Chileno. CECS was founded in Santiago but is since 2000 housed in the recently modernized, German-style Hotel Schuster located by Valdivia River. Claudio Bunster, a physicist and winner of Chile's National Prize in Exact Sciences, is the Director of CECS. - The Drake Passage or Mar de HocesSea of Hocesis the body of water between South America's Cape Horn and the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica. It connects the southwestern part of the Atlantic Ocean (Scotia Sea) with the southeastern part of the Pacific Ocean and extends into the Southern Ocean. - The Valdivia River or Río Valdivia, as it is known locally, is a major river in southern Chile. It is the continuation of the Calle-Calle River, from the point where it meets the Cau-Cau River in the city of Valdivia. The Valdivia river ends in Corral Bay, on the Pacific coast. Other tributaries are the Cruces River, the Tornagaleones River and the Futa River. Pedro de Valdivia Bridge crosses the river in downtown Valdivia. - An \\"aquatic animal\\" is an animal, either vertebrate or invertebrate, which lives in water for most or all of its life. It may breathe air or extract its oxygen from that dissolved in water through specialised organs called gills, or directly through its skin. Natural environments and the animals that live in them can be categorized as aquatic (water) or terrestrial (land). - Whaling is the hunting of whales for meat, oil, blubber, and scientific research. Its earliest forms date to at least circa 3000 BC. Various coastal communities have long histories of subsistence whaling and harvesting beached whales. Industrial whaling emerged with organized fleets in the 17th century; competitive national whaling industries in the 18th and 19th centuries; and the introduction of factory ships along with the concept of whale harvesting in the first half of the 20th century. By the late 1930s, more than 50,000 whales were killed annually In 1986, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) banned commercial whaling in order to increase the whale stock. - Pedro Gutiérrez de Valdivia or Valdiva (April 17, 1497 December 25, 1553) was a Spanish conquistador and the first royal governor of Chile. After serving with the Spanish army in Italy and Flanders, he was sent to South America in 1534, where he served as lieutenant under Francisco Pizarro in Peru, acting as his second in command. In 1540 he led an expedition of 150 Spaniards into Chile, where he defeated a large force of Indians and founded Santiago in 1541. He extended Spanish rule south to the Bío-Bío River in 1546, fought again in Peru (1546 48), and returned to Chile as governor in 1549. He began to conquer Chile south of the Bío-Bío and founded Concepción in 1550. He was captured and killed in a campaign against the Araucanian Indians. The city of Valdivia in Chile is named after him. - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas. - Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. Fishing may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\" \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\" \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives. - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.

Help as much as you can. Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Desert plants fall into two sorts according to the way they deal with the problem of surviving drought. There are the drought--avoiders--those which persist only as seeds, ready to spring up when it rains, to flower quickly and produce another crop of seeds, and to die again. There are also the drought--resisters--those which have evolved various methods for strong water, locating underground water, or reducing their need for water by such devices as shedding their leaves. The drought--resisters are perennials ,they manage to live from one rainy season to another, slowly growing bigger and bigger. Of these, the succulents is a small but interesting fraction . They may store water in their leaves, in their stems, or in underground containers. In the American deserts the best--known succulents are the cacti . They come in a wide range of sizes, from 50--foot tall giant saguaros to tiny round cacti about the size of a thumb--nail. They take thick, cylindrical or even spherical forms, thereby exposing a minimum of evaporating surface to the air and light. They are leafless, except in youth, and then the leaves are small. Typically their surfaces are spiny, discouraging thirsty animals, and channeled like an accordion , so the fleshy stem may expand quickly when the plant drinks and contract slowly as it uses up the water. The root system is widespread and shallow, with good reason; only about 3 per cent of the rain that falls on the desert penetrates to any significant depth into soil.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: With the score 0-0, hundreds of supporters came on to the field, forcing referee Mick Russell to take the players off the pitch. The game was held up for more than an hour before a decision was made to call the fixture off. It is not known if the match will be replayed at a later date. A Football League spokesman said: \\"Following the abandonment of today's match at Bloomfield Road, it will be for the Football Association to consider any matters relating to crowd behaviour, with the Football League ruling on whether or not the match should be replayed.\\" Before the match, 2,000 Blackpool fans protested outside the ground against the club's owners, the Oyston family. The Seasiders have already been relegated from the Championship and have endured a miserable season, collecting just 25 points from their 45 games before Saturday's final match of the campaign. Saturday's protest was the second in just under a month at Bloomfield Road, after home fans threw fireworks and eggs during their draw against Reading. Shortly after half-time, Blackpool supporters made their way on to the pitch and headed towards the centre circle. Some fans released flares and began angrily chanting towards the Oyston family in the directors' area, as tensions rose inside the stadium. The scene soon became somewhat farcical, as one fan entered the pitch to join the protest on a mobility scooter, while others broke out in a conga line as supporters continued to voice their frustrations. Despite pleas from the referee to restart the match, the protesting fans stood firm and the match was eventually called off on safety grounds after over an hour of on-field protesting. Before the game was abandoned, the visitors were twice denied an opening goal as Joe Lolley and former Blackpool striker Ishmael Miller had their efforts stopped by Elliot Parish. Parish was called into action again shortly afterwards to deny Oscar Gobern's well-directed header, before Peter Clarke's long-range shot nearly gave the home side the lead against the run of play. Jamie O'Hara forced a save from visiting goalkeeper Alex Smithies before the pitch invasion ended the match. Blackpool manager Lee Clark: \\"It just compounds an absolutely horrendous season. The supporters were just acting on this season and the culmination of the relegation. \\"Frustration has been building up over a period of time. It's a very, very disappointing day. I love football and I love working in the industry ever since I left school, and I didn't want to be involved in anything like this. \\"I have the feelings of a supporter and I'll never criticise them. Since I came through the door there has been a very toxic atmosphere and you can't be successful with that. \\"We kept chatting to the referee and the officials and match commander, but we couldn't determine what was going to happen or how long we'd have to wait before it was abandoned and what would the sanction be. \\"Is the game going to be replayed? No-one knows as it's a unique situation.\\" Huddersfield manager Chris Powell: \\"I feel sorry for our fans first off, coming all this way. I'm sure some will have come last night and paid for accommodation and they were all in a good mood. \\"What happened is something that I've never seen before. It's unprecedented and what's going to happen now? \\"To be fair to the referee, he was a little bit in shock but handled it well and got advice from safety officers and the head of police. They tried their best to get the game back on but in the end they couldn't guarantee our safety. \\"It's strange to end the season this way.

Once again I have seen a movie made by people that know nothing. I just recently reviewed Baby Face Nelson. Now I've seen Dillinger and I've had it. This movie is garbage. I don't know how anyone in their right mind could compare this to a classic like Bonnie and Clyde. This movie is far from a classic. Someone called it brilliant. That's an insane thing to say. This movie can't get any facts straight and it has the worst casting I've ever seen. I don't know whose dumb idea it was to cast Warren Oates as John Dillinger. First of all he looks nothing like him. Second of all, by the time John Dillinger was killed he was 31. When Oates made this he was 45! You could even tell that he's older than the real Dillinger just by looking at him. Not only was he too old, but so was Ben Johnson as Melvin Purvis. They show Baby Face Nelson die, then Homer Van Meter, and finally John Dillinger. John Dillinger was killed before both of them. The last one to die out of the three was Baby Face Nelson. Not only do the writers not know when they died, but they also don't know how they died. Baby Face Nelson was not killed after he escaped from Little Bohemia in a robe. Homer Van Meter was not killed by farmers with shot guns. Homer Van Meter was cornered by the police in St. Paul and gunned down with machine guns. Another member of Dillinger's gang, Harry Pierpont is shown being shot by police in this movie. Pierpont wasn't shot. Harry Pierpont was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair. I go into what happened to Baby Face Nelson on my Baby Face Nelson review so I'm not going to go into it again here. Let me also add that Richard Dreyfuss' portrayal of Baby Face Nelson is pathetic. There's a scene where he attacks Dillinger and then gets a bad beating. While Dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming, \\"Leave me alone!\\" Baby Face Nelson and John Dillinger never fought. Maybe Dillinger didn't agree with Nelson's bank robbing methods, but they never fought. Nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten. They keep calling him Lester \\"Baby Face\\" Nelson. He was never in his life known by that name. Nelson's real name was Lester Gillis and he changed his name to George Nelson. The black guy that escaped from jail with Dillinger was Herbert Youngblood, but in this movie he is known as Reed Youngblood. John Milius doesn't know anything. Where the hell did John Milius get his information? I could probably make a better movie than him. Finally the way they showed John Dillinger die is outrageous and inexcusable. The movie shows Dillinger walk out of the Biograph with the Lady in Red and his girlfriend Billie Frechette. By the way, Billie Frechette wasn't even there that night. But a girl named Polly Hamilton was. Melvin Purvis yells, 'Johnny!' Dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell. It is a proved fact that Dillinger did not have a gun that night. The FBI gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away. They didn't even have to shoot him. They were so close that powder burns were found on his face. It was murder. They also say that the man killed that night was not John Dillinger. After killing tons of civilians in the Little Bohemia incident can you imagine the FBI reporting that they had just killed another innocent unarmed man? The gun they had on display that was supposedly on Dillinger was also proved not to have been manufactured until after Dillinger's death. I could go on and on how the man they killed wasn't John Dillinger, but I'll stop here.

At 42, she had never been married, or even seriously dated. All she could think about, night and day, was her ultimate goal. And her dream finally came true, thanks to the death of 74-year-old Porter Strickley. She could not deny that she had learned the job well, working for that old pain-in-the-butt. He was 57 when she interviewed for the position of Assistant District Attorney. At the time, she thought he was 70. Two months ago, she had become the District Attorney. She loved seeing her name on the door. And she felt a rush of adrenaline every time a judge referred to her as 'The District Attorney' in open court. The D.A.'s office would be better than ever--now that she was running the show. There was a soft knock, and Andrea Newly opened the door just enough to peek in. \\"Come in, Andrea.\\" Angela sometimes wondered if she had made a mistake two weeks ago when she hired this timid young lady as her assistant. Angela had been impressed with her resume. But in person, Andrea was quiet, and seemed to be rather intimidated by Angela. But Andrea was enthralled with every word Angela spoke. And the new D.A. couldn't resist the prospect of being god to her assistant. She had hired her on the spot, even though she knew Andrea would stress her patience. But Angela was confident the 25-year-old could be molded into her mentor's image. And thereby, become a powerful force for justice in the D.A.'s office. Andrea took a chair across from the D.A. The furniture in the District Attorney's office was similar to that found in most old government offices-largely unchanged since the 1950s. Yet the hardwood chairs and desks were of such good quality that an exact replacement would be cost prohibitive in today's market. Angela planned to upsize her diminutive desk as soon as possible, even if the money came out of her own pocket. Question: Who was 57 when she interviewed for the position of district attorney? Answer:","completion":"Porter Strickley was 57 when Angela Hammerly interviewed for the position of Assistant District Attorney."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To help your salmon bake evenly, arrange your racks so you can place a baking dish in the very center, equally distant from the top and bottom. Use a brush to spread a light amount of olive oil over your filet. This will help your salmon retain moisture while stuck in the oven. If your salmon is large, cut it into smaller filets before spreading any oil. To season your salmon thoroughly, sprinkle pinches of salt, pepper, dill, garlic, parsley, and tarragon over the filet. After, squeeze half of your citrus fruit over the salmon for extra flavor and juiciness. Make sure to season both sides before baking. You can also use aluminum foil or non-stick baking sheets as an alternative to cooking spray. For most salmon, this leads to baking times of around 15 minutes. Salmon can dry out quickly, so make sure you keep an eye on it while cooking. To check if your salmon is ready, scrape the center of the fish with a fork to see if it's done. If it doesn't slake, leave it in for a few more minutes. Summary:","completion":"This article teaches how to bake salmon by putting it in the center of the oven, brushing with oil, seasoning with spices and citrus, and checking if it's done after 15 minutes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The answer to the question: Who did Harris accuse of assisting the gamblers in the inciting the unrest,? is inside the article: The NSWCA appealed to Lord Harris, and in reply he said he did not blame them or the cricketers of Sydney in any way, but said that \\"it [the riot] was an occurrence it was impossible he could forget\\". On 11 February, one day after the conclusion of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.Lord Harris referred to the crowd as a \\"howling mob\\" and said \\"I have seen no reason as yet to change my opinion of Coulthard's qualities, or to regret his engagement, in which opinion I am joined by the whole team\\". He further added that \\"Beyond slyly kicking me once or twice the mob behaved very well, their one cry being, 'Change your umpire'. And now for the cause of this disturbance, not unexpected, I may say, by us, for we have heard accounts of former matches played by English teams.\\" Harris further accused a New South Wales parliamentarian of assisting the gamblers in the inciting the unrest, although he did not name the accusee. He said I blame the NSW Eleven for not objecting to Coulthard before the match began, if they had reason to suppose him incompetent to fulfil his duties. I blame the members of the association (many, of course, must be excepted) for their discourtesy and uncricket like behaviour to their guests; and I blame the committee and others of the association for ever permitting betting, but this last does not, of course, apply to our match only. I am bound to say they did all in their power to quell the disturbance. I don't think anything would have happened if A. Bannerman had been run out instead of Murdoch, but the latter, besides being a great..., can you guess it ?

Stereolab introduced easy-listening elements into their sound with the EP Space Age Bachelor Pad Music, released in March 1993. The work raised the band's profile and landed them a major-label American record deal with Elektra Records. Their first album under Elektra, Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements (August 1993), was an underground success in both the US and the UK. Mark Jenkins commented in Washington Post that with the album, Stereolab \\"continues the glorious drones of [their] indie work, giving celestial sweep to [their] garage-rock organ pumping and rhythm-guitar strumming\\". In the UK, the album was released on Duophonic Ultra High Frequency Disks, which is responsible for domestic releases of Stereolab's major albums.In January 1994, Stereolab achieved their first chart entry when the 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline, entered at number 75 on the UK Singles Chart. (Over the next three years, four more releases by the band would appear on this chart, ending with the EP Miss Modular in 1997.) Their third album, Mars Audiac Quintet, was released in August 1994. The album contains the single \\"Ping Pong\\", which gained press coverage for its allegedly explicit Marxist lyrics. The band focused more on pop and less on rock, resulting in what AllMusic described as \\"what may be the group's most accessible, tightly-written album\\". It was the last album to feature O'Hagan as a full-time member. He would continue to make guest appearances on later releases. The group issued an EP titled Music for the Amorphous Body Study Center in April 1995. The EP was their musical contribution to an interactive art exhibit put on in collaboration with New York City artist Charles Long. Their second compilation of rarities, titled Refried Ectoplasm (Switched On, Vol. 2), was released in July 1995.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Jake and his son Ryan just had their yearly physical examination by the doctor. As part of this year's examination, both men had their arterial walls examined to identify the presence of plaques.

Neil was ready to sleep, but Donald was having a party, so","completion":"Neil was ready to sleep, but Donald was having a party, so he had to deal with the blaring music, laughter, and foot traffic right outside his bedroom door. While he initially felt annoyed and ready to confront Donald to ask him to lower the noise, he figured it might be more productive to find alternative ways to handle the situation. Knowing that Donald was quite the social butterfly and enjoyed hosting frequent gatherings at their place, Neil thought that it would be wise to invest in some noise-cancelling headphones and blackout curtains for his bedroom. This would help in creating an environment conducive to relaxation and sleep, despite the noisy environment around him. He also thought about speaking with Donald about establishing some boundaries and rules concerning noise levels and the frequency of parties. As roommates, it was essential to reach a compromise that respected one another's preferences; Neil valued his peace and quiet, while Donald loved having friends over to celebrate. Furthermore, Neil realized that he could always join the party occasionally. This would not only strengthen his bond with Donald but also present an opportunity to meet new people and socialize. Neil didn't have to become a regular attendee, but getting involved now and then would show he was a good sport and potentially earn him some goodwill for future circumstances when he would need to ask for their cooperation. Another solution Neil considered was adjusting his daily routine to accommodate the changes in his environment. For instance, he could use earplugs and try taking naps during quieter times in the day or practice meditating or maintaining focused work in the early morning hours when everyone else was asleep. Neil also believed that communication was key to resolving this issue. He planned on talking with Donald, sharing his concerns about the noisy environment, and finding a middle ground suitable for both of them. They could discuss designated quiet hours to help Neil get the sleep he needed while allowing Donald to have his fun. Finally, seeking external support could help, like asking other neighbors if they experienced similar disturbances and contacting the landlord regarding quiet-hour policies. While Neil wasn't keen on resorting to such measures, it was a useful fallback option in case of unresolved roommate disputes. In conclusion, though Neil was ready to sleep and faced Donald's raucous parties, he found that adopting various strategies like investing in noise-canceling devices, communicating with his roommate, participating in social events, adjusting his routine, and potentially seeking external assistance could help him manage the situation effectively. Ultimately, maintaining a sense of understanding and cooperation would be instrumental in preserving a harmonious living environment, despite their different lifestyle preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali (; Dutch: [a:'ja:n 'hi:rsi 'a:li] ( listen); born Ayaan Hirsi Magan, 13 November 1969) is a Somali-born Dutch-American activist, feminist, author, scholar and former politician. Susan Dominus of the New York Times wrote: \\"In \\"Heretic,\\" Hirsi Ali forgoes autobiography for the most part in favor of an extended argument. But she has trouble making anyone else's religious history - even that of Muhammad himself, whose life story she recounts - as dramatic as she has made her own. And she loses the reader's trust with overblown rhetoric. ... She tries to warn Americans about their naivete in the face of encroaching Islamic influences, maintaining that officials and journalists, out of cultural sensitivity, sometimes play down the honor killings that occur in the West.\\" The Economist wrote: \\"Unfortunately, very few Muslims will accept Ms Hirsi Ali's full-blown argument, which insists that Islam must change in at least five important ways. A moderate Muslim might be open to discussion of four of her suggestions if the question were framed sensitively. Muslims, she says, must stop prioritizing the afterlife over this life; they must \\"shackle sharia\\" and respect secular law; they must abandon the idea of telling others, including non-Muslims, how to behave, dress or drink; and they must abandon holy war.

However, it is important to note that the original passage only discusses the case where body temperature increases. Based on the passage, when the body temperature increases, the brain sends messages to the blood vessels in the skin to increase in diameter. This process helps to dissipate heat, allowing the body to maintain a safe internal temperature. In contrast, when body temperature decreases, the body needs to conserve heat. In order to do this, the blood vessels in the skin would constrict or decrease in diameter. Constriction of blood vessels reduces blood flow to the surface of the skin, which helps minimize heat loss and maintain a stable body temperature.

The mystery surrounding 28 pages said to show links between 9/11 plotters and Saudi Arabia What is the official line on the Saudi role in the 9/11 attacks? Of the 19 hijackers who carried out the 9/11 attacks, 15 were from Saudi Arabia. They were all affiliated with al-Qaeda, the terrorist organization founded by Osama bin Laden, the scion of a wealthy and connected Saudi family. The Saudi royal family also has been accused of tolerating extremist clerics within the kingdom in exchange for domestic stability and political support. After the attacks in 2001, these facts contributed to a widespread suspicion that Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally for 70 years, had somehow aided the plotters, possibly with financing. However, when the 9/11 Commission released its final report on the attacks in 2004, it suggested only that the Saudi government had \\"turned a blind eye\\" to charities that funded the attack but was not directly involved. The report's conclusion has served as the official line on any allegations of a Saudi government link to the attacks: \\"Saudi Arabia has long been considered the primary source of al Qaeda funding, but we found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior officials within the Saudi government funded al Qaeda.\\" What are the 28 pages? The source of the new speculation about the alleged Saudi role in the attacks is a report that came out in 2002, two years before the 9/11 Commission released its findings. This report was the product of a bipartisan joint congressional inquiry into intelligence failures that led to the attacks. And the problem isn't so much what the publicly released version of this report said. It was what it didn't say. Under the orders of then-President George W. Bush, 28 pages of the joint inquiry's final 838-page report were classified. They sit under lock and key in a vault. According to multiple accounts from those who have seen the pages, they contain an entire section on the alleged links between Saudi officials and the 9/11 hijackers. Of particular notoriety are the alleged links between two of the hijackers and a Saudi network that helped them when they arrived in California. These hijackers, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, could not speak English and may have been expected to struggle with adapting to American life. However, they arrived in California more than a year and a half before the attacks took place. Some suspect that Hazmi and Mihdhar would have needed help in California. Authorities have investigated whether Fahad al-Thumairy, an official at the Saudi consular office in Los Angeles, could have been someone who provided help. The two hijackers may have worshiped at a mosque where Thumairy was an iman. What is clear is that they met with Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi working for the country's civil aviation authority in California, at a restaurant in L.A. Bayoumi, who says his meeting with the two men was simply a coincidence, later helped the pair get acquainted with San Diego, and loaned money for an apartment. The Federal Bureau of Investigation suspects Bayoumi and Thumairy met shortly before this meeting. According to the Guardian, in a 2004 interrogation in Riyadh, Thumairy denied knowing Bayoumi. However, investigators later suggested he may have been lying — phone logs showed 21 calls between the two over two years. The government gave several reasons for not releasing the 28 pages, including national security. At the time, Saudi officials were among those who called for those pages to be released. \\"Saudi Arabia has nothing to hide,\\" the Saudi ambassador to the United States at the time, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, said in 2003. \\"We can deal with questions in public, but we cannot respond to blank pages.\\" Why are these 28 pages still so controversial? Over the years, there have been some who have suggested that the 28 pages weren't quite as scandalous as they were often presented — in fact, as the New Yorker's Lawrence Wright has reported, the 9/11 Commission report attempted to substantiate the allegations contained in those 28 pages and apparently failed. Recently, Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters that the allegations in the 28 pages had been investigated and found false. \\"There is no there there,” he said in June, while reiterating Saudi calls for their release. Yet the controversy surrounding the pages has remained; in fact, some point toward the 9/11 Commission report's cautious wording on the alleged Saudi link as evidence of a coverup. Groups, including families of the attack victims, have repeatedly called on the government to release the 28 pages. These groups have gained the support of several members of Congress and U.S. officials — Obama is reported to have made a promise to the families of victims in 2008 and 2009. The whole controversy has been brought back in a big way recently by a \\"60 Minutes\\" documentary that aired April 10 — about a week before Obama was due to visit Saudi Arabia. In the segment, correspondent Steve Kroft spoke to a number of members of the 9/11 Commission, who said they wanted the 28 pages released. \\"We certainly didn't pursue the entire line of inquiry in regard to Saudi Arabia,\\" former U.S. senator Bob Kerrey (D) told CBS. What happens if the 28 pages are released? It depends a lot on what is actually in these pages. If they really do contain some kind of smoking gun that links the Saudi government to the 9/11 plot, there could be a large public outcry. There has long been skepticism among the U.S. public about their government's relationship with Saudi Arabia — survey research from Gallup suggests that more Americans have had an unfavorable view of the country than a positive one since 2002 — but the recent rise of the Islamic State, a group partially inspired by the radical Islam many Saudi clerics espouse, has thrown the relationship into an especially harsh light. To add to this pressure, in April the Senate passed a bill that could make it easier for families of victims to sue the Saudi government for any link to the 9/11 plot, despite reports that the Saudi government would sell off U.S. investments if the bill passed. However, it may be more likely that the pages might contain some theories and suggestions for ways that the Saudi government could be linked to the 9/11 plot, but no hard proof. The net result here would be murkier, but it seems unlikely that this would satisfy those who suspect a conspiracy. Either way, their release comes at an important time. The United States is in the middle of a complicated and controversial election season. Trump has spoken in favor of releasing the 28 pages and hinted at Saudi involvement in the 9/11 attacks. \\"It’s sort of nice to know who your friends are and perhaps who your enemies are,\\" the presumptive Republican candidate said in April. \\"You’re going to see some very revealing things released in those papers.” Meanwhile, the Saudis are having their own succession drama. The 90-year-old King Abdullah died last year, to be replaced by his half-brother King Salman. But the 80-year-old Salman has switched up the line of succession, bringing his son Mohammed bin Salman closer to holding power, raising fears of a power struggle in the kingdom. The facts — and a few myths — about Saudi Arabia and human rights Saudi Arabia’s ‘Islamic military alliance’ against terrorism makes no sense What Saudi Arabia is (and isn’t) doing in the fight against the Islamic State What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The 28 pages refer to a classified section of a joint congressional inquiry's report on the September 11 attacks. These pages are believed to contain information about the possible links between the Saudi government and the 9/11 attackers. The pages have not been released to the public, leading to suspicions and debates over Saudi Arabia's possible involvement in the attacks. These pages remain classified due to several reasons, including national security concerns, and the controversy surrounding their non-release still exists. Some believe that the pages contain evidence that could potentially damage the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia. If these pages were to be released, the reactions would highly depend on the content within, which could either lead to a large public outcry or remain inconclusive with theories but no solid proof."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: If you are staying awake longer than normal, you’ll have to resist the temptation to sleep. Stay out of bed, don’t wear pajamas, and avoid anything else that is part of your sleep routine. Keep the temperature warm enough or cool enough that you are slightly uncomfortable, and more likely to stay awake. Your body’s basic sleep cycle is tied to light during the day and dark at night. This means that dim lights can make you sleepy, especially if you are staying up beyond your usual bed time. Bright lights, however, can increase alertness. Keep lamps and other sources of light on when you are trying to stay awake. Staying awake in company can be easier than trying to do it alone. Talking, studying, listening to music, and taking breaks with others can be stimulating and help the time pass by. An alarm clock can be a good back-up when you are trying to stay awake, especially if you have to do it alone. Try setting an alarm (or several) for regular intervals, such as every half-hour. That way, if you accidentally fall asleep, it won’t be for very long. If you are staying awake while getting work or chores done, try switching tasks every now and then. The change will provide some mental stimulation, especially if you move locations (from room to room, or from indoors to outdoors, for instance).

Genetic engineering: As explained above, genetic engineering deals with the direct manipulation of genes, and it’s the most accurate term for this process. Genetic engineers can introduce, remove or modify one or more genes in an organism’s DNA to produce desired characteristics, such as resistance to pests in crops, production of therapeutic proteins in pharmaceuticals, and even the creation of model organisms for research purposes. 2. Manual engineering: This term is not related to genetic manipulation. Manual engineering usually refers to the process of designing, prototyping, and testing various non-genetic components, such as hardware devices, machines, or facilities using manual skills, drawings or models, and basic engineering principles. 3. Genetic testing: Genetic testing, also known as DNA testing, involves examining an individual's DNA to identify changes, mutations, or variations in their genes. This process is utilized to diagnose or predict the likelihood of genetic diseases, confirm or refute biological relationships between individuals, and establish ancestry. Though it involves analyzing genetic information, genetic testing does not involve the direct manipulation of genes. 4. Genetic cloning: Cloning, or gene cloning, is a process where scientists create copies of a gene, cell, or organism. During genetic cloning, a specific gene or a DNA sequence is isolated from an organism and inserted into a cloning vector, like a bacterial plasmid or a virus, which can multiply within a host cell, thus creating multiple copies of the target gene. Genetic cloning is a technique used within genetic engineering but isn’t the exact term for direct manipulation of genes. In conclusion, genetic engineering is the appropriate term for the direct manipulation of genes for practical purposes. The other terms, such as manual engineering, genetic testing, and genetic cloning, describe different aspects or techniques associated with genetics but do not specifically pertain to the direct manipulation of genes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The output should be a list of numbers that is the result of applying that logic to the input list. You should not round any decimals in the output. Zero should be counted as an even integer. Q: [71, -44, 33, 91, -46, -59, 16, -72, 85] A:","completion":"Explanation: This task involves taking a list of integers, and performing different operations based on whether each number is even or odd. Here are the guidelines provided: 1. If a number is even, it should be divided by 4. 2. If a number is odd, it should be multiplied by 4, and then 2 should be added to the result. The output should be a new list, with the results of these operations. It was also specified not to round any decimals, meaning we keep the result as it is without rounding off to the nearest whole number. The provided list is [71, -44, 33, 91, -46, -59, 16, -72, 85]. Let's solve the task: For 71 (odd), the operation is 71*4+2 = 286. For -44 (even), the operation is -44/4 = -11. For 33 (odd), the operation is 33*4+2 = 134. For 91 (odd), the operation is 91*4+2 = 366. For -46 (even), the operation is -46/4 = -11.5. For -59 (odd), the operation is -59*4+2 = -234. For 16 (even), the operation is 16/4 = 4. For -72 (even), the operation is -72/4 = -18. For 85 (odd), the operation is 85*4+2 = 342.

We have this equation: 3 * b - 24 = -33 1. First, let's add 24 to both sides to get rid of the -24 in the equation. This is like saying, if we have 3 apples and take away 24 candies, we are left with -33 toys. To find out how many toys we have without the candies, we add 24 candies back. 3 * b - 24 + 24 = -33 + 24 Now, the -24 and the +24 on the left side cancel each other out: 3 * b = -9 2. Now, we have 3 * b = -9. This means 3 times some number (b) is equal to -9. To find out what 'b' is, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3. It's like saying, we have three groups of toys that equal -9 toys, so if we separate them evenly, how many toys are in each group? To do this, we do: (3 * b) ÷ 3 = -9 ÷ 3 3 and 3 cancel each other: b = -3 So, b equals -3.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Parents' Guide To College Depression Most parents of college-bound kids are likely caught up this month in thoughts of shopping lists, what to pack and how they'll say goodbye. But given the growing number of college-aged kids reporting that they're dealing with depression, it may also be worth it to think about how these kids will handle the sometimes overwhelming transition to being on his or her own--and, should it trigger a mental health disorder, what parents can do. Everything from the way parents talk to their kids on the phone at school to their own attitudes about seeking mental health counseling can have an impact, experts say. The rate of students reporting ever having been diagnosed with depression increased 56% between 2000 and 2005, from 10% to 16%, according to the American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment. But just how common is the problem? The organization's fall 2007 survey showed that, of more than 20,000 students questioned at 48 schools, 36% were so depressed that it had caused difficulty functioning on one to 10 occasions during the previous year. Why Now? Depression has likely grown among college-aged students in the U.S. due to more diagnoses (an effect of increased awareness), more campus mental health resources and a greater willingness to discuss the problem and seek treatment for it, says Dr. Rachel Glick, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan and former co-chair of the Presidential Task Force on Mental Health on College Campuses. Kids today are also being treated for psychological problems earlier than ever before, enabling them to attend college when it might not have been possible otherwise. There's also a lot to be said about the powder keg that can be a young adult's transition to college. Not only are kids aged 18 to 22 experiencing a flood of developmental changes, they're also usually living on their own for the first time, dealing with the stresses of figuring out their careers and staying up all night. Some are experimenting with drugs and alcohol. And then there are all of those expectations. \\"There are a lot of notions that this is the way college has to be, this is the way I've planned on it to be my whole life,\\" says Todd Sevig, a psychologist who directs counseling and psychology services for undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Michigan. \\"When that starts to change, it's disconcerting.\\" What You Can Do While many parents are aware of their college-bound children's vulnerabilities, whether due to past experiences with depression or a family history, others are caught by surprise. \\"Some people are quite vulnerable [to depression], but it doesn't emerge until the highly stressful years of separation and trying to grow into adulthood,\\" says Dr. Chris Martin, staff psychiatrist and team leader of the Menninger Clinic's Compass Program, an inpatient hospital program for 18- to 30-year-olds struggling with psychiatric disorders. That's why it's crucial for parents to keep an eye out for changes in their child's attitude and behavior during the transition to college, as well as other periods of change such as the times leading up to summer break and graduation. This can be tricky to do, especially from afar, but the key is to look for unusual changes in your child's appetite, sleeping habits (such as a sudden onset of insomnia), ability to concentrate and energy levels, Martin says. If you spend a lot of time talking with your child about his or her hopes for college, consider discussing the problems he or she might encounter too, suggests Dr. Flynn O'Malley, the Compass Program's program director. Bringing up the topic now can make it easier for your child to open up about problems later. Sharing the fact that there's no weakness in seeking counseling to get through a period of depression can also, in a subtle way, influence your child to get help if he or she ever needs it. Sending a child off to school? How are you handling the transition? Weigh in. Post your thoughts in the Reader Comments section below. Parents whose children are currently dealing with depression would also be wise to compare the mental health resources at the schools on their child's wish list, Sevig says. If a child's problem is severe, it might mean asking if he or she would be able to work with a psychiatrist or inquiring about whether students are ever hospitalized if their illnesses progress. It's smart to look into what your health insurance covers in terms of mental health care in different states, too. With some planning, parents can position themselves so they're better able to help their children deal with depression and get as much as possible out of the college experience. \\"Kids with depression and anxiety disorders should be able to succeed with good treatment,\\" Glick says. \\"I think it's harder, but it shouldn't be a block to their being successful.\\"","completion":"This news article emphasizes the importance of parents being aware of and addressing the potential for college-related depression in their children. The rate of students reporting diagnosed depression has increased significantly; a survey showed that 36% of over 20,000 students at 48 schools were so depressed that it had caused difficulty functioning at least once during the previous year. Factors contributing to this issue include increased awareness and willingness to discuss mental health concerns, greater accessibility of campus mental health resources, and the significant developmental changes and stressors faced by college students. Parents can play an essential role in helping their children manage depression by being aware of any changes in their child's behavior or attitude during the college transition and discussing potential challenges with them. Encouraging openness about mental health issues and emphasizing the importance of seeking professional help can also provide a safety net for students who may experience depression. Additionally, parents should research and compare the mental health resources at each school on their child's list, as well as understand the scope of mental health care coverage provided by their health insurance in different states. With proper planning and support, children with depression and anxiety disorders can succeed in college with appropriate treatment and assistance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: If your parents have different Rh factors (or if they are both positive and you want to know for sure that you are also positive), you can request a blood typing test. This outpatient procedure is fast and should not be very painful. You can go home afterwards. A nurse or physician will clean a spot on your inner elbow or wrist with an antiseptic towelette. He/She will locate an easily accessible vein in this area. After wrapping a tourniquet around your upper arm to pool the blood, he/she will stick your vein with a needle. The needle is usually connected to a syringe, which removes your blood. Once he/she has taken enough blood, he/she will take out the needle and gently press the injection site with a sterile swab. You will then receive a bandage. Afterwards, the nurse will label your sample and send it to a lab for testing. Doctors test children’s blood through the back of their hands. If you feel like you might pass out, tell the medical professional. He/She can help you recline. You might feel a prick, sting, or mild pain when your nurse sticks you. After the test, you might bruise at the puncture site. This pain should not last long. At the laboratory, a technician will test your sample for its Rh factor. He/She will combine a sample of your blood with an anti-Rh serum. If your cells clot, you have Rh+. On the other hand, if your blood cells do not stick together, you are Rh-. It is likely that the lab will run tests to determine your ABO blood type as well during this time. Record your blood type in a safe place and share this information with your emergency contacts. You will need this information if you require a blood transfusion or organ transplants. Additionally, if you are or plan to be pregnant, knowing your Rh factor is essential. If you are female and Rh-, you will need to have your partner test his Rh factor. If you are Rh- and he is Rh+, you can experience Rh incompatibility. This means that if your baby inherits his father’s Rh+, your antibodies can attack the baby's red blood cells. This can cause extreme anemia and possible death for the baby. During your pregnancy, if you are Rh-, you will take blood tests to see whether your body is producing antibodies against Rh+ blood. The first will happen in your first trimester and the second will occur when you are 28 weeks pregnant. If no antibodies have developed, you will receive a shot of Rh immune globulin. This shot will prevent your body from producing harmful antibodies against your child. If your body has produced antibodies against Rh+ blood, you will not receive an immune globulin shot. Instead, doctors will keep a close eye on your baby as he/she develops. Either before or after his/her birth, your child might receive a blood transfusion. Once your baby is born, doctors can test his/her Rh factor. If your baby shares your Rh factor, you will need no further treatment. If you are Rh- negative, however, and your baby is Rh+, you must receive another immune globulin shot.","completion":"If your mom and dad have different blood types, you might need a test to find out your own blood type. This test is quick and not too painful. A nurse or doctor will take a small sample of your blood using a needle. They will then send that blood to a lab to find your blood type. Knowing your blood type is important if you ever need a blood transfusion, organ transplant, or are planning to have a baby. If a mom has a certain blood type called Rh- and the dad has Rh+, their baby might have a health problem called Rh incompatibility. This can make the baby very sick or even cause them to die. During pregnancy, the mom will take tests to see if her body is making things that can harm the baby. If not, she will get a special shot to keep the baby safe. Sometimes the baby needs extra care before and after birth. Knowing your blood type can help keep you and your baby safe and healthy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the background: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. and the situation: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess. Answer the following question: Does lake Mahoe have more or less chemicals in it than lake Tresco? Answer:","completion":"Given the background information and the situations of both lakes, it is likely that Lake Mahoe has more chemicals in it than Lake Tresco. The reason for this conclusion is as follows: 1. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows various crops for the town, which implies they may be using significant amounts of fertilizers and pesticides to ensure good crop production. These chemicals can potentially run off the farm fields and enter the lake. 2. The owner of the farm at Lake Mahoe also rents out his barn for celebrations, indicating that there might be more visitors and activities on the farm. These visitors could inadvertently contribute to chemical pollution by spilling food, drinks, or other products during their celebrations. Lake Tresco, on the other hand, is located near a school and is primarily used by children during recess. While children may inadvertently contribute to pollution, the sources and amounts would likely be less significant than those at Lake Mahoe. Based on this analysis, I conclude that Lake Mahoe likely has more chemicals in it than Lake Tresco."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Brussels Airport reopens to thin stream of passengers BRUSSELS, April 3 (Reuters) - Brussels Airport reopened to a thin stream of passengers on Sunday, 12 days after suicide bombers destroyed its departure hall and killed 16 people. SEE ALSO: Two additional US citizens confirmed killed in Brussels attack Belgium's main airport had not handled passenger flights since two suspected Islamist militants carried out the suicide attacks. Those bombs and a separate one on a metro train in the capital killed 32 people, excluding the three bombers. The first of three scheduled flights set for Sunday was due to depart for Faro in Portugal at 1:40 p.m. local time (1140 GMT), with only about 60-70 passengers. Planes will also go to Turin and Athens later in the day, with three return flights set for the evening. The first passengers for nearly two weeks fed into a vast temporary marquee housing security controls and check-in facilities. Arnaud Feist, the airport's chief executive, said Sunday would be an emotional day for many airport staff, but described the partial reopening as a sign of hope.

Many flights have been rerouted to Belgium's regional airports or other nearby hubs such as Amsterdam and Paris, with high-speed trains to and from Brussels packed. Brussels Airport has warned passengers to arrive three hours before their flights due to increased security and to come by car. The normal train and bus services are not running. Special cameras will be set up to read number plates, there will be random checks of vehicles and the drop-off zone will not be accessible. Passengers and their baggage will be checked on arrival and there will be increased patrols of armed police and military. The airport is one of the largest in Europe, handling 23.5 million passengers per year. It links the Belgian capital, headquarter city of the European Union and NATO, with 226 destinations worldwide through 77 airlines. With its temporary check-in zone, it will only be able to handle some 800 departing passengers or about five to six flights per hour, around 20 percent of previous capacity. The airport says it aims to return to maximum capacity before the start of summer holidays at the end of June or early July, with some check-in desks restored in the departure hall, followed by a full reopening of that space. Brussels Airlines, Belgium's largest carrier and 45 percent owned by Germany's Lufthansa, has estimated the closure of its Brussels hub is costing it 5 million euros (5.7 million) per day. The city's association of hotel operators pointed to the closed airport as one of the main reasons for a more than 50 percent drop in overnight stays in the week following the bombings.

It informs about the new security measures, and modifications in airport infrastructure, services, and operations due to the bombings. There were only limited flights with a reduced number of passengers. There were extra stringent security measures like special cameras and random vehicle checks. The airport said it hopes to go back to its maximum capacity sometime in the summer. Arnaud Feist, CEO of Brussels Airport, described the reopening as a sign of hope. The airport shutdown caused Brussels Airlines, Belgium's largest carrier, an approximate financial loss of around 5 million euros a day. The shutdown was also one of the reasons hotel stays in Brussels dropped more than 50% in the week after the bombings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: City traffic is a great problem. More cars are produced every year and the streets are getting more and more crowded. So during \\"rush hours\\", when people are going to or from their work, traffic is brought to a standstill. It has been suggested that commuters--the people who travel to work every day from outside the city--should share their cars and give each other lifts. So each car would carry four or five people instead of only one. It is an excellent idea., however, so far nobody has been able to think of a way to make people do so. To discourage motorists from leaving their cars in the streets all day, parking meters are used. When you park at a meter, you must put a coin in the slot . This pays for a certain amount of time. The meter records this and it shows when the time that you have paid for is finished. If the car is still there then, you have to pay a fine. Traffic wardens look after the meters. They walk around the streets and check that every meter shows that money has been paid for the car parked there. If a meter shows 'TIME EXPIRED', the motorist who has left his car there is fined. Of course, the traffic warden can not wait for the owner of the car to return. He carries many printed forms, and on one of these he writes down all the details, such as the number of the car, where it is parked, how much the driver must pay and where he must send the money. He leaves this form on the car, where the driver will be able to see it easily; he usually pushes it under one of the windscreen wipers so that it will not be blown away. And in case it rains before the motorist returns, the form is put in a little plastic envelope to protect it. When the driver comes back, he gets an unpleasant surprise, but it is his own fault for leaving his car too long at parking meter.

Movie title: Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls Context: After failing the rescue attempt of a raccoon in the Himalayas (a parody of the opening to the film Cliffhanger), Ace Ventura undergoes an emotional breakdown and goes on a personal soul-searching quest by becoming a Tibetan monk. He is approached by Fulton Greenwall, a British correspondent working for a provincial consulate in the fictional African country of Nibia. Being that Ace's influence is disruptive to the monastery, the Grand Abbot eagerly gives Ace excuses by which to justify his departure.Greenwall asks Ventura to find a sacred animal called Shikaka, which has become a point of contention. Shikaka, which is a great white bat, is a sacred animal for the Wachati and Wachootoo tribes of Nibia; whenever its name is spoken, the tribesmen must bow. Accompanied by his capuchin monkey, Spike, Ace travels to Africa and returns to his pet detective work.After arriving in Nibia and meeting with the head of the consulate, Vincent Cadby, Ace begins learning about his case as well as the possible suspects. Ace, normally an animal lover, must overcome his fear of bats in order to continue studying the case. He travels to the Wachati tribal village, where he learns that Shikaka is meant as a wedding present from the Wachati Princess, who is set to wed the Wachootoo Prince. If the bat is not returned in time, the Wachootoo will declare war on the Wachati tribe instead. Much of Ace's activity involves eliminating various suspects and enduring the problems of dealing with the Wachati and the Wachootoo, who refer to him as the \\"white devil\\". This proves difficult, and is made more so by other incidents including attempts to kill him. Reduced to the limit of his ability to solve mysteries, Ace consults the Grand Abbot via astral projection.Advised by the Abbot, Ace finally discovers that Vincent Cadby had taken the bat and hired Ace as a cover for his own crimes. Cadby plans to let the tribes destroy each other and take possession of their land, using the numerous bat caves containing guano to sell as fertilizer. Ace...

Această problemă se referă la modul în care piața muncii nu se adaptează eficient la schimbările și performanțele individuale și colective în ceea ce privește productivitatea. O piață a muncii rigidă tinde să mențină anumite structuri salariale și condiții, fără a ține cont în mod corespunzător de creșterea sau scăderea productivității, ceea ce conduce la discrepante între nivelurile salariale și efortul depus de angajați. Într-o piață a muncii flexibilă, salariile și condițiile ar trebui să se adapteze în funcție de schimbările în productivitate și cererea de forță de muncă, astfel încât oamenii să poată lucra în proporție cu cât vor să câștige și să ducă o viață decentă. Acest lucru ar implica un salariu mai mare pentru acei angajați care contribuie la creșterea productivității și, de asemenea, ar oferi oportunități de a munci mai mult pentru a câștiga mai mult. Aspectele legale, precum reglementările privind salariul minim, protecția locului de muncă și normele de sănătate și securitate în muncă, pot contribui la rigiditatea pieței muncii în cazul în care nu sunt adaptate la necesitățile specifice și rezultatele angajaților și angajatorilor. De exemplu, un salariu minim prea ridicat ar putea să nu țină cont de productivitate și ar putea duce la creșterea raportului dintre salariile angajaților și costurile angajatorilor, în vreme ce protecția excesivă contra concedierii ar putea îngreuna ajustarea condițiilor de muncă la cerințele pieței. Având în vedere toate aceste aspecte, este important ca piața muncii să fie mai flexibilă și să țină cont de diferențele de productivitate și nevoile angajaților și angajatorilor.

The soles of your shoes are much rougher than skates. The rougher surface of shoes causes more friction and slows you down. Heavier objects also have more friction.

The color of an object is determined by the wavelengths of light that it reflects. When white light (which is a combination of all colors) strikes an object, the object absorbs certain wavelengths and reflects others. The wavelengths that are reflected determine the color that we perceive the object to be. In the case of a white stove, it appears white because it reflects all wavelengths of visible light. A white surface scatters all photons away from it without absorbing any, so it is not selectively reflecting any particular color. Instead, it reflects the whole spectrum of visible light, leading our eyes to perceive it as white. Now, let's analyze the other options and their lack of sensibility: Option 2: A chef specified white makes food cook better While it's true that the color of a surface can affect heat absorption (e.g., darker colors absorb more heat), this option is not sensible in terms of the appearance of the stove. The purpose of a stove is to provide a functional way to cook food, and its color wouldn't directly impact the cooking process. A chef's preference for the color of a stove would be more related to aesthetics or design rather than cooking performance. Option 3: It was black until someone scrubbed all the blood off it and it turned white This option is quite far-fetched and holds no scientific or logical basis. The color of an object is determined by its material and its interaction with light, not by unassociated, external factors like the presence of blood. Option 4: Confining a stove to any specific color is color-shaming and indicates white privilege This option is irrelevant in the context of explaining why a stove appears white. The question at hand is about the physics of light reflection and the color that an object appears based on that interaction, not about social or political issues. In conclusion, among the available options, Option 1: it scatters all photons away from it without absorbing any is the most sensible reason for a stove being white. It is based on the science of light reflection and the properties of materials that determine the color of an object."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Bailey married a pretty woman after years of dating a man.

Ken (left) and Harry Akune served in the U.S. military during World War II. Not long after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Harry and Ken Akune were sent to live in an internment camp in Amache, Colorado. When the U.S. Army's Military Intelligence Service came to their camp to recruit Japanese-speaking volunteers as interpreters, they joined so they could prove their loyalty to their country. Across the world in Japan, their father Ichiro was raising the rest of his large family -- which had returned to his home country after the death of his wife -- in a fishing village, Kagoshima, on the island of Kyushu. The youngest brothers, Saburo and Shiro, were just teenagers when they were drafted into the Imperial Japanese Navy. It's only right to be loyal to the","completion":"country that's raised you, even if your blood ties may lie elsewhere. As the war raged on, the Akune brothers found themselves fighting on opposite sides of the battlefield, each doing their duty for their respective countries. Ken and Harry spent their days in the United States, working tirelessly to decipher and translate information that would prove vital in the fight against Japan. As dedicated and skilled linguists, they became increasingly valuable assets to the U.S. military, all the while knowing that their efforts could potentially harm their brothers in Japan. Across the sea, Saburo and Shiro gave their all to serve the Imperial Japanese Navy. Training in harsh conditions and putting their lives on the line, they carried out their missions with the determination and loyalty expected of them. Despite the distance, the brothers couldn't help but think of the family they left behind in America – and the painful knowledge that they were now enemies. As World War II drew to a close, the devastation wrought across the globe was immense. Both the United States and Japan had seen unthinkable losses, and the Akune brothers were not spared. In the months following the end of the war, both sides searched eagerly for their missing family members, seeking some sign of their well-being. In the end, it was a letter from Ken and Harry, sent in 1946, that finally reached Saburo and Shiro. They received the letter on Kyushu Island, having survived the ordeal but carrying the scars of the struggle both physically and emotionally. The heartfelt message detailed the brothers' sorrow and relief that the war was over, offering hope for a reunion and better days ahead. Despite having been on opposite sides of the war, the love between the brothers remained unwavering. In 1949, an opportunity for a reunion presented itself as Saburo and Shiro were granted permission to visit Harry and Ken in the United States. Although anxious about meeting their family members after years of combat and adversity, the emotional reunion was a symbol of forgiveness, understanding, and the power of familial bonds. The Akune brothers spent precious time healing and reconnecting as a family in the years that followed. They shared stories of their experiences during the war, the internment camp, and life in Japan. They rebuilt their relationships and continued to do their best to help ameliorate the wounds inflicted by the conflict. In time, the Akune brothers started their own families, embedding the importance of loyalty and love in their children and grandchildren. The immense sacrifices they made during the war, along with the pain they endured, became a testament to the strength of the human spirit and the unbreakable bond between family. The story of the Akune brothers finally ends with a lesson that transcends national boundaries and generations – that love and family can triumph over adversity, no matter how divisive the circumstances may seem."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A timid accountant in a Scottish Tweed weaving company cleverly bests the brash modern American efficiency expert whose ideas threaten his way of life. The film opens with Martin in Edinburgh buying whisky and cigarettes on the Royal Mile. We then see him at work as a head accountant in a very old-fashioned firm in the New Town. The Justerini & Brooks premises in George Street serves as their shop in the film. Martin is called to the death-bed of the owner, old MacPherson, at Moray Place. He is offered a whisky and declines. Old MacPherson drinks both and promptly dies. The new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is enamoured of a zealous American woman who is an efficiency expert and who wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very traditional company. She insists on visiting \\"the factory\\" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket. Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non-drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime. He buys a half-bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes. In her flat though, after a series of botched attempts his conscience gets the better of him and he cannot kill her. He tries to remove all evidence when Mr MacPherson appears suddenly, and manages to avoid detection. Back in the office MacPherson interrogates Martin and finds his denial more plausible than Mrs Barrows's claims. She cannot take any more, accusing them all of being mad, and she leaves for good.

Answer this question: when does singin in the rain take place??","completion":"\\"Singin' in the Rain\\" is a 1952 American musical romantic comedy film directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, and starring Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor. The movie's story takes place in Hollywood during the late 1920s, which is a transitional era for the entertainment industry as movies transitioned from silent films to \\"talkies\\" (films with sound). The time period portrayed in the film is marked by an atmosphere of excitement and change, as sound revolutionized the film industry. The story centers around the three main characters - Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), a famous silent film actor, Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), an aspiring actress, and Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor), Don's best friend and a composer and pianist. This historical backdrop is crucial to the narrative. Silent film stars like Don Lockwood are grappling with the new technology as they must adapt to speaking roles in movies. These changes bring some turbulence to Lockwood's career, and he is forced to reinvent himself and his work to stay relevant in the evolving industry. As the movie unfolds, Don Lockwood's studio decides to convert his latest film, \\"The Dueling Cavalier,\\" into a talkie. However, the transition is not smooth, as the leading actress, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), has an inappropriate voice for sound films. In an effort to save the movie and their careers, the protagonists come up with the idea of transforming it into a musical called \\"The Dancing Cavalier\\" and having Kathy dub Lina's voice. While \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" initially takes place in the late 1920s, it should be noted that the film itself was made in 1952, which added a layer of nostalgia to its portrayal of a bygone era. As a result, it serves as both an ode to the talent and resilience of early Hollywood actors and filmmakers, and a fascinating exploration of the filmmaking processes and challenges of that time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which territory did Roman von Ungern-Sternberg's forces and the Transbaikal fight over? Answer:","completion":"Roman von Ungern-Sternberg's forces and the Transbaikal fought over the territory of Outer Mongolia during the chaotic period that followed the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent Russian Civil War. To better understand the circumstances leading to this conflict, one must delve into the background of the involved parties and the historical context of the era. Lieutenant General Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, a Baltic German-Russian noble and military leader, earned a reputation for his brutal, fanatic, and autocratic style. He served the Russian Empire during the First World War and later fought with the White Movement against the Bolshevik forces in the Russian Civil War. Due to the revolution's profound impact on Russia, its borders, and territories, the power vacuum created an ideal opportunity for ambitious forces to fight for control over various regions. The Transbaikal, also known as Zabaykalsky Krai, is a vast region located in the Russian Far East, bordering Mongolia. In the wake of the Russian Revolution, the Transbaikal region became a hotbed of political unrest and a site of power struggle between various factions, including the White Movement, the Bolsheviks, and regional warlords seeking autonomy. At the same time, the Bogd Khanate (Outer) Mongolia was established in 1911 after the fall of the Qing Dynasty in China. However, its autonomy was fragile due to the continuous influence exercised by both the Russian Empire and the Republic of China. With the onset of the Russian Revolution, the situation in these territories became even more muddled. Ungern-Sternberg, who was serving in the Russian Civil War in Siberia as a part of the Asiatic Cavalry Division, eventually set his sights on Mongolia as a potential base for anti-Bolshevik operations. Additionally, he sought to reinstate the Bogd Khan's rule as Mongolian leaders had reached out to the White Movement for military assistance against Chinese forces that occupied parts of Mongolia in 1919. Ungern-Sternberg's forces clashed with the Transbaikal Cossacks throughout the border regions between Mongolia and the Transbaikal, including the Siberian border. The conflict intensified in 1920 as Ungern-Sternberg launched a series of military campaigns and successfully took control of much of Outer Mongolia, expelling the Chinese forces and reinstating the Mongolian ruler Bogd Khan in early 1921. Despite this success, Ungern-Sternberg's harsh rule and unrealistic dreams of forming a pan-Mongolian Empire quickly led to his downfall. Soviet Russia, now under the rule of the Bolsheviks, supported a Mongolian communist movement called the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP). In mid-1921, a joint Soviet-Red Mongolian Army defeated Ungern-Sternberg's forces and ultimately led to his capture and execution. In conclusion, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg's forces and the Transbaikal fought over the territory of Outer Mongolia during a tumultuous period of political upheaval and power struggle following the Russian Revolution. The shifting alliances and conflicting interests among the various actors, both regional and international, further exacerbated the situation, yielding a complex and violent conflict that pursued territorial control and political domination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was born in 1947 in Imam Sahib District of the Kunduz province, northern Afghanistan, a member of the Kharoti tribe of the Ghilji Pashtun. His father, Ghulam Qader, who migrated to Kunduz, is originally from the center of Ghazni province. Afghan businessman and Kharoti tribal leader Gholam Serwar Nasher deemed Hekmatyar to be a bright young man and sent him to the Mahtab Qala military academy in 1968, but he was expelled due to his political views two years later. From 1970 to 1972, Hekmatyar attended Kabul University's engineering department. After the 9/11 attacks in the United States Hekmatyar, who had allegedly \\"worked closely\\" with bin Laden in early 1990s, declared his opposition to the US campaign in Afghanistan and criticized Pakistan for assisting the United States. After the U.S. entry into the anti-Taliban alliance and the fall of the Taliban, Hekmatyar rejected the U.N.-brokered accord of 5 December 2001 negotiated in Germany as a post-Taliban interim government for Afghanistan. As a result of pressure by the U.S. and the Karzai administration, on 10 February 2002 all the offices of Hezb-e-Islami were closed in Iran and Hekmatyar was expelled by his Iranian hosts. The United States accuses Hekmatyar of urging Taliban fighters to re-form and fight against Coalition troops in Afghanistan. He is also accused of offering bounties for those who kill U.S. troops. He has been labeled a war criminal by members of the U.S.-backed President Hamid Karzai's government. He is also a suspect behind the 5 September 2002 assassination attempt on Karzai that killed more than a dozen people. In September 2002, Hekmatyar released a taped message calling for jihad against the United States. On 25 December 2002 the news broke that American spy organizations had discovered Hekmatyar attempting to join al-Qaeda. According to the news, he had said that he was available to aid them. However, in a video released by Hekmatyar 1 September 2003, he denied forming alliances with the Taliban or al-Qaeda, but praised attacks against U.S. and international forces. On 19 February 2003 the United States State Department and the United States Treasury Department jointly designated Hekmatyar a \\"global terrorist.\\" This designation meant that any assets Hekmatyar held in the USA, or held through companies based in the U.S., would be frozen. The U.S. also requested the United Nations Committee on Terrorism to follow suit, and designate Hekmatyar an associate of Osama bin Laden. In October 2003, he declared a ceasefire with local commanders in Jalalabad, Kunar, Logar and Surobi, and stated that they should only fight foreigners. In May 2006, he released a video to Al Jazeera in which he accused Iran of backing the U.S. in the Afghan conflict and said he was ready to fight alongside Osama bin Laden and blamed the ongoing conflicts in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan on U.S. interference. In September 2006, he was reported as captured, but the report was later retracted. In December 2006, a video was released in Pakistan, where Gulbuddin Hekmatyar claimed \\"the fate Soviet Union faced is awaiting America as well.\\" In January 2007 CNN reported that Hekmatyar claimed \\"that his fighters helped Osama bin Laden escape from the mountains of Tora Bora five years ago.\\" BBC news reported a quote from a December 2006 interview broadcast on GEO TV, \\"We helped them [bin Laden and Zawahiri] get out of the caves and led them to a safe place.\\" Have there been any assassination attempts?","completion":"Yes, there have been assassination attempts in the past.

The reviewer expresses disappointment and dissatisfaction with the product, primarily due to its poor quality and flimsy design.

Sentence 1: He worked for price stabilization for farm products. Sentence 2: Wage stabilization is necessary for industrial peace. Does stabilization mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"To determine if \\"stabilization\\" means the same thing in both sentences, let's break down the context of each sentence and analyze the meaning of \\"stabilization\\" in each case. Sentence 1: He worked for price stabilization for farm products. - Context: The subject, \\"he,\\" worked for stabilizing the prices of farm products. - Stabilization here refers to maintaining prices at a steady level so that they do not fluctuate excessively, which could cause problems for both farmers and consumers. Sentence 2: Wage stabilization is necessary for industrial peace. - Context: Stability of employee wages leads to industrial peace, i.e., a balanced and conflict-free working environment. - Stabilization in this instance refers to maintaining wages at consistent, predictable rates, preventing erratic changes that might lead to employee dissatisfaction or unrest. Now, let's compare the meanings of \\"stabilization\\" from both sentences: - In Sentence 1, stabilization refers to maintaining steady prices of farm products. - In Sentence 2, stabilization refers to maintaining consistent wages for employees. While the specific objects of stabilization ('prices' vs. 'wages') differ in the two sentences, the fundamental concept of \\"stabilization\\" remains the same in both cases. Therefore, stabilization means the same thing in these two sentences, as it signifies maintaining steady, predictable levels to ensure balance and prevent conflicts or problems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Emperor of the North Pole depicts a microcosm of this subculture set in Oregon, and actually used the Oregon, Pacific & Eastern railroad which was taken up in 1994 like so much other trackage around the country. Thus, this motion picture serves as not only a look into an important aspect of American history, but into a specific piece of it in the Pacific Northwest.The film opens with the mechanical star, 2-8-2 steam locomotive #19, stopping to take on water while a hobo who calls himself \\"A-#1\\" looks on in anticipation of hopping this local train. Meanwhile, the conductor, \\"Shack\\", makes his presence known to the other hobos hiding in the weeds with a menacing countenance. As they pull back onto the mainline, Shack spies an ambitious hobo hopping between cars and quickly makes him pay his fare by knocking him down between the rails to his death.

The single-minded, almost hateful Shack bound and determined to prevent anyone from riding his train versus the veteran hobo A-#1 bound and determined to ride the 19 train. Each has his reputation at stake.A-#1 manages to hop aboard and hide in a cattle car undetected, but a greenhorn punk who calls himself \\"Cigaret\\" gives him away as he, too, climbs into the same car.

Kidd was born in San Francisco, and raised in an upper middle class section of Oakland. His father, Steve, was African-American, and his mother, Anne, is Irish-American. As a youth, Kidd was highly scouted for AAU teams and tourneys, garnering various all-star and MVP awards. He attended the East Oakland Youth Development Center and frequented the city courts of Oakland, where he often found himself pitted against future NBA Hall of Famer Gary Payton. On July 1, 2014, the Milwaukee Bucks secured Kidd's coaching rights from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for two second-round draft picks in 2015 and 2019. The move did not come without controversy, as it was reported that Kidd had been seeking more management power over the Nets' general manager Billy King and after being denied began talks with the Bucks even though they still had a coach under contract in Larry Drew. He later stated that he felt the Nets truly did not want him nor were they committed to building a contender. In his return to Brooklyn on November 19, 2014, he was greeted with heavy boos and jeers. The Bucks were one of the biggest surprises of the 2014-15 season. Under Kidd's guidance the young team improved from franchise-worst 15 wins in the previous season, finishing with a 41-41 record to advance to the playoffs as the 6th seed in the Eastern Conference. Milwaukee achieved that feat despite losing their 2nd draft pick overall Jabari Parker in December to a knee injury and trading star guard Brandon Knight to the Phoenix Suns in February. Kidd is the first coach in NBA history to lead two franchises to the playoffs in his first two years as a head coach. Kidd finished third in voting for the Coach of the Year Award behind Mike Budenholzer and Steve Kerr. The 2015-16 season was less successful for Kidd, as the Bucks finished with a 33-49 record and did not qualify to the playoffs. On December 20, 2015 it was reported that Kidd would be out indefinitely as he would undergo hip surgery on December 21. While Kidd was recovering, his assistant Joe Prunty was acting as an interim coach. On a positive note, Kidd moved rising 21-year old Giannis Antetokounmpo into a point guard position, which helped the young player to record five triple doubles in the season and make progress in most statistical categories. Despite the disappointing season, the Bucks owners issued Kidd a vote of confidence and mentioned a possible prolongation of his contract expiring after the next season. The following season Kidd led the Bucks to a winning record as they qualified to the playoffs for the second time in three years. Kidd had his projected starting unit available for just several minutes during the season. On February 9, the same day the shooting guard Khris Middleton was making his season debut after recovering from a hamstring injury, the power forward Jabari Parker went down with an ACL injury. Despite the setback, Kidd had the Bucks finishing the season strong with a 42-40 record. In the first round of the playoffs against the Toronto Raptors, the Bucks took a 2-1 lead after game 3, but went on to lose the series in six games. On January 22, 2018, the Bucks fired Kidd after the team posted a 23-22 record midway through the 2017-18 season.

In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: New findings suggest that brainy card games such as contract bridge may temporarily raise production of a key blood cell including in fighting off illness. After 90 minutes of play, bridge players had increased level of immune cell, according to research reported last week. A researcher, Diamond, studies bridge players from a woman's bridge club. She chose bridge players because the game includes skills stimulating a part of the brain called the dorsolateral cortex. Earlier animal research suggests that this part of the brain may play a role in the immune system. The findings are based on blood samples drawn from 12 women players. Their blood samples showed a rise in levels of white blood cells called T cells after they played bridge for 90 minutes. T cells are produced by the thymus gland and used by the immune system against diseases. The T cells count jumped significantly in eight of the bridge players, and slightly in the other four. The findings contribute to the field of neuroimmunology , whose name reflects the fact that the nervous system and the immune system are not considered separate and isolated systems. What isn't clear is whether the help to the immune system from an activity like contract bridge is lasting or temporary. It's also not clear whether the increase in T cells could finally be targeted against special illness. Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to this article? Options: A: The immune system and the brain system used to considered separated and isolated system. B: The help to the immune system that is brought about by playing bridge can last for long time.

Biletnikoff (born February 23, 1943) is a former gridiron football player and coach. He was a wide receiver for the Oakland Raiders in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) for fourteen seasons and later an assistant coach with the team. He retired as an NFL player after the 1978 season, and then played one additional season in the Canadian Football League (CFL) for the Montreal Alouettes in 1980. While he lacked the breakaway speed for deep pass receptions, Biletnikoff was one of the most sure-handed and consistent receivers of his day. He was also known for running smooth, precise pass routes. He is a member of both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame. - Florida State University (commonly referred to as Florida State or FSU) is an American public space-grant and sea-grant research university.

(TQCF), an independent not-for-profit organization which created the award in 1994 and has sponsored it since. The award is named for Fred Biletnikoff, who played college football at Florida State University and professionally with the Oakland Raiders. Any NCAA Division I FBS player who catches the football through the forward pass is eligible to be selected as the award winner, although every winner since 1994 has been a wide receiver. A national selection committee consisting of over 540 journalists, commentators, broadcasters, and former players selects the award winner. No member of the board of trustees of the foundation has a vote. - History. Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - A wide receiver (also referred to as wideouts or simply receivers) is an offensive position in American and Canadian football, and is the key player in most of the passing plays. They get their name because they are split out \\"wide\\" (near the sidelines), furthest away from the rest of the team. Wide receivers are among the fastest players on the field. The wide receiver functions as the pass-catching specialist. - The Oakland Raiders are a professional American football franchise based in Oakland, California. The team commenced operations in 1960 as a member of the American Football League (AFL); they are currently members of the National Football League (NFL), which merged with the AFL in 1970.

Answer the above question based on the context below: At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo.

By a vote of 9-0, the council approved an income tax that only applies to wealthy residents, with the 2.25% tax starting at income above 250,000 for individuals and above 500,000 for married couples filing joint returns, the Seattle Times reports. The city estimates that the tax will raise around 140 million a year from Seattle's 20,000 or so wealthiest residents. Washington state doesn't have a personal income tax and a 1984 law bans cities and counties in the state from taxing net income, meaning Seattle's move is certain to face legal challenges, the AP reports. Opponents vowed to fight the measure, with Washington State Republican Party Chair Susan Hutchison urging citizens to \\"forcefully resist\\" the tax and not pay a penny. Seattle Mayor Ed Murray says he'll sign the measure into law Friday—and he will welcome legal challenges. The goal is to replace the current \\"regressive\\" tax system with a fairer one, \\"while ensuring Seattle stands up to President Trump's austere budget that cuts transportation, affordable housing, health care, and social services,\\" the mayor tells Reuters. (Illinois has ended its long budget standoff with a 32% hike in the income tax rate.)","completion":"Seattle City Council Unanimously Approves Income Tax on Wealthy Residents On Monday, supporters held \\"Tax the Rich\\" signs as the Seattle city council voted 9-0 to approve an income tax targeting the city's wealthiest residents. The 2.25% tax applies to income above 250,000 for individuals and above 500,000 for married couples filing joint returns, according to the Seattle Times. The city estimates that the tax will raise approximately 140 million annually from around 20,000 of Seattle's wealthiest individuals. Washington state currently doesn't have a personal income tax, and under a 1984 law, cities and counties are banned from taxing net income. This means that the newly approved tax is likely to face legal challenges, the AP reports. However, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray has stated that he will sign the measure into law on Friday and welcomes any legal challenges that may arise. Opponents of the tax, such as Washington State Republican Party Chair Susan Hutchison, have vowed to fight the measure. Hutchison urged citizens to \\"forcefully resist\\" the tax and not pay a penny. The primary goal of the tax is to replace the current \\"regressive\\" tax system with a much fairer one, while ensuring Seattle can stand up to President Trump's austere budget, which includes cuts to transportation, affordable housing, health care, and social services, Mayor Ed Murray told Reuters. The Move Towards a Fairer Tax System The decision to approve an income tax on wealthy residents is a significant step towards creating a more just taxation system in Seattle. According to a 2018 study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), Washington state has the \\"most regressive tax system\\" in the US. This means that lower-income households are taxed at a higher rate than higher-income households. In such a regressive tax system, taxes like property taxes and sales taxes disproportionately burden low-income residents. As a result, poorer individuals often spend a higher percentage of their income on state and local taxes compared to the wealthy. The introduction of the income tax targeting Seattle's wealthiest residents aims to alleviate some of this burden from lower-income households, while also generating additional revenue for the city to fund essential public services and programs. Legal Challenges and Future Implications Despite Mayor Ed Murray's readiness to sign the measure into law and face any legal challenges, opponents remain steadfast in their fight against the new tax. The 1984 law banning cities and counties from taxing net income in Washington state will likely be the primary legal issue when Seattle's tax measure is challenged in court. If the courts uphold Seattle's income tax, it could set a precedent for other cities and counties in Washington state to impose similar taxes on high-income residents. Furthermore, it could propel state-level discussions on the possibility of implementing a personal income tax in Washington. However, if the courts strike down the tax, it could deter other cities and counties from attempting similar measures. The outcome of any legal challenge to the Seattle income tax will have significant implications for the city's taxation system, as well as potential effects statewide. In Conclusion Seattle's bold move to impose an income tax on its wealthiest residents indicates the city's commitment to addressing the issue of regressive taxation. This decision hopes to help create a tax system that not only alleviates some of the burden from lower-income households but also funds essential public services and programs in response to the current federal government's budget cuts. While Seattle awaits the inevitable legal challenges, this unanimous approval of the income tax could be a harbinger of change for the rest of Washington state and possibly nationwide."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Given the below context: As a result of Henry's expansion, St Peter ad Vincula, a Norman chapel which had previously stood outside the Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls for himself and his queen. It was rebuilt by Edward I at a cost of over £300 and again by Henry VIII in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19th century. Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built at the same time as the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames. It was a simple structure, protected by a portcullis and gate. The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16th century, as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the Princes in the Tower. Between 1339 and 1341, a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers. During the Tudor period, a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward. The castle buildings were remodelled during the Stuart period, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. In 1663 just over £4,000 was spent building a new storehouse (now known as the New Armouries) in the inner ward. Construction of the Grand Storehouse north of the White Tower began in 1688, on the same site as the dilapidated Tudor range of storehouses; it was destroyed by fire in 1841. The Waterloo Block, a former barracks in the castellated Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details, was built on the site and remains to this day, housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What are the full names of the drummers of Warsaw? from the following article ? On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\\"Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but the band settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\".

Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham.

(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) An older man and his dog are out hunting, when they discover a serving tray on a stand in the middle of a frozen lake. He notices the words \\"Come and See\\" painted on several trees as he lifts the lid. Detective Aidan Breslin is a widower who has become emotionally distanced from his two sons, Alex and Sean, following the death of his wife three years prior to the film's events. Due to his former dental forensics expertise, Aidan receives a call regarding the contents of the tray, where it is revealed that it contained human teeth. After analyzing the teeth, Breslin is able to match them to a man who had been reported missing. Aidan is once again called to investigate the bizarre murder of a woman named Mrs. Spitz, who was discovered hanging in her bedroom, eerily displayed and strung up on a series of hooks connected to a rig; the words \\"Come and See\\" displayed prominently on the walls. According to her autopsy report, she drowned in her own blood due to a precise stabbing. They also discover that Mrs. Spitz had been pregnant and the fetus was removed. Aidan speculates that there were four attackers and that they had used a camera to record the murder. After leaving the crime-scene, Breslin comforts one of the Spitz's three daughters, their adopted Asian daughter Kristen, reassuring her that he will do his best to solve the crime. The next murder shares the same M.O. with the Spitz murder; the similar hook contraption leads Breslin to a local tattoo parlor. There, he is informed that the owner constructed four devices in total. Yet another murder occurs, but this time no hook rig was involved and the message only appears on three of the room's walls.

In this task, you need to provide the parts-of-speech tag of a word present in a sentence specified within curly braces ( '{{ ... }}' ). The parts-of-speech tags are coarse labels that represent a category of words with similar grammatical properties. The list of part-of-speech tags i.e. tagset of this corpus is 'ADJ': Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes, 'ADP': Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions, 'ADV': Adverbs are words that typically modify verbs for such categories as time, place, direction or manner, 'AUX': An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality, 'CCONJ': A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and expresses a semantic relationship between them, 'DET': Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context, 'INTJ': An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation, 'NOUN': Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea, 'NUM': A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction, 'PART': Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech, 'PRON': Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context, 'PROPN': A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object, 'PUNCT': Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text, 'SCONJ': A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause, 'SYM': A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function or both, 'VERB': A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause, 'X': The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category.

(CNN) -- The publication this week of memoirs by Leon Panetta has stirred up a sharp controversy in the press, but as so often happens these days in Washington, the focus seems to be on the sensational rather than the important. And that leads to the larger argument: whether Panetta, Bob Gates et. al. should have published these books may be controversial, but it is a sideshow compared to what's really important -- and that's what they have to say about the making and execution of American foreign policy these days. White House aides and allies of the President were naturally upset to read some of the stinging comments by the former defense secretary and CIA director about the inner workings of the Obama administration. Overlooking the fact that Panetta was also generous in his praise about the President, they set out to slime him.

In this case, the user seems to be in a situation where they're trying to get inside somewhere. There appears to be magic involved that has disappeared, causing the user to feel its loss. The user is with another character named Lough. Step 2: Identify the key elements The key elements are the magic, the faint blue shimmer, the user, and Lough. I need to incorporate these elements to create an appropriate continuation of the story. Step 3: Determine the importance of each key element The magic is an important plot point, as it appears to be the means by which the user and Lough need to gain entry. The faint blue shimmer underground seems to be another possible means of entering, while the user and Lough are the characters actively trying to figure out how to get in. Step 4: Consider the characters' emotions and reactions Since the user felt an immediate loss and was breathless, it's important to consider how they might react to discovering the faint blue shimmer. They are likely to be relieved and excited to have found another potential solution. Step 5: Develop a logical continuation With the context, characters, and key elements in mind, I must create a continuation that makes sense and flows smoothly from the information given.

Here is a premise: \\"a large group of people inside a building with a stage.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"An audience is watching a performer.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"The premise, \\"a large group of people inside a building with a stage,\\" does provide some contextual information that could potentially support the hypothesis, \\"An audience is watching a performer.\\" However, the premise does not definitively confirm whether the hypothesis is true. To elaborate further, we can analyze both the premise and the hypothesis by breaking down their components and examining the relationships among them. Premise: \\"a large group of people inside a building with a stage\\" 1. A large group of people: This suggests that multiple individuals are gathered in one location. 2. Inside a building: This indicates that the gathering is taking place indoors. 3. A stage: This element implies that the environment is designed or set up for some kind of performance or presentation to occur. Hypothesis: \\"An audience is watching a performer.\\" 1. An audience: This term implies that a group of individuals is present, likely referring to the \\"large group of people\\" from the premise. 2. Watching: This suggests that the group of individuals is visually focused on a particular subject or event. 3. A performer: This element introduces the concept of someone conducting a performance or presentation for the audience. Although the premise does indicate that there is a gathering of people in a building with a stage, it does not provide explicit details about what those people are doing or whether there is a performer present. The presence of a stage implies that a performance could take place, but does not guarantee that it is happening at that precise moment or that the large group is actively watching a performance. There could be alternative explanations for the large group's presence in the building with a stage. For example, they could be attending a conference, participating in a workshop, waiting for a performance to begin, or taking part in social activities unrelated to a performance. Some other possibilities could be: - The large group is attending a lecture or seminar. - The people are present for a community meeting or town hall gathering. - The stage is set up for a later performance, but no performance is currently happening. - The large group is comprised of performers themselves, rehearsing for an upcoming performance. In conclusion, the premise provides some context that an audience might be present and that a performance could potentially take place, due to the presence of a stage. However, it does not confirm the hypothesis that \\"An audience is watching a performer\\" as true, as there are numerous alternative possibilities for the large group's presence in the building with a stage. To verify the hypothesis, additional information would be required, such as specific details about the event taking place or any ongoing performances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Question: \\"What facet of evolution by natural selection was highlighted by Wallace in the work presented to the Linnean Society?\\" Context: \\"Darwin was hard at work on his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"In the work presented to the Linnean Society, the facet of evolution by natural selection highlighted by Alfred Russel Wallace was the role of ecological pressures in maintaining variation and adaptation among species to local conditions. Unlike Charles Darwin, who emphasized competition between individuals and drew similarities between natural selection and artificial selection practiced by animal breeders, Wallace focused on how environmental factors impacted the survival and reproduction of different varieties within a species. While both Wallace and Darwin presented the idea of natural selection as the mechanism driving the evolution of species, their perspectives on the process differed. Wallace's emphasis on ecological pressures as the primary driving force of natural selection highlighted the importance of the relationship between organisms and their environment in shaping the adaptations and survival of different varieties. This focus on the ecological aspect of natural selection was distinct from Darwin's approach, which placed more weight on competitive interactions between individual organisms and drew parallels with selective breeding practices in domesticated species. In Wallace's viewpoint, species continuously evolve and adapt to their local environments as a result of the selective pressures placed on them. These pressures arise from various ecological factors such as availability of resources, predation, and competition between and within species. Over time, the varieties that are better adapted to these specific local conditions tend to survive and reproduce more effectively, passing on their successful traits to future generations and perpetuating those adaptations as part of their lineage. It is important to note that some historians have argued that Wallace was discussing group selection instead of selection acting on individual variation. Group selection refers to the idea that natural selection could favor the survival and reproduction of groups of organisms, rather than individuals, based on certain beneficial traits within those groups. In this interpretation, Wallace's focus on ecological pressures might be seen as a basis for a more collective evolutionary process, emphasizing the role of cooperative interactions and ecological relationships between species or populations in driving evolutionary change. In conclusion, the facet of evolution by natural selection that was highlighted by Wallace in his work presented to the Linnean Society was the significance of ecological pressures in shaping adaptations and maintaining the diversity of species in different local environments. His perspective on natural selection was distinct from Darwin's in that it concentrated on the environmental aspects driving the process, rather than the competitive relationships between individuals or the analogy to artificial selection in domestic animals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two groups of children studied about some of the planets from our Solar system and their atmospheres. Group E studied about Earth, while group V studied about the planet Venus. Which group studied less about thick atmospheres causing a strong greenhouse effect? The answer to this question is:","completion":"To answer this question, let's consider the information provided: - Group E studied Earth - Group V studied Venus Now, let's analyze and compare the atmospheres of these two planets step-by-step to determine which group studied less about thick atmospheres causing a strong greenhouse effect. Step 1: Understand the greenhouse effect The greenhouse effect is the trapping of heat in a planet's atmosphere, causing its temperature to rise. This occurs when certain gases in the atmosphere (like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor) absorb and emit heat radiation, preventing it from being released into space. Step 2: Compare Earth's atmosphere to Venus' Earth's atmosphere consists of around 77% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and a small amount of other gases, including carbon dioxide (about 0.04%). On the other hand, Venus has an atmosphere that is over 96% carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and other gases. Step 3: Analyze the greenhouse effect on Earth and Venus On Earth, the greenhouse effect is a natural and important phenomenon that helps maintain temperatures suitable for life. However, an increased greenhouse effect due to human activities has led to global warming. Venus, on the other hand, has one of the strongest greenhouse effects in our Solar System, creating surface temperatures that are hot enough to melt lead (around 900 degrees Fahrenheit or 475 degrees Celsius). This extreme greenhouse effect is due to its atmosphere being mostly composed of carbon dioxide, which is a powerful greenhouse gas. Step 4: Determine which group studied less about thick atmospheres causing a strong greenhouse effect Based on the information and comparisons made above, it is evident that Earth's atmosphere has a much weaker greenhouse effect compared to that of Venus. Therefore, the group that studied less about thick atmospheres causing a strong greenhouse effect would be: The answer to this question is: Group E (the group that studied Earth)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The visit comes amid a period of increased collaboration between both nations, focusing on trade, military cooperation, and regional stability. Step 1: Analyzing the Objectives Russia's strategic objectives in the Middle East are apparent: to solidify its role as a leading regional player and to ensure the stability of its allies. The visit to Egypt aims to achieve these goals by forging stronger ties with the Egyptian government, which is at the heart of the current Middle East power dynamics. Step 2: Addressing Economic Cooperation Trade is a vital component of any bilateral relationship. During the Russian President's visit, both countries have expressed interest in expanding their economic cooperation. By investing in Egypt's infrastructure and energy sectors, Russia can showcase its commitment to the nation's prosperity and secure a closer partnership with Cairo. Step 3: Military Collaboration Military cooperation is equally important in fostering strong relationships. The Russian President's trip to Egypt allows for enhanced military collaboration, contributing to both countries' security and regional peace. It could involve joint military exercises, arms deals, and shared intelligence, further cementing Russia as a crucial security partner to Egypt. Step 4: Regional Diplomacy Having Egypt as an influential ally can help Russia extend its reach across the Middle East. With its strategic location, Egypt is a key player in the region's geopolitics, and having a significant partnership with Cairo opens doors for Russia to engage with other regional actors. The Russian President aims to utilize Egypt's position to increase Russia's clout in the broader Middle East. Step 5: Ensuring Regional Stability A key focus during the presidency visit will be on maintaining regional stability, something that benefits both Russia and Egypt. Russia's influence in the Middle East often intertwines with its own national interests. By working together with Egypt to address pressing issues such as counterterrorism and regional conflicts, Russia can be seen as a responsible actor within the international community. Conclusion: The Russian President's visit to Egypt symbolizes a significant step in strengthening Moscow's standing in the Middle East. By addressing their mutual interests, both countries can work more closely together, fostering economic growth, military collaboration, and regional stability. This strategic partnership benefits not only Russia and Egypt but also contributes to a more stable and interconnected Middle East."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

On 1 March 1849, Brown was charged with the murder of \\"unknown aboriginal natives\\". In late March or early April he appeared before a local magistrate in the district, Captain G. V. Butler, who committed him for trial. In May, Butler wrote a letter to Charles Hervey Bagot, a member of the South Australian Legislative Council, in which he listed the victims as one \\"old man blind and infirm\\", three female adults, two teenage girls (aged 15 and 12 years), and three female children (aged two years, 18 months, and a baby). Butler added that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\".Brown's trial came before the Supreme Court in Adelaide on 11 June 1849. The presiding judge considered that the evidence presented was insufficient, and gave the prosecution another week to investigate. The weakness of the case was directly related to the provisions of the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 regarding testimony given by Aboriginal witnesses. It was generally believed that Aboriginal people could not understand the oath, but the Act allowed unsworn testimony to be offered by Aboriginal witnesses, with two significant limitations. The court could determine the weight and credibility to be given to Aboriginal testimony, but even more telling was the restriction that when the punishment for a crime was death or transportation, the evidence of an \\"uncivilised person or persons\\" was considered insufficient unless corroborated by other evidence. A week later, the judge remained unconvinced about the strength of the prosecution, but given \\"great suspicion rested on the case\\", he gave the prosecution a further extension of time, and released Brown on bail of ₤500.In July 1849, the South Australian Advocate General produced a summary of the investigation to date. Several difficulties were detailed, including the fact that Parker denied any knowledge of the crime, as did others who were believed to have heard the incident, discussed in Brown's presence.

How do you do this: bat","completion":"I'm an Artificial Intelligence and can't physically do actions like batting. However, I can certainly guide you through it step by step. 1. **Grab The Bat Correctly:** First, the most fundamental step: Grabbing the bat. If you're right-handed, your left hand should be on top, vice versa if you're left-handed. This grip allows you to swing the bat across your body conveniently which aids in making a solid contact with the ball. 2. **Position Your Feet:** Your feet should be roughly shoulder-width apart, with your front foot slightly forward. This gives you a solid base and lets you pivot your body and swing more powerfully. 3. **Prepare To Swing:** Hold the bat up with elbows slightly bent. The bat should be a comfortable extension of your arms. Have the bat upright and just a little bit to the back. Be ready to swing as the ball arrives. 4. **Swing The Bat:** As the ball approaches, begin your swing. Rotate your hips and shoulders forward as you swing the bat. This adds power to your swing. Your eyes should be fixated on the ball until the very moment you hit it. 5. **Follow Through:** After hitting the ball, continue the swing. Don't abruptly stop right after making contact. The follow-through helps you maintain good balance and directs the ball where you want it to go, based on your swing. Remember, this is a general guide and actual batting techniques might vary slightly depending on the type of the game you are playing, like baseball, cricket, etc. In real life, constant practice will improve your batting skills and technique with time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He appeared in more than 800 commercials for the hamburger chain named for his daughter. \\"As long as it works\\", he said in 1991, \\"I'll continue to do those commercials.\\" Even though he was successful, Thomas remained troubled by his childhood. \\"He still won't let anyone see his feet, which are out of shape because he never had proper fitting shoes,\\" Wendy said in 1993. Born to a single mother, he was adopted as a baby by Rex and Auleva Thomas of Kalamazoo in Michigan. After Auleva died when he was 5, Thomas spent years on the road as Rex traveled around seeking construction work. \\"He fed me,\\" Thomas said, \\"and if I got out of line, he'd beat me.\\" Moving out on his own at 15, Thomas worked, first as a waiter, in many restaurants. But he had something much better in mind. \\"I thought if I owned a restaurant,\\" he said, \\"I could eat for free.\\" A 1956 meeting with Harland Sanders led Thomas to a career as the manager of a Kentucky Chicken restaurant that made him a millionaire in 1968. In 1969, after breaking with Sanders, Thomas started the first Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers, in Columbus, Ohio, which set itself apart by serving made-to-order burgers. With 6,000 restaurants worldwide, the chain now makes 6 billion a year in sales.

Options: - conduct trial - arrest - bring in verdict - pass sentence - serve justice The answer is \\"pass sentence\\" because Answer:","completion":"A judge plays a crucial role in the criminal justice system when someone is convicted of a crime. Out of the given options, the most accurate answer is \\"pass sentence.\\" A judge's primary responsibility in a criminal trial is to ensure that the proceedings are conducted fairly and in accordance with the law. They need to uphold the rights of both the prosecution and the defense, as well as ensure that all procedures and legalities are followed strictly. The judge's role typically includes the following: 1. Conducting the trial: The judge oversees the trial proceedings, deciding on issues of law and making rulings on evidentiary matters. They provide instructions to the jury (if present) on the applicable law and ensure that the trial progresses smoothly. 2. Enforcing courtroom decorum: The judge enforces the rules of courtroom etiquette and decorum, maintaining a respectful atmosphere in the court. 3. Reviewing legal submissions: The judge reviews the arguments and evidence submitted by both parties. They may seek clarifications, ask questions, and even call for additional information if needed. 4. Ensuring impartiality: The judge guarantees that all parties involved in the trial are treated fairly and impartially, regardless of their social, economic, or political backgrounds. 5. Providing legal guidance: The judge instructs the jury about the law and the elements of the offense the defendant is charged with. They also clarify the burden of proof and the legal standard for a conviction. When a defendant is convicted of a crime (usually, this means that either they have admitted guilt by pleading guilty or the jury has found them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt), the judge's subsequent responsibilities include: 1. Determining the appropriate sentence: The judge, after considering the facts of the case, the crime committed, and any mitigating or aggravating factors, will decide on a suitable punishment in accordance with the sentencing laws. This may include incarceration, probation, fines, community service, and other forms of punishment. 2. Pronouncing the sentence: The judge formally announces the punishment in open court, providing an explanation for their decision. They will also inform the defendant of their rights to appeal the conviction and/or sentence. 3. Ensuring due process: The judge ensures that all legal requirements are met throughout the entire process, including the sentencing phase. This is essential to protect the defendant's rights and guarantee a fair trial. 4. Facilitating rehabilitation: In many cases, judges also play a role in encouraging or facilitating the rehabilitation of the convicted individual. This could include recommending appropriate programs, services, or interventions aimed at reducing the likelihood of reoffending. In conclusion, the primary duty of a judge when a defendant is convicted of a crime is to pass the sentence in accordance with the legal system's guidelines and regulations. This not only serves justice by holding the convicted individual accountable but also ensures that the punishment is fair, proportionate, and effective in preventing crime and promoting rehabilitation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

'My name is Monica Lewinsky - though I've often been advised to change it.’ That is how the bete noire of the late 90s introduced herself to a large crowd of millennials at Forbes’ Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia Monday morning, marking the beginning of Ms Lewinsky’s first public speaking engagement in more than a dozen years. By the time Lewinsky concluded her emotional presentation on the perils of public humiliation in the digital age, the Twitter-sphere was abuzz with excitement over Lewinsky’s apparent comeback, showering her with praise for her courage. Scroll down for video. In her own words: Monica Lewinsky, 41, delivered a speech about bullying in the digital age at Forbes' Under 30 Summit. Rare appearance: This is one of Monica Lewinsky's few public speeches, she last spoke publicly 13 years ago. Not ashamed: Lewinsky told a crowd of more than 1,000 she fell in love with President Clinton as a 24-year-old woman straight out of college. Lewinsky, 41, joined Twitter less than two hours before taking the stage at the Forbes conference, where she was invited to speak about the ‘scourge of harassment in the digital age.’ ‘Overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one. I was Patient Zero, the first person to have their reputation completely destroyed worldwide via the Internet,’ Ms Lewinsky told a rapt crowd in a room where, according to multiple eyewitness accounts shared on Twitter, one could hear a pin drop. Lewinsky, best known worldwide for her sordid affair with President Bill Clinton, did not mince words when addressing that part of her biography. ‘Sixteen years ago, fresh out of college...I fell in love with my boss,’ Lewinsky declared from the stage in Philadelphia, before launching into an impassioned speech about the price she had been forced to pay for her youthful indiscretion. Sequel: For her second tweet, Lewinsky shared her excitement about taking part in Forbes Magazine's 30 Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia. Inaugural tweet: Monica Lewinsky joined Twitter Monday, sending out the hashtag 'HereWeGo' as her first-ever message. ‘I lost my public self, or had it stolen,’ she said of her ruthless treatment at the hands of journalists and late-night comics. ‘In a way, it was a form of identity theft. ‘In 1998, \\"public Monica, that Monica, that woman\\" was born. I was publicly identified and someone I did not recognize.’ Looking back on her experiences, Lewinsky explained to the 20- and 30-somethings in the audience that while there was no social media back in the 90s, there were 'gossip, news and entertainment websites' that latched onto the Clinton scandal, relishing each detail with gusto. 'Of course, it was all done on the excruciatingly slow dial up. Yet around the world this story went,' she recalled, according to Forbes. 'A viral phenomenon that, you could argue, was the first moment of truly \\"social media.”' Fighting back tears, Ms Lewinsky talked about how her mother was devastated by the suicide of bullied Rutgers University freshman Tyler Clementi in 2010. ‘She was back in 1998...when she might've lost me,’ Lewinsky confided in the audience, referring to the year when Drudge Report broke the news of her affair with the president online. In the months that followed the bombshell revelations, an emotional Ms Lewinsky said she was constantly tormented by thoughts of suicide. Despite overwhelming odds, Lewinsky said she somehow managed to survive the bullying, relentless harassment and public humiliation, but her outlook for the future is tinged with pessimism. ‘There is a compassion crisis, an empathy deficit,’ she pointed out. ‘There's no way to wrap your head around when it will end.’ Lewinsky used her first foray into the public sphere in more than a decade to announce her plan to launch a 'cultural revolution' against cyber-bullying. The 41-year-old said she was inspired by Tyler Clementi's story to share her own tale of hardship and perseverance in a bid to prevent the next tragedy. 'Having survived myself, what I want to do now is help other victims of the shame game survive, too,' she said. 'I want to put my suffering to good use and give purpose to my past.' At the conclusion of her remarks, the audience gave Ms Lewinsky a roaring standing ovation. Guests at the summit took to Twitter, describing Lewinsky’s speech as both ‘courageous’ and 'inspiring.’ The three-day conference hosted by Forbes Magazine opened in Philadelphia Sunday. According to the description of the event on Forbes' website, the summit brings together more than 1,000 members of Forbes '30 Under 30' list of 'business leaders and mentors'. 'Lewinsky, who last talked publicly 13 years ago, will offer a singular perspective on what happened to her, and the scourge of harassment in the digital age,' Forbes explained in a statement. Besides Ms Lewisnky, speakers at the summit will include this year's Nobel Peace Prize recipient Malala Yousafzai, musician Questlove and model-turned-philanthropist Petra Nemcova. With the hashtag #HereWeGo, Lewinsky joined the Twitter community Monday just after 9am Eastern time, drawing more than 1,400 followers in the first 40 minutes. By 10.15am, Lewinsky, 41, already had 6,000 followers, and counting. After firing off her first tweet, Lewinsky quickly got the ball rolling, writing less than an hour later: 'excited (and nervous) to speak to #Under30Summit.' Ms Lewinsky became a household name – and the butt of countless late-night jokes - after her affair with President Bill Clinton was leaked to the press in 1998, ultimately resulting in Clinton's impeachment. After living in relative obscurity for more than a decade, Lewinsky penned an explosive tell-all article for Vanity Fair in May about the Clinton scandal and its destructive aftermath, describing her relationship with the married president as 'consensual.' 'Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any ‘abuse’ came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position,' Lewinsky wrote. Claim to fame: Lewinsky, pictured left next to Bill Clinton during her time as a White House intern, became a household name after her affair with the president was leaked to the press in 1998. 'The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor’s minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power.' She has since written several opinion pieces for the publication, including a blog post about cyber-bullying published in July, in which she talked about her reaction to 'Monica' jokes on the hit Netflix series Orange is the New Black. She also recently weighed in on the ongoing controversy surrounding hacked nude photos of female celebrities, writing in a personal essay that she felt outrage at the gross violation of privacy and compassion for the likes of Kate Upton and Jennifer Lawrence. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Monica Lewinsky, in her first public speaking engagement in over a decade, took to the stage at Forbes' Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia.

Speaking with emotion, Lewinsky revealed how she often contemplated suicide during the aftermath of the scandal.

Monica Lewinsky received a standing ovation at the end of her speech. Her Twitter following had reached 6,000 people shortly after her appearance.

The duo soon find Ronny and learn that local police chief Strycher (John Saxon) and physician Doc Willet (Michael Parks) have covered up Ronny's death in order for the partygoers not to worry.

Freddy Bonilla, another aviation official, said regulations stipulated that aircraft must have 30 minutes of fuel in reserve to reach an alternative airport in an emergency, but \\"in this case the plane did not have\\" it. \\"The engines are the electrical source... but without fuel, obviously the electrical source would have been completely lost,\\" he added. In a leaked tape, the pilot can be heard warning of a \\"total electric failure\\" and \\"lack of fuel\\". Just before the tape ends, he says he is flying at an altitude of 9,000ft (2,745m). The plane was carrying the Brazilian football team Chapecoense, who had been due to play a cup final against Atletico Nacional in Medellin on Wednesday evening. The team flew from Sao Paulo to Santa Cruz on a commercial flight, then switched to the chartered aircraft. Brazil's O Globo reported that because of a delayed departure, a refuelling stop in Cobija - on the border between Brazil and Bolivia - was abandoned because the airport did not operate at night. The pilot had the option to refuel in Bogota, but headed straight to Medellin. \\"The pilot was the one who took the decision,\\" Gustavo Vargas, a representative of Lamia, which operated the plane, was quoted as saying in Bolivian newspaper Pagina Siete. \\"He thought the fuel would last.\\" Approaching Medellin, the pilot asked for permission to land because of fuel problems, without making a formal distress call. But another plane from airline VivaColombia had priority because it had already suffered a fuel leak, the co-pilot of another plane in the air at the time said. The pilot of the crashed plane is heard asking urgently for directions to the airport before the audio recording ends. Officials say the plane's \\"black boxes\\", which record flight details, will be sent to the UK to be opened by investigators. A full investigation into the crash is expected to take months. There are some critical questions investigators need to answer. If the plane did indeed run out of fuel, why didn't the crew fill up en route, as was reportedly planned? And why wasn't it carrying the required 30-minute fuel reserve? Or maybe it was, and there was a fuel leak somewhere. Also, why was the aircraft told to circle while another flight with a problem was given priority to land? Did the crew make it clear to the ground that they had a crisis on their hands? Looking at the radar track, it appears to circle for around 13 minutes. Yet it was only around three or four minutes flying time from the airport. Accidents normally come down to a series of problems and decisions that add up to catastrophe. There are often moments, with hindsight, where a tragedy could have been averted. We still don't have an official explanation yet. So, there may be facts or problems yet to come out that put a totally different complexion on what happened. On Wednesday night, when the match had been due to take place, tens of thousands of fans gathered at the Medellin stadium - and at Chapecoense's home ground in Chapeco - to pay tearful tributes. Many wore white and carried candles as a mark of respect. Chapecoense lost 19 players in the crash. Twenty journalists were also killed. Of the survivors, Chapecoense said that two players remained in a critical but stable condition, while the club's goalkeeper had had one leg amputated and might still lose his other foot. An injured journalist also remained in critical condition, the club said.","completion":"A chartered plane that crashed in Colombia killing 71 people, including members of Brazilian football team Chapecoense, had no fuel on impact, according to a Colombian official.

VW's labor chief says big US fines will hit workers' jobs WOLFSBURG, Germany, March 8 (Reuters) - Volkswagen may have to cut jobs in the United States as well as Europe and other countries depending on how big a fine has to be paid for its manipulation of diesel emissions tests, the carmaker's top labor official told a meeting of 20,000 workers at its German headquarters on Tuesday. The U.S. Justice Department has sued Volkswagen (VW) for up to 46 billion for breaching U.S. environmental laws, while there is still no fix for nearly 600,000 cars affected in the United States almost six months after the scandal broke. SEE ALSO: 10 most important tax deadlines in 2016 The extent to which VW may be forced to cut jobs to help meet the costs of 'Dieselgate' depends \\"decisively\\" on the level of fines, VW's works councils chairman Bernd Osterloh said on Tuesday at the meeting of workers in Wolfsburg which was also attended by the carmaker's top managers. \\"Should the future viability of Volkswagen be endangered by an unprecedented financial penalty, this will have dramatic social consequences,\\" said Osterloh, who also sits on VW's 20-member supervisory board.

Europe's largest automaker employs over 600,000 people at around 120 factories worldwide, including 270,000 in Germany. Its U.S. plant in Chattanooga, Tennnessee employs about 2,200 people. Speaking at the Wolfsburg meeting Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said the scandal would inflict \\"substantial and painful\\" financial damage on the carmaker, without elaborating. Volkswagen last year set aside 6.7 billion euros (7.39 billion) to cover the expected costs of recalling of about 11 million diesel vehicles globally. It has postponed the release of its 2015 results by more than a month until April 28 to better assess the financial implications of the crisis. \\"The software manipulations and its consequences will keep us busy for a long time,\\" Mueller said on Tuesday, adding that it would take years to determine the full extent of the financial impact of the scandal. The state of Lower Saxony, VW's second-largest shareholder, expects more \\"unpleasant news\\" to emerge over the months ahead but remains confident that the company has the financial strength to cope. \\"We will this year probably every now and then be confronted with unpleasant news related to 'Dieselgate',\\" Stephan Weil, prime minister of Lower Saxony, told the Wolfsburg meeting. \\"The damage will, on balance, not be minor, that much can already be said today, but Volkswagen luckily has a strong economic base,\\" Weil, also a member of the supervisory board, said. The Western German state, which holds 20 percent of VW's common shares, has \\"no reason\\" to alter its commitment to the carmaker despite the crisis, said Weil, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners. MORE SUSPECTS IN GERMAN INVESTIGATION Separately, German prosecutors said on Tuesday they have widened their investigation into Volkswagen's diesel emissions scandal and are now targeting 11 more employees. Klaus Ziehe from the state prosecutor's office in Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, which is leading the German case against VW, said 17 people were now being investigated, up from six previously. \\"The number of suspects has risen, although none are from the management board,\\" Ziehe said.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Rob is an auto mechanic. He was checking the radiators of his car and truck. He put antifreeze into the car radiator, but didn't put any antifreeze into the truck radiator. He was wondering how the vehicles would fare in coming hot weather. But I can use this background: Antifreeze could also be called “antiboil” because it also raises the boiling point of the water in a car radiator. Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the radiator above 100 °C, which is the boiling point of pure water. If the water boils, it could cause the engine to overheat and become seriously damaged. However, if antifreeze has been added to the water, the boiling point is much higher. For example a 50 percent antifreeze solution has a boiling point of 129 °C. Unless the water gets hotter than this, it won’t boil and ruin the engine. What is an answer for this question: Which vehicle would do worse in hot weather and hot engine, car or truck? A:","completion":"Based on the given background information, the truck would likely fare worse in hot weather and under hot engine conditions compared to the car. This is because the car radiator has antifreeze added to it, while the truck radiator does not have any antifreeze. Antifreeze, as mentioned, functions not only to prevent freezing of the coolant but also to increase the boiling point of the water in a car radiator. Since the car has a 50% antifreeze solution, its coolant boiling point would be raised to 129 °C. This means that unless the water gets hotter than 129 °C, it will not boil, and the car engine will not face the risk of overheating and becoming seriously damaged. The higher boiling point provided by the antifreeze solution effectively protects the car's engine from overheating during hot weather conditions. On the other hand, the truck does not have antifreeze added to its radiator. As a result, the boiling point of the water in the truck radiator remains at 100 °C, which is the boiling point of pure water. Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the truck's radiator above 100 °C. The lack of antifreeze in the truck's radiator increases the risk of water boiling, which can lead to engine overheating and potential damage to the engine. In conclusion, the truck is more likely to suffer from performance issues and engine damage in hot weather and hot engine conditions due to the lack of antifreeze in its radiator. The car, with its antifreeze solution, has a higher boiling point for its coolant, and is better protected from the risks of overheating during hot weather."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Stereolab were an English-French avant-pop band from London, formed in 1990 by Tim Gane (guitar/keyboards) and Laetitia Sadier (vocals/keyboards/guitar) who both remained at the songwriting helm across many line-up changes. Other long-time members included Mary Hansen (backing vocals/keyboards/guitar), who joined in 1992 and remained in the line-up until her accidental death in 2002, and Andy Ramsay (drums), who joined in 1993 and is still in the official line-up. Sean O'Hagan of the High Llamas was a member from 1993 to 1994, and continued appearing on later records for occasional guest appearances. The group's music combined influences from krautrock, lounge and 1960s pop music. Stereolab's music combines a droning rock sound with lounge instrumentals, overlaid with sing-song female vocals and pop melodies. It has been generally described as avant-pop, indie pop, art pop, indie electronic, indie rock, post-rock experimental rock, and experimental pop. Their records are heavily influenced by the \\"motorik\\" technique of 1970s krautrock groups such as Neu! and Faust. Tim Gane has supported the comparison: \\"Neu! did minimalism and drones, but in a very pop way.\\" Funk, jazz, and Brazilian music were additional inspirations, and the sounds influenced by minimalist composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich can be found on the 1999 album Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night. Regarding their later work such as Instant 0 in the Universe (2003) and Margerine Eclipse (2004), critics have compared the releases to their earlier guitar-driven style. Stereolab's style also incorporates easy-listening music of the 1950s and '60s. Joshua Klein in The Washington Post said that, \\"Years before everyone else caught on, Stereolab was referencing the 1970s German bands Can and Neu!, the Mexican lounge music master Esquivel and the decidedly unhip Burt Bacharach.\\" Stereolab make use of vintage electronic keyboards and synthesizers from brands such as Farfisa and Vox and Moog. Gane has praised the instruments for their versatility: \\"We use the older effects because they're more direct, more extreme, and they're more like plasticine: you can shape them into loads of things.\\" The 1994 album Mars Audiac Quintet prominently feature Moog synthesizers. Laetitia Sadier's English and French vocals was a part of Stereolab's music since the beginning; and would occasionally sing wordlessly along with the music. In reference to her laid-back delivery, Peter Shapiro wrote facetiously in The Wire that she \\"display[ed] all the emotional histrionics of Nico\\". Sadier would often trade vocals with Mary Hansen back-and-forth in a sing-song manner that has been described as \\"eerie\\" and \\"hypnotic\\". After Hansen's death in 2002, critic Jim Harrington commented that her absence is noticeable on live performances of Stereolab's older tracks, and that their newer songs could have benefited from Hansen's backing vocals. In interviews, Gane and Sadier have discussed their musical philosophy. Gane said that \\"to be unique was more important than to be good.\\" On the subject of being too obscure, he said in a 1996 interview that \\"maybe the area where we're on dodgy ground, is this idea that you need great knowledge [of] esoteric music to understand what we're doing.\\" Sadier responded to Gane, saying that she \\"think[s] we have achieved a music that will make sense to a lot of people whether they know about Steve Reich or not.\\" The duo were up-front about their desire to grow their sound: for Gane, \\"otherwise it just sounds like what other people are doing\\", and for Sadier, \\"you trust that there is more and that it can be done more interesting.\\" How has Stereolab's style been described?","completion":"Stereolab's style has been described as a blend of various genres and influences, making their music unique and diverse. It has been generally labeled as avant-pop, indie pop, art pop, indie electronic, indie rock, post-rock experimental rock, and experimental pop. Their sound is a combination of droning rock, lounge instrumentals, sing-song female vocals, and catchy pop melodies. Some of their key influences include the \\"motorik\\" technique of 1970s krautrock groups such as Neu! and Faust, as well as funk, jazz, and Brazilian music. Stereolab also incorporates elements of easy-listening music from the 1950s and '60s, and minimalist compositions by Philip Glass and Steve Reich. The band's instrumentation features vintage electronic keyboards and synthesizers from brands like Farfisa, Vox, and Moog, which Tim Gane has praised for their versatility and ability to be shaped into various sounds. Laetitia Sadier's English and French vocals have been a staple of Stereolab's music since the beginning, often singing wordlessly alongside the music or trading vocals with Mary Hansen in an eerie and hypnotic manner. As for Stereolab's musical philosophy, Gane and Sadier value uniqueness over simply being good and believe their music should make sense to listeners regardless of their knowledge of esoteric influences. The duo remains committed to growing and evolving their sound, ensuring that it stays distinct and interesting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. What is most probably the case regarding why Trump did not make payment to the adult star directly? - the payment was made without his knowledge - not enough information - he wanted this payment to remain private - his lawyer insisted on handling all transfers of funds on behalf of his clients","completion":"It is most probable that Trump wanted the payment to the adult star to remain private, which is why he did not make the payment directly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who hires someone to kill the corrupt Mexican army officer? , can you please find it? El Mariachi is recruited by CIA agent Sheldon Jeffrey Sands to kill General Emiliano Marquez, a corrupt Mexican Army officer who has been hired by Mexican drug lord Armando Barillo to assassinate the President of Mexico and overthrow the government. Many years before, El Mariachi and his wife Carolina confronted Marquez in a shootout and wounded the general; in retaliation, Marquez took the lives of Carolina and their daughter in an ambush. In addition to El Mariachi, Sands persuades former FBI agent Jorge Ramírez to come out of retirement and kill Barillo, who had murdered his partner Archuleta in the past. Furthermore, AFN operative Ajedrez is assigned by Sands to tail Barillo. While monitoring Barillo's activities, Ramírez meets Billy Chambers, an American fugitive who has been living under the protection of Barillo, but can no longer stomach the horrible tasks he's been forced to carry out for him. Ramírez convinces Chambers he will provide him protection in exchange for getting closer to Barillo by tagging Chambers' pet chihuahua with a hidden microphone, and Chambers agrees to complete the deal by surrendering to U.S. authorities once Barillo has been taken down. Sands' assistant, Cucuy, originally hired to keep an eye on El Mariachi, instead tranquilizes El Mariachi and turns him over to Barillo, also offering to reveal the details of Sands's plan.

Context: There is no hiding from the impact agenda. The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

Available options: [1]. 0; [2]. 1; [3]. 2; [4]. 3; [5]. 4; [6]. 5;","completion":"To rate textual similarity between two sentences, it is necessary to consider the level of meaning that they share, as well as the details and aspects of the sentences that are common between them. In this case, the sentences are as follows: 1. The man is driving a white car. 2. A man is giving an interview. Let us first break down the sentences and compare their components: - Both sentences have a man as the main subject. This creates a minimal level of similarity based on the subject, even though the context of the man's actions may differ. - The first sentence's primary focus is on the man driving a white car, which indicates that the sentence revolves around the action of driving and the specific detail of the car's color. - The second sentence, on the other hand, is focused on the man giving an interview. This implies that the topic of conversation or the event taking place has a different focus than the first sentence. Considering these components, it appears that the similarities mainly arise from the presence of a man as the main subject in both sentences. However, the context and specific actions of each sentence differ significantly, with one focused on driving a car and the other centered around an interview. Given this assessment, it would be appropriate to rate the textual similarity of these two sentences as a 1 on the scale from 0 to 5. The rating of 1 signifies that there is some minimal meaning overlap due to the common subject (the man), but that the overall meaning and context of the sentences do not share significant similarities."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Write an article based on this summary: Paul Merton has clocked up more appearances on Just a Minute than veteran player Kenneth Williams. Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Paul Merton Surpasses Kenneth Williams in Number of 'Just a Minute' Appearances\\" Article: Paul Merton has decisively etched his name into the history of BBC Radio 4’s beloved radio and television show, 'Just a Minute', as he has now outdone the remarkable veteran player Kenneth Williams in total appearances. This is noteworthy because 'Just a Minute' is a show well-known to value and celebrate longevity and cumulative achievements. To kick off a detailed dive into this event, it is essential to introduce both key players. Paul Merton, a cherished comedian and actor, enjoys immense popularity among 'Just a Minute' fans. Known for his wit and comic timing, he has regularly made audiences burst into laughter with his hilarious impromptu speeches, often led by outlandish trains of thought. On the other side, we have the legendary Kenneth Williams. A prolific actor and comedian in his own right, Williams was an essential part of 'Just a Minute'. His unique style, flamboyantly pitched voice, and quick retorts were a sell-out factor for the show through many of its formative years. His remarkable record in the show has been unparalleled until now. To quantify the scale of Merton's achievement, we need to understand the show's format. 'Just a Minute' is challenging – the participants have to talk for a full minute on a randomly assigned topic, without repetition, hesitation or deviation. To excel on this show, a unique blend of quick-thinking skills, general knowledge, comic talent and eloquence is required. Both Merton and Williams have these qualities in abundance, as demonstrated by their longevity on the series. It's apparent now, though, that Merton has taken a step ahead. The badge of distinction, symbolising the ultimate commitment and dedication to the show, has now passed hands from Williams to Merton. This development is not just a triumph of one player over another; instead, it marks a significant milestone in the rich history of 'Just a Minute'. This accomplishment of Merton underlines not only his talent but also his commitment to the show he has been a part of for decades. While this impressive achievement surely brings him personal satisfaction, it also gives the fans of 'Just a Minute' a new milestone to celebrate and reflect upon in the show's long-standing tradition. However, as thrilling as this contest was, it's essential to take a moment to appreciate both performers. Williams set the benchmark with his performances, while Merton made matching, and now surpassing that benchmark, his mission. In conclusion, Paul Merton's surpassing of Kenneth Williams' record for appearances on 'Just a Minute' is a remarkable achievement that re-asserts his standing as a significant contributor to the enduring success of the show. But more than anything, this milestone serves as a testament to Merton's skill, dedication and love for the game. The legacy continues, with many more minutes filled with renowned guests, riveting tales and timeless humor to be experienced. The progression of this step-by-step analysis first involved setting the context, then introducing the key players. This was followed by highlighting the show's challenge and explaining why the new record is substantial. Drawing attention to Merton's achievement while capitulating Williams' contributions was crucial. Lastly, the analysis concluded by forthrightly focusing on the importance of this milestone in the show's history and Merton's career."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The emphasis is primarily on the location of the second stage (Plymouth), with the detail about it being the first time the Tour de France visited England serving as an additional piece of context. On the other hand, in the second sentence, \\"The second stage was in Plymouth, the first time that the Tour de France visited England\\", the addition of \\"that\\" forms a conjunction which links the previous statement to the next. The conjunctive \\"that\\" could be seen as more explicitly making the point that the Tour was in England for the first time. Arguably, the emphasis or focus of this sentence is slightly more on the significance of the tour's first visit to England. However, in reality, most readers would interpret these sentences as having the same overall meaning. The slight change in sentence structure doesn't substantially alter the conveyed information or significance of the components. So, in essence, they both communicate the historic first visit of the Tour de France to England during its second stage in Plymouth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is a question about this article: The 9/11 Commission's final report on July 22, 2004 stated that the FBI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were both partially to blame for not pursuing intelligence reports that could have prevented the September 11, 2001 attacks. In its most damning assessment, the report concluded that the country had \\"not been well served\\" by either agency and listed numerous recommendations for changes within the FBI. While the FBI has acceded to most of the recommendations, including oversight by the new Director of National Intelligence, some former members of the 9/11 Commission publicly criticized the FBI in October 2005, claiming it was resisting any meaningful changes. What is the answer to this question: Did many believe the FBI was resisting important changes?","completion":"Yes, many people, including some former members of the 9/11 Commission, believed that the FBI was resisting important changes. The 9/11 Commission's final report, released on July 22, 2004, found that both the FBI and CIA had failed to effectively pursue intelligence reports that could have prevented the September 11, 2001 attacks. As part of its findings, the report provided numerous recommendations for changes within the FBI to address the shortcomings identified. While the FBI did accept and implement many of the proposed recommendations, such as the establishment of the new Director of National Intelligence to oversee intelligence efforts, some former members of the 9/11 Commission continued to criticize the Bureau in public forums. In October 2005, these critics claimed that the FBI was still resisting meaningful changes that would improve its ability to prevent future terrorist attacks. This resistance was perceived, among other reasons, due to concerns that certain bureaucratic and structural changes could interfere with the organization's traditional law enforcement role and compromise its effectiveness in responding to traditional crimes. Additionally, the FBI's culture and resistance to change were seen as contributing factors to reluctance in implementing necessary reforms. In summary, despite the FBI's implementation of certain recommendations put forth by the 9/11 Commission, the perception was widespread among critics, including some former members of the 9/11 Commission, that the FBI was not fully embracing important changes aimed at improving its capabilities to prevent future terrorist attacks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A random sequence of events, symbols or steps has no order and does not follow an intelligible pattern or combination. Individual random events are by definition unpredictable, but in many cases the frequency of different outcomes over a large number of events (or \\"trials\\") is predictable. For example, when throwing two dice, the outcome of any particular roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7 will occur twice as often as 4. In this view, randomness is a measure of uncertainty of an outcome, rather than haphazardness, and applies to concepts of chance, probability, and information entropy. - Nassim Nicholas Taleb (alternatively \\"Nessim \\"or\\" Nissim,\\" born 1960) is a Lebanese-American essayist, scholar, statistician, former trader, and risk analyst, whose work focuses on problems of randomness, probability, and uncertainty. His 2007 book \\"The Black Swan\\" was described in a review by the \\"Sunday Times\\" as one of the twelve most influential books since World War II. - Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. Probability is quantified as a number between 0 and 1 (where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty). The higher the probability of an event, the more certain that the event will occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is unbiased, the two outcomes (\\"head\\" and \\"tail\\") are both equally probable; the probability of \\"head\\" equals the probability of \\"tail\\". Since no other outcomes are possible, the probability is 1/2 (or 50%), of either \\"head\\" or \\"tail\\". In other words, the probability of \\"head\\" is 1 out of 2 outcomes and the probability of \\"tail\\" is also 1 out of 2 outcomes, expressed as 0.5 when converted to decimal, with the above-mentioned quantification system. This type of probability is also called a priori probability. - Fooled by Randomness : The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets is a book by Nassim Nicholas Taleb that deals with the fallibility of human knowledge . - A statistician is someone who works with theoretical or applied statistics. The profession exists in both the private and public sectors. It is common to combine statistical knowledge with expertise in other subjects, and statisticians may work as employees or as statistical consultants. What object entity has the relation of 'genre' with the subject 'fooled by randomness'?

'Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets' is a book written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. In this context, genre refers to a category of artistic composition characterized by similarities in form, style, or subject matter. Here, the genre of 'Fooled by Randomness' refers to the fact that it is a written work and is thus a book. Other categories such as essayist, information, randomness, statistics, war, will don't quite fit into the concept of genre in relation to 'Fooled by Randomness'. This work doesn't fall under the genre of 'statistics' or 'randomness' despite it dealing with those subjects because genre refers to the form or type of the work, which is a book, rather than the subject matter it explores.

Please briefly summarize this news article: A Pre-Thanksgiving Ritual: Cocktails, Catch-Ups and Maybe a Kiss There was a short line outside the Stumble Inn on 76th Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan on Wednesday night. Women decked out in what seemed to be matching puffy coats huddled together under the bar’s overhang. Men wore Uniqlo flannel. There was an excited energy in the air, but it was not holiday spirit. It was the hope, perhaps, that before the clock would strike 4 a.m. and the Prince Charmings and Cinderellas would have to retreat home in cabs for turkey and pumpkin pie, they might ring in the holiday season with a night of debauchery and unapologetic fun. And by the way, if you thought that the first snowstorm of the year would keep young 20-somethings away from the bars on what is infamously referred to as the most insane party night of the year, you thought wrong. So wrong. Inside, Justin Timberlake’s “Sexy Back” played loudly, and Shamar, the doorman, inspected IDs (but gave only his first name for privacy reasons). He has been working this job for three years, so he believes he is pretty good at judging the scene. The night before Thanksgiving usually turns out a similar size crowd as a regular Friday or Saturday, he said, but the energy is better. “Everyone just wants to be merry tonight,” he said of the crowd. Merry they were. Packets of friends monopolized dark brown leather booths, a group of eight guys threw back shots of tequila by the beer pong table, two girlfriends shrieked and embraced upon seeing each other for the first time in months. Tabs were opened and kept open. ’Twas the night before Thanksgiving. Once again, it was a big bar night around the country for the post-collegiate and barely legal set — traveling to their hometowns for the holiday. For some, it was about finding an hourslong romance in a crowded bar of strangers. For others, the lure was striding into that one place that used to deny them entry when they were underage and seeing everyone they grew up with and having, finally, a compelling answer to the questions of “What are you up to these days?” For all, it was about the possibility of a tipsy, consequence-free kiss. By Thursday, these same revelers would be kicking back with relatives, avoiding conversations about politics and religion, wondering if crazy Aunt Judy would again ask when they were going to finally settle down. (She’s not going to be around forever, you know, and she would like to see at least one of her nieces or nephews get married.) There would be food, family and football. But first would come flirting. Sitting at a corner of the mahogany bar were Wendy Dallis and Richie O’Mahoney. If you had only a minute to study them, you would think they were in a long-term relationship. Mr. O’Mahoney’s hand rested on Ms. Dallis’s leg. Now and again, she leaned in close to make a joke, then tilted her head back in wild laughter. They seemed blissfully unaware of any others. Turns out, they had only met two nights earlier. Ms. Dallis, a singer in the band Ferrari Truck, told the story of girl-meets-boy. Or in this case, bartender: Mr. O’Mahoney, 33, works at the Gael Pub, which is about 10 blocks from the Stumble Inn. She had wandered there last Monday night after having had a few drinks while singing downtown at the Mercury Lounge. “I told him I was hungry, and he gave me olives, and I told him he had to make sure I got home that night,” she said. “He texted me the next morning asking if I wanted to hang out.” Ms. Dallis told Mr. O’Mahoney she would meet him at the Stumble Inn on Wednesday night. From that perch, they discussed meeting up on Thanksgiving, too. As they focused on their new connection, a dozen or so fraternity brothers waxed about their old days at the University of Pennsylvania. Meeting up for Thanksgiving Eve drinks is their annual tradition, said Lionel Anderson, 32, of Philadelphia. He and a group of his Alpha Phi Alpha friends have dinner at Dallas BBQ on 73rd Street and Third Avenue, and walk a few blocks up to the Stumble Inn. Mr. Anderson, now the assistant director of academic research at Haverford College, said he is the only one of the brothers who doesn’t live in New York City. But this pre-Thanksgiving event is a priority for him: “I haven’t missed a Thanksgiving Eve night out since 2001.” He reminisced about the years when they were younger and a little more carefree, he said, adding that those nights were crazier. Now, he said, “it’s about catching up with old friends over a drink or two, and getting nostalgic for our college days.” By now, R. Kelly’s “Ignition (Remix)” had begun to play. The song is an anthem of sorts for anyone who was in high school or college in the early aughts (which, on Wednesday night was most everyone). One young woman stood on her chair and started dancing and singing along, every lyric memorized. The crowd whooped in delight. A bit farther south on Second Avenue, a different crowd congregated at Turtle Bay, a renowned party bar not far from the Queensboro Bridge, it’s a favorite spot for those traveling from Long Island and New Jersey in search of a night of big-city fun. The scene at Turtle Bay was younger and a little rowdier. A steady rain and snow mix fell as a line zigged outside the door. Sean Paul’s 2005 hit “Get Busy” could be heard thumping from inside. The cover charge was 5 for women and 10 for men. The doorman granted entry at his leisure. A soggy pile of umbrellas accumulated on the ground inside. Hanging out by the bar, trying to catch the attention of the blond bartender were two buddies — Charles Gehnrich, a senior at SUNY Geneseo, and Steven Davies, a senior at Towson University in Maryland. The two 21-year-olds, childhood friends originally from Syosset, N.Y., were home for the holiday and ventured into the city for their first official “legal night out” on Thanksgiving Eve. They had chosen Turtle Bay because a friend of theirs had won a free happy hour for a small group. “I’m a broke college student!” Mr. Davies said, never diverting his eyes from one of the seven TV screens showing the Knicks game. “I’m just trying to get drunk, that’s it.” Then he looked away from the game, for just a moment. “But there should be more girls here,” he said. Indeed, Turtle Bay was heavy on the cheap drinks, including neon-colored tubes of alcohol being sold for 5 by an aggressive saleswoman who ported them about, cigarette-girl style. But the guy-to-gal ratio did not favor gentlemen looking to hook up with women. And the women who were there, weren’t digging the vibe. “This is so not my scene,” Trisha Barry, 24, yelled over the music. Her friend Kelsey Demsky, who would turn 24 at midnight, nodded her head in annoyed agreement. The women said they had been invited to the bar by a colleague at T. J. Maxx, who had told them he wanted to ring in Ms. Demsky’s birthday “the right way,” Ms. Demsky said, “whatever that means.” What they really wanted to do was head home to Brooklyn to prep for their Thanksgiving, which they would be spending Thursday afternoon together in their apartment in Bensonhurst. They did not want to drink too much. “We have to cook tomorrow,” Ms. Barry said. Back uptown at the Stumble Inn, Mr. O’Mahoney and Ms. Dallis grabbed their coats and prepared to leave together into the rainy night. It was a successful second date, they both said, and then Ms. Dallis hinted it might not yet be over. “We already kissed,” she said, grabbing his hand. “And I’m still here.” A version of this article appears in print on November 30, 2014, on page ST1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Night for Hookups.

After the death of her mother, Carrie McLaughlin has been living with her grandmother in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. When her grandmother needs to go to a nursing home, Carrie has to move in with her father Hank, a rancher in Wyoming, whom she hasn't seen since she was a baby. Initially reluctant to adapt to country living, Carrie soon meets Flicka, a beautiful black Mustang that previously had belonged to Carrie's cousin Katy, who asked Hank to look after Flicka when her father sold their own ranch. Flicka is wild and dangerous and, according to the ranchers, longs for Katy. However, when Carrie is attacked by a rattlesnake, Flicka saves her and the two form a bond. Carrie also meets Jake, an attractive ranch hand hoping to become a country singer, and Amy Walker, the proud and arrogant daughter of a neighbour. Although Jake and Carrie take an immediate liking to each other, there is instant animosity between Carrie and Amy, mainly because Amy also likes Jake. When Carrie disobeys her father's rules regarding visits to the nearest town, Hank decides to punish Carrie by temporarily relocating Flicka to the farm of one of his ranch hands, Toby. After a midnight visit by Carrie, Flicka tries to follow Carrie home to Hank's ranch, but accidentally ends up on the ranch belonging to Amy's father HD Walker. Upon entering the Walker ranch, Flicka damages a fence and releases some of HD's prize cows. At Amy's request, HD asks for Flicka as payment for the damage, threatening to turn it into a lawsuit if Hank refuses. Amy then starts training with Flicka for a championship, but performs poorly during the actual competition because of Flicka's fear of the crowd and camera flashes from the audience.

In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

Abattoirs providing the majority of British supermarkets with fresh pork use a stunning method that campaigners claim causes the animals 'severe distress' before they are slaughtered. MailOnline has learned LIDL, the Co-operative and Waitrose source all of their pig meat from plants using carbon dioxide to knock out the animals. Sainsbury's said the 'majority' of their pork is sourced from CO2 plants and ASDA's suppliers use the gas too. Tesco now wants every one of its plants to adopt the same method by 2018. It did not disclose the proportion which already do. Researchers and welfare groups say it is 'aversive' to the animals who can suffer for 'up to 30 seconds' before losing consciousness. Morrisons slaughters '100 per cent' of its fresh pork in its own abattoirs and uses electric stunning, which has drawn its own condemnation. During the CO2 stunning process Tesco wants implemented, groups of pigs are mechanically herded into cages which are then lowered into pits with high carbon dioxide concentration. Scroll down for video. Panic: CO2 stunning has been deemed humane because the pigs are moved in groups before they are stunned, but they can suffer for 'up to 30 seconds' when they are in the high concentration pits. Stunned: Tesco has called on every one of its fresh pork suppliers to stun their pigs (pictured in a CO2 stunning plant in North-west Europe) with carbon dioxide by December 31, 2017. Suffocating: CO2 is aversive to the pigs' breathing and can cause them 'severe distress', campaigners say. The procedure before stunning is considered humane because pigs naturally move around in groups without human interaction. But they can get stuck the wrong way in the machinery that shepherds them - and become frightened. When they are lowered into high concentrations of carbon dioxide, which is aversive to their breathing, they panic and kick out for 'a period of up to 30 seconds' before losing consciousness. In emails revealed to MailOnline, Tesco says it wants the plants to use a machine called the Butina backloader or an equivalent stunning system by December 31, 2017. Footage obtained from a plant in North-west Europe - using that very machine - shows the animals climbing over each other and gasping for breath as they enter the CO2 pits. The gas 'induces respiratory distress, causing hyperventilation and a sense of breathlessness,' researchers say. As one cage is brought to the surface, another is lowered into the pit and the cycle continues. Animal welfare group Eyes on Animals, who filmed inside the plant, says the pigs are 'out of sight out of mind until they come back up and their bodies are no longer reacting'. Robert Hubrecht, Chief Executive of the Humane Slaughter Association told MailOnline: 'As with many gas killing systems, carbon dioxide partly acts by displacing oxygen so the brain cannot function and brain death ensues. 'Carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid with a low pH when it meets moisture and probably because of this, inhalation of carbon dioxide at high concentrations causes irritation of the nasal mucosal membranes and lungs.' He added that all available commercial methods for the stunning and slaughter of pigs have their disadvantages, and the use of CO2 is 'often the most reliable' for large operations. 'Looking to the future, further research into inert gas mixtures and other controlled atmosphere systems might well lead to welfare benefits,' he said. Their director Lesley Moffat told MailOnline: 'I think Tesco rushed into making a really, really big decision that has an impact on animal welfare for years to come and on slaughterhouses. 'They made the wrong decision because they're expecting slaughterhouses that don't yet have the CO2 system to install it when maybe five to ten years down the road, it could be banned. 'It means a lot of animals will be slaughtered in a way that isn't ideal.' A survey carried out by the Food Standard Agency in 2013 found that a similar number of pigs were stunned using electricity and carbon dioxide - but the gas method was far more efficient. Of the 167,325 pigs it recorded slaughtered one week, 80,768 were stunned electrically at 116 plants. Whereas 86,456 were stunned using 'high concentration' CO2 at just seven abattoirs. Electric stunning knocks the pigs out instantly, but the herding leading up to it causes them more stress than during gas stunning because they move in single file and they can see the animal in front being stunned. Donald Broom, Professor of Animal Welfare at Cambridge University, said: 'The handling systems associated with gas stunning are generally better for pig welfare than those when electrical stunning is used.' But he added: 'When carbon dioxide stunning is used, the welfare of the pigs is poor until they lose consciousness, usually about 30 seconds. They gasp, throw their heads around and squeal.' Herded: Tesco wants its pig meat suppliers to adopt the Butina back loader (pictured) or equivalent, which mechanically herds the pigs into cages - which are then lowered into CO2 pits. Carousel: One group of pigs is lowered into an area of high-concentration CO2 as another is brought back up. The slaughter method has been previously criticised by the Farm Animal Welfare Committee (FAWC), which advises the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). One of their previous reports called for the practice to be 'phased out' out by 2008 after concluding: 'the use of high concentrations of carbon dioxide to stun and kill pigs is not acceptable.' It added: 'FAWC supports further research into and development of alternatives to CO2, such as mixtures including argon or nitrogen, which are less aversive.' Experiments using gases like as argon mixed with lower concentrations of carbondixodie have shown it is non-aversive to pigs, who lose consciousness without showing signs of stress. According to Butina, the CO2 back loader system is for slaughterhouses who want to implement the latest technology and focus on animal welfare and meat quality. Its components are thouroughly tested to prevent the pigs from becoming stressed. The concept for the product is based on the pigs being driven forward to the stunning system in groups in groups using a 'mechanical driveway'. The pigs are divided into smaller groups and driven into the stunning boxes which are lowered into a CO2 atmosphere using a 'paternoster' or continuous lift system. After stunning, the pigs are tipped out of the boxes for shackling and 'sitcking'. The back loader can manage four to eight pigs per stunning box and between 125 and 900 pigs every hour. But using argon is less profitable because the gas is more expensive, it can lower the quality of meat and it takes longer for the pigs to lose consciousness - so fewer pigs can be stunned every hour. According to Professor Broom: 'The small extra cost and the extra minute during the process are easily outweighed by the better image of both the pig industry and Tesco if the best method is used.' That message was echoed by Compassion in World Farming who is 'utterly opposed to the use of high levels of carbon dioxide stunning or killing pigs'. It was one of seven welfare groups who wrote to the European Commission in January urging them to phase out CO2 and discuss alternative methods that will not cause the animals pain and distress. A Tesco spokesperson said: 'We are committed to high animal welfare standards. All of our pork suppliers must be fully compliant with nationally recognised welfare assurance schemes as well as meeting additional Tesco requirements. 'We are guided by the advice of independent bodies such as the Farm Animal Welfare Council and available scientific evidence demonstrates that CO2 stunning, combined with moving pigs in groups together, reduces stress and injury. 'We will continue to work with our pork suppliers and acknowledged veterinary experts, to explore and invest in methods that can further improve animal welfare.' A Co-operative Food spokesperson said: 'Animal welfare is a priority for us and we only source fresh meat and meat product from UK abattoirs which adhere to our strict sourcing requirements and high standards.' Welfare concern: Donald Broom, Professor of Animal Welfare at Cambridge University, said: 'When carbon dioxide stunning is used, the welfare of the pigs is poor until they lose consciousness' 'Gondola system': Pigs are only slaughtered once they are completely unconscious and their pain reflexes have been tested. Waitrose stated: 'Animal welfare is a top priority for us. ​Our process has been described by Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) as ensuring stress is minimised. We are confident our welfare standards are among the highest in the UK.' ASDA said: 'Our suppliers do use carbon dioxide stunning in common with many others around the world.' And Lidl confirmed their fresh pork suppliers 'use abattoirs that adhere to the CO2 gassing method to stun their pigs prior to slaughter'. 'This method, which is approved according to both Freedom Food and Red Tractor animal welfare standards, is widely used in the UK and rest of Europe and commonly considered to be a more humane form of stunning than others,' its spokesperson said. Morrisons, who use electric stunning only, said it is 'the quickest and most effective way to minimise suffering and uphold the high level of animal welfare we operate in our abattoirs'. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1. Abattoirs providing fresh pork for major British supermarkets use carbon dioxide (CO2) stunning methods that may cause distress to the animals before slaughter. 2. LIDL, the Co-operative, and Waitrose source their pig meat from plants using CO2 for stunning, as do the majority of Sainsbury's and ASDA suppliers. 3. Animal welfare groups and researchers argue that CO2 stunning is aversive, potentially causing pig distress for up to 30 seconds before unconsciousness. 4. While electric stunning is instantaneous, the process generates more stress for pigs due to single-file herding and witnessing the stunning of other pigs. 5. Alternatives to carbon dioxide, such as mixtures including argon or nitrogen, may provide less aversive stunning methods for pigs but could be less cost-effective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was recorded and made famous by American country music artist David Frizzell. Released in 1982, the song was the lead single from the album \\"The Family's Fine, But This One's All Mine.\\" It became a major hit on the country charts, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in July of that year. The song also crossed over to the pop charts, peaking at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song tells the story of a husband who is tired of his wife's incessant redecorating and overspending on their home. In response, he jokingly tells her that he will hire a wino (a person who drinks excessive amounts of alcohol, especially cheap wine) to come and decorate their home. The idea is that the wino would create such a chaotic and unappealing environment that it would deter the wife from wanting to spend more money on unnecessary home improvements. \\"I'm Gonna Hire a Wino to Decorate Our Home\\" was both a commercial and critical success for David Frizzell. The song's humorous lyrics and catchy tune resonated with audiences, helping it become one of his signature songs. It also earned him a nomination for Best Country Song at the 25th Annual Grammy Awards, further solidifying the song's status as a classic in the country music genre."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Information: - A silver medal in sports and other similar areas involving competition is a medal made of, or plated with, silver awarded to the second-place finisher, or runner-up, of contests or competitions such as the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, etc. The outright winner receives a gold medal and the third place a bronze medal. More generally, silver is traditionally a metal sometimes used for all types of high-quality medals, including artistic ones. - The 1900 Summer Olympics, today officially known as the Games of the II Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event which was celebrated in 1900 in Paris, France, and the last Summer Olympics to be held in the 19th century. No opening or closing ceremonies were held; competitions began on May 14 and ended on October 28. The Games were held as part of the 1900 World's Fair. In total, 997 competitors took part in 19 different sports. Women took part in the games for the first time and sailor Hélène de Pourtalès became the first female Olympic champion. The decision to hold competitions on a Sunday brought protests from many American athletes, who travelled as representatives of their colleges and were expected to withdraw rather than compete on their religious day of rest. - At the 1900 Summer Olympics, six of the archery events that took place in Paris, France, were considered Olympic, with 153 archers competing in them. The identities of 17 of those archers are known, though a number of those are known only by their surnames. It was the first time that archery was featured in the Olympics. All six events were for men. Only France, Belgium, and the Netherlands sent archers. None of the Dutch archers are known by name and none won any medals. - Silver is the metallic element with the atomic number 47. Its symbol is Ag, from the Latin \\"\\", derived from the Greek \\"\\" (literally \\"shiny\\" or \\"white\\"), and ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European language root reconstructed as *\\"her-\\", \\"grey\\" or \\"shining\\". A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (\\"native silver\\"), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining. Silver is more abundant than gold, but it is much less abundant as a native metal. Its purity is typically measured on a per mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as \\"0.940 fine\\". - Hubert van Innis ( 24 February 1866 -- 25 November 1961 ) was a Belgian competitor in the sport of archery . Van Innis competed in four events and won two first prizes and a second prize , and is now considered by the International Olympic Committee to have won two gold medals and a silver medal . His wins came in the shorter events , the 33 metre sections of each of the Au Chapelet and Au Cordon Doré competitions . In the 50 metre Au Cordon Doré , van Innis finished second to Henri Hérouin by a score of 31 -- 29 , with Émile Fisseux close behind at 28 points . Van Innis had his worst of his four outings in the 50 metre Au Chapelet event , finishing in fourth place . He also lost to Hérouin in the Championnat du Monde event , 22 -- 16 , though that event is not considered Olympic by the IOC . At the 1920 Summer Olympics held in Antwerp , van Innis won four gold and two silver medals , bringing up his total Olympic medal count to six gold and three silver medals . He 's the most successful archer in Olympic history . - A medal or medallion is, strictly speaking, a small, flat, and round (at times, ovoid) piece of metal that has been sculpted, molded, cast, struck, stamped, or some way marked with an insignia, portrait, or other artistic rendering. A medal may be awarded to a person or organization as a form of recognition for sporting, military, scientific, academic, or various other achievements. Military awards and decorations are more precise terms for certain types of state decoration. Medals may also be created for sale to commemorate particular individuals or events, or as works of artistic expression in their own right. In the past, medals commissioned for an individual, typically with their portrait, were often used as a form of diplomatic or personal gift, with no sense of being an award for the conduct of the recipient. - Henri Louis Hérouin, Sr. (born 19 February 1876, date of death unknown) was a French competitor in the sport of archery. Hérouin won the first prize, and is now considered by the International Olympic Committee to have won the gold medal, in the 50 metre Au Cordon Doré event at the first Olympic appearance of archery, in the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. His score of 31 put him 2 points above his closest competitor Hubert Van Innis. - The Commonwealth Games (known as the British Empire Games from 19301950, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games from 19541966, and British Commonwealth Games from 19701974) is an international, multi-sport event involving athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations. The event was first held in 1930, and, with the exception of 1942 and 1946, which were cancelled due to World War II, has taken place every four years since then. - International mostly means something (a company, language, or organization) involving more than a single country. The term international as a word means involvement of, interaction between or encompassing more than one nation, or generally beyond national boundaries. For example, international law, which is applied by more than one country and usually everywhere on Earth, and international language which is a language spoken by residents of more than one country. - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva. - The International Olympic Committee (IOC; French: Comité international olympique, CIO) is the supreme authority of the worldwide Olympic movement. It is an international, non-profit, non-governmental organization based in Lausanne, Switzerland. Its mission is enshrined in the Olympic Charter: to support the development of competitive sport by ethical and environmentally sustainable means. - Lausanne (, ) is a city in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, and the capital and biggest city of the canton of Vaud. The city is situated on the shores of Lake Geneva (or simply \\"Le Léman\\"). It faces the French town of Évian-les-Bains, with the Jura Mountains to its north-west. Lausanne is located northeast of Geneva. - Émile Léon Fisseux (born 15 February 1868, date of death unknown) was a French competitor in the sport of archery. Fisseux competed in one event in Archery at the 1900 Summer Olympics, taking third place in the 50 metre Au Cordon Doré competition. His score of 28 points was one point behind the second-place archer, Hubert Van Innis, and three points behind the winner, Henri Hérouin. While Fisseux received no medal at the time, he is currently considered to be a bronze medallist by the International Olympic Committee. - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits.

Although the reviewer notes that the naengmyun wasn't the best they've ever had, they still affirm that it was good. A clear sign that the overall experience was positive is the variety of other dishes the reviewer's family ordered and enjoyed; the reviewer singles out the kalbi (a Korean beef dish) for particular praise, noting that it was tender and well-seasoned, and was appreciated specifically by their children. Moreover, the service is described as \\"awesome\\" and \\"friendly,\\" descriptors that give a strong indication of a positive experience. The reviewer also expresses a desire to not only return to the establishment if in town again, but also bring friends, which suggests that they trust the quality and experience enough to recommend it to others. Finally, it's worth noting that negative reviews typically focus on problems or issues encountered during the service or with the food. In this review, the mild critique of the naengmyun not being the best the reviewer had ever had does not amount to a genuine complaint, but rather seems to serve as a comparison point to highlight their surprise that the dish was done well, as most places don't \\"get it right.\\" As a result, the overall tone and content of the review are trending positive.

Payton was one of three children born to Peter and Alyne Payton in Columbia, Mississippi. His father was a factory worker who had played semi-professional baseball. Payton was an active member of the Boy Scouts, Little League, and his local church. At John J. Jefferson High School, Payton played drums in the marching band, participated in the track team and sang in the school choir. Payton's motto was \\"Never Die Easy\\", which is also the title of his posthumously published autobiography. Payton attributed this motto to Bob Hill, his coach at Jackson State. In practice, this meant that Payton refused to deliberately run out-of-bounds and always delivered some punishment to his tacklers before being forced off the field or forced down. One of Payton's signature maneuvers was the \\"stutter-step\\", a high-stepping, irregularly paced run. He developed this as a way to distract his pursuers during long runs, saying that it startled them into thinking and gave him some advantage over players who were actually faster runners. In his autobiography, he likened the stutter step to a kind of \\"option play\\": when he was stutter-stepping, defenders would have to commit to a pursuit angle based upon whether they thought he would accelerate after the stutter-step, or cut -- he would read this angle and do the opposite of what the defender had committed to. He re-invented the practice of stiff-arming his tacklers, which had gone out of favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup. After scoring touchdowns, Payton declined to celebrate; instead, he would often hand the ball to his teammates or the official. He disapproved of the growing practice of touchdown celebrations; he preferred post-game antics such as rushing into the locker room and locking his teammates out in the cold while taking a long shower. Although Payton would have won the respect of his peers and coaches by his running alone, he retired as the career leader in receptions for a running back with 492 for over 4,500 yards, and still holds the career record for a running back with 8 touchdown passes.

The answer is:","completion":"While I cannot predict exactly what Riley will do next, I can provide an analysis of different possible reactions Riley might have based on the context provided. It is important to remember that human emotions and reactions differ greatly depending on the individual's personality, past experiences, and the level of trust in their relationships. 1. Confront the friend: Riley may decide to confront their friend to have an honest and open conversation about the situation. In this case, Riley would need to approach their friend in a non-accusatory and calm manner to discuss the issue and share their feelings about being talked about negatively. This could lead to either a resolution and strengthened friendship, or a realization that their friendship isn't as strong as they once thought. 2. Seek advice from other friends: Before making any decisions, Riley could talk to their other friends who overheard the gossip. Asking for advice and getting their perspectives might help Riley better understand the situation and weigh possible reactions. 3. Ignore the gossip: Another option for Riley would be to ignore the gossip, not letting it affect their emotions, and not allowing it to alter their relationship with their friend. This might be an effective choice if Riley believes that the gossip was out of character for their friend or that it was simply a one-time occurrence. 4. Distance themselves: Alternatively, Riley might decide to distance themselves from their friend who was gossiping. This may happen gradually, by spending less time together and interacting less, or more abruptly, by ending the friendship altogether. Riley could determine that the trust in their relationship has been broken and choose to focus on other connections instead. 5. Reflect on their own behavior: It's also possible that Riley might take this as an opportunity to look inward and examine their own behavior. They might question if there's anything in their actions that could have led to the gossip, and whether they should make changes in their own life to improve their relationships with others. 6. Confide in a trusted adult: If Riley is still unsure how to proceed, they might choose to confide in a trusted adult-like a parent, teacher, or guidance counselor. Their experience and advice might help Riley navigate the situation. In conclusion, Riley's next step will depend on their personality, priorities, and the significance of their friendship with the person who was gossiping about them. Regardless of the chosen path, it is essential for Riley to communicate and confront the situation positively and constructively, keeping in mind the importance of trust, respect, and empathy in building strong, healthy relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Arrest: Former Montgomery County DA Bruce Castor said he wanted to arrest Cosby - but there was not enough evidence. The former District Attorney who decided not to charge Bill Cosby with rape today revealed to MailOnline that he wanted to arrest the star - but had insufficient proof. Bruce Castor was the DA of Montgomery County at the time that Andrea Constand claimed Cosby, now 77, drugged her and sexually assaulted her at his Pennsylvania home in January 2004. Miss Constand, a former director of operations for Temple University's women's basketball team and college basketball star, launched a legal suit against Cosby, a man she called her 'mentor', in March 2005. She was the first - and only woman - to press charges against the comic legend. And today, Mr Castor, who is now Montgomery County commissioner, told MailOnline exclusively: 'I wanted to arrest Bill Cosby because I thought he was probably guilty, but being able to prove anything beyond a reasonable doubt and thinking he's probably guilty are two different things. 'We knew back then that other woman had come forward, but even if they did it didn't mean anything for our case as none of those cases resulted in charges and were remote in time.' Commissioner Castor, a former two-term DA of Montgomery County and a private lawyer at the Bryn Mawr law office of Rogers and Associates., added: 'The lady who was allegedly attacked waited a year before she reported it. As a result of that delay, any possible corroborating physical evidence was unavailable to us. 'We couldn't test for hairs, fibers, DNA and drugs in her system that might match those at Mr Cosby's house. We didn't have any corroborative evidence. Scroll down for video. Happy, now: Andrea Constand pictured beaming while on a hike. She claimed in court papers she was attacked by Cosby at his Philadelphia home in 2004 - having previously considered him a friend and mentor. Post-traumatic stress disorder: Andrea Constand, former director of operations for Temple University's women's basketball team, sued Bill Cosby for rape in 2005. They settled out of court in 2006. 'Impish': NPR host Scott Simon said that when he asked Cosby about allegations of sexual assault, the star - joined by his wife of 50-years Camille - shook his head, wagged his finger and gave an 'impish, delightful' smile' 'There was almost no evidence on which to base a criminal case. The lady could not remember what happened with any detail, and she didn't report it for a year, all this made the case very difficult. 'I thought the failure to report the alleged incident would create a high hurdle to jump over. It was not like she could say what happened.' In her civil suit, Miss Constand, now 41, said she first met Cosby, a Temple University alum, in November 2002 and the pair became friends. She considered him a 'mentor' and was a frequent guest at dinner parties at his home. However, in court papers, she claims that after arriving at Cosby's house on an evening in January 2004, the comic legend gave her three blue pills when she said she was stressed over work, which he described as 'herbal medication' to help her relax. Then, the suit states, her 'knees began to shake, her limbs felt immobile, she felt dizzy and weak, and she began to feel only barely conscious.' Alum: Bill Cosby poses with Cheerleaders at the Philadelphia Premiere of Fat Albert at the Liacouras Center of his alma mater, Temple University, in December 2004 - a month after his alleged assault on Andrea Constand at his home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Sports fan: Bill Cosby takes up the trumpet as he joins the Mississippi State band before the start of the first game of the NCAA Final Four in March 1996, in East Rutherford, N.J. Cosby then gave her another drug, she said, and led her to the sofa, where she says she was sexually molested. 'When Plaintiff awoke, her clothes and undergarments were in disarray,' the suit said. Miss Constand later returned to her native Canada, where she reported the incident to police in January 2005. Authorities in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, followed up with an investigation, but in February 2005, they declined to press criminal charges due to a lack of evidence. Commissioner Castor said: 'All she could say is that she was there (at Cosby's house) and then something might have happened due to how she was when she next remembered something. 'I also knew she had a civil court remedy with a much lower standard of proof, and in fact, she had initiated such a case. 'So this lady was going to get a measure of justice in civil court where the burden of proof is much lower: just more likely than not that Cosby had done it. 50 per cent plus a tiny bit. A far cry from proof beyond a reasonable doubt which, essentially, is just shy of proof beyond any doubt. As a result of the alleged incident, Miss Constand claimed she had suffered 'serious and debilitating injuries, mental anguish, humiliation, embarrassment, physical and emotional upset, including, but not limited to, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, sleeplessness, isolation, flashbacks, anxiety, the full extent of which injuries are not yet known and some or all which may be permanent in nature.' The suit also said she had been 'caused to suffer and continues to suffer severe emotional distress, humiliation, embarrassment and financial loss.' Miss Constand sued Cosby for more than 150,000 in damages. Thirteen other women were claimed to be supporting witnesses in her suit and she settled out of court for an undisclosed sum in 2006. Today, Miss Constand declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline. However, she seemed to make her feelings clear on the overwhelming publicity surrounding Cosby and his alleged sexual offences. She tweeted a saying from Dr Seuss: 'My heart goes out to you:Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.' Statement: Bill Cosby, pictured in April, broke his silence amid the allegations of sexual assault on his website. The post thanked fans for their 'outpouring' of support. Paid out: Bill Cosby and Andrea Constand came to an out of court settlement in 2006. When asked about the rape charges by NPR Weekend Edition host Scott Simon last week, Cosby - joined by his wife of 50-years Camille - shook his head, wagged his finger and gave an 'impish, delightful' smile. A day later the comedian's lawyer called the charges 'discredited' and said the 'fact that they are being repeated does not make them true. The star would not 'dignify' the allegations with a response, he added.. 'He would like to thank all his fans for the outpouring of support and assure them that, at age 77, he is doing his best work. There will be no further statement from Mr. Cosby or any of his representatives.' However, this was later taken down and today, a joint statement from Dolores Troiani, counsel to Andrea Constand, and John P. Schmitt, counsel to Bill Cosby.statement was posted on billcosby.com saying: 'The statement released by Mr. Cosby's attorney over the weekend was not intended to refer in any way to Andrea Constand. 'As previously reported, differences between Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand were resolved to the mutual satisfaction of Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand years ago. Neither Mr. Cosby nor Ms. Constand intends to comment further on the matter.' Keeping quiet: Andrea Constand declined to comment on the latest allegations of sexual assault made by women against Bill Cosby. Support: Andrea Constand has been posting a series of supportive messages on her Twitter feed. Joan Tarshis, a former publicist, is now the latest to accuse Cosby of rape, claiming he assaulted her on two occasions in 1969, when she was 19. Joan wrote an essay for Hollywood Elswhere, published on Sunday, saying that she felt she could not come forward because Cosby was idolized - but said she was going public in the wake of accusations made by other women. 'I thought nobody would believe me because of his image, you know, whiter than snow,' she told The Wrap. Allegations: Barbara Bowman claims years of hell at the hands of Bill Cosby. And Barbara Bowman, who last month described her years of hell at the hands of the comic legend exclusively to MailOnline, is now asking him to acknowledge her claims. She said: 'I understand why more women have not spoken up. But my plea is that ANY women sexually abused by Bill Cosby come forward now and speak out. You have an obligation to survivors. If you don't speak out, you're helping no one, including yourselves. If nothing else, don't you deserve closure yourselves? Your daughters are not immune to this if we all stay silent. What kind of message are we sending to our own children?' 'This is why I'm speaking out. Wouldn't you like your daughters to learn how to stay safe from sexual predators? That's why I'm pushing so hard.' Cosby has never been charged with any crime relating to the allegations now swirling around him. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"This article covers several key points about the case of alleged sexual assault by famed comic figure, Bill Cosby, investigated by Bruce Castor, the former DA of Montgomery County. Castor has stated that while he wanted to arrest Cosby, he felt that the supporting evidence was insufficient for a criminal case. He explains his decision was rooted in challenges such as a lack of physical evidence due to the victim's delayed report, lack of case building details from the victim, and no charges being brought about in cases of other women who had come forward. The allegations against Cosby were brought by Andrea Constand, a former director of operations for Temple University's women's basketball team. According to her, Cosby, whom she called her 'mentor', drugged and sexually assaulted her at his home in January 2004. Her legal case began in March 2005. Castor notes that Constand's delayed reporting of the incident, as well as her inability to clearly remember certain events due to the effects of the supposed drugging, posed significant hurdles in building a successful criminal case. In her 2005 civil suit, Constand detailed her relationship with Cosby and the events of the alleged assault, involving Cosby supposedly giving her drugs to help her relax, following which she became incapacitated and was sexually molested. Following the incident, Constand returned to her native Canada and eventually reported the case in January 2005. However, the authorities declined to press charges due to a lack of evidence. Regardless, Castor mentioned that Constand also had the option of seeking justice in a civil court where the burden of proof is lower. Indeed, she initiated a civil case wherein she claimed to have suffered severe emotional and mental distress, along with physical injuries. Her lawsuit, which sought more than 150,000 in damages, was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum in 2006. The article further notes that Cosby and his representatives did not address the allegations directly. However, a joint statement from the counsel of both parties has clarified that any previous comments were not intended to refer to Constand and that all differences between Cosby and Constand had been resolved years ago. The article concludes by mentioning other women who also accused Cosby of sexual misconduct, such as Joan Tarshis and Barbara Bowman.
