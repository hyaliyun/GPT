If they're not, they'll be very difficult to work with and won't warrant the results you're looking for. Possible answers: (A). The butter should be light cream, not light brown or bittersweet. 1 1/4 pounds butter would be the best.; (B). Try using regular butter for the best results, but if you're not sure, thin or glossy butter might work fine too. You'll also need a cup that has room to spread.; (C). Preheat the oven to 350 f (180 c). Set an ungreased baking sheet aside.; (D). Test the temperature of your ice cream by bringing it up to room temperature. This will soften the shell and loosen it slightly so that you can work the cookie butter into the cookie dough without fading the cheese.; The answer is:","completion":"(C). Preheat the oven to 350 f (180 c). Set an ungreased baking sheet aside. To make gooey chocolate cookies, you'll first want to set out your cream cheese and a stick of butter to ensure they reach room temperature. If they're not at room temperature, they'll be hard to work with, and your cookies may not turn out as desired. Once your cream cheese and butter are ready, you can start preparing the rest of the ingredients and preheat your oven. Preheating the oven to 350 f (180 c) is essential because it will ensure consistent cooking temperature and proper baking results. While the oven is preheating, set an ungreased baking sheet aside. This will be used later when you're ready to bake the cookies. Next, gather all your other ingredients: sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, salt, eggs, vanilla extract, and chocolate chips. Cream together the room temperature butter and sugar until they are light and fluffy. Gradually add in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until combined. Fold in the chocolate chips. Now that your cookie dough is prepared, you can start portioning it out onto the ungreased baking sheet. Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the baking sheet, leaving enough space between each cookie to allow for them to spread as they bake. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still slightly soft. It's essential not to overbake the cookies, as you want to maintain that gooey, delicious texture. Once the cookies are done baking, let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. These gooey chocolate cookies are best enjoyed fresh, but they can also be stored in an airtight container for a few days or even frozen for longer storage.

Hypothesis: They receive a lot of cargo ships every week. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Alright, kiddo, let's think about it like this: A \\"premise\\" is like a fact or an idea we know to be true. In this case, the premise is that there are \\"ports.\\" Ports are like special parking spots for big boats (called cargo ships) where they bring in things from faraway places. Now, a \\"hypothesis\\" is a guess we make based on the premise. In this case, we're guessing that these ports receive a lot of cargo ships every week. To see if the premise \\"entails\\" the hypothesis, we need to know if the fact that they are ports means that they will always receive a lot of cargo ships every week. Since ports are made for cargo ships to park and unload their stuff, it's likely that they get a lot of those big boats coming in. But, we can't be 100% sure. Sometimes, ports might be small or not very busy, and they won't receive a lot of ships.

Doyle and Onuora made a positive start but it was Diamond's speed on the third leg, after a slow changeover, that pushed Britain into medal contention. The United States and Jamaica were ahead for the majority of the race but Ohuruogu's push on the final leg ensured GB won the struggle for bronze. American Allyson Felix, meanwhile, claimed her sixth track and field gold medal, making her the fifth most decorated female Olympian in any discipline. It is the first time since 1996 Russia have not featured in the top three, after their track and field team were banned from competing in Rio. Bronze means British athletics has hit its pre-Rio target of seven medals. This will be the last Olympics for Ohuruogu, who hinted at retirement after failing to qualify for the women's 400m final.

Answer the following question: Information: - Jean-Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert (16 November 1717 29 October 1783) was a French mathematician, mechanician, physicist, philosopher, and music theorist. Until 1759 he was also co-editor with Denis Diderot of the \\"Encyclopédie\\". D'Alembert's formula for obtaining solutions to the wave equation is named after him. The wave equation is sometimes referred to as d'Alembert's equation. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Jean - Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert ( / dælmbr / ; French : ( batist l dalb ) ; 17 November 1717 -- 29 October 1783 ) was a French mathematician , mechanician , physicist , philosopher , and music theorist . Until 1759 he was also co-editor with Denis Diderot of the Encyclopédie . D'Alembert 's formula for obtaining solutions to the wave equation is named after him . The wave equation is sometimes referred to as d'Alembert 's equation . - Pythagoras of Samos ( or simply ; in Ionian Greek) was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and the putative founder of the movement called Pythagoreanism. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos. - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC). - Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers (\\"Encyclopaedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts\\") was a general encyclopedia published in France between 1751 and 1772, with later supplements, revised editions, and translations. It had many writers, known as the \\"Encyclopédistes\\". It was edited by Denis Diderot and, until 1759, co-edited by Jean le Rond d'Alembert. - Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz). - The Encyclopédistes were members of the Société des gens de lettres, a French writer's society, who contributed to the development of the \\"Encyclopédie\\" from June 1751 to December 1765 under editors Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. The composition of the 17 volumes of text and 11 volumes of plates of the \\"Encyclopédie\\" was the work of over 150 authors belonging, in large part, to the intellectual group known as the philosophes. They promoted the advancement of science and secular thought and supported tolerance, rationality, and open-mindedness of the Enlightenment. - The wave equation is an important second-order linear partial differential equation for the description of wavesas they occur in physicssuch as sound waves, light waves and water waves. It arises in fields like acoustics, electromagnetics, and fluid dynamics. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Denis Diderot (5 October 171331 July 1784) was a French philosopher, art critic, and writer. He was a prominent figure during the Enlightenment and is best known for serving as co-founder, chief editor, and contributor to the \\"Encyclopédie\\" along with Jean le Rond d'Alembert. - In physics, sound is a vibration that propagates as a typically audible mechanical wave of pressure and displacement, through a transmission medium such as air or water. In physiology and psychology, sound is the \\"reception\\" of such waves and their \\"perception\\" by the brain. Humans can hear sound waves with frequencies between about 20 Hz and 20 kHz. Sound above 20 kHz is ultrasound and below 20 Hz is infrasound. Other animals have different hearing ranges. - The 6th century BC started the first day of 600 BC and ended the last day of 501 BC.

When teenage E.B. leaves for Hollywood in pursuit of his dream to become a rock star drummer, he meets Fred, an out-of-work slacker with his own lofty goals. Together the two encounter a series of hilarious mishaps and misadventures and in the end help each other recognize the importance of family.________________________________________________________________________________________On Easter Island, a young rabbit named E.B. (Russell Brand) is intended to succeed his father, Mr. Bunny (Hugh Laurie), as the Easter Bunny. Intimidated by the calling's demands, E.B. runs away to Hollywood to pursue his dream of becoming a drummer. Mr. Bunny sends his three ninja royal guards, the Pink Berets, to find his son. Meanwhile, Easter Chicks Carlos and Phil (Hank Azaria) plot a coup d'état against Mr. Bunny to take over the Easter organization. Wandering through Van Nuys, E.B. is hit by Fred O'Hare (James Marsden), an out-of-work, job-hopping slacker (who is being pressured by his family to \\"get a job\\") who was driving to his sister Sam's (Kaley Cuoco) boss's house he's housesitting. Feigning injury, E.B. persuades Fred to take him in as he recovers, but when E.B. causes trouble Fred attempts to abandon him in the wilderness. E.B. persuades the human to help him by claiming to be the Easter Bunny, whom Fred saw in operation in his youth. The rabbit sees the Berets closing in on him and hides inside a business where Fred is having job interview. E.B. enjoys a successful recording session with the Blind Boys of Alabama as their substitute drummer, but ruins Fred's job interview. In the process, E.B. gets a tip about a possible audition for David Hasselhoff, who invites him to perform on his show.

Vaca is almost over.","completion":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mix of inquisitive, light-hearted, and slightly melancholic. To break it down further, let's analyze the different elements of the tweet: 1. Inquisitive - The tweet starts with \\"@libraritarian59 What's on the agenda today?\\". This indicates that the person is asking a question, hence showing curiosity and wanting to know about the other person's plans for the day. The inquisitive nature highlights a sense of engagement and interest in the other person's life. 2. Light-hearted - The informal language and acronym usage (\\"Vaca\\" as the short form for \\"vacation\\") indicate that the tweet has a casual and light-hearted tone. The person isn't overly formal or demanding while waiting for the response. Instead, they are open and friendly, expecting a light-hearted and informal conversation. 3. Slightly melancholic - The second part of the tweet, \\"Vaca is almost over\\", suggests that the person’s vacation is nearing its end. This information implies a hint of sadness or melancholy because vacations are usually associated with relaxation and positive experiences. The phrase \\"almost over\\" might lead to a sense of disappointment that the enjoyable time is coming to an end. In summary, this tweet's sentiment can be best characterized as inquisitive and light-hearted with a subtle underlying tone of melancholy. The tweet demonstrates a desire for conversation, cheerful engagement, and acknowledgement of the temporary nature of pleasurable experiences such as vacations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here are possible answers to this question: - communication - fun - understood - ease tension - suffering I believe the correct choice is \\"understood\\", here's why:","completion":"\\"Understood\\" seems to be the most appropriate response to the question, \\"Sometimes just expressing yourself is the best way to be what?\\" In this case, we will break down each of the possible answer choices and explain why \\"understood\\" is the optimal choice. 1. Communication: While the act of expressing oneself contributes to the communication process, simply communicating does not necessarily imply full comprehension. Communication is a broader term encompassing a two-way exchange of information, feelings, or ideas. Expression, on the other hand, is a subset and fundamental aspect of communication. Thus, although communication is significant, it does not directly address the question at hand. 2. Fun: While expressiveness may lead to enjoyable conversations or interactions, the direct correlation is less clear, and enjoyment relies on other factors as well. Expressing oneself doesn't inherently imply having fun, so it isn't the best-fit response. 3. Understood: Expressing oneself can indeed lead to mutual understanding between parties. When individuals voice their thoughts and feelings, others can grasp their intentions, emotions, and viewpoints. Misunderstandings or misinterpretations are more likely when someone's expression is stifled or unclear. Consequently, being \\"understood\\" is in line with the idea of expressing oneself. 4. Ease tension: Expressing oneself can occasionally ease tension in certain situations. However, this isn't always the case since self-expression can sometimes escalate conflicts or create tension when diverse opinions or emotions arise. Easing tension may depend on context, tone, and timing, among other factors. As a result, this is not the most suitable response. 5. Suffering: Expressing oneself does not inherently imply suffering. Suffering may arise from various sources, such as external events or emotions. While expressing oneself may help alleviate suffering in some contexts (like expressing grief or venting frustration), suffering is not a direct result of self-expression. Thus, it isn't the best response to this question. In conclusion, it's evident that \\"understood\\" is the most fitting response to the question. By expressing oneself, individuals increase the likelihood of being understood by others. This understanding fosters empathy, compassion, and deeper connections. While the other answer choices may be tangentially related to self-expression, they do not directly address the core of the question as effectively as \\"understood\\" does."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: who made a makeshift hospital? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Keys of the Kingdom Context: Father Francis Chisholm (Gregory Peck) is visited in his old age by Monsignor Sleeth (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) at his parish in Tweedside. The Monsignor informs Father Francis that the Bishop thinks it would be better if he retires, as Father Francis' somewhat unorthodox recent teachings have become a distraction. The Monsignor retires to his room in the rectory, and finds Father Francis' diary that recounts his story from 1878. As the Monsignor begins to read the diary, a flashback begins. One night during his childhood, Francis' father was beaten by an anti-Catholic mob during a rainstorm. As his mother attempts to lead her husband to safety, they both die in a bridge collapse, leaving young Francis an orphan. He is raised by his aunt, and the next we see of Francis, he is leaving for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm \\"Angus\\" Mealey (Vincent Price). Francis studies at seminary for a year, but is unsure about all of the Church's teachings. He still finds himself in love with Nora, a girl from his home. However, he finds out that after he left, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, and she dies before Francis can return to see her. This prompts him to go back to seminary and follow through with his studies, and Francis becomes a priest. Francis' first two assignments as a priest are unfulfilling to him, so the Bishop asks Francis to be a volunteer missionary to China. Francis readily accepts the position, even though that means it would take him far from home as well as far from Judy, Nora's daughter. Francis arrives in Paitan, Chekhow Province in China to find the mission destroyed by floods, and not rebuilt because the true Christians all left, leaving only those who attended to receive free rice. Because the Church hadn't given the mission money for rice in over a year, \\"the faith left them when the rice gave out.\\" Francis rents a small room in the city to evangelize, but because he has no money or influence, he is attacked by those same \\"rice Christians\\" who were supposed to help...","completion":"Step 1: Identify the question - Who made a makeshift hospital?

The answer \\"knows more about Jesse\\" does not provide any details about the events or experiences that Robin might have while wearing the costume. A valid answer would potentially address how people will react to Robin's costume, whether the costume will be well-received at the party, if the costume will lead to any interactions or conversations between Robin and other party guests, or if the costume will affect Robin's overall enjoyment of the Halloween party. For example, if the costume Jesse made for Robin is high-quality or particularly unique, Robin might receive compliments and positive reactions from others at the party. This could lead to more interactions, conversations, and potentially new friendships.

Was looking for a good dog on this side of town, and happened into Chicago Bob's. I read the few reviews and decided to try the place. Let me begin by saying they ripped off the few good places in town, the way the menu reads, but the food is not as good as others. The Chicago Dog was over cooked. I have been eating these dogs for over 40 years and I can tell when one sits around too long. This one just had that \\"overcooked\\" flavor to it. I also had two sliders. They are nothing like a few of the other places in town and have a weird after taste to them. As Patrick E said, NOTHING EVEN CLOSE to white castle. Chicago Hamburger or Sweet Home Chicago is the place for Sliders. The fries were mushy and not made correctly for Homemade Fries. The best Homemade Fries in the valley are either Chicago Hamburger Co or Johnnies on Thomas. These fries were dark and nasty tasting. I was surprised that none of the employees even cared to ask how we liked our food. To sum it up; The store looks like a typical Chicago place, but the food is not even close. I think Vienna should really look at who represents their product because this is yet another disappointment in the Chicago Food Experience....Choices: (I). negative. (II). positive. I think the answer is","completion":"(I). negative. The sentiment of the review is decidedly negative. This can be deduced from the various critical comments made by the reviewer. There are clear expressions of dissatisfaction with almost every aspect of their dining experience at Chicago Bob's. Firstly, the reviewer begins by stating that the restaurant seems to have copied other successful establishments in town as indicated by the menu, however, it fails to deliver the quality of food that these other places offer. In essence, the reviewer expresses disappointment about the lack of originality and lesser quality of food at Chicago Bob's compared to others. They specifically critique the Chicago Dog for being overcooked, arguing from a position of authority as they claim to have been consuming these for over 40 years. The word \\"overcooked\\" and the quotation marks around it suggest a strong negative sentiment. Furthermore, their complaint about the sliders having a weird aftertaste underlines their dissatisfaction about the taste and quality of the food. They also compare these negatively to those found at other locations, indicating that they have a reference point and have found Chicago Bob's lacking. The reviewer's criticism extends beyond the main meals to encompass the side dishes, stating that the homemade fries were mushy, incorrectly made, dark and nasty tasting. This is another negative statement directed towards the quality of the food. The choice of words like \\"mushy\\", \\"dark\\" and \\"nasty tasting\\" add to the overall negative sentiment of the review. The reviewer also expresses disappointment with the level of customer service, pointing out that none of the employees asked about their dining experience. This presents an image of indifference from the staff which is another negative aspect mentioned by the reviewer. Finally, the last part of the review reinforces the negative sentiment by stating that while the store looks like a typical Chicago place, the food does not live up to this image. The reviewer concludes by arguing that the brand the restaurant represents (Vienna) should reconsider who is representing their product, implying that Chicago Bob's is not doing a good job. In sum, the reviewer mostly uses negative words and phrases and does not express any enjoyment or satisfaction with the food or service at the restaurant.

These attacks aimed at causing significant damage to infrastructure and morale, resulting in civil leaders fleeing the cities before the offensive reached its peak. However, the Luftwaffe's efforts eased in the last 10 attacks as seven Kampfgruppen (combat groups) were relocated to Austria in preparation for the Balkans Campaign in Yugoslavia and Greece. Due to the shortage of bombers, the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL, the German Air Force High Command) had to improvise.

While the defences in the targeted Western ports failed to prevent widespread damage, they occasionally managed to hinder German bombers from concentrating on their targets.

(3). mobiles should not be banned in public places. (4). it is possible to ban the use of mobiles in public places. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: While they were almost unknown twenty years ago, it seems that mobile phones these days are part of everyone's life. However, as with other inventions such as the television and the computer, they are a double-edged sword, inviting both supporters and opponents, especially in regard to their use in public places like restaurants and cinemas. One of the strongest arguments in favor of forbidding mobiles in public places is the trouble they cause to other people. For example, although we are often asked to turn off our phones when in a cinema, the film that we are watching is often interrupted by the sound of at least five rings. To make it even worse, some people insist on continuing their conversation, even though hundreds of people can hear what they say, which often drowns out the voice from the film. As a result, many people would welcome a ban on mobile phones in places where they might disturb other people. On the other hand, there are a number of arguments against such a ban. It is difficult to stop people bringing with them their mobile phones in public places, making it almost impossible to call for a ban. Some people would see this as an infringement of their rights, while other people would say they need them in case of an emergency. Despite being asked to silence their phones, some people insist on leaving them on. It seems to me that a ban on mobile phones would not have any result in the end. People will find a way to escape a ban. Nevertheless, people should be discouraged from using them in public places, unless it is highly necessary. They should be made to know that it is bad manners to use them in certain places or at certain times.

Wilson (Erica Gavin) is nabbed by the cops and sent to prison in this slick and amusing example of prime 70's exploitation, marking the directing debut of Jonathan Demme. After writing and producing a few of mentor Roger Cormans' New World films, Demme was afforded the opportunity to direct for the first time, and he delivers a movie that not only delivers the expected and tasty doses of nudity and violence, but has an appealing tongue-in-cheek quality to it as well; it's often as funny as it is flashy. Standout scenes include a lewd and crude vaudeville style act performed for the prisoners, as well as a potent dream / fantasy sequence for uptight and obviously very repressed Superintendent McQueen (horror icon Barbara Steele, doing a marvelous turn in this antagonistic role). I also enjoyed a bank robbery scene gone haywire and a carjacking scene that was simply uproarious. As in other movies of this kind, it's also commendable that it's as much a portrait of female empowerment as it is pure exploitation. These women are tough, they take no garbage from anybody, and they're more than capable of handling themselves. Our attractive cast here makes the most of their roles: Juanita Brown as the aggressive Maggie, Roberta Collins as the sassy Belle, Rainbeaux Smith as the cute and timid Lavelle, Gavin as the wide-eyed newcomer, and Lynda Gold (a.k.a. Crystin Sinclaire) in a bright appearance as an accomplice on the outside. As our climax plays out, Demme comes up with a tense \\"beat the clock\\" finish as our heroines race to save Belle from being lobotomized by predatory Dr. Randolph (Warren Miller), the type of man who thinks nothing of taking advantage of women. Bouncing along to John Cales' flavorful score, \\"Caged Heat\\" is upbeat entertainment and a guaranteed good time. 8/10 Choose your answer.

Q:Information: - An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft. - Colombia (or ), officially the Republic of Colombia, is a transcontinental country largely situated in the northwest of South America, with territories in Central America. Colombia shares a border to the northwest with Panama, to the east with Venezuela and Brazil and to the south with Ecuador and Peru. It shares its maritime limits with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It is a unitary, constitutional republic comprising thirty-two departments. The territory of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by indigenous peoples including the Muisca, the Quimbaya and the Tairona. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - A gill is a respiratory organ found in many aquatic organisms that extracts dissolved oxygen from water and excretes carbon dioxide. The gills of some species, such as hermit crabs, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area to the external environment. - A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be \\"in mothballs\\" or \\"mothballed\\"; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is \\"ghost fleet\\". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be \\"laid up in ordinary\\". - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe. - The winghead shark (\\"Eusphyra blochii\\") is a species of hammerhead shark, and part of the family Sphyrnidae. Reaching a length of , this small brown to gray shark has a slender body with a tall, sickle-shaped first dorsal fin. Its name comes from its exceptionally large \\"hammer\\", or cephalofoil, which can be as wide as half of the shark's total length. The function of this structure is unclear but may relate to the shark's senses. The wide spacing of its eyes grants superb binocular vision, while the extremely long nostrils on the leading margin of the cephalofoil may allow for better detection and tracking of odor trails in the water. The cephalofoil also provides a large surface area for its ampullae of Lorenzini and lateral line, with potential benefits for electroreception and mechanoreception respectively. - Costa Rica (literally meaning \\"Rich Coast\\"), officially the Republic of Costa Rica, is a country in Central America, bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and Ecuador to the south of Cocos Island. It has a population of around 4.5 million, of whom nearly a quarter live in the metropolitan area of the capital and largest city, San José. - Lampreys (sometimes also called, inaccurately, lamprey eels) are any jawless fish of the order Petromyzontiformes, placed in the superclass Cyclostomata. The adult lamprey may be characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth. The common name \\"lamprey\\" is probably derived from Latin \\"lampetra\\", which may mean \\"stone licker\\" (\\"lambere\\" \\"to lick\\" + \\"petra\\" \\"stone\\"), though the etymology is uncertain. - Malpelo is a small island in the East Pacific Ocean, located about west of the Colombian mainland. Except for a small military post that is manned by the Colombian Armed Forces, it is uninhabited. It consists of a sheer and barren rock with three high peaks, the highest being \\"Cerro de la Mona\\" with a height of . The island is about one mile in length from northeast to southwest, and 700 yards in width. - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service . - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A fin is a thin component or appendage attached to a larger body or structure. Fins typically function as foils that produce lift or thrust, or provide the ability to steer or stabilize motion while traveling in water, air, or other fluid media. Fins are also used to increase surface areas for heat transfer purposes, or simply as ornamentation. - Molokai or Molokai (Hawaiian: ), often called the \\"Friendly Island\\", is an island in the Hawaiian archipelago. It is 38 by 10 miles (61 by 16 km) in size at its extreme length and width with a usable land area of , making it the fifth-largest of the main Hawaiian Islands and the 27th largest island in the United States. It lies east of Oahu across the 25-mile (40 km) wide Kaiwi Channel and north of Lnai, separated from it by the Kalohi Channel. - Hawaii is the 50th and most recent state to have joined the United States of America, having received statehood on August 21, 1959. Hawaii is the only U.S. state located in Oceania and the only one composed entirely of islands. It is the northernmost island group in Polynesia, occupying most of an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean. Hawaii is the only U.S. state not located in the Americas. - Cocos Island is an island designated as a National Park off the shore of Costa Rica, that does not allow inhabitants other than Costa Rican Park Rangers. It constitutes the 11th of the 13 districts of Puntarenas Canton of the province of Puntarenas. It is located in the Pacific Ocean, approximately from the Pacific shore of Costa Rica. With an area of approximately , about and a perimeter of around , this island is more or less rectangular in shape. - Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river. - A tunicate is a marine invertebrate animal, a member of the subphylum Tunicata, which is part of the Chordata, a phylum which includes all animals with dorsal nerve cords and notochords. The subphylum was at one time called Urochordata, and the term urochordates is still sometimes used for these animals. Some tunicates live as solitary individuals, but others replicate by budding and become colonies, each unit being known as a zooid. They are marine filter feeders with a water-filled, sac-like body structure and two tubular openings, known as siphons, through which they draw in and expel water. During their respiration and feeding, they take in water through the incurrent (or inhalant) siphon and expel the filtered water through the excurrent (or exhalant) siphon. Most adult tunicates are sessile, and are permanently attached to rocks or other hard surfaces on the ocean floor; others, such as salps, doliolids and pyrosomes, swim in the pelagic zone of the sea as adults. Various species are commonly known as sea squirts, sea pork, sea livers, or sea tulips. - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. - USS Hammerhead ( SSN - 663 ) , a Sturgeon - class submarine , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the hammerhead shark , a voracious fish found in warm seas , with a curious hammerlike head . - In cryptography, SHARK is a block cipher identified as one of the predecessors of Rijndael (the Advanced Encryption Standard). - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - The hammerhead sharks are a group of sharks in the family Sphyrnidae, so named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into a \\"hammer\\" shape called a cephalofoil. Most hammerhead species are placed in the genus Sphyrna while the winghead shark is placed in its own genus, Eusphyra. Many not necessarily mutually exclusive functions have been proposed for the cephalofoil, including sensory reception, manoeuvering, and prey manipulation. Hammerheads are found worldwide in warmer waters along coastlines and continental shelves. Unlike most sharks, hammerheads usually swim in schools during the day, becoming solitary hunters at night. Some of these schools can be found near Malpelo Island in Colombia, Cocos Island off Costa Rica, and near Molokai in Hawaii. Large schools are also seen in the waters off southern and eastern Africa.

Born Lucille Fay LeSueur in San Antonio, Texas, the youngest and third child of Anna Bell (Johnson) and Thomas E. LeSueur, a laundry laborer. She was of English, French Huguenot, Swedish, and Irish ancestry. Crawford's elder siblings were sister Daisy LeSueur, who died before Lucille's birth, and brother Hal LeSueur. Crawford's father abandoned the family a few months before her birth, reappearing later in 1930 in Abilene, Texas, reportedly working as a construction laborer. In 1970, Crawford was presented with the Cecil B. DeMille Award by John Wayne at the Golden Globes, which was telecast from the Coconut Grove at The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. She also spoke at Stephens College, where she had been a student for two months in 1922. Crawford published her autobiography, A Portrait of Joan, co-written with Jane Kesner Ardmore, in 1962 through Doubleday. Crawford's next book, My Way of Life, was published in 1971 by Simon & Schuster. Those expecting a racy tell-all were disappointed, although Crawford's meticulous ways were revealed in her advice on grooming, wardrobe, exercise, and even food storage. Upon her death there were found in her apartment photographs of John F. Kennedy, for whom she had voted for in the 1960 presidential election. In September 1973, Crawford moved from apartment 22-G to a smaller apartment next door (22-H) at the Imperial House, 150 East 69th Street. Her last public appearance was made on September 23, 1974, at a party honoring her old friend Rosalind Russell at New York's Rainbow Room. Russell was suffering from breast cancer and arthritis at the time. When Crawford saw the unflattering photos that appeared in the papers the next day, she said, \\"If that's how I look, then they won't see me anymore.\\" Crawford cancelled all public appearances, began declining interviews and left her apartment less and less. Dental-related issues, including surgery which left her needing round-the-clock nursing care, plagued her from 1972 until mid-1975. While on antibiotics for this problem in October 1974, her drinking caused her to pass out, slip and strike her face. The incident scared her enough to give up drinking, although she insisted that it was because of her return to Christian Science. The incident is recorded in a series of letters sent to her insurance company held in the stack files on the 3rd floor of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts; it is also documented by Carl Johnnes in his biography of the actress, Joan Crawford: The Last Years. When it came to personal politics, Crawford aligned herself as a Democrat who greatly supported, and admired, the administrations of John F. Kennedy and Franklin D. Roosevelt. She was once noted as saying: \\"The Democratic party is one that I've always observed. I have struggled greatly in life from the day I was born and I am honored to be a part of something that focuses on working class citizens and molds them into a proud specimen. Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Kennedy have done so much in that regard for the two generations they've won over during their career course.\\" Ask a question about this article.","completion":"What was the nature of Joan Crawford's relationship with her parents and siblings, and how did her early life experiences shape her acting career and personal life?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"How distant were the black students at Harvard to their ancestors?\\" Context: \\"During a panel discussion at Harvard University's reunion for African American alumni during the 2003–04 academic year, two prominent black professors at the institution—Lani Guinier and Henry Louis Gates—pointed out an unintended effect of affirmative action policies at Harvard. They stated that only about a third of black Harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the African American community. The majority of black students at Harvard were Caribbean and African immigrants or their children, with some others the mixed-race children of biracial couples. One Harvard student, born in the South Bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations, said that there were so few Harvard students from the historic African American community that they took to calling themselves \\"the descendants\\" (i.e., descendants of American slaves).

The two lines then separate vertically, one going up and another going down to meet with the end of the \\" l \\". Explanation: In this scenario, the story is about the step-by-step process of drawing an impossible cube. The next logical step, following the construction on the parallelogram and the \\"l\\", would be to continue building upon the existing lines of the shape.

Now let's examine why the other answer choices are incorrect: (A) We are in the process of drawing an impossible cube, not decorating it with smiley faces. Smiley faces aren't contained within the steps to draw the structure of an impossible cube. (B) The mention of lines forming a \\"stalk\\" doesn't fit the context of drawing an impossible cube. An impossible cube doesn't consist of parts that can be referred to as a \\"stalk.\\" (D) The shading and marking of the cube can be a part of the final steps but at this point, we are still constructing the cube.

President Donald Trump is shifting his focus back to domestic issues after returning late Tuesday from a 12-day trip to Asia. This week, Trump will resume pressing congressional Republicans to pass a tax reform measure to follow through on one of his key campaign promises. Trump appears to be working closely with Republican congressional leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. \\"We ran in 2016 on doing this tax reform,\\" Ryan told reporters at the Capitol. \\"The president ran on doing this tax cut and tax reform. So this is about fulfilling our promises to the American people.\\" However, since the president was last in the country, he and his Republican allies in Congress face a new political landscape in the wake of last week's gubernatorial election victories by Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey. In Virginia, exit polls showed that many voters were motivated primarily by their opposition to the president. \\"The fact that the president is so polarizing and so unpopular with approval ratings generally under about 40 percent, and Democrats are going to be extra-motivated to come out,\\" said University of Virginia political analyst Kyle Kondik. Kondik said the strong Democratic showing in statewide races in Virginia last week was the best non-presidential election showing for the party since 2006, the last time Democrats nationally won control of the House of Representatives.

Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album--\\"One of Us Must Know ( Most accounts of recording Blonde on Blonde, including those by Dylan scholars Clinton Heylin and Michael Gray, agree that there were two blocks of recording sessions: February 14-17 and March 8-10, 1966. This chronology is based on the logs and files kept by Columbia Records. Dylan and the Hawks performed concerts in Ottawa, Montreal, and Philadelphia in February and March, and then Dylan resumed recording in Nashville on March 8. On that date, Dylan and the musicians recorded the take of \\"Absolutely Sweet Marie\\" that Dylan selected for the album. Historian Sean Wilentz observed that \\"with the sound of 'Sweet Marie', Blonde on Blonde entered fully and sublimely into what is now considered classic rock and roll\\". The same day saw the successful takes of \\"Just Like a Woman\\", and \\"Pledging My Time\\", the latter \\"driven by Robertson's screaming guitar\\". According to Wilentz the final recording session, on March 9-10, produced six songs in 13 hours of studio time. The first number to be recorded to Dylan's satisfaction was \\"Most Likely You Go Your Way and I'll Go Mine\\", when McCoy reinforced on trumpet a musical phrase Dylan played on his harmonica, changing the sound of the song radically. Dylan and his band then quickly recorded \\"Temporary Like Achilles\\". The session atmosphere began to \\"get giddy\\" around midnight when Dylan roughed out \\"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\\" on the piano. Johnston recalled commenting; \\"That sounds like the damn Salvation Army band\\". Dylan replied; \\"Can you get one?\\" Johnston then telephoned trombonist Wayne Butler, the only additional musician required, and Dylan and the band, with McCoy again on trumpet, played a high-spirited version of the song. In quick succession Dylan and the musicians then recorded \\"Obviously 5 Believers\\" and a final take of \\"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\\" powered by Robertson's lead guitar. The session concluded with \\"I Want You\\" on which, as Wilentz notes, \\"Wayne Moss's rapid-fire sixteenth notes on the guitar\\" are an impressive element of the recording.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was one of their songs?","completion":"One of their songs is \\"Absolutely Sweet Marie,\\" which was recorded on March 8 during the sessions for Blonde on Blonde."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.

Q:Information: - Kamenz is a town (\\"Große Kreisstadt\\") in the district of Bautzen in Saxony, Germany. Until 2008 it was the administrative seat of Kamenz District. The town is known as the birthplace of the philosopher and poet Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. - Rolf Huisgen (born 13 June 1920) is a German chemist. He was born in Gerolstein in the Rhineland-Palatinate and studied in Munich under the supervision of Heinrich Otto Wieland. After completing his Ph.D. in 1943 and his habilitation in 1947, he was named professor at the University of Tübingen in 1949. He returned to the University of Munich in 1952 where he remained dedicated to research long after attaining emeritus status in 1988. - In organic chemistry, functional groups are specific groups (moieties) of atoms or bonds within molecules that are responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of those molecules. The same functional group will undergo the same or similar chemical reaction(s) regardless of the size of the molecule it is a part of. However, its relative reactivity can be modified by other functional groups nearby. The atoms of functional groups are linked to each other and to the rest of the molecule by covalent bonds. Any subgroup of atoms of a compound also may be called a radical, and if a covalent bond is broken homolytically, the resulting fragment radicals are referred as free radicals. Functional groups can also be charged, e.g. in carboxylate salts (-COO), which turns the molecule into a polyatomic ion or a complex ion. - The Steglich esterification is a variation of an esterfication with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide as a coupling reagent and 4 - dimethylaminopyridine as a catalyst . The reaction was first described by Wolfgang Steglich in 1978 . It is an adaptation of an older method for the formation of amides by means of DCC ( dicyclohexylcarbodiimide ) and 1 - hydroxybenzotriazole ( HOBT ) . This reaction generally takes place at room temperature . A suitable solvent is dichloromethane . Because the reaction is mild , esters can be obtained that are inaccessible through other methods for instance esters of the sensitive 1,4 - dihydroxybenzoic acid . A characteristic is the formal uptake of water generated in the reaction by DCC , forming the urea compound dicyclohexylurea ( DCU ) . - The connectivity of a molecule often has a strong influence on its physical and chemical properties and behavior. Two molecules composed of the same numbers of the same types of atoms (i.e. a pair of isomers) might have completely different chemical and/or physical properties if the atoms are connected differently or in different positions. In such cases, a structural formula is useful, as it illustrates which atoms are bonded to which other ones. From the connectivity, it is often possible to deduce the approximate shape of the molecule. - Habilitation is a post-doctoral qualification or academic degree at some European and Central Asian, North African, and Latin American universities. It is conferred for a habilitation thesis based on independent scholarship, which was reviewed by and successfully defended before an academic committee in a process similar to that of a doctoral dissertation. In some countries, a habilitation degree is a required formal qualification to independently teach and examine a designated subject at the university level. - An amide (or or ), also known as an acid amide, is a compound with the functional group RE(O)NR (R and R refer to H or organic groups). Most common are carboxamides (organic amides) (\\"n\\" = 1, E = C, \\"x\\" = 1), but many other important types of amides are known, including phosphoramides (\\"n\\" = 2, E = P, \\"x\\" = 1 and many related formulas) and sulfonamides (E = S, \\"x\\" = 2). The term amide refers both to \\"classes of compounds\\" and to the \\"functional group\\" (RE(O)NR) within those compounds. - The University of Bonn is a public research university located in Bonn, Germany. Founded in its present form in 1818, as the linear successor of earlier academic institutions, the University of Bonn is today one of the leading universities in Germany. The University of Bonn offers a large number of undergraduate and graduate programs in a range of subjects. Its library holds more than five million volumes. The University of Bonn has 544 professors and 32,500 students. Among its notable alumni and faculty are seven Nobel Laureates, three Fields Medalist, twelve Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize winners, Prince Albert, Pope Benedict XVI, Frederick III, Karl Marx, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich Nietzsche, Konrad Adenauer, and Joseph Schumpeter. The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2016 and the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2015 ranked the University of Bonn as one of the 100 best universities in the world. - Life. Wolfgang Steglich was born in Kamenz and studied chemistry at the Technical University of Berlin and later at the Technical University of Munich where he received his PhD in 1959 for work with Friedrich Weygand. After his habilitation at the Technical University of Munich he became professor at the Technical University of Munich in 1969 where he stayed until he became professor at the University of Bonn in 1975. He succeeded Rolf Huisgen as head of the organic chemistry department of the University of Munich in 1991. He retired in 2001. - The Technical University of Munich (TUM) is a research university with campuses in Munich, Garching and Freising-Weihenstephan. It is a member of TU9, an incorporated society of the largest and most notable German institutes of technology. - Pyridine is a basic heterocyclic organic compound with the chemical formula CHN. It is structurally related to benzene, with one methine group (=CH) replaced by a nitrogen atom. The pyridine ring occurs in many important compounds, including azines and the vitamins niacin and pyridoxine. - 4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) is a derivative of pyridine with the chemical formula (CH)NCHN. This colourless solid is of interest because it is more basic than pyridine, owing to the resonance stabilisation from the NMe substituent. - The Technische Universität Berlin, known as TU Berlin and unofficially as the Technical University of Berlin, is a research university located in Berlin, Germany. It was founded in 1879 and became one of the most prestigious education institutions in Europe.

In 1973, a year before that film was released, producer Tom Miller was instrumental in Winkler getting cast for the role of Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli, nicknamed \\"The Fonz\\" or \\"Fonzie\\", in Happy Days, which first aired in January 1974. For Happy Days, director/producer Garry Marshall originally had in mind a completely opposite physical presence. Marshall sought to cast a hunky, blonde, Italian model-type male in the role of Fonzie, intended as a stupid foil to the real star, Ron Howard. However, when Winkler interpreted the role in auditions, Marshall immediately snapped him up. According to Winkler, \\"The Fonz was everybody I wasn't. He was everybody I wanted to be.\\" Winkler's character, though remaining very much a rough-hewn outsider, gradually became the focus of the show as time passed (in particular after the departure of Ron Howard). Initially, ABC executives did not want to see the Fonz wearing leather, thinking the character would appear to be a criminal. The first 13 episodes show Winkler wearing two different kinds of windbreaker jackets, one of which was green. As Winkler said in a TV Land interview, \\"It's hard to look cool in a green windbreaker\\". Marshall argued with the executives about the jacket. In the end, a compromise was made. Winkler could only wear the leather jacket in scenes with his motorcycle, and from that point on, the Fonz was never without his motorcycle until season 2. Happy Days ended its run in 1984. Question: How long did the show last for? Answer:","completion":"Happy Days, an American television sitcom, first aired in January 1974 and had a successful run until its conclusion in 1984. The show lasted for 11 seasons, during which it entertained viewers with its unique blend of humor, drama, and nostalgia. Throughout its run, Happy Days showcased the lives and experiences of a group of friends and family members living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and captured the essence of American life in the 1950s and 1960s. The show gained significant popularity, with memorable characters such as Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli (The Fonz or Fonzie), played by Henry Winkler, and Richie Cunningham, portrayed by Ron Howard."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Washington (CNN) -- The estate of the late actress Anna Nicole Smith has lost a Supreme Court appeal in a longstanding fight to secure a share of her deceased husband's fortune. The 5-4 ruling Thursday was the latest chapter in a tedious legal soap opera, over the kind of evidence a separate bankruptcy court may hear when deciding various claims and counterclaims. State courts generally hear probate cases, while bankruptcy proceedings are confined to federal courts. The high court's 38-page decision will now likely put an end to this particular legal dispute. J. Howard Marshall was married to the much younger Smith, who is named in court papers as Vickie Lynn Marshall, for 14 months before he died in 1995. His will left nearly all assets and trust to his son from a previous marriage, E. Pierce Marshall, and Smith received virtually nothing. She later sued, claiming her elderly husband promised to give her more than 300 million. A state probate court also dismissed her claims, saying","completion":"that there was insufficient evidence to support Smith's claims that J. Howard Marshall had indeed promised her such a significant portion of his estate. The case continued to take numerous turns over the years, with various appeals and legal filings made by both sides, each attempting to gain the upper hand in the drawn-out battle for the late billionaire's fortune. Ultimately, the Supreme Court's ruling emphasizes the importance of abiding by the legal standards set forth by both state and federal courts in addressing complex probate and bankruptcy matters, as well as the necessity for clear and convincing evidence when making claims on a deceased individual's estate. This decision serves as a reminder that even though individuals may verbally express their intentions concerning their assets, it is essential for those intentions to be properly documented and executed through a legally binding instrument, such as a will or trust, to ensure the accurate distribution of wealth upon one's passing. In the case of Anna Nicole Smith, the failure to provide sufficient evidence to corroborate her allegations has ultimately left her estate unable to stake a claim to her late husband's fortune, forcing an end to this long-standing legal saga."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(WSVN) -- When an officer caught a woman speeding through a West Boynton Beach school zone and issued her a ticket, the driver cursed the officer out, and it was all caught on the police dashcam. The driver's harsh statements were all caught on the deputy's dashcam, and that video has now gone viral. According to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, driver Joy Feinberg was speeding 30 miles over the speed limit. The sheriff said that her comments, regardless of the situation, were uncalled for. He said the officer was not rude to Feinberg, and her comments were unacceptable. She was driving a white Subaru. When she speeds by the deputy's cruiser, he turns on his lights and sirens and makes a U-turn to make the traffic stop. When Feinberg pulled over, she asked the deputy what she did. He responded, \\"You just went 51 miles an hour in a school zone.\\" After her attempts to get out of the ticket fails, she begins to beg. \\"I'm begging you,\\" she said. \\"I promise I won't do it again. I really wasn't aware.\\" The deputy is firm and hands her a citation for 606. And when she realizes her pleas were not working, the next few words were not as pleasant. \\"You know what?

(Dillon Freasier), travels the state to buy the drilling rights to private property.At a meeting with local people of an unidentified town, Plainview lectures them on his business plan: he claims he does all the work himself, only hires men he can trust to complete the work and will eliminate the need for a \\"contractor\\", a middleman of sorts that will collect more money from the community that Daniel believes should go back to the landowners themselves. He also introduces his son as his partner and claims that his business is a family-run operation. When the people begin to question him rigorously and argue loudly among themselves, Daniel turns down the offer and leaves, knowing the community is a bit too smart to be taken advantage of.Daniel later meets with a husband and wife and draws up a contract to drill on their land. The couple are reluctant but Daniel appeals to them by talking about their children.

Here is a brief explanation of each option and why \\"decay\\" is more suitable: 1. Decay: This term implies a natural process of breaking down or deteriorating due to exposure to moisture, fungus, or other factors. Since the wallpaper is wet, it implies that it has started to break down due to the moisture, making \\"decay\\" the most appropriate option in this context. 2. Ruin: Although \\"ruin\\" can also imply damage or destruction, it is a more general term and does not provide as much specificity as \\"decay.\\" Ruin can occur due to various reasons, and it doesn't necessarily imply the progressive breakdown associated with decaying material. 3. Throw away: This option refers to discarding or disposing of something, which is not relevant to the deterioration of the wet wallpaper. 4. Destroy: Destruction is a more aggressive and intentional act, like smashing or tearing something apart. Unlike \\"decay,\\" it does not capture the natural process of deterioration that occurs when wallpaper gets wet. 5. Waste: This term is not relevant to the condition of the wet wallpaper because \\"waste\\" implies a misuse or inefficient use of resources.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Two geology students had an exam on plate tectonics. Bobby learned more about divergent tectonic plates, while Nate was more confident in explaining everything about Convergent plates. Which student knew more about seafloor spreading? Hint: Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 5–9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 5 cm/year. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the hint, seafloor spreading is primarily associated with divergent tectonic plates. This geologic process occurs when oceanic plates diverge and new oceanic crust forms due to rising magma that cools and solidifies. Considering that Bobby learned about divergent tectonic plates and Nate focused on convergent plates, it can be concluded that Bobby knew more about seafloor spreading. Seafloor spreading is a critical component of the overall understanding of plate tectonics - a scientific theory that explains the large-scale movement of Earth's lithosphere. It involves the continuous formation of new oceanic crust and the movement of older crust away from the spreading zones, resulting in the Earth's continents gradually drifting apart or toward each other. Seafloor spreading not only provides insight into continental drift but also contributes to the understanding of various other geological phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, and formation of mountain ranges. As Bobby's focus was divergent tectonic plates - where plates pull away from each other - he had a better understanding of seafloor spreading. This is because seafloor spreading mainly takes place along mid-ocean ridges, which are clear manifestations of divergent plate boundaries. The driving force behind this process is the tensional stress caused by tectonic plate pull, which results in fractures within the lithosphere. Furthermore, different spreading rates dictate whether the mid-ocean ridges are classified as fast, intermediate, or slow. These classifications provide valuable information on the rate at which new oceanic crust is being formed and subsequently, how different tectonic plates interact with each other. In contrast, Nate's focus on convergent tectonic plates deals more with the process of plates moving towards and colliding with each other, resulting in various regional geologic features such as mountain ranges, subduction zones, and volcanic arcs. While converging plates also play a critical role in the overarching theory of plate tectonics, their relationship to seafloor spreading is not as direct as that of the divergent plates studied by Bobby. In conclusion, based on their respective areas of focus within the study of plate tectonics, Bobby, who learned about divergent tectonic plates, had a more comprehensive understanding of seafloor spreading compared to Nate, who focused on convergent plates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: but now that we have children and we go every blue moon i'd rather just go to Galveston Here is a hypothesis: We go every once in a while after having kids. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. Let's break down both statements to better understand the connection. Premise: \\"But now that we have children and we go every blue moon, I'd rather just go to Galveston.\\" The premise presents three relevant points: 1. The speaker has children now. 2. The speaker goes on trips every blue moon, which is an idiomatic expression indicating a rare occurrence or infrequently. 3. Given point 2, the speaker would prefer going to Galveston, which implies going somewhere might be more challenging after having kids or that Galveston might be a more family-friendly or accessible location than other destinations. Hypothesis: \\"We go every once in a while after having kids.\\" The hypothesis proposes that the speaker and their family go on trips infrequently or occasionally after having children. This idea aligns with point 2 of the premise, as both \\"every blue moon\\" and \\"every once in a while\\" suggest a low frequency of trips. Based on these observations, if we assume the premise as true, the hypothesis also holds true, as it captures the essence of the frequency of trips after having to adjust to the new responsibilities and lifestyle changes that come with raising children. Given the premise, the hypothesis does not directly address the preference for going to Galveston. However, it is still consistent with the broader idea that the family's schedule and preferences have changed as a result of having children."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Scott) addresses an unseen audience of American troops, (based on his speech to the Third Army). The film version of the speech is heavily condensed, with much of the original vulgarity removed. Following the humiliating American defeat at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass in 1943, Patton is placed in charge of the American II Corps in North Africa. Upon his arrival, he enforces discipline amongst his troops, e.g. fining a cook 20 for not wearing his army issue leggings. Patton is then summoned to a meeting with Air Marshal Coningham of the Royal Air Force, where he claims that the American defeat was caused by lack of air cover. Coningham promises Patton that he will see no more German aircraft - but seconds later the compound is strafed by Luftwaffe planes. Patton then defeats a German attack at the Battle of El Guettar; his aide Captain Jenson is killed in the battle, and is replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Codman. Patton is bitterly disappointed to learn that Erwin Rommel, Commander of the German-Italian Panzer Army, was on medical leave due to having diphtheria, but Codman reassures him that: \\"If you've defeated Rommel's plan, you've defeated Rommel\\". After success in the North Africa campaign, Patton and Bernard Law Montgomery plan the Allied invasion of Sicily. Patton's proposal to land his Seventh Army in the northwest of the island with Montgomery in the South-East (therefore potentially trapping the German and Italian forces in a pincer movement), initially impresses their superior General Alexander, however Eisenhower rejects it in favour Montgomery's more cautious plan, which places Patton's army in the South-East, covering Montgomery's left flank. Whilst the landing is successful, the Allied forces become bogged down, causing Patton to defy orders and push his army northwest to Palermo, and then to the port of Messina in the northeast, narrowly beating Montgomery to the prize, although several thousand German and Italian troops are able to flee the island.

Answer:","completion":"[a]. Rebecca is a bug lover. Upon coming across a millipede on their hike, Rebecca's excitement couldn't be contained as she took a picture of the magnificent creature, her admiration for bugs evident in the sparkle in her eyes. As a bug lover, Rebecca saw beauty in these often overlooked and misunderstood creatures, appreciating their roles in the ecosystem and the unique features that made them so extraordinary. Elena, on the other hand, had quite a different reaction. Just as Rebecca had captured the perfect shot of the millipede, Elena inadvertently stepped on the tiny arthropod. Although she didn't mean to harm the creature, it was clear that Elena didn't share the same passion for bugs as Rebecca did. Even with this incident, Rebecca was undeterred in her infatuation with the insect world. She continued to educate her friends about the importance of bugs and how they served as critical links in the chain of life. From pollinators like butterflies and bees to decomposers like beetles and millipedes, Rebecca recognized that the world wouldn't be the same without these tiny beings. Elena too started to change her perspective on bugs, with Rebecca's enthusiasm and knowledge slowly rubbing off on her. Together, they embarked on numerous hikes, discovering and documenting the countless insects along their way, contributing to the preservation and appreciation of these often-underappreciated creatures. Thus, having selected the answer \\"[a].

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Gaelic Ireland (Irish: Eire Ghaidhealach) was the Gaelic political and social order, and associated culture, that existed in Ireland from the prehistoric era until the early 17th century. Before the Norman invasion of 1169, Gaelic Ireland comprised the whole island. Thereafter, it comprised that part of the country not under foreign dominion at a given time. For most of its history, Gaelic Ireland was a \\"patchwork\\" hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs, who were elected through tanistry. Throughout the Middle Ages, the common clothing amongst the Gaelic Irish consisted of a brat (a woollen semi circular cloak) worn over a leine (a loose-fitting, long-sleeved tunic made of linen). For men the leine reached to their ankles but was hitched up by means of a crios (pronounced 'kriss') which was a type of woven belt. The leine was hitched up to knee level. (Gaelicattire.com) Women wore the leine at full length. Men sometimes wore tight-fitting trews (Gaelic triubhas) but otherwise went bare-legged. The brat was simply thrown over both shoulders or sometimes over only one. Occasionally the brat was fastened with a dealg (brooch), with men usually wearing the dealg at their shoulders and women at their chests. The ionar (a short, tight-fitting jacket) became popular later on. In Topographia Hibernica, written during the 1180s, Gerald de Barri wrote that the Irish commonly wore hoods at that time (perhaps forming part of the brat), while Edmund Spenser wrote in the 1580s that the brat was (in general) their main item of clothing. Gaelic clothing does not appear to have been influenced by outside styles. Women invariably grew their hair long and, as in other European cultures, this custom was also common among the men. It is said that the Gaelic Irish took great pride in their long hair--for example, a person could be forced to pay the heavy fine of two cows for shaving a man's head against his will. For women, very long hair was seen as a mark of beauty. Sometimes, wealthy men and women would braid their hair and fasten hollow golden balls to the braids. Another style that was popular among some medieval Gaelic men was the glib (short all over except for a long, thick lock of hair towards the front of the head). A band or ribbon around the forehead was the typical way of holding one's hair in place. For the wealthy, this band was often a thin and flexible band of burnished gold, silver or findruine. When the Anglo-Normans and the English colonized Ireland, hair length came to signify one's allegiance. Irishmen who cut their hair short were deemed to be forsaking their Irish heritage. Likewise, English colonists who grew their hair long at the back were deemed to be giving in to the Irish life. Gaelic men typically wore a beard and mustache, and it was often seen as dishonourable for a Gaelic man to have no facial hair. Beard styles varied - the long forked beard and the rectangular Mesopotamian-style beard were fashionable at times.

The town's inhabitants open it and release a deadly microorganism, which is later codenamed Andromeda by the Army. A team is sent from the Army's bio-defense department to retrieve the satellite, only to die from the disease themselves. The video footage recorded by the retrieval team and their strange deaths capture the attention of General George Mancheck, the head of the bio-defense department, who activates \\"Wildfire,\\" a team of five scientists who are called upon when high-level bioterror threats occur in the United States.

What type of dog is Beethoven in the film franchise of that name ?","completion":"Beethoven, the main canine character from the film franchise of that name, is a Saint Bernard. The Saint Bernard is a large and powerful breed of dog that was originally bred in the Western Alps, particularly in Switzerland and Italy. The breed is known for its incredible strength, impressive size, intelligence, and gentle disposition. The Saint Bernard gained international recognition in the early 18th century when monks at the Great Saint Bernard Hospice, a monastery located at a treacherous Alpine pass between Switzerland and Italy, bred these dogs as rescue and working animals. They were known for their incredible ability to locate and rescue lost travelers buried beneath avalanches or stuck in snowstorms. Saint Bernards are massive dogs, with adult males generally weighing between 140 to 180 pounds and standing 28 to 30 inches tall at the shoulder. Females tend to be slightly smaller, weighing between 120 to 140 pounds with a height ranging from 26 to 28 inches. Despite their large size, these dogs have a calm and gentle nature, making them an excellent choice for families. The breed's distinctive appearance is characterized by a dense, muscular body, large skull, and powerful jaws. Their fur can be either short and smooth or medium-length and slightly wavy, with colors ranging from reddish-brown to brindle, and often including varying amounts of white. The Saint Bernard’s facial expression is typically very warm and friendly, which is a key part of the breed's endearing appeal. In the \\"Beethoven\\" film franchise, Beethoven, the lovable and mischievous Saint Bernard, is portrayed by a series of dogs. The first two \\"Beethoven\\" films starred a dog named Chris, who was followed by different Saint Bernards in later installments. Beethoven's adventures bring laughter and warmth to audiences, showcasing his innate intelligence, loyalty, and companionship. The lovable character of Beethoven has not only brought attention to the gentle nature of Saint Bernards but also helped raise awareness about the responsibilities of caring for such a large and powerful dog. Potential owners should consider the breed's exercise requirements, living space, grooming needs, and a general understanding of the Saint Bernard’s temperament when deciding if this breed would make a suitable addition to their family. Overall, the \\"Beethoven\\" film franchise has given the Saint Bernard breed a prominent place in popular culture, introducing audiences around the world to the appealing qualities of this historical, charming, and endearing dog breed."},{"prompt":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Question: who killed julius caesar?

While Stafford was still working for Dorsey, Johnny Mercer told her, \\"Some day I'm going to have my own record company, and you're going to record for me.\\" She subsequently became the first solo artist signed to Capitol after leaving the Pied Pipers in 1944. A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub. Her performance was well-received—an article in the July 1945 edition of Band Leaders magazine described it as \\"sensational\\"—but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played. Speaking about her discomfort with live performances, Stafford told a 1996 interview with The New Yorker's Nancy Franklin, \\"I'm basically a singer, period, and I think I'm really lousy up in front of an audience—it's just not me.\\"Stafford's tenure with the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II—which often saw her perform for soldiers stationed in the U.S.—led to her acquiring the nickname \\"G.I.

She replied personally to all the letters she received from servicemen.

Forrest Lucas, husband of Charlotte Lucas, wrote the letter, published as an advertisement this week, after RTV6 broke the story of her Facebook post. The post talked about how minorities should not be running the country. \\"I'm sick and tired of minorities running our country!\\" Lucas wrote in the post. \\"As far as I'm concerned, I don't think that atheists (minority), muslims [sic] (minority) nor any other minority group has the right to tell the majority of the people in the United States what they can and cannot do here. Is everyone so scared that they can't fight back for what is right or wrong with his country?\\" The next day, Charlotte issued an apology for the post. Thursday morning, Forrest Lucas put out an ad (in the form of a letter), explaining what had happened and how he and Charlotte were trying to move forward. The advertisement read: Dear Friends: Many of you know the story of how Charlotte and I started Lucas Oil from nothing in 1989. Over the last 25 years, Lucas Oil has achieved success with many oil products, developed a strong, supportive presence in motorsports, expanded into ranching and media operations, and became naming rights holder for the stadium that the Indianapolis Colts call home. Lucas Oil remains a family-owned business with manufacturing and distribution facilities in our home state of Indiana. Lucas Oil is proud to have employees, friends, customers and business partners reflecting ethnic and racial diversity. Charlotte and I have been extremely fortunate, and we have found many ways to give back to the community. Among many other things, we have funded groups that provide opportunities and benefits for veterans, women, minorities and disadvantaged youth. We have supported causes that promote education and seek cures for cancer, diabetes, paralysis and other health problems. Unfortunately, this week, Lucas Oil has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. The media reported a story about a posting Charlotte made on her Facebook page in which she included statements directed to minority special interest groups. Although it was not Charlotte's intent to offend anyone, her comments were harsh and insensitive. Her words were hurtful to many and disappointing to all. Make no mistake, Charlotte feels extremely saddened by her actions and regrets the posting. She has issued an apology with the hope that it will be accepted as sincere. The reality is that the message posted on Charlotte's Facebook page does not reflect the feelings in her heart. Those who know Charlotte appreciate that she is a caring and loving person who has great respect for everyone. We thank those who have consoled Charlotte in this time of turmoil and have encouraged her to learn from her mistake. Lucas Oil will continue to focus on all of its positive business activities and events. We will use this opportunity to examine our diversity efforts and to strengthen our relationships with minority leaders and organizations. We appreciate the patience and understanding of the community as we make progress in these areas.

Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. and the situation: Bimmy and Harold are both four years old and are about to start attending school. Before that though, it is important that they have adequate supplies to be prepared. Bimmy's parents, who both have worn glasses their whole lives, took him to the store to pick up folders and pencils. While there, they bumped into Harold and his parents, who do not wear glasses. They quickly exchanged hellos before moving on with their shopping. Answer the following question: Which boy will more likely struggle to see the chalkboard when they start school? Answer:","completion":"Bimmy will more likely struggle to see the chalkboard when they start school. The background information states that there is evidence that myopia (nearsightedness) is inherited, and if one or both of a child's parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that the child will too. Since both of Bimmy's parents have worn glasses their whole lives, he is at a higher risk of developing nearsightedness compared to Harold, whose parents do not wear glasses. Additionally, myopia commonly first occurs in school-age children. However, it is also important to note that there's no certainty about Bimmy or Harold developing nearsightedness, but based on the given factors, Bimmy is more likely to struggle to see the chalkboard."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found out this morning over breakfast. Suicide. Walter. I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it. Suicide. Walter wasn't suicidal. I know that, know it for a fact. But he is dead. Why? I am not foolish enough to suspect \\"foul play\\" as they say in the mystery stories. No one cares enough about a community college art teacher to murder him. But suicide? Something is wrong here. Very wrong. April 2, 2006 I didn't realize until this morning that yesterday was April Fools day. Some kind of sick joke? But that's not like Walter either. He was a little crazy, but not that kind of crazy. Still I keep half expecting to pick up my voice and hear his voice yell, \\"Gotcha!\\" But it is no joke. I know he is dead. (Later) Got a package today. From Walter. Scary considering what I wrote about expecting him to call. I can't express the chill I got when I saw his name on the label. A message from the dead. Surely it's not a good Omen. It's a painting. Or at least I think it is. The package is the right shape, and knowing Walter it seems likely, but...I haven't yet worked up the courage to open it yet. I'm afraid of what I might find. April 3, 2006 Went to the funeral today. Walter's wife, Martha, was in hysterics. Can't say I blame her. It was awkward being there seeing someone in the most vulnerable possible condition. I didn't know her that well. Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away. After five years of friendship it's the least Walter deserves of me. One other thing. The package. It's still sitting there in my study. Mocking me. That's how it feels anyway. Should...

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. In which reservoir a good portion of the water would most likely not be replaced? There are two hydroelectric dams in North Dakota. Both of them has large lakes or reservoirs, reservoir A and reservoir B. Since North Dakota has one the lowest unemployment rates in the country, it's hard to find an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoirs. This year reservoir A could hire an engineer, but reservoir B failed to find an engineer. As a result, there is no one to regulate reservoir B. The engineer for reservoir A let the water out in the fall. But there was no one to do that for reservoir B. Hint: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. Answer:","completion":"Reservoir B would most likely not have a good portion of the water replaced.

If you are afraid of the dark,it's not a big deal.It's perfectly normal to feel afraid After all,animals do too. \\"Fear matters,\\"says Karen Warkentin,an ecologist.\\"It's a good thing,\\" she adds, \\"because fear makes you do things that keep you alive.\\" Like kids,many animals experience fear and they respond to the feeling in variety of ways.A frightened turtle pulls its head and legs inside its shell.A small fish will swim away when a big,hungry fish approaches. Some animals respond to fear in ways you might not expect.The first example is that the fear of being eaten can scare some frogs right out of their eggs. Warkentin made the surprising discovery while studying red--eyed tree frogs in Costa Rica. In this species,female frogs attach jellylike clumps of their eggs to the undersides of leaves.The leaves hang on branches that dangle over ponds.After they hatch from the eggs,the tadpoles then fall into the water,where they eventually grow into adult frogs. Tree frog eggs usually grow for 6 days before hatching.If they sense that a hungry snake is about to attack,however,they can hatch up to 2 days ahead of schedule. As the snakes are unable to swim,by falling into the water early,the tadpoles can escape. If hatching early helps protect red--eyed tree frogs from snakes,you might wonder why their eggs don't always hatch sooner.It turns out that hatching early brings its own danger.Once tadpoles land in the water,hungry fish and other animals like to eat them too.Staying in their eggs for a full 6 days,then,allows frog embryos to grow big and strong.This extra growth improves their chances of surviving in the water.

If Indicated is a way of implying he said it while indicating he must not have actually said it., can we conclude that \\"He boldly confirmed that he had said it.\\"?","completion":"To determine if we can conclude that \\"He boldly confirmed that he had said it,\\" let's break down and analyze the statement step-by-step: 1. Understand the problem: The statement suggests that the word \\"indicated\\" implies that someone both said something and that they might not have actually said it. We are asked whether that statement allows us to conclude that \\"He boldly confirmed that he had said it.\\" 2. Identify the key elements: a. Indicated: This implies that someone conveyed a message or an idea through various means, not necessarily direct or verbal communication. b. Boldly confirmed: This implies that someone explicitly and confidently stated or acknowledged a fact or their involvement in an action. 3. Compare the key elements: a. Indication vs. confirmation: Indication is an indirect way of communicating a message or an idea, while confirmation is a direct statement validating a particular fact. Therefore, they are not equivalent. b. Boldness: Boldness can be associated with confidence. If someone is bold in making a statement, they are doing so assertively and without doubt. 4. Analyze the given scenarios: a. The statement \\"Indicated is a way of implying he said it while indicating he must not have actually said it\\" can be understood in two different ways: i. The person indirectly communicated that they said something but did not explicitly state it. ii. The person indicated that they were misunderstood or that their words were taken out of context. b. In either interpretation, the person did not \\"boldly confirm\\" that they had said something. Instead, they either indirectly communicated their involvement or expressed that their words were misconstrued. Based on this analysis, we cannot conclude that \\"He boldly confirmed that he had said it.\\" The use of \\"indicated\\" suggests indirect communication or a level of ambiguity, while \\"boldly confirmed\\" implies direct and confident affirmation. These two expressions describe different actions and cannot be equated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

These two equations are: 1) x + y = 2 2) x^2 + y^2 = 2 We can solve them by first squaring the first equation (x + y)^2, which results in x^2 + 2xy + y^2. Since x^2 + y^2 = 2 (from the second given equation), we can replace this in our new equation, simplifying it to 2 + 2xy = 4, which simplifies further to xy = 1.

He played for three National Football League (NFL) teams: the St. Louis Rams, the New York Giants, and the Arizona Cardinals. He was originally signed by the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent in 1994 after playing college football at Northern Iowa. Warner went on to be considered the best undrafted NFL player of all time, following a 12-year career regarded as one of the greatest stories in NFL history. On January 3, 2009, Warner led the Cardinals in their victory over the Atlanta Falcons 30-24 at home in the first round of the playoffs. During the game Warner went 19 for 32 passing, a completion percentage of 59.4%, for 271 yards. He threw two touchdowns and one interception. This win represented the first time the Cardinals had won a post-season home game since the 1947 NFL Championship Game. On January 10, Warner helped the Cardinals defeat the Carolina Panthers 33-13 in Charlotte, North Carolina in the second round of the playoffs. During the game Warner went 21 for 32 passing, for 220 yards, a completion percentage of 65.6%, with two touchdowns and one interception. This win was the first time the Cardinals had won a game on the East Coast the entire 2008 season, after having lost away games to the Panthers, Washington Redskins, Philadelphia Eagles, New York Jets, and the New England Patriots. On January 18, Warner threw for 279 yards, four touchdowns, and no interceptions against the Philadelphia Eagles to lead the Cardinals to their first Super Bowl appearance in history. Warner is one of three quarterbacks who made Super Bowl starts with two different teams (the others are Craig Morton [1970: Dallas Cowboys and 1977: Denver Broncos] and Peyton Manning [2006 & 2009: Indianapolis Colts and 2013 & 2015: Denver Broncos]). Warner also became the third quarterback in NFL history to win a conference championship with two different teams (following Craig Morton and Earl Morrall). In Warner's third career Super Bowl appearance on February 1, the Cardinals lost Super Bowl XLIII 27-23 to the Pittsburgh Steelers, leaving him with a career 1-2 record in Super Bowls. Despite losing, Warner still managed to throw for 377 yards (the fourth-highest total in Super Bowl history). He completed 72.1% of his passes, and had a quarterback rating of 112.3. Warner had now recorded the three highest single-game passing yardage totals in the history of the Super Bowl, and joined Roger Staubach, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, John Elway, and Tom Brady as the only quarterbacks to throw a touchdown pass in three different Super Bowls. Warner had taken his team to the Super Bowl every year that he played as the starting quarterback during all regular and post season games.

Who was Fred Astaire's dancing partner in the musical film The Band Wagon","completion":"Fred Astaire's dancing partner in the musical film The Band Wagon (1953) was the talented actress, dancer, and singer Cyd Charisse. Cyd Charisse, born Tula Ellice Finklea, was an American actress primarily known for her work in the Golden Age of Hollywood musicals. She made her film debut in 1943 with small roles in two films, but it was in the 1950s that her talents as a dancer were showcased in numerous film projects. Charisse gained significant acclaim for her dancing skills and performances alongside notable legends Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly in a series of successful musical films. In The Band Wagon, directed by Vincente Minnelli, Fred Astaire starred as Tony Hunter, a washed-up Hollywood star who returns to the Broadway stage as part of a last-ditch effort to revive his career. Cyd Charisse played the role of Gabrielle Gerard, a gifted and sophisticated ballerina who becomes Astaire's co-star and love interest in a grand show-within-a-show. The movie is a tribute to the behind-the-scenes experiences of creating theater productions and the personal lives of individuals involved in the entertainment industry. Throughout The Band Wagon, Astaire and Charisse's incredible on-screen chemistry, dancing prowess, and acting abilities are prominently displayed. One of the most memorable dance sequences is the \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" number, which has become iconic in the history of film. The two dazzled with their emotional performance, seamlessly blending acting, singing, and dancing. Their beautiful ballet and tap dance routines, enhanced by Charisse's grace and elegance, along with Astaire's finesse and charm, make for a perfect pairing across various musical numbers in the film. The Band Wagon, featuring the wonderful music by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz, went on to become one of MGM's most prestigious and beloved film musicals, earning three Academy Award nominations and an avid fan-following. The on-screen partnership between Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse in this movie remains a touchstone for subsequent musical films and represents the height of Hollywood's Golden Age of musicals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Haug said it being \\"a pretty inoffensive song musically\\" helped Powderfinger make that decision. \\"The Day You Come\\" spent nine weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #25.The second single was the double a-side, \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out/Good-Day Ray\\", released on 9 November 1998. \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out\\", a song about a friend of Fanning's who had difficulty in social situations, was one of the roughest Powderfinger songs to date. 'Don't Wanna Be Left Out' could be comfortably ranked with other Powderfinger songs such as 'Lighten My Load' and 'Rise Up'.

The music video for \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out\\" was unpopular and drew criticism from band members. \\"Good-Day Ray\\" was dedicated to Australian television presenter Ray Martin and his public disagreements with former Media Watch host Stuart Littlemore.

They say that the quality of life is as important as life itself and that people should not be forced to go on living when conditions of life have become unbearable .

The article discusses the advancements in medical technology that have resulted in people being able to live longer. However, this development has sparked a debate about the right to die and who should make this decision. On one side, there are people, including some doctors, who believe in the importance of considering the quality of life, and that an individual should have the right to decide when they want to die if their conditions become unbearable. They argue that people should be allowed to die with dignity and make their own choices regarding their lives. On the other hand, there are those who hold the view that life in any condition is preferable to death, and that it is the responsibility of doctors to prolong life wherever possible. This standpoint prioritizes the sanctity of life and the doctors' role in sustaining it. Despite the ongoing disagreement between these two sides, one of the central ideas put forth by some people is that the patient should have the right to decide whether or not they wish to continue living under unbearable circumstances. In this scenario, the choice should rest with the patient themselves, rather than being made by doctors, their surrounding environment, or close friends.

Q:As a mother, I’m right now navigating the hardest moment with my two daughters and my son … I was raped at 15 and molested by a teacher from 15–16 … it took 13 years of fighting before I saw any justice for those crimes and it paled in comparison to having to live with that trauma for the last 25 years. I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

Remember to keep nurturing their emotional well-being and offering them a safe space to express their feelings and concerns. In doing so, you are fostering their mental and emotional growth while also reinforcing their understanding of the importance of communication and support. It is evident that you are an incredibly strong and inspiring mother, and your children will undoubtedly learn a great deal from you about overcoming adversity, fighting for justice, and supporting others in need.

When the diaphragm contracts during inhalation, it creates a negative pressure within the chest cavity, allowing the lungs to expand and draw in air. When the diaphragm relaxes during exhalation, the pressure within the chest cavity increases, and the lungs naturally contract, pushing out air. This process of breathing is also referred to as \\"belly breathing\\" as it involves the diaphragmatic movement.

The circle is never round.” This sentence, taken from the film “Before the Rain’’ by Milcho Manchevski (Golden Lion Award in Venice, 1994), refers to history happening again and again through different facts and people. It is this concept that permeates the narrative of photojournalist Calogero Russo‘s photographs of East Berlin 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and its reunification with West Germany. A city can choose to weave its past into its new future, understanding that this new tapestry only strengthens its history and culture relevance. Or it can bury that past quietly under newly-erected buildings, roads and cafes to blot out its past transgressions. But it can never fully be erased. And East Berlin in the past 25 years, according to Russo, “is a city that doesn’t run away from its past in the “Deutsche Demokratische Republik” (DDR). On the contrary, it lives with it.” “OST: Berlin” the title of Russo’s photo series, is a play on the word “Ostalgie,” a term referring to nostalgia for parts of German culture and life. All across the city of Berlin today, one can find old portraits of Erich Honecker, the former first general secretary of East Germany’s Social Unity Party who led the country from 1971 until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, in hotel rooms or painted on the sides of buildings. Food products that were once popular are now being sold once again in the new supermarkets. The most requested rental cars by tourists today? The old Lada and Trabant, which was created in East Berlin in the 1950s and which many East Berliners later drove over the Berlin wall when it fell. People like to go to the Soviet Memorial in Treptower Park for a walk, or to the abandoned fun fair for a weekend picnic. Cafès and restaurants furnished in pure DDR style, and the former Stasi headquarters, have now become touristic attractions. The lure of this nostalgia could be advantageous toward driving tourism as East Germany continues to build its economy as West Germany has. And newer landmarks, cars and cafes also bump against the Lenin-era architecture. Calogero has been documenting East Berlin’s transformation since April 2014, and is producing a fanzine that will be published on the anniversary of the fall in November.

However, despite his achievements, Napoleon was often depicted as short in stature, which became a popular talking point and subject of mockery over the years. Alfred Adler, an Austrian psychotherapist and a contemporary of Sigmund Freud, developed a theory known as \\"individual psychology.\\" He focused on the concept of feelings of inferiority and the compensatory behaviors people exhibit as a response to those feelings. As part of his theory, Adler introduced the idea of the Napoleon Complex or Napoleon Syndrome. This term refers to the tendency of some shorter individuals, particularly men, to overcompensate for their perceived shortcomings in height by acting more aggressively, asserting dominance, or seeking positions of power. According to Adler's theory, the Napoleon Complex arises from a sense of insecurity and self-doubt caused by societal expectations and prejudices linked to height. Consequently, some shorter individuals may develop a heightened sensitivity to their stature, leading them to adopt behaviors that counterbalance these perceptions of inadequacy. It is important to note that while the Napoleon Complex has become a widely-recognized term in popular culture, modern research on the subject presents mixed findings on the validity of the concept. In conclusion, Alfred Adler coined the term \\"Napoleon Complex\\" or \\"Napoleon Syndrome\\" in 1908, citing French leader Napoleon Bonaparte as the inspiration behind the concept. This syndrome refers to the supposed inclination of some short individuals to feel inferior due to their height, leading them to exhibit compensatory behaviors such as aggressiveness, dominance-seeking, and power ambitions. Although the Napoleon Complex has become a well-known idea, scientific research on its validity remains inconclusive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: A 19 year-old Marine from Riverside has died in Iraq, becoming the second U.S. military member to die as the U.S. fights the advance of Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. Lance Cpl. Sean P. Neal, a specialist in the use of mortars, died in a “non-combat related incident” Thursday in Baghdad, the Department of Defense announced Friday. The incident is under investigation. Neal, who enlisted in 2013, was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment at Twentynine Palms. The battalion deployed last month to the Middle East as part of what Marines call a Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force. The task force is meant to bolster the “crisis response capability” in the region. The announcement of Neal’s death marks the first indication that Marines from the task force are in Iraq. In its Sept. 30 announcement about the deployment of the 2,300 Marines of the task force, the U.S. Central Command said that it was \\"not in response to the ongoing operations in Iraq\\" and that the Marines would be spread to several spots in the region. Central Command said late Friday that there are approximately 150 Marines from the task force assigned to Iraq to provide additional security for U.S. personnel and facilities. President Obama has insisted that there will be no U.S. ground combat troops in Iraq, but last month the administration approved sending additional troops to the Iraqi capital to bolster diplomatic security for State Department officials at the Baghdad embassy compound and its support facilities. Not counting Marines from the special task force, the U.S. force in Iraq is now about 1,400. The death of Neal, and the deployment of task force Marines to Iraq, indicates the key role that Marines and sailors from California bases are playing in the U.S. mission. Earlier this month, Cpl. Jordan Spears, 21, from the San Diego-based 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, became the first U.S. fatality in the mission that the Pentagon recently dubbed Operation Inherent Resolve. Spears bailed out of an MV-22 Osprey aircraft in the Persian Gulf when it appeared on the verge of crashing. After searching for two days the Navy declared Spears as “lost at sea.” From 2003 to 2011, 345 Marines and sailors from Camp Pendleton and 115 from Twentynine Palms died in Iraq. The administration has steadily increased its efforts against the Islamic State militants as they have seized large swaths of western and northern Iraq and threatened Iraq's government and the semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Plans for the task force crisis response unit began in summer of 2013, months before the assault on Iraq by Sunni militants under the banner of setting up an Islamic caliphate, the Marine Corps said. The force will be headquartered in Kuwait, Col. Kenneth DeTreux told the newspaper Stars and Stripes. Kuwait was the staging point for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein. The force includes infantry Marines from Twentynine Palms, fixed-wing and rotary aircraft from Miramar Marine Corps Air Station in San Diego, headquarters and logistics personnel from Camp Pendleton. Spears, from Memphis, was a crew member on the Osprey, which deployed to the Persian Gulf aboard the amphibious assault ship Makin Island. The Makin Island Amphibious Ready Group consists of three San Diego-based ships and 4,000 Marines and sailors. The Marines are the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit from Camp Pendleton. A week ago the carrier Carl Vinson, based at North Island Naval Air Station in Coronado, relieved the carrier George H.W. Bush in the Persian Gulf to continue the bombing mission of Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria. The Vinson’s air squadrons are from Naval Air Station Lemoore, near Fresno. The three destroyers and one cruiser with the Vinson are all from San Diego. The U.S. and coalition partners have launched more than 600 airstrikes since Aug. 8. @LATSandiego @wjhenn ||||| CAMP LEATHERNECK Afghanistan British troops ended their combat operations in Afghanistan on Sunday as they and U.S. Marines handed over two huge adjacent bases to the Afghan military, 13 years after a U.S.-led invasion launched the long and costly war against the Taliban. Their coming departure leaves Afghanistan and its newly installed president, Ashraf Ghani, to deal almost unaided with an emboldened Taliban insurgency after the last foreign combat troops withdraw by year-end. At the U.S. Camp Leatherneck and Britain's Camp Bastion, which lie next to each other in the southwestern province of Helmand, troops lowered the American and British flags for the final time on Sunday and folded them away. The timing of their withdrawal has not been announced for security reasons. Camp Leatherneck, the largest U.S. base to be handed over to Afghan control, and Camp Bastion together formed the international coalition's regional headquarters for the southwest of Afghanistan, housing up to 40,000 military personnel and civilian contractors. But on Sunday, the base resembled a dust-swept ghost town of concrete blast walls, empty barracks and razor wire. Offices and bulletin boards, which once showed photo tributes to dead American and British soldiers, had been stripped. \\"It's eerily empty,\\" said Lt. Will Davis, of the Queen's Dragoon Guards in the British Army. Camp Bastion was also where Prince Harry was based in 2012 as an Apache helicopter gunner. In all, 2,210 American soldiers and 453 British soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001, when the U.S.-led coalition toppled the Taliban government for harboring al Qaeda after the militant group carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The coalition has been led by NATO since 2003, and includes forces from Germany, Italy, Jordan and Turkey. After Sunday's ceremony, the Afghan National Army's 215th Corps will be headquartered at the 28 sq km (11 sq mile) base, leaving almost no foreign military presence in Helmand. The U.S. military is leaving behind about 230 million worth of property and equipment –- including a major airstrip at the base, plus roads and buildings -- for the Afghan military. \\"We gave them the maps to the place. We gave them the keys,\\" said Col. Doug Patterson, a Marine brigade commander in charge of logistics. Speaking on BBC television, British Defense Minister Michael Fallon said British armed forces had helped to strengthen the Afghan security forces, who were now taking on \\"full responsibilities\\". \\"It is with pride that we announce the end of UK combat operations in Helmand, having given Afghanistan the best possible chance of a stable future,\\" he said. \\"CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC\\" Helmand province, which produces 80-90 percent of the opium that helps finance the Taliban's insurgency, has seen fierce fighting this year, with Taliban and allied forces seeking to seize the district of Sangin from the Afghan army and police. The battles have raised concerns about whether Afghan forces are truly able to hold off the Taliban without intelligence and air support from the United States and its allies. Officials with the U.S.-led coalition say the Afghan forces, which have been losing hundreds of soldiers and policemen each month in battles, assassinations and suicide attacks by insurgents, did not lose any significant ground in the recent summer fighting season. \\"I'm cautiously optimistic they will be able to sustain themselves,\\" said Brig. Gen Daniel Yoo, the commander of Regional Command (Southwest). He said the success of the Afghan security forces depended on leadership, continued development of logistics and confidence. \\"They've got to want it more than we do,\\" he said. International forces in Afghanistan boosted their numbers to about 140,000 in 2010 troops with the aim of wresting control of Helmand back from the Taliban. By Jan. 1, that number will be about 12,500, comprising mostly trainers and advisers. Of those, 9,800 will be American, with the rest from other NATO members. The British will keep a small contingent at an officer training school in Kabul. Gen. John Campbell, head of coalition forces in Afghanistan, acknowledged Helmand \\"has been a very, very tough area\\" over the last several months. \\"But we feel very confident with the Afghan security forces as they continue to grow in their capacity,\\" he said. He said that the smaller international force that will remain next year will still provide some intelligence and air support, two areas where Afghan forces are weak. General Sher Mohammad Karimi, chief of staff of the Afghan National Army, also said the insurgency \\"will keep us busy for a while\\". \\"We have to do more until we are fully successful and satisfied with the situations,\\" he said. Civilian casualties in Afghanistan may reach an all-time high this year, with the United Nations reporting nearly 5,000 killed or wounded in the first half of 2014, most of them by the insurgency. Several Afghans at Sunday's ceremony expressed pride at taking over the base, mixed with sadness that the international forces with whom they have worked with for years are leaving for good. \\"We are going to miss our friends,\\" said Afghan Brig. Gen. Nasim Sangin. \\"But we will still be in touch by email.\\" (Writing by Raissa Kasolowsky; Editing by Michael Perry and Kevin Liffey) |||||Summary:","completion":"The article reports on the death of a 19-year-old Marine, Lance Cpl.

Given the question: This article: Hearst died in August 1951. The castle remained on the market for the following decade until bought in 1960 by Antonin Besse II, son of the late Sir Antonin Besse, and donated to the founding council of Atlantic College. Besse was a patron and honorary vice-president of the United World Colleges. The idea for an international school arose from a meeting between the educationalist Kurt Hahn, who founded Gordonstoun, and Air Marshal Sir Lawrence Darvall, the commandant of the NATO Defense College. They conceived of a college for 16–19-year-old students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding. With Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare, the first headmaster, they persuaded Besse that the castle would make a suitable location for the first United World College, which opened in 1962 with fifty-six students.The first rigid-hulled inflatable boat was patented by Hoare at St Donat's in the 1960s. In an act of generosity, Hoare sold the patent for the boat to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1973 for a notional £1; the RNLI's cheque was not cashed and remains at the castle. From 1963 until 2013 the castle hosted an RNLI lifeboat station which was credited with saving ninety-eight lives along the South Wales coast during its period of operation. The college's early years were financially precarious, but major fund-raising efforts led by Sir George Schuster strengthened the financial position in the mid-1960s.The fiftieth anniversary of the college in 2012 was celebrated with a visit to the site by Queen Noor of Jordan, President of the United World Colleges Foundation. As at 2017, the college was home to 350 students from more than 90 countries. The Hearst Corporation maintains a connection with St Donat's through a sponsorship programme for students at the college. With a history of occupation from its construction in the late 13th century, St Donat's has been described as the oldest continuously inhabited castle in Wales. contains an answer for the question: What are the full names of the two individuals who conceived of a college for students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding?, what is it ?

In a heart-stopping moment, a boy and girl found themselves within metres of two deadly animals, forced to retreat to the safety of their car when one of the creatures growled and lunged at them. Body: Chance Encounter in the Wild: The day started off innocently enough as the children embarked on an exciting photography expedition in Kruger National Park, a vast wildlife reserve situated in South Africa. As they eagerly explored their surroundings, their cameras at the ready, their journey took an unexpected turn. The boy and girl ventured closer and closer to two fierce animals, each intent on capturing a once-in-a-lifetime photograph of these magnificent beings. The Perilous Approach: Without realizing the gravity of the situation, the children inched nearer to the animals, eventually coming within mere metres of them. Although eager to document their encounter with the wild creatures, they soon found themselves faced with a startling reality: one of the animals had no intention of playing nice. The male of the pair growled menacingly, its posture suggesting imminent aggression. A Hasty Retreat: Reacting quickly, the kids retreated to their car as the animal lunged at them. The male's growl and sudden movement indicated its displeasure at the children's intrusion, forcing them to abandon their earlier excitement. Their initial excitement quickly turned to fear, and their photography session was cut short as they sought the safety of their vehicle. The Takeaway: The harrowing encounter in Kruger National Park acts as a clear reminder that, although the beauty of the natural world is undeniably captivating, dangers lurk near at all times. In this instance, the children were fortunate to escape unharmed, but their story serves as a cautionary tale for all would-be photographers who dare to voyage into these awe-inspiring yet perilous landscapes. Conclusion: As the boy and girl regale family and friends with tales of their close call, they will likely reflect on their experience with a newfound appreciation for the power and unpredictability of nature. Although they had hoped to immortalize their awe-inspiring encounter with these deadly predators through their cameras, they were ultimately able to capture an unforgettable memory that no photograph could do justice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"Bill learned more about symbiotic associations, as he studied mycorrhiza. Mycorrhiza is a symbiotic relationship between fungi and plant roots, where the fungi provide the plant with important nutrients like phosphorus and other minerals, while the plant supplies the fungi with carbohydrates and other organic compounds. This mutually beneficial relationship aids in the development and growth of both the organisms. On the other hand, Red studied hugelkultur, which is a horticultural technique involving the use of wood debris, such as fallen branches and logs, to create raised beds for plant growth. This technique improves soil fertility, water retention, and promotes decomposition, however, it does not inherently involve a symbiotic relationship between different organisms. While some symbiotic relationships may occur as a result of hugelkultur, they are not the primary focus of the technique.

He was born in Stoke Newington, London in spring 2003. He started up an Internet marble company where he sells the toys. And recently the 8-year-old student was written into the record books for being the youngest founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of an Internet company. Harli's love for marbles got rolling when he was 6. According to Tina, Harli's mother, he loved the colcorful toys so much that he would go to sleep talking about marbles and the first thing in the morning he did was talking about marbles. And his family started calling him \\"the Marble King\\". \\"I like the patterns and designs of marbles. You can collect hundreds of different color1s, shaps, and sizes. It's fun,\\" Harli told WR News. \\"And I really enjoy looking at them, touching them, holding them, studying them and playing them with my friends.\\" Harli Jordean's marble company has a long history. After losing his marbles to an older boy, Harli and his mom turned to the Internet for ordering more marbles. However, they couldn't find a Web site that sold the toys. That gave Harli an idea-to start a Web site where people could find different types of marbles. With his family's help, Harli created a Web site that sells marbles and marble accessories. His collection includes tiny and large marbles, along with clear and color1ful ones. Since starting his business, Harli has learned how to work with marble suppliers and fill orders. In the past two years, he's received orders from customers around the world. Some of the countries where he has sold the most marbles are Brazil, Italy, and the United States. Most kids just love marbls! So how does Harli feel about being the world's youngest CEO? \\"It feels marvelous . I like having my own company.

Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What caused Edison's Amberol cylinder to fail? Context: In 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced, followed in 1903 by 12-inch records. These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing). A:","completion":"The failure of Edison's Amberol cylinder was mainly caused by the competition of discs introduced during the 1910s.

This victory was facilitated further when in 1919, the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records expired, leading to an open field for a multitude of companies to produce them. This competition significantly dwindled the customer base for Edison's cylinders until 1929."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Created:. 19:52 EST, 20 February 2012. Jobless people attending courses run by David Cameron's 'back to work' tsar Emma Harrison were ordered to sign blank timesheets, it was alleged yesterday. Others complained of being forced to waste hours sitting doing nothing instead of being allowed to look for gainful employment. A damning dossier of allegations about Mrs Harrison's employment agency A4e has been handed to the Comptroller and Auditor General by former minister Fiona Mactaggart. She is the Labour MP for Slough, Berkshire, where last week A4e's offices were visited by police as part of a fraud probe. The Prime Minister is facing demands to suspend lucrative Whitehall contracts which A4e won to help the long-term unemployed find jobs. 'Posh commune': A4e boss Mrs Harrison's £5million pile has 16 bedrooms, 100 acres of land, a pool, spa, a bar, a nightclub and a long dining table for banquets. Millionairess Mrs Harrison, 48 - made. families tsar by Mr Cameron after she boasted she could help problem. families find work - triggered outrage when she paid herself. £8.6million of mainly taxpayers' cash. Ministers. have sought urgent reassurance there is no 'systematic fraud' of the. public purse, after Thames Valley Police were called in by the. Department of Work and Pensions. Ms. Mactaggart's dossier contains accusations from constituents who were. made to attend an A4e 'back to work' course as a condition of receiving. state benefits. One claimed: 'Every Friday, the \\"clients\\" have to sign a blank timesheet and the times are filled in later. 'Members of my group were told to fill in a blank piece of paper outlining any \\"modules\\"...and to sign a blank \\"review\\". 'I would guess this was to fraudulently claim that all \\"criteria\\" as laid down by the government was adhered to.' Another. complainant, a construction worker, said he had spent 13 weeks on an. A4e course supposedly to renew a forklift operator's licence yet had. 'received no training at all', despite repeatedly asking for some. Attendance. on a back-to-work course is mandatory for the long-term unemployed if. they want to keep being paid benefits, and companies such as A4e charge. taxpayers millions of pounds to run them. But a third person described a 'chaotic, unorganised' A4e course in which 'we would mostly be shunted in and out of rooms, staring at walls, long silences with none of the staff telling the group what was happening'. She told the MP her group was forced to 'learn' menial tasks such as how to write a letter on a computer. She said: 'I did not learn anything that I did not know already, and it is ridiculous and worrying that people like myself should be forced into this position where I have a proven work history.' Last night Ms Mactaggart, a former Home Office minister and a member of the influential Public Accounts Committee, said: 'I think there is a series of what appears to me on the face of it to be fraudulent actions - expecting people to sign blank time sheets and so on. Prime Minister David Cameron is facing calls to sack his 'back to work' tsar after a fraud probe was launched. 'It is in itself wrong to get vulnerable unemployed people to sign blank time sheets, because this company is in the position where it has the power to put people in breach of their Jobseekers' Allowance conditions. 'In my view, that makes A4e not fit to receive a government contract. The government should absolutely consider suspending the contracts. 'The concerns that my constituents have raised are sufficient for me to believe that they are not a proper company to get taxpayers' money and to be dealing with vulnerable people.' The MP forwarded the complaints to Sir Amyas Morse, the Comptroller and Auditor General - the head of the National Audit Office which scrutinises the accounts of government departments and agencies. She demanded an investigation, telling him the cases seemed to be examples of 'A4e taking money from the Government without actually delivering anything worthwhile'. Other MPs have attacked Mrs Harrison's vast dividend, which she paid herself after A4e recorded a £234million turnover. A4e - which used to be called Action For Employment - makes all its UK income from state contracts. Mrs Harrison, worth an estimated £70million, lives in a £7million country mansion in Derbyshire with her husband Jim, their four children, and a group of 11 close friends and their six children in a 'posh commune'. Labour's Margaret Hodge, who is chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, has led calls for Mrs Harrison's company to have its state contracts suspended. Margaret Hodge, the chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, yesterday tabled a parliamentary question asking whether the Government would suspend the company's contracts pending inquiries. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'Officers visited the offices of A4e in Slough as part of an allegation of fraud, which was referred to the Force by the Department for Work and Pensions. The investigation is ongoing and at an early stage, therefore we are currently unable to comment any further.' A4e said the police had only come in 'for a meeting' and had not taken away any documents. It said the fraud probe concerned an isolated incident two years ago relating to four employees who had since left the company, and that A4e had discovered the alleged fraud itself and reported it to the Department for Work and Pensions within 48 hours. Last night an A4e spokesman insisted the concerns raised by Ms Mactaggart had been resolved, saying: 'Under the new Work Programme, customers are no longer required to fill out timesheets. 'All our staff have clear guidelines on how to complete claims made under Work Programme and these claims are independently verified by the employer and by JobCentre Plus. 'A4e has a zero tolerance policy towards any form of behaviour that might lead to allegations of fraud. 'The concerns raised by Fiona Mactaggart's constituents are not linked to the current Thames Valley Police investigation.'

The restaurant is right at the front of the Monte Carlo and they seated us adjacent to the main window, overlooking the strip. The server was friendly and told us about the tapas menu yet failed to warn us of just how small the portions were. The problem is that at other places, tapas are usually priced accordingly. At Yusho however, the prices are way out of proportion to the size and, unfortunately, the taste of the food. The drink menu looked interesting so I tried the Last Word (13), which is a mixture of gin, green chartreuse, maraschino, lime and egg whites. The flavor was ok but there was more egg white foam than liquid in the glass and I didn't taste any gin at all. We also tried a Negroni which did have a strong taste of Campari (13). However, similar to what they did with the previous cocktail, there was so much ice jammed into the glass that there were only a few sips of liquor. We started with the house pickles (9) and assorted kimchi (7). The taste of the kimchi was interesting but there wasn't much there to eat. We had one order of the Tiger shrimp which came in a small bowel containing a few shrimp and cucumber pieces with a tangy vinegar coating (9). We ordered one of the specials which was an ear of corn, broken into two pieces and smothered in a spicy miso sauce (7). The taste of the sauce was great but the corn was a bit waterlogged and mushy. Next came the duck breast which consistent of one skewer holding four small pieces of bland duck meat wrapped around mushrooms (12). We ordered two cod buns (16 for two) and two pork buns (16 for two). The meat in both tasted all right however the mix of ingredients that they threw in with it seemed like a desperate attempt to create something different by throwing in anything on hand rather then creating a unified concept of flavors that meshed together. The portions are so small however and you are so hungry throughout the experience that you will eat anything they bring to the table. Last to come was the crab fried rice (24) and the chicken drummies with red miso sauce (9). The fried rice tasted ok but there was only enough to fill the small miso soup bowl that it came in. The chicken dish was the most substantial of the night with several flat medallions of chicken meat with a red dipping sauce. We skipped dessert. All in all, some of the dishes tasted ok but nothing had a wow factor. Certainly nothing to demand the exorbitant prices for what you actually received. I can't see this place staying at the Monte Carlo for very long if nothing changes. I would recommend skipping Yusho and heading right next door to the Dragon Noodle Co. or Andre's for a real meal.

One study involved sixty-eight healthy young women and men who ran at least twenty-four kilometers a week. The runners were observed on a treadmill machine . Sometimes they wore running shoes. Other times they ran barefoot . Researchers from the JKM Technologies company in Virginia, the University of Virginia and the University of Colorado did the study. They found that running shoes create more stress that could damage knees, hips and ankle joints than running barefoot. They observed that the effect was even greater than the effect reported earlier for walking in high heels. The study appeared in the official scientific journal of The American Academy of Physical Medicine. The other study appeared in the journal Nature. It compared runners in the United States and Kenya. The researchers were from Harvard University in Massachusetts, Moi University in Kenya and the University of Glasgow in Scotland. They divided the runners into three groups. One group had always run shoeless. Another group had always run with shoes. And the third group had changed to shoeless running. Runners who wear shoes usually come down heel first. That puts great force on the back of the foot. But the study found that barefoot runners generally land on the front or middle of their foot. That way they ease into their landing and avoid striking their heel. Harvard's Daniel Lieberman led the study. He says the way most running shoes are designed may explain why those who wear them land on their heels. The heel of the shoe is bigger and heavier than other parts of the shoe, so it would seem more likely to come down first. Also, the heel generally has thick material under it to soften landings. But the researchers do not suggest that runners immediately start running barefoot. They say it takes some training. And there can be risks, like running when your feet are too cold to feel if you get injured. The study was partly supported by Vibram,...

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The researcher who found more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was Bob, who studied a present-day county. Over the past 10,000 years, human activities have greatly increased, leading to significant growth in industries, transportation, and energy production, among other areas. These activities have contributed to a considerable rise in the release of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), into the atmosphere. Today, atmospheric CO2 levels are substantially higher than they were 10,000 years ago, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and various industrial processes. Hence, it is safe to assume that Bob would have observed higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere compared to Tim, who studied a human settlement in an era when human impact on the environment was considerably lesser."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - compliments acknowledgment - better life - american dream - complimented - headache The rationale to choose \\"better life\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"Choosing \\"better life\\" as the answer to the question of how a person's situation is improved when they work hard is based on various factors and underlying reasons. This choice encapsulates a more comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted benefits that arise from hard work and perseverance, as opposed to the other options provided. Here are some detailed explanations behind selecting \\"better life\\": 1. Personal growth and self-improvement: Hard work in one's personal and professional life often translates into enhanced skills, expertise, and efficiency. The accumulated knowledge and experiences contribute to a person's growth, making them more self-reliant, confident, and prepared to face challenges. This improved version of themselves leads to a better, more fulfilling life. 2. Financial stability and growth: Working hard usually results in better job prospects, promotions, and increases in salary. This financial stability allows individuals to enjoy the comforts of life, invest in their future, provide for their family's needs, and create long-term financial security. As a result, a better life with less financial stress and more opportunities is achieved. 3. Career advancement and job satisfaction: By working hard, individuals demonstrate commitment, dedication, and reliability in their chosen field. This can open doors to promotions, leadership roles, and networking opportunities, ultimately resulting in career growth and job satisfaction. As career goals are achieved and satisfaction becomes more prevalent, the individual's life quality also improves. 4. Achievement and recognition: As people work hard and surpass expectations, they not only build a positive reputation for themselves but are also recognized and appreciated by others. This acknowledgement reinforces the individual's sense of achievement and can enhance self-esteem, leading to a better life. 5. Healthier relationships and social life: When an individual works hard to develop essential life skills, they become better equipped to handle various aspects of their lives, including relationships. A healthy and balanced life with good relationships positively impacts a person's overall well-being and happiness. 6. Resilience and adaptability: Through hard work, people learn to face challenges and obstacles with determination and a never-give-up attitude. This resilience enables individuals to adapt to changing circumstances and maintain a positive outlook, leading to a better life despite unavoidable difficulties. 7. Better life as the central idea: The other options - compliments acknowledgment, American dream, complimented, and headache - either focus on single aspects (e.g., recognition or societal ideals) or mention negative consequences (e.g., a headache from too much work) of hard work. The choice \\"better life\\" embraces a more holistic perspective, covering personal, professional, financial, and social improvements in an individual's life brought about by their hard work. In conclusion, the rationale to choose \\"better life\\" as the answer lies in the numerous advantages and improvements that hard work can bring to an individual's life. These factors together contribute towards the betterment of one's personal and professional well-being, making \\"better life\\" the appropriate choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Article Title: Proper Handling and Serving of Milk: A Detailed Guide Milk, a scrumptious and nutritious white fluid, is often a staple in most households. While its consumption is straightforward, there are still specific steps that can be taken to enhance its enjoyment and longevity. This article elaborates those methods based on a compact summary provided. Firstly, we point to the individual serving of milk, particularly when you have guests or a gathering at your home. It's significant to pour milk into individual glasses. This not only adds a personal touch but also ensures hygienic handling. Rather than sharing from a common bowl, each person having their separate glass guarantees a fresh and untampered drink. Moreover, the elegance in the serving plays a substantial role in our eating habits. It's not just about what we consume, but also how aesthetically pleasing it's presented. With this in mind, consider garnishing the milk before serving. A simple but effective garnishment for milk is sliced almonds. Not only do these sliced almonds provide a vibrant visual contrast to the milk, but they also enhance the flavor and deliver extra nutritional value with their healthy fats and proteins. It's an easy but significant method to make the everyday glass of milk more appealing. However, depending on the volume of milk purchased, you may often find yourself with leftovers. If one is not mindful, these leftovers could potentially lead to wastage. To minimize this, it's important to refrigerate the extra milk. Refrigeration slows down microbial growth and extends the milk's shelf life. This not only helps conserve the milk for future use, thereby preventing unnecessary wastage but also maintains the milk's freshness and flavor. Lastly, consequential to all food items' nature, there will come a point when the milk will no longer be consumable. Like any perishable, milk once it goes bad is dangerous for health and should be promptly discarded. Bear in mind that consuming spoiled milk may lead to food poisoning or other health problems. Keeping track of the milk's expiration date, practicing proper storage methods, and using your senses to identify signs of spoilage can help prevent these health risks. In conclusion, enjoying milk is not just about drinking it straight from the carton. By pouring your milk into individual glasses, garnishing with tasty and nutritious additives like sliced almonds, refrigerating any extra for extended freshness, and making a point to discard milk once it goes bad, you're ensuring a safe, tasteful, and enjoyable milk-drinking experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more cells will be attacked happens, how will it affect LESS cells being damaged. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The process you described involves the following steps: 1. Bacteria enters the body. 2. Bacteria enter the bloodstream. 3. Cells in the body are attacked by bacteria. 4. Cells are killed by bacteria. 5. Different kinds of sickness are formed as a result of cell damage. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis: if more cells are attacked by bacteria, how does it affect the possibility of fewer cells being damaged? If more cells are attacked, it is likely that more cells will potentially be damaged. This is because the bacteria attacking the cells are responsible for causing damage, usually through the release of toxins or through direct invasion and destruction of the cells. However, several factors can influence whether this increased attack on cells would necessarily lead to more cells being damaged: 1. The immune system response: The body's immune system may respond more robustly to the increased bacterial attack, neutralizing a larger number of bacteria before they can cause damage to the cells. 2. The virulence of the bacteria: Some bacteria are more aggressive in their ability to attack and damage cells. If less virulent bacteria are responsible for the increased attack, the resulting damage may not increase proportionally to the number of cells attacked. 3. The resilience of the cells: Some cells may be better equipped to resist or recover from bacterial attack. For example, they may have protective mechanisms or be more capable of repairing damage. Although these factors may alleviate the potential increase in cell damage due to more cells being attacked, it is still reasonable to assume that, in general, increased bacterial attack on cells will lead to a higher likelihood of cell damage. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis that suggests more cells being attacked would result in less cell damage is likely not accurate in most cases. More cells being attacked by bacteria will typically lead to more cells being damaged, potentially leading to more severe or widespread illness. However, factors such as the immune system response, bacterial virulence, and cell resilience can influence the extent of the damage caused."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I had another offer on the table from someone I am close with that I kept pushing back at the time so when the company told me they would get back to me the next week I said sounds great, I have another offer so as soon as a decision is made it would be awesome if you let me know. On Tuesday of the following week they got back to me with an offer to which I asked if I could get back to them the next day and if I had any questions I would email them over. Both of these jobs are hourly, I just graduated college. I emailed them the next day asking if they had a policy in place for reviews for potential raises whether it be 60, 90, or 180 days from the start date. I only asked this because the other position I was considering offered a 60 day raise review. The boss responds and says they typically do yearly reviews other than for title changes. I respond back saying great thank you, is there anyway I could get back to you on Friday and sleep on the decision. I don’t get a response, so I email again asking if Friday is okay. I get an email later that night saying while they wanted to know today, after reading my email they wanted to further discuss my role and I could get back to them Friday. I was shocked and knew that this wasn’t good. The next day I get an email from them telling me I should accept the other job and that after reconsidering I am not a good fit for the company because I want to eventually leave the state (this was already discussed prior and okayed). I ask to call them so I could explain myself as my intentions were getting lost in translation and I get no answer.

So I send one final email apologizing for asking too forthcoming of questions and reiterating my desire to work for the company long term, accepting the position, and that again I would love to talk on the phone to sort this out.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What does Mr. Lomax's reanimated corpse need to hear in order to move? Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. This limits Bernie's ability to walk toward the hidden money: he only moves when he hears music.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: It was only last week, after all, that Ms. Sebelius, 65, said that she would step down from her cabinet job. Image Kathleen Sebelius Credit Michael Reynolds/European Pressphoto Agency Even if Ms. Sebelius had not presided over the Department of Health and Human Services at a time of turmoil and self-inflicted distress — and while carrying out a law that inspires such anger on the right — her candidacy would be a tough sell in Kansas. Democrats have not held a Senate seat in the state since 1939. And even before the president’s popularity started to take a steep slide last year, he fared especially poorly in Kansas, winning only 38 percent of the vote there in 2012. Democrats say that Ms. Sebelius would be their best hope at winning in a tough state, especially if Mr. Roberts loses his primary to Milton Wolf, a Tea Party-backed radiologist who has alarmed mainstream Republicans with some of his actions, such as when he posted gruesome pictures of gunshot victims on Facebook. Perhaps more significant, Ms. Sebelius would force Republicans to spend money in Kansas as they tried to fight off her challenge. Her family has a long history in the state, and she was a popular, twice-elected governor. In 2006, she was re-elected with 58 percent of the vote. But friends and Democrats who know her said that they seriously doubted she would follow through and mount a campaign, considering how personally difficult the past six or seven months had been. She has been mocked and excoriated by Republicans on Capitol Hill, who made her the face of the Affordable Care Act’s problems. And she has told people that she anticipated staying on in her job as secretary for a while longer. President Obama has already nominated a successor, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the current director of the Office of Management and Budget, but her appointment must be approved by the Senate. Ms. Sebelius would have until June 2 to decide, the deadline for filing for the Senate primary in Kansas. ||||| Before she was President Barack Obama‘s embattled Health and Human Services secretary, tasked with overseeing the initial stages of the implementation the Affordable Care Act, Kathleen Sebelius served as the governor of Kansas. With her time in the administration behind her, reports indicate that Sebelius is openly contemplating a return to politics in her home state via a challenge to Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS). The New York Times reports that Sebelius is “weighing revenge” against Roberts, a Sebelius family friend who reportedly wounded her when he accused her of “gross incompetence” as HHS secretary. Roberts, who is currently running for a fourth term in the upper chamber of Congress, saw his job approval rating dip following a the report that he did not actually own a home in the state which he represents in Congress. After that report, the 77-year-old senator drew a primary challenge from a tea party-aligned candidate. RELATED: Must Reads: Kathleen Sebelius’ Legacy Gets a First Draft “Democrats say that Ms. Sebelius would be their best hope at winning in a tough state, especially if Mr. Roberts loses his primary to Milton Wolf, a Tea Party-backed radiologist who has alarmed mainstream Republicans with some of his actions, such as when he posted gruesome pictures of gunshot victims on Facebook,” The Times reports. Polls presently show Roberts leading Wolf among Kansas GOP primary voters and indicate that Roberts’ primary challenger is a flawed candidate. Roberts polls significantly worse against a generic “more conservative” Republican candidate than he does against Wolf, a condition that goes to show Kansas’ Republican electorate is ready to send new blood to Washington. However, the last time Sebelius won a race in Kansas was in 2006, a year in which the political environment heavily favored Democrats seeking national and statewide office. Furthermore, a Democrat has not occupied a U.S. Senate seat from The Sunflower State since 1939. In spite of Roberts’ troubles, Sebelius has an uphill battle if she wants to replace the aging Republican in Washington D.C.

' still in use for summertime festivals which seats 2,500 spectators.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"There are only a few fragments of the walls of the Etruscan stronghold remaining.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"There are only a few fragments of the walls of the Etruscan stronghold remaining.\\" appears to be true. The premise states that \\"only some wall fragments remain of the former Etruscan stronghold in Fiesole itself.\\" This indicates that a significant portion of the original Etruscan stronghold has been lost or destroyed over time, leaving behind only a limited number of fragments. The Etruscan civilization was a powerful and advanced one that flourished in ancient Italy before the rise of the Roman Republic. The stronghold in Fiesole was likely a well-fortified structure that served as a defensive or strategic location for the Etruscans. Over the centuries, it would have been subjected to natural disasters, decay, and possibly invasions by external forces. As a result, many of its original structures and features would have eventually crumbled away. However, while only some fragments of the Etruscan stronghold remain, the premise also highlights the existence of extensive Roman ruins in the area. This includes a well-preserved amphitheater dating back to 100 BC that seats 2,500 spectators and is still in use for summertime festivals. The Roman Empire succeeded the Etruscan civilization and expanded its influence over the Italian Peninsula. It is likely that the Romans repurposed parts of the Etruscan stronghold or built their own structures on its foundations, resulting in the preservation of some aspects of the site while allowing others to decay or be lost over time. In conclusion, the hypothesis that there are only a few fragments of the walls of the Etruscan stronghold remaining can be considered true based on the information provided in the premise. While there may be more information or archaeological evidence available beyond the scope of the premise that could further substantiate or contradict this claim, the current details support the hypothesis that just a small portion of the walls of the Etruscan stronghold in Fiesole have survived to the present day. The Etruscan stronghold's remnants coexist with the extensive Roman ruins, including the amphitheater, providing a rich historical and cultural landscape that demonstrates the continuous use and transformation of the site through the ages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Following up from my recent blog post explaining why dietary supplements offer few benefits for most people, new research has found that people who take a mineral supplement actually consume more minerals from their normal diet than non-supplement users. The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. For someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement ‘just in case’ offers little to no benefit.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: a boxcar train for the following movie plot: Launched in 1977, the Voyager 2 space probe carried a gold phonographic disk with a message of peace, inviting alien civilizations to visit Earth. The probe is intercepted by an alien ship which then sends a small scout vessel to establish first contact with Earth. However, instead of greeting the alien craft, the US government shoots it down. Crashing in Chequamegon Bay, Wisconsin, the lone alien occupant, looking like a floating ball of glowing energy, finds the home of recently widowed Jenny Hayden (Karen Allen). While there, the alien uses a lock of hair from her deceased husband, Scott, to clone a new body for himself as a terrified Jenny watches. The alien \\"Starman\\" (Jeff Bridges) has seven small silver spheres with him which provide energy to perform miraculous feats. He uses the first to send a message to his people stating that Earth is hostile and his spacecraft has been destroyed. He arranges to rendezvous with them in three days' time. He then uses the second sphere to create a holographic map of the United States, coercing Jenny into taking him to the rendezvous point in Arizona. Jenny is initially both hostile and frightened of him and attempts to escape. Having a rough understanding of English language from the Voyager 2 disk, the Starman learns to communicate with Jenny and assures her that he means no harm. He explains that if he does not reach the rendezvous point, Arizona's Barringer Crater, in three days, he will die.

While racing wildly with his friends in the snow, Richie's butler, Herbert Cadbury, controls the cars using a remote and guides the children back to Richie's house. He then reminds him about his responsibilities that are due to be executed on Christmas Eve, and instructs him to change his clothes and get ready for tea.

Cette déclaration a été adoptée lors d'une conférence internationale organisée par la Commission économique pour l'Afrique et la Banque mondiale, qui s'est tenue à Dakar, au Sénégal, en novembre 2011. Elle vise à mettre en œuvre un ensemble d'actions concrètes et mesurables pour améliorer le transfert de données fiables et à jour afin de mieux informer les décisions politiques et économiques, et ainsi contribuer au développement durable. Le développement des statistiques est une étape essentielle pour améliorer la qualité et la disponibilité des informations sur lesquelles s'appuient les gouvernements, les organisations internationales, les chercheurs et les autres acteurs pour élaborer des politiques publiques, suivre et évaluer les progrès réalisés dans la réalisation des objectifs nationaux et mondiaux, notamment les Objectifs de développement durable (ODD) des Nations unies. De plus, le développement des statistiques est également un moyen de renforcer la transparence, la gouvernance et la responsabilité des institutions publiques et privées. Les principales recommandations de la Déclaration de Dakar comprennent la nécessité d'instaurer des systèmes de collecte, de traitement et de diffusion des données statistiques solides et intégrés aux systèmes d'information nationaux, ainsi que de mettre en place des mécanismes de financement durables pour les activités statistiques. Parmi les autres engagements pris par les signataires figurent également la promotion des partenariats entre les producteurs et les utilisateurs de données, la formation de statisticiens professionnels et la coopération régionale et internationale dans le domaine de la statistique. La mise en œuvre de la Déclaration de Dakar repose sur la mobilisation des ressources techniques, humaines et financières nécessaires pour renforcer les capacités de production et d'analyse des données, ainsi que pour assurer l'intégration et l'utilisation efficaces des données dans les processus de planification, de mise en œuvre et d'évaluation des politiques publiques et des programmes de développement. En outre, la focalisation sur les questions d'égalité de genre, de protection de l'environnement et de réduction de la pauvreté, entre autres, constitue un élément central de cette déclaration pour garantir que les futures générations puissent bénéficier d'un développement équitable et durable. En somme, la Déclaration de Dakar sur le Développement de la Statistique est un appel à l'action urgent et nécessaire pour renforcer les systèmes statistiques à travers le monde, en particulier dans les pays en développement, afin de garantir que les décideurs politiques, les institutions et les partenaires du développement disposent d'informations fiables et à jour pour mieux orienter leurs actions et contribuer à la réalisation des objectifs de développement et de bien-être pour tous."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The well - known Rushmore National Monument in the United States is built on the Rush More Peak, 1829 meters above sea level, of the Black Hills in the southwest of South Dakota. It is a group of huge stone statues of four American presidents, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. President Washington is the founding father of the country;the 3rd President Jefferson drafted the U. S. Declaration of Independence;the 16th President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation and the26th President Roosevelt protected the average people's right to compete fairly with trusts. All of them,made outstanding achievements for their country. They were pioneers of U. S. history. The stone statues of presidents were built at the suggestion of an historian in the State of Dakota,with a view to carrying forward the U. S. pioneering spirit everlastingly. The statues are 18 meters high. They are the highest and greatest realistic stone statues in the world,taller than a 6-storied building and larger than the Great Sphinx of Egypt. The size of each head is 20sq mt,with a 20-meter- long face,a 7-meter -long nose,a 2.6-meter- wide mouth and two 1.5-meter -wide eyes. Though not facing the same direction,they are all lifelike and look ahead gravely in harmony with fixed gazes. On clear days,one can have a sight of the four presidents with their firm and steady expression at a distance of dozens of kilometers. Since the stone sculpture is unique in style,the Monument is now the U. S. National Art Centre of Popular Education. Groups of people keep streaming everyday to the site for a visit and tourists across the world are also interested in taking a view of this great Monument.

Help as much as you can. I have a new situation: Two cousins went to college to get a B.S. Greg studied Biology, and his younger cousin Dawn decided to study chemistry. They both graduated Summa Cum Laudae. But I can use this background: Chemists look at the world in two ways, often simultaneously. The two worlds of the chemist are the macroscopic world and the microscopic world. Macroscopic refers to substances and objects that can be seen, touched, and measured directly. Microscopic refers to the small particles that make up all matter. Chemists must observe matter and do experiments macroscopically and then make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature. For example, anyone can observe the physical change in appearance that occurs as an iron object such as a tractor that is left out in the elements gradually turns to rust. However, a chemist looks at the rusting tractor and thinks about what is going on with the individual atoms that make up the iron and how they are changing as a result of exposure to oxygen in the air and water from rain. Throughout your study of chemistry, you will often switch back and forth between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Drum keys are used to tune drums and cost about two dollars at a music store. If you're going to play drums, it's a good idea to get one and make sure your kit is in tune with itself. To start tuning your drums or changing the heads, all you need is a stick and your drum key. Turn the snares off and you're ready to start. If you have any drummer friends, you can ask if they have spare keys to lend or give you. Consider using two drum keys at rods opposite each other on the drum. You'll be able to tune faster and will get a more even tension (so long as you continue keeping them across from each other as you move diagonally around the drum). Center the new head on the drum and put the rim and tension rods back onto the drum. You might want to place the rim back on the drum in the spot it was originally since the rim's shape has probably moved to fit in that position. Tighten all of the tension rods evenly using your hands (no drum key yet) and keep going until all of the tension rods are finger tight. Keep your tension rods and drum lugs clean and lubricated. To lubricate the rods, rub a little oil, petroleum jelly, or paraffin wax over them. Prevent your drum from repeatedly going out of tune by pushing down in the center of the drum with your fist. Do this 5-10 times. Don't worry, you won't break it. You should be able to put a good portion of your body weight onto the drum. Don't be alarmed if you hear popping or glue-cracking sounds. Make sure the tension rods are all still tight and adjust them as needed. Once you've got the new head seated and the tension rods relatively tight, you're ready to start tuning the drum.","completion":"The article provides a comprehensive guide on how to use drum keys for tuning drums, discussing the importance of owning a drum key, tips for faster and even tension tuning, proper head replacement and rim placement, pre-tightening tension rods by hand, maintaining and lubricating tension rods and drum lugs, breaking in a new drum head by applying pressure, and fine-tuning the drum to achieve the desired sound."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: The oil spill on the Gulf Coast has states and visitors bureaus working hard to keep the public updated and reassure beach-bound travelers. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster:. Northwest Florida. Oil has affected sections of Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key beaches, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. Photos from the area showed patches of dark, syruplike oil on the white sand, but local officials said the situation is getting better. \\"Our beaches continue to improve hourly as the crews clean up,\\" said Ed Schroeder, director of Visit Pensacola, in a statement on the bureau's website. On Thursday, yellow tape blocked about a quarter mile of the beach to public access, CNN affiliate WPMI-TV reported. Local officials said the temporary closure was put in place to speed up the cleanup process. Pensacola Beach is open, but the waters from the Park West recreation area to the area just west of Portofino are closed to all swimming and wading until further notice because of large quantities of emulsified oil in shore waters and along the shoreline, the visitors bureau said. \\"The shoreline and water along Santa Rosa Sound on the north side of the island is still clean, clear and open for swimming,\\" according to the bureau's website. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches. A no-swimming notice has been issued for Destin Beach because of the presence of \\"tar chips,\\" according to the website of the Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau, which represents the destination. There were no reported oil impacts along beaches of south Walton County on Friday morning, the area's Tourist Development Council said on its website. The health advisory issued this week for a stretch of beach in the western end of the county has been lifted after two consecutive, clean high-tide cycles, the council said. Meanwhile, small scattered tar balls and oil patches have affected Panama City Beach, but the beaches are open and the swimming is still safe, the area's visitors bureau website said. \\"Our sugary white sand beaches are open for the enjoyment of our guests and, as of now, we are seeing only intermittent impact,\\" according to the bureau. iReport: A slick trip to Perdido Key. Tar balls, tar patties and tar mousse -- a puddinglike oil-water mixture -- continue to be found in northwest Florida, with the heaviest impacts reported between Escambia and Walton counties, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. All of the state's beaches remain open. Gulf Islands National Seashore. All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites, which are in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the National Park Service's website said. But several spots have been affected by the oil spill. A health advisory is in effect from Walkover 23 on Pensacola Beach, Florida, to the west tip of Santa Rosa Island including Fort Pickens. This advisory extends to the Perdido Key area, including Johnson Beach. \\"Because of significant quantities of oil in the water and coming ashore signage and flags advise visitors to not wade or swim in the water,\\" according to the park. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach have experienced significant oiling, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. \\"The beaches are open and visitors are still welcome to sunbathe and walk the beach, but we strongly suggest they swim in a pool or enjoy our many off-beach activities,\\" the site said. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan, and in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou and Old River. Grand Isle, Louisiana. The oil's biggest impact in Louisiana is on the portion of the coast from the mouth of the Mississippi River extending east, according to a state emergency website. \\"Most of the Louisiana Gulf Coast, 70 percent, is unaffected by the oil spill and remains open for commercial and recreational fishing,\\" according to the Cajun Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau website. Grand Isle has closed its public beach, the site said.","completion":"A big oil spill happened near the Gulf Coast, and it has made some beaches dirty with oil. States in the area and visitor bureaus want people to know what is happening and that they are working very hard to clean the beaches. Some beaches like Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key in Northwest Florida have been affected, but they are getting better. Some parts of the beach are closed to help clean up faster. At other beaches like Destin Beach, people are told not to swim because of \\"tar chips.\\" In some parts of Florida, sticky tar balls and oil patches have affected the beaches, but they are still open for people to enjoy. Gulf Islands National Seashore is a park with beaches in Florida and Mississippi, and they are all open but have signs telling people not to swim because of the oil. In Alabama, Gulf Shores and Orange Beach have a lot of oil, but people can still sunbathe and walk on the beach. In Louisiana, most of the coast is not affected by the oil spill, but Grand Isle has closed its public beach because of the oil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He eventually finds him at a facility where Blofeld look-alikes are being created through plastic surgery. Bond kills a test subject, and later the \\"real\\" Blofeld, by drowning him in a pool of superheated mud. While assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd systematically kill several diamond smugglers, M suspects that South African diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by dumping, and orders Bond to uncover the smuggling ring. Disguised as professional smuggler and assassin Peter Franks, Bond travels to Amsterdam to meet contact Tiffany Case. The real Franks shows up on the way, but Bond intercepts and kills him, then switches IDs to make it seem as though Franks is Bond. Case and Bond then go to Los Angeles, smuggling the diamonds inside Franks' corpse. At the airport Bond meets his CIA ally Felix Leiter, then travels to Las Vegas. At a funeral home, Franks' body is cremated and the diamonds are passed on to another smuggler, Shady Tree. Bond is nearly killed by Wint and Kidd when they put him into a coffin and send it to a cremation oven, but Tree stops the process when he discovers that the diamonds in Franks' body were fakes planted by Bond and the CIA. Bond tells Leiter to ship him the real diamonds. Bond then goes to the Whyte House, a casino-hotel owned by the reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte, where Tree works as a stand-up comedian. Bond watches Tree's act and afterwards goes to his dressing room, where he discovers that Tree has been killed by Wint and Kidd, who did not know that the diamonds were fake. At the craps table Bond meets the opportunistic Plenty O'Toole; after gambling, he brings her to his room. Gang members ambush them, throwing O'Toole out of a window and into a pool.

Simply write a short message thanking them for their time, explain that you’re not interested, and wish them the best. For example, “Hi Hannah, thanks for your interest; however, I don’t see us having a romantic relationship in the future. You seem really kind and I wish you all the best!”. The best option is always to be honest. However, if you feel uncomfortable, use a polite excuse to quickly end the conversation. Keep it brief and then avoid replying to any further responses. For example, “Thanks for chatting, but I have recently met someone else” or “I’m taking a break from social media at the moment, as I have taken on extra hours at my job.” If the person continues to message you or you feel nervous that you might contact them during a weak moment, don’t feel shy to delete them.

Review: This is only a response to the yahoo who says this movie is more realistic than the classic, genre defining MASTERPIECE, Jaws. Yes, brainiac, great whites(and other species of shark, bull, black-tip, oceanic white-tip, tiger)have been known to populate areas where easy prey is found. Humans don't often make it onto that menu, granted, but the shark in the film was repeatedly pointed out to be exhibiting abnormal behavior. It's not like it's never happened. The odds of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town, singling out a human nemesis, sinking several dozen thick hulled North Atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people, all friends of the aforementioned \\"nemesis\\", are close enough to the water for it to reach, are so slim as to be laughable. Much like this turd of a Jaws knock-off. Laughable. Great white sharks are also known to frequently chew on boats, protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards, as they look like seals from below. A shark the size of Bruce(if you don't know, look it up)would be more than capable of sinking a boat like The Orca(hey! that's the name of the blatant rip-off we're discussing!), as it would weigh upwards of 6,000 lbs.

Jaws is amazing(better acting, better effects, better music, better writing), Orca is crap(BLATANT rip-off of Jaws, lousy writing, abominable effects, most ridiculous plot this side of an Olson Twins flick).

Eye contact can also help you determine whether a topic of conversation is one that your conversation partner will enjoy. If he begins to seem distracted or look elsewhere, you should consider changing the topic, asking your partner a question, or politely ending the conversation. Silences happen. Feel free to embrace these silences, especially with those with whom you are already close. Don't feel obligated to fill every break in a conversation with your opinions, questions, and stories: sometimes these breaks are natural and positive. Pause every once in a while as you speak. This will allow your partner to change topics, ask you questions, or end the conversation if necessary. Be sure that you are not monologuing. If you are first getting to know somebody, you should withhold your most intimate details until you get to know them better. Oversharing might make you appear gossipy, inappropriate, or shocking. Keep things factual but appropriately intimate until you become better acquainted. Some topics to avoid oversharing about include: Bodily or sexual functions Recent breakups or relationship turmoil Political and religious opinions Gossip and salacious stories Topics that people do not like discussing in the workplace include personal appearance, relationship status, and socioeconomic status. Political and religious affiliations can also be taboo, depending on the context. Be sensitive to your listener and try to keep things casual and light until you have a better sense of what they are interested in. If you have a funny story to share, make sure that it is brief or that it has something to do with your listener's interests. Just because a topic is interesting to you doesn't make it interesting to others. Feel free to share (briefly) your interests and enthusiasms, and then gauge your listener's responses. Let them ask you follow-up questions (if they are interested in learning more) or change the subject (if they'd rather discuss something else). It is not just your responsibility to keep the conversation going—it takes two to tango. If the other person is really not interested in your conversation, find another person to converse with. Don't beat yourself up over an unsuccessful conversation. Maintain eye contact and listen carefully when your conversation partner is speaking. Do not appear distracted or bored. Show that you are engaged and interested. A good listener is someone who will actually listen and focus on the other person instead of just trying to look engaged. Be present when someone else is speaking. Avoid trying to think of what you are going to say next. Instead, just listen to them. Conversations will go more smoothly if you smile, nod, and show interest with your body language. Don't shift too much, cross your arms, look down at your toes, or stare at your phone. Maintain an appropriate amount of eye contact and face your conversation partner openly.

Stepfather III is the second sequel to 1987 's The Stepfather and concerns the titular serial killer seeking out yet another all - American family to become a part of , using plastic surgery to disguise himself from the authorities . - Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. It includes cosmetic or aesthetic surgery, reconstructive surgery, craniofacial surgery, hand surgery, microsurgery, and the treatment of burns. - A burn is a type of injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation. Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids, solids, or fire. Females in many areas of the world have a higher risk related to the more frequent use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people. Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part. Burns are generally preventable. Treatment depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection.... Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'color' with 'color'.

During a choir practice two days before Christmas, village organist Franz Gruber is worried to hear unusual sounds from the church organ and suspects the bellows. One of Gruber's sons discovers mice in the pipes of the organ and the mice have chewed up parts of the organ. Without the organ the church choir cannot perform the rehearsed Bach piece because the music was written to be performed with an organ. Accompanied by both his sons, Gruber travels to Salzburg, hoping to buy spare parts and then mend the organ when returning to the village. The party is caught in a snow storm and the spare part is lost on the way home but pastor Joseph Mohr is simply thankful they are unharmed. Pastor Mohr (with a little help from the bell-ringer Otto) writes the lyrics for a song and the next morning he brings it to Gruber, asking him to compose a melody for the lyrics. With some inspiration from his wife, Gruber sets music to Mohr's words. At church Gruber and Mohr presents \\"Silent Night\\" performed a cappella by the choir.

Într-o lume în care tehnologia și inovația joacă un rol esențial în dezvoltarea economică și socială, protejarea drepturilor de proprietate intelectuală devine tot mai importantă. Comisia Europeană ar trebui să depună eforturi suplimentare în promovarea unei legislații eficiente și implementarea unor măsuri adecvate împotriva contrafacerii și a încălcării drepturilor de proprietate intelectuală, atât la nivel național, cât și internațional. Aceasta ar duce la stimularea inovării, consolidarea pieței unice și creșterea încrederii consumatorilor în produsele și serviciile oferite. Lupta împotriva contrafacerii implică o serie de acțiuni, precum despărțirea în două a lanțurilor de aprovizionare ilicite, persecutarea traficanților și a infractorilor responsabili de producerea și distribuirea bunurilor contrafăcute și cooperarea dintre autoritățile naționale și internaționale în vederea schimbului de informații și a coordonării acțiunilor. În plus, ar trebui să se acorde o atenție sporită educării consumatorilor cu privire la riscurile asociate cu utilizarea și achiziționarea bunurilor și serviciilor contrafăcute, precum și măsuri de prevenire a acestor situații. Protejarea drepturilor de proprietate intelectuală înseamnă asigurarea că persoanele care au creat și dezvoltat idei și produse originale beneficiază de recunoaștere și recompensă corespunzătoare pentru efortul și resursele investite în procesul de inovație. Acest lucru implică îmbunătățirea legislației și a reglementărilor privind brevetele, mărcile, drepturile de autor și alte forme de proprietate intelectuală, precum și combaterea eficientă a plagiatorilor și a celor care încalcă aceste drepturi. De asemenea, Comisia ar trebui să se concentreze pe dezvoltarea unor soluții tehnologice care să ajute la urmărirea și detectarea bunurilor și serviciilor contrafăcute, precum și să colaboreze cu părțile interesate din industrie și societatea civilă pentru a identifica și a aborda problemele specifice în domeniul protecției proprietății intelectuale. În concluzie, Comisia Europeană trebuie să adopte o abordare proactivă și agresivă în ceea ce privește lupta împotriva contrafacerii și protejarea drepturilor de proprietate intelectuală, pentru a asigura un mediu favorabil inovării și respectarea legilor și reglementărilor relevante, în beneficiul întregii societăți."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Fact 2: Plants breathe oxygen into the atmosphere. Given the two facts above, cells cannot survive without plants breathing into what? The answer is:","completion":"Cells cannot survive without plants breathing into the atmosphere. The intricate connection between cells, oxygen, plants, and the atmosphere is a testament to the delicate balance of life on Earth. Based on the two facts given, we can conclude that cells cannot survive without plants contributing oxygen to the atmosphere. To understand this relationship more deeply, we need to explore the processes that enable cells to use oxygen and the role plants play in providing it. Fact 1 states that cells cannot survive without oxygen, which is true for many living organisms, especially for those that rely on aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is the process by which cells use oxygen to break down glucose and other organic molecules, ultimately producing energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Oxygen is essential in this process, acting as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, which drives ATP synthesis. Without oxygen, the electron transport chain would not function effectively, leading to the buildup of toxic waste products and, eventually, cell death. Fact 2 highlights the crucial role of plants in maintaining life on Earth by generating oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into organic compounds like glucose and release oxygen as a byproduct. This released oxygen then enters the atmosphere, replenishing the oxygen supply that aerobic organisms need for cellular respiration. Given these facts, it becomes clear that cells cannot survive without plants breathing oxygen into the atmosphere. The relationship between plants and other living organisms is mutually beneficial. While plants produce oxygen through photosynthesis, they also utilize a portion of the oxygen generated for their cellular respiration. The remaining oxygen released into the atmosphere supports the respiration of countless aerobic organisms, including animals and microorganisms. Moreover, these organisms release carbon dioxide as a byproduct of cellular respiration which, in turn, provides the carbon dioxide necessary for plants to continue photosynthesis. This interconnected cycle highlights the interdependence between different life forms on Earth, and its delicate balance. In conclusion, cells cannot survive without plants breathing oxygen into the atmosphere. This essential resource is a fundamental component of life on Earth, ensuring the continual survival and growth of countless organisms. By exploring the processes of cellular respiration and photosynthesis, we gain insight into the intricate balance that exists between different life forms and the indispensability of plants in maintaining this equilibrium."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We hear the laughter , we see the faces , we see the music . We see laughter , we see the faces , we hear the music .","completion":"Analyzing these sentences, we can conclude that the two sentences do not mean the same thing even though they contain the same elements. The difference lies in the senses involved and the observation attributed to each element. Explanation : 1. \\"We hear the laughter, we see the faces, we see the music.\\" This sentence indicates that laughter is being heard and the faces and music are being visually perceived or metaphorically seen (since music is generally associated with hearing and not sight). 2. \\"We see laughter, we see the faces, we hear the music.\\" This sentence indicates that both the laughter and faces are being visually perceived while music is being heard. The difference between these two sentences is that in the first sentence, laughter is associated with hearing, and music with sight. In the second sentence, laughter is associated with sight, and music with hearing. Hearing laughter and seeing music can be a figurative or metaphoric use of senses, like seeing music could be interpreted as seeing the people play music or the visual representation of the music, whereas seeing laughter could mean seeing people laugh. However, in their standard understanding, laughter is usually something we hear, and music is something we hear as well. Consequently, matching sensory input with expected understanding, the second sentence is more congruent. Hence, while there are the same elements (laughter, faces, music), the way these elements are perceived gives each sentence a different meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It's important to learn about protecting our environment. Here is a 5R rule for us: 1. Reduce If you want to reduce waste, you should use things wisely. Millions of trees are being cut down to make paper. If everyone uses a little paper carelessly and throw it out, soon we would not have any trees left. Other things are also being wasted, and people don't know what to do with the waste in big cities. So it is necessary to reduce the waste 2. Reuse You should always think of reusing the usable things before throwing them out. Give your clothes you do not use or the ones which are too small to the poor. With a family, you may pass on such clothes to younger brothers or sisters. 3. Recycle Bottles, cans and paper can easily be recycled. By doing so, we save lots of time and money. For example, coke cans are sent to a factory, where they are smashed flat and melted and the melted things are made for new coke cans. 4. Recover When you buy a box of apples, there may be a few rotten apples. You have two choices: one is to throw the whole apple away, or you could cut off the rotten parts and eat the good parts. In this way, you are recovering the eatable parts of food. 5. Repair If one of the legs of your table is broken, you can repair it instead of throwing it away. If you want to change for better ones, It is better for you to sell the old things or give them to other people who can use them after doing some repair.

Please answer the following question: This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it?

After closing Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the Kaiserkeller in October. When he learned they had been performing at the rival Top Ten Club in breach of their contract, he gave the band one month's termination notice, and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age. The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November. One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them. Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fiancée Astrid Kirchherr, who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.During the next two years, the Beatles were resident for periods in Hamburg, where they used Preludin both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances.

His friends find him washed up on the shore, and Tom finds it was Huck Finn (Brad Renfro) who carried him to safety. Huck learns of an unusual way to remove warts - by taking a dead cat to the graveyard at night. There they witness Injun Joe and Muff Potter (Mike McShane), the town drunk, digging up the grave of Vic \\"One-Eyed\\" Murrell for Doctor Robinson. A treasure map is discovered and when Doc tries to betray the two men, Injun Joe murders him with Muff's knife. The next morning, Muff is charged for the murder. Unfortunately, Tom and Huck had signed an oath saying that if either of them came forward about it, they would drop dead and rot. The boys embark on a search for Injun Joe's treasure map, so they can declare Muff innocent and still keep their oath. The only problem is, the map is in Injun Joe's pocket. After Injun Joe finds the last treasure, he burns the map and discovers that Tom was a witness to the crime. He finds Tom and threatens he will kill him if he ever tells anyone about the murder. However, at the time, the entire community believed that he was dead, and the friendship between Tom and Huck starts to decline because of the fact that their evidence (the map) to prove Muff innocent, while preserving their oath, is destroyed. At Muff Potter's trial, Tom decides that his friendship with Muff is more important than his oath with Huck and tells the truth. The court finds Muff innocent of all charges and goes after Injun Joe. As a result, Injun Joe decides to hold up his end of the bargain by killing Tom. When Injun Joe returns to the tavern, he kills his accomplice Emmett (Lanny Flaherty) for cheating him.

Answer the following question: Digestion is the process of breaking down food into components the body can absorb, and digestive enzymes are necessary for a complete digestion. Given these facts, what supplement would a human take to aid in breaking down food among the following options: - sweating - Energy - Enzymes. - Calcium supplements. - Energy. - Antacid. - Protein supplement. - evaporation Answer:","completion":"Out of the given options, the most suitable supplement for a human to take to aid in breaking down food would be enzymes. This is because digestive enzymes play a crucial role in the process of digestion, helping to break down large food molecules into smaller, more easily absorbed components. These enzymes are essential for the proper functioning of the digestive system, and taking a supplement containing them can help to ensure that food is being broken down effectively. Here's a brief overview of the other options and why they are not as suitable for aiding in digestion: 1. Sweating: Sweating is a natural bodily function that helps to regulate body temperature, but it has no direct relation to the process of digestion. Thus, it would not be an effective supplement to aid in breaking down food. 2. Energy: Energy is not a supplement, but rather a general term used to describe the capacity to do work or produce heat. In the context of digestion, the body needs energy to perform the various processes involved, but consuming a supplement called \\"energy\\" would not directly help to break down food. 3. Calcium supplements: While calcium is an important mineral for maintaining strong bones and teeth, as well as for proper nerve and muscle function, it does not specifically aid in the digestion of food. 4. Antacid: Antacids are medications that help to neutralize stomach acid, providing relief from heartburn, indigestion, and other symptoms related to excess stomach acid. While they can provide some relief in cases of indigestion, they do not directly aid in breaking down food, as they do not contain digestive enzymes. 5. Protein supplement: Protein supplements are designed to provide additional protein to one's diet, which can be helpful for muscle growth, repair, and overall health. However, they do not play a direct role in the process of breaking down food in the digestive system. 6. Evaporation: Evaporation is the process of turning a liquid into a gas and has no relevance to digestion or supplements that aid in breaking down food. In conclusion, the best option among the given choices for a supplement specifically designed to aid in breaking down food in the digestive system is enzymes. A supplement containing digestive enzymes can help to support healthy digestion by supplementing the body's natural production of enzymes and ensuring a more efficient breakdown of nutrients for absorption and utilization in the body."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Context: The purpose of this study was to examine the osteotomy gap filling rate with new bone after open wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO) without bone graft and the effects of smoking, lateral hinge fracture, and early full weight bearing.', 'A prospective series (Nxa0= 70) of open wedge HTOs with the TomoFix plate (DePuy Synthes, Umkirch, Germany) was performed. Radiologic follow-up examinations took place postoperatively, after 6 and 12 weeks, and after 6, 12, and 18 months to measure osteotomy gap filling at each follow-up. Bone healing was compared in smokers versus nonsmokers who underwent open wedge HTOs with intact lateral hinges. Fractured lateral hinges were classified according to the Takeuchi classification and separately analyzed regarding bone healing. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo early (11 days) or standard (6 weeks) full-weight-bearing rehabilitation.', 'A delay in the osteotomy gap filling rate between smokers and nonsmokers could be observed at all follow-up periods, but differences were not significant. A fracture of the lateral hinge was found in 39% of the patients. A type I fracture was observed in 14% of patients, a type II fracture was observed in 13%, and a type III fracture was found in 6%. The highest increase in the osteotomy gap filling rate was observed between 12 weeks and 6 months after surgery in patients with intact lateral hinges. For patients with unstable type II fractures, the highest increase in the gap filling rate was delayed until 6 to 12 months. Early full weight bearing had no effect on the gap filling rate in any of the patient groups evaluated.

What is the answer: Which French phrase translates as ‘blow of mercy’?","completion":"The French phrase translating to \\"blow of mercy\\" is \\"coup de grâce.\\" This phrase has been borrowed into the English language and is commonly used in various contexts today. The phrase \\"coup de grâce\\" combines the words \\"coup\\" (blow, stroke), \\"de\\" (of), and \\"grâce\\" (mercy). In the original French context, this term is related to offering a swift, decisive, and merciful blow to end the suffering of a wounded individual or animal. It is often seen being used to describe a finishing stroke, meant to bring an end to the physical pain and suffering. This finishing blow could be anything from a sword thrust to a gunshot, depending on the circumstances. In the English language, \\"coup de grâce\\" has taken on a slightly broader meaning. While it still refers to an action that effectively puts an end to a difficult situation or suffering, it can also be used metaphorically. For example, in literature, a coup de grâce can refer to the final event or plot twist that brings a story to a close. It can also refer to the decisive moment in a competition or contest when the outcome is determined. In short, the French phrase \\"coup de grâce\\" translates to \\"blow of mercy\\" and is used to describe an action that mercifully ends the suffering or struggle of a person or an animal. It can be employed both literally and figuratively to depict the final, decisive event that brings closure to a challenging situation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ask them for an autograph politely if you’re mailing a letter. Thank them and wish them well.","completion":"Title: The Art of Writing the Perfect Fan Letter: A Guide to Conveying Your Admiration Introduction: In today's era of digital communication, receiving a heartfelt handwritten note, especially from a devoted fan, can warm a celebrity's heart. While it can be tempting to let your passion for a famous person translate into pages of admiration, it is essential to note that brevity is the key to writing a tasteful and thoughtful fan letter. This guide will walk you through the steps of expressing your gratitude and appreciation effectively, ensuring that your message is not only genuine but also well-received by the recipient of your praise. Step 1: Keep it Short and Concise Long, rambling letters may be cathartic to write, but they can be difficult for busy celebrities to read and digest. Remember that your favorite star likely receives countless fan letters, so being concise and respectful of their time will make your note stand out and increase the chances of a favorable response. Step 2: Introduce Yourself Don't assume that the recipient of your message knows who you are; give them a brief introduction to your life. Include your name, occupation, hobbies, and perhaps some details about how you became a fan. It's perfectly fine to express your admiration for the celebrity, but be sure not to go overboard. Focus on highlighting your genuine connection to their work instead of bombarding them with excessive flattery. Step 3: Mention Your Favorite Works By identifying and discussing your favorite book, film, or television show featuring the celebrity, you demonstrate genuine appreciation for their art and achievements. Detail why that particular work resonates with you, such as its powerful impact on your life or a particular scene that moved you. This reinforces your authenticity as a fan and helps build a stronger connection to the celebrity. Step 4: Request an Autograph If you're mailing your letter, politely requesting an autograph creates an extra touch of personalization. However, keep in mind that the primary goal of your message should be to express admiration for the celebrity's talent, not just to collect a memento. As such, be polite and understanding in your request - make it clear that having their autograph would mean a great deal to you, but also express that you understand if they are too busy or unable to provide one. Step 5: Gratitude and Well Wishes Always end your letter by thanking the celebrity for the time and effort they invest into their work, and wish them continued success in their career and personal life. By acknowledging the hard work and dedication they put into their craft, you demonstrate that you understand and appreciate their role as an artist. Conclusion: Whether sending a letter by traditional mail or engaging in a social media exchange, a well-crafted fan letter can leave a lasting impression on a celebrity. By keeping your message short, introducing yourself, mentioning your favorite works, and politely asking for an autograph, you increase the likelihood that your words of admiration will be cherished. Remember, sincerity, and genuine appreciation will always shine through, helping forge a connection with your favorite star. So, grab your pen and paper (or keyboard) and start expressing your gratitude to those who have touched your heart with their talent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story.

To do that, we will subtract 572 from both sides: -44*s = -572 Now, we need to find the value of \\"s\\".

(CNN) -- Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari denied his nation was involved in last week's deadly attacks on Mumbai, India, and told CNN on Tuesday he's seen no evidence that a suspect in custody is a Pakistani national as Indian officials claim. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari says he believes the Mumbai attackers were \\"stateless actors.\\" \\"I think these are stateless actors who have been operating all throughout the region,\\" Zardari said on CNN's \\"Larry King Live\\" in an interview set to air Tuesday night. \\"The gunmen plus the planners, whoever they are, [are] stateless actors who have been holding hostage the whole world.\\" \\"It was conveyed to the","completion":"Indian government that we are ready to cooperate in any possible way in the investigation of the Mumbai attacks,\\" Zardari continued. \\"Our security agencies are on high alert, and we are committed to bringing the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice.\\" Indian officials have accused the Pakistan-based militant group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, of carrying out the November 26-29 assault on the Indian financial capital, which left at least 164 people dead and more than 300 injured. India's Foreign Ministry has said that the sole surviving attacker, Ajmal Kasab, is a Pakistani national and has provided what it calls \\"evidence\\" to Pakistani authorities. In response to these claims, Zardari urged for caution and further investigation. \\"We need to act responsibly and thoroughly investigate all possible sources of information before pointing fingers at anyone,\\" he said. \\"We must remember that our goal is not to create tensions between our two nations but to work together to combat terrorism.\\" Despite the growing tensions and accusations, both Pakistan and India have expressed their willingness to cooperate with each other to find those responsible for the Mumbai attacks. A joint investigation team has been established, consisting of representatives from both countries' intelligence and law enforcement agencies. As the investigation progresses, new evidence emerges, including phone intercepts and intelligence reports suggesting that the planning and training for the attack took place in Pakistan. This information puts increasing pressure on Pakistan to provide a satisfactory response and concrete actions to prevent future attacks. In an attempt to ease the escalating tensions, President Zardari orders a crackdown on Lashkar-e-Taiba and its affiliated groups. Several arrests are made, including high-ranking members of the organization, and their assets are seized. The crackdown on Lashkar-e-Taiba reveals connections to other extremist groups operating within Pakistan. As a result, the country is forced to review its domestic counter-terrorism strategy and implement stricter measures to prevent the rise of extremist ideologies and terrorist activities. Ultimately, the growing pressure on Pakistan to cooperate in the investigation and address its internal security issues results in positive developments for both India and Pakistan. The joint investigation team achieves significant breakthroughs, leading to the arrest and prosecution of key individuals responsible for the Mumbai attacks. This increased cooperation in intelligence sharing and counter-terrorism efforts sets the stage for a new era of collaboration between the two countries in their fight against terrorism. However, the region's complex history and ongoing tensions remain a challenge for India and Pakistan. As they continue to build trust and work together on matters of security and terrorism, both countries must remain vigilant against the evolving threats and be prepared to reassess their strategies as needed. Only time will tell if this newfound spirit of cooperation between these two nuclear-armed neighbors will lead to a more stable and peaceful South Asia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The person asking this question may be interested in understanding the office environment, company culture, employee interactions, work ethics, and the type of projects they might be working on. Responding to this question may involve sharing personal experiences, work-life balance, challenges, growth opportunities, and learning experiences while working at Evalueserve, Mumbai. Additionally, this question directs attention to the specific location (Mumbai) and may expect responses that address location-specific advantages or challenges. 2. How is the work-life at Evalueserve? This question, on the other hand, primarily focuses on the work-life balance at Evalueserve. Work-life balance refers to the equilibrium between one's professional and personal life and how the company supports employees in achieving that balance. The person asking this question might be more interested in knowing about flexible working hours, workload management, stress levels, and the company's policies for vacation time, maternity/paternity leaves, and availability of support systems.

The visitor looked genuine, dressed in the expected uniform. He was around 6.3 and probably not the most tidily presented utility man I'd met, but I believed him to be genuine and willingly invited him in out of the foul weather. It was pouring down outside, a freezing cold winter's day. As I closed the door I remembered that I should have asked to see his company I.D. , so as I opened the meter cupboard and switched on the light, I politely said, 'Oops, I should have asked to see your I.D. if you don't mind?. He stood there in front of the door and made no move to produce his card or do anything in fact. He just glared down at me in the most menacing way and said in a very sinister voice 'Isn't it a little bit late for that now? What are you going to do if I tell you I don't have it?'.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. I am facing a new situation today: Gary researched two old human settlements. Village A was smaller, it existed about 12,000 years ago. He also studied village B, which existed about 6,000 years ago. The village was much bigger and better developed. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which village had a more dependable food supply available? The answer is:","completion":"Village B likely had a more dependable food supply available. Based on the information from the background article, agriculture was invented about 10,000 years ago, which provided a bigger and more dependable food supply for human settlements. Since Village A existed about 12,000 years ago, it predates the invention of agriculture, and its inhabitants likely relied on hunting and gathering for their sustenance, which would not have been as dependable. On the other hand, Village B existed about 6,000 years ago, after the invention of agriculture. The fact that it was also bigger and better developed suggests that the people in Village B had access to the benefits of agriculture, which would have provided a more dependable food supply."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Question: Where would you put some coffee if you are thirsty? Options: A. container B. internet cafe C. starbucks D. cup E. supermarket Answer:","completion":"The most reasonable and common-sense choice would be option D. Cup. Here is a detailed explanation: A. Container: It's not wrong per se to put coffee in a container, as containers do serve the function of holding beverages. However, the term 'container' is quite broad and may not necessarily imply something suitable for immediate consumption - it could refer to large storage containers or small Tupperware boxes. When you are thirsty and want to have a drink, you typically put the beverage in an easily accessible and useable container, like a cup or mug. B. Internet Cafe: An Internet cafe is a small business that offers Internet services to the public. They might serve coffee, but one wouldn't put coffee 'into' an Internet cafe (unless it's a coffee delivery order for the cafe). C. Starbucks: Starbucks is a well-known coffeehouse chain that sells a variety of beverages, including coffee. Similar to the Internet cafe reasoning, one wouldn't put coffee 'into' a Starbucks unless you crafted coffee yourself to sell there, which doesn't seem applicable based on the question. D. Cup: A cup is a small, bowl-shaped container for drinking from, typically having a handle. It's common that coffee is consumed from a cup. Hence, if you're thirsty and want to consume coffee, pouring it into a cup would make the most sense. E. Supermarket: Supermarkets are where you can buy coffee, not a place where you would put it to drink. Putting coffee into a supermarket would mean you are intending to sell or distribute it, not consume it. So, selecting a 'cup' as the best option aligns with common sense and is consistent with everyday human activities. It's conventional to drink coffee from a cup, and the question implies immediate consumption (\\"...if you are thirsty\\"), thus suggesting drinking rather than storing or selling the coffee."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: When you truly love being a server, it shows. You will become infectious with your good attitude and earn larger tips. People are proven to tip higher when they feel a social connection with their server, as if they could be friends. The best way to cultivate this attitude is to enjoy your work and interactions with others. A big, open-lipped smile can increase tips up to 140%. Take some time to get presentable before arriving to work. A dirty waiter or waitress is unpleasant to look at and reflects poorly on you and the restaurant. Wash your apron and uniform, and make an effort to wear nice clothes when at work. While attractiveness hasn't been proven to increase tips for male waiters, effort and cleanliness definitely does. Women should wear a little basic make-up to earn more tips, as a French study showed that 50% more men left tips to waitresses wearing make-up than those wearing none. Unfortunately, more attractive women have been proven to get higher tips than less, but you should exploit this fact for your own benefit as well. The same study found that adding a bit of personality to your outfit, like a flower or button, increased tips by roughly 15%. For women, this is particularly noticeable when wearing something in your hair. In order to build connections with customers, and thus increase your tips, be sure to let the table know your name. When you arrive, say hello and let them know your name before launching into the specials. Waitstaff who introduced themselves earned roughly 2 more per bill. If the table offers you their names, be sure to remember them and use them. The best way to do this is when you get the check. When returning a credit or debit card, be sure to thank the name on the card when handing over the check -- it's been shown to increase tips. When people feel treated or gifted upon, they generally try to \\"pay back\\" the person being generous to them. Even writing a simple \\"Thank You\\" on the back of a check was shown to increase tips, and simple smiley faces and pictures help as well. Being kind and generous during the meal can create the same effect. If someone spills something, or an order doesn't come out perfectly, you should offer to rectify the situation for them as best you can. This is especially crucial when it is busy or the restaurant is filling up. While you should always be kind and courteous, you want people to eat, pay, and move on so that you can get a new table, and thus a new tip. To do this, come collect the dishes once everyone has finished eating, and ask about further courses (like dessert) instead of waiting for them to ask you.","completion":"To earn larger tips as a server, cultivate a genuine, positive attitude and social connections with customers. Present yourself cleanly and attractively, and consider adding a personal touch to your outfit. Introduce yourself and remember customers' names. Thank customers when handing over checks and consider writing a small \\"Thank You\\" note. Be generous and attentive during the meal, promptly addressing any issues and helping maintain a steady flow of customers for increased tip opportunities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I am a huge fan of Say Anything, Jerry Maguire, and Almost Famous (I wasn't that big on Singles), so it's safe to say that I look forward to anything that Cameron Crowe attaches his name to. I went to see Vanilla Sky having been told that it was a very weird movie and that I probably wouldn't like it if I was expecting anything similar to Crowe's other films. Well, having just seen it, let me say that the former was correct, and the latter couldn't have been more wrong. It is a very weird movie, and nothing really comes together until the end. Anyone who tells you that they saw it coming halfway into the movie is either lying to you or is unable to detach their hindsight from their memory. Anyway, the movie was stellar, and I look forward to owning it as soon as the DVD is released. I was moved by the film, and felt emotionally spent by the end. This is an experience that will draw from the viewer the entire spectrum of human emotion, if the viewer allows him/herself into the plot. In the theatre in which I saw the movie, there were more than a few people who clearly lost track of the movie and were bored by it when they found that they were unable to get back into the plot. I'm sure others just lack the ability to properly follow any movie like this. I don't mean that to sound pompous, but some people are more cut out for the Seagal, Chan, Van Damme genre of movies, and these are the types that probably would not enjoy this movie. It is very cerebral, so make sure you are prepared for a two hour mental bender, as well as much thought afterwards. As far as comparing this film to other Crowe movies, it is very similar in at least one regard, in all Crowe movies, the soundtrack is a character unto itself. This is almost definitely due to Crowe's longstanding ties to music, as anyone who has seen Almost Famous knows, and to his marriage to Heart star Nancy Wilson. It was also worthy to note that there was a definite chemistry between Tom Cruise's acting and Crowe's directing that made the movie seem familiar to anyone who has seen Jerry Maguire. In my mind, that is not a bad thing. Anyway, if I had to compare this movie to any one other film, I would say this: if you enjoyed David Fincher's The Game, you will almost certainly be a fan of Vanilla Sky.

It may exist a man in the park.","completion":"A linguist would likely find the given sentence, \\"It may exist a man in the park,\\" to be grammatically incorrect in standard English. While the sentence attempts to convey a message that there might be a man in the park, it fails to adhere to English grammar rules. In order to understand the linguistic reasoning for this, let's analyze the sentence's structure, syntax, and word choice. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases in a sentence. A standard English sentence follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order. In the given sentence, \\"It\\" is the subject, \\"may exist\\" is the verb phrase, and \\"a man in the park\\" is the object. This structure is deviant from the typical SVO word order due to the presence of a so-called \\"dummy\\" subject \\"it,\\" which does not refer to a specific entity but is used for purely grammatical purposes. 2. Word choice: \\"Exist\\" is used in this sentence to suggest the presence of a man. However, the verb \\"exist\\" is not typically used in the context of a person being in a location. More appropriate verbs such as \\"be\\" or \\"find\\" would convey this meaning more accurately. In addition, the modal verb \\"may\\" is combined with \\"exist\\" in this context, which makes the construction somewhat awkward. 3. Alternative structures: A correct structure would involve using the existential \\"there\\" construction, which is widely used in English to indicate the presence or existence of something. In this case, the sentence can be rephrased as: \\"There may be a man in the park.\\" or \\"A man may be in the park.\\" Both alternatives adhere to English grammatical rules and convey the intended message more effectively and directly. The first sentence utilizes the \\"there\\" construction, while the second avoids it, employing the standard SVO syntax with \\"a man\\" as the subject. In conclusion, the original sentence, \\"It may exist a man in the park,\\" would be considered grammatically incorrect by most linguists due to its deviance from standard English syntax rules and peculiar verb choice. By rephrasing it using the appropriate verbs and syntax, the intended message can be effectively communicated."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a subject line for this message: With respect to future Enron guarantees, there are at least three issues to be addressed in addition to the pervasive objective of transitioning out of the parent guarantee: 1. Excluding the value of major equipment from the guarantee. I believe this is already being done for new bids. 2. Carving out at least part of the guarantee as within Enron's/Nepco's discretion to establish performance or other bonding instruments. 3. Negotiating transferability of the guarantee, i.e. the guarantee can be assumed by another credit-worthy entity with at least investment grade or, if necessary, at least a rating equal to Enron's at the time of assumption. Since the substantive financial protection afforded by an Enron parent guarantee to the contract value would not be compromised if these are implemented, Enron's corporate position is very likely to push very hard on these points. Logically, owners and project lenders should be willing to accept these structures--even though there undoubtedly would be strong initial pushback. On the other hand, there may be a real question whether to accept contracts that do not provide for these relatively small steps away from the traditional hell or high water parent guarantee that Enron has approved in the past.

The premise states that the husband doesn't have air conditioning in his car, and when he comes home from work during the summer, he feels like he's been baking for an hour due to the heat. This implies that the husband feels too hot because there is no air conditioning in his car to cool him down while he is driving.

He hosted key U.S. allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany; but, he also had to weather more turmoil in his Cabinet as well as the ongoing Russia investigation and intensifying scrutiny of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. What might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become “situation normal” for the man elected as the nation’s 45th chief executive. Trump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,” said Trump with Merkel looking on. “It is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in “secret meetings and communications” between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders. “He is going to be an outstanding president. One of your great presidents and it is an honor to call you my friend. Thank you,” Trump told Macron at the end of their joint news conference. Trump also received more good news this week when his choice for secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, finally won Senate confirmation. There were, however, some significant setbacks as well, including the withdrawal of Ronny Jackson as the next head of the Department of Veterans Affairs and intense congressional...

News article: Mars' two moon,s Phobos (shown here) and Deimos, may have formed from a ring of debris around the Red Planet. Larger moons formed in the same debris ring may have crashed into Mars. The moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, may be the only survivors of a giant impact that created many short-lived, but now-absent moons around the Red Planet, a new study finds. Phobos and Deimos are both small for moons — about 14 and 7.7 miles (22.5 and 12.4 kilometers) wide, respectively — and sort of potato-shaped. Compared to other satellites in the solar system, they look more like asteroids. As a result, astronomers previously hypothesized that these moons were asteroids captured by Mars' gravitational pull. But if that were the case, previous research suggested that Phobos and Deimos would have relatively irregular orbits. In reality, these moons have nearly circular orbits positioned near the Martian equator. [Photos of Mars' Moon Phobos Up Close] This diagram shows the collision model for the formation of Mars' two moons. A giant collision (top left) creates a disk of material around Mars (top right), and large moons emerge from the disk of material. More moons form. Eventually, the large moons fall back into Mars, and two small moons remain. Credit: A. Trinh - Royal Observatory of Belgium Another possible origin story for the Martian moons is that they coalesced from the debris of a giant impact, similar to the one largely thought to have formed Earth's moon. This rubble would have first formed a ring around Mars, and as moons emerged from this ring, they would have ended up with similarly circular orbits. However, this possibility raises the question of why Mars would end up with two moons instead of a single moon like Earth did, according to the new research paper. To learn more about the potential origins of Phobos and Deimos,study lead author Pascal Rosenblatt, lead author on the new study, and a planetary scientist at the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels, and his colleagues investigated scenarios \\"left on the side until now,\\" Rosenblatt told Space.com. \\"I rapidly discovered they were left not always for justified reasons.\\" The scientists focused on the huge impact that previous research suggested created the gigantic Borealis basin in the northern lowlands of Mars, which covers two-fifths of the Red Planet's surface. Prior work suggested that this basin is an impact crater, created when an impactor about 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) wide struck Mars, generating a ring of debris around the Red Planet with a mass of about 110 quadrillion tons (100 quadrillion metric tons), or about 10,000 times the combined mass of Phobos and Deimos. The research team's computer models suggested that, over time, in the inner part of this debris ring where the rubble was most densely packed, large moons up to hundreds of miles in diameter would have clumped or accreted together. In contrast, in the outer part of the debris ring, dust and rocks were thinly dispersed, making it difficult for this material to accrete into moons. However, the scientists found that gravitational tugs from one or more large moons from the inner debris ring could have stirred up rubble in the outer ring, shepherding rock and dust to form smaller outer moons, such as Phobos and Deimos. The researchers calculated that after about 5 million years, Mars' gravitational pull would have doomed the other moons, sending them crashing to the Red Planet's surface and leaving Phobos and Deimos as the sole survivors. \\"Our results pave a new path to re-understand the Martian system in a context of formation similar but not identical to [that of] our own moon,\\" Rosenblatt told Space.com. After a large moon forms from the disk of material around Mars (following a collision with a second body), the gravitational influence of that large body spurs the formation of smaller moons, like Phobos and Deimos. Credit: Labex UnivEarths / Université Paris Diderot If a giant impact did create the Martian moons and the Borealis basin, that might help explain many other aspects of early Martian history, such as how Mars got its current rate of spin and lost its atmosphere and surface water, Rosenblatt said. Although the orbit of Deimos is stable, previous research found that Phobos will one day crash against Mars as well. Indeed, a 2015 study found that Phobos already has stretch marks from the Red Planet's gravitational pull. This model suggests that Phobos and Deimos are composed of a mix of material from Mars and the impactor that created the Borealis basin. Future research can test this model by returning samples from Phobos or Deimos to Earth for study, Rosenblatt said. He noted that Japan's space agency, JAXA, and the European Space Agency (ESA) are considering missions to these moons that \\"could be launched as soon as 2022 or 2024.\\" The scientists detailed their findings online July 4 in the journal Nature Geoscience.

Despite being only half as big and a tenth as heavy as Earth, it bears the solar system’s tallest mountain, longest canyon and largest crater. At 22 and 12 kilometers wide, however, its inner moon Phobos and outer moon Deimos are figurative small potatoes. Scientists suspect both formed much as Earth’s single large moon did, from a massive debris disk ejected into orbit by a giant impact eons ago. But if Mars’s moons formed like Earth’s, why are they so very much smaller? The answer may be that they did not form alone. New simulations from Pascal Rosenblatt of the Royal Observatory of Belgium and colleagues show how the debris disk from a giant impact on Mars could have generated additional moons a few hundreds of kilometers in size. After forming in the dense inner regions of the disk, those larger moons would have stirred the disk’s sparser outer reaches, allowing smaller companions like Phobos and Deimos to coalesce from the ripples. The study appears in the journal Nature Geoscience. [Rosenblatt et al., Accretion of Phobos and Deimos in an extended debris disc stirred by transient moons] In this scenario, the reason we only see Phobos and Deimos today is that the bigger moons were destroyed a few million years after their formation. Their low, fast orbits outpaced Mars’s rotation, creating a tidal pull that sent them spiraling down to crash into the planet (Earth’s moon, by contrast, orbited slower than our planet’s rotation, allowing it to spiral outward and survive). Future investigations could test the new hypothesis by looking for clusters of Martian craters produced by the infalling moons, but in the meantime, proof that Mars can kill its companions is right before our eyes: The orbit of Deimos is stable, but Phobos is in a death spiral, losing two centimeters of altitude per year to Mars’s tidal pull. It will plunge into the planet in 20 [million] to 40 million years, leaving lonely, far-out Deimos as the last vestige of what may have been a once-mighty system of Martian moons. —Lee Billings [The above text is a transcript of this podcast.] [Scientific American is part of Springer Nature.] ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"New research suggests that Mars' two potato-shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos, could be the sole survivors of a giant impact, creating many short-lived, now-absent moons around the Red Planet.

Meanwhile, a student named Lisa (Jacinda Barrett) feels dazed and prepares to leave the bar, when someone abducts her. She wakes up in a bathtub filled with ice and discovers that her kidney was removed. Attacked by her abductor, she tries to flee through the window and is decapitated in the process. Lisa is not missed as she was about to go on a trip. The next day, Amy is preparing the shooting of her thesis film but is deserted by the assigned camera man, Toby Belcher (Anson Mount), who accuses Amy of stealing his thesis idea. Shooting begins with another camera man, Simon. When Sandra (Jessica Cauffiel), Amy's actress friend who played a victim in a scene, returns to an empty studio after forgetting her keys, she is attacked and slashed to death with a straight razor by the same killer who killed Lisa. Her friends witness her death when the material is smuggled into a sequence of takes of the scene, but discount it as another piece of acting, wondering who shot it.

Write a summary based on this article: WASHINGTON — Clinics that provide abortions or refer patients to places that do would lose federal funding under a new Trump administration rule that takes direct aim at Planned Parenthood, according to three administration officials. The rule, which is to be announced Friday, is a top priority of social conservatives and is the latest move by President Trump to impose curbs on abortion rights, in this case by withholding money from any facility or program that promotes abortion or refers patients to a caregiver that will provide one. The policy would be a return to one instituted in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan that required abortion services to have a “physical separation” and “separate personnel” from other family planning activities. That policy is often described as a domestic gag rule because it barred caregivers at facilities that received family planning funds from providing any information to patients about an abortion or where to receive one. But a Trump administration official who detailed the forthcoming proposal said the new version of the policy would not impose a blanket prohibition on abortion counseling. Federal family planning laws already ban direct funding of organizations that use abortion as a family planning method. But conservative activists and Republican lawmakers have been pressing Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, to tighten the rules further so that abortions could not occur — or be performed by the same staff — at locations that receive Title X federal family planning money. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Jonathan Allen WASHINGTON — The Trump administration moved forward with a proposal Friday that would effectively ban Planned Parenthood and similar organizations from providing abortion and related services under the same roof as operations funded by federal family-planning grants, according to an administration official. The so-called Hyde amendment prohibits the use of competitive federal family-planning grant funds for abortion, but organizations like Planned Parenthood have traditionally used the federal money for other health services while using private money for abortions and related services — sometimes at the same facilities and with the same staff. Based on a Reagan-era regulation and championed by abortion-rights opponents, the new rule would force entities that receive so-called Title X family-planning funding to maintain physical and financial separation between taxpayer-backed operations and any related facilities that perform abortions, support the procedures or receive referrals about them, the official said. In addition to the policy implications, the decision is a monumental signal by President Donald Trump to anti-abortion activists entering a midterm election cycle in which Republicans are worried that they will lose seats in Congress — and perhaps control of one or both chambers — because of a lack of enthusiasm within the GOP base. \\"We thank President Trump for taking action to disentangle taxpayers from the abortion business,\\" Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a group that provides political support for candidates who oppose abortion. \\"This is a major victory which will energize the grass roots as we head into the critical midterm elections. The proposed rule change — which was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget by the Health and Human Services Department Friday morning — will drop a requirement that Title X grant recipients provide abortion counseling to patients. But it will stop short of giving abortion foes one provision they sought: a gag rule prohibiting recipients from discussing abortion with pregnant women. \\"This is an attempt to take away women's basic rights, period,\\" said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \\"Under this rule, people will not get the health care they need. They won't get birth control, cancer screenings, STD testing and treatment, or even general women's health exams.\\" She added: \\"Everyone has the right to information about their health care — including information about safe, legal abortion, and every woman deserves the best medical care and information, no matter how much money she makes or where she lives. No matter what. They won’t get it under this rule.\\" Alex Azar, secretary of the Health and Human Services Department, which is issuing new rules on abortion funding Friday. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images The proposed rule could hit many of the front-line health providers for the nation’s poorest. About two-thirds of people who visit family planning services are below the federal poverty level, according to the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association. The Title X program, which provides grants for a broad range of family-planning services, was created by a 1970 law whose lead sponsors included George H.W. Bush, then a Republican congressman from Texas. In fiscal 2017, Congress appropriated 286.5 million in Title X grants, much of it to Planned Parenthood affiliates. For critics of Planned Parenthood who have been frustrated by their inability to get Congress to ban funding for the group, the new rule is a tool to achieve a similar result. The administration official framed the proposed rule as a choice for Planned Parenthood: separate themselves from abortion services or fund themselves entirely with private money. ||||| FILE - In this Jan. 19, 2018 file photo, President Donald Trump speaks to participants of the annual March for Life event, in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington.

(Associated Press) FILE - In this Jan. 19, 2018 file photo, President Donald Trump speaks to participants of the annual March for Life event, in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington. The Trump administration... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration will resurrect a Reagan-era rule that would ban federally funded family planning clinics from referring women for abortions, or sharing space with abortion providers. The Department of Health and Human Services will announce its proposal Friday, a senior White House official said Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to confirm the plans before the announcement. The policy has been derided as a \\"gag rule\\" by abortion rights supporters and medical groups, and it is likely to trigger lawsuits that could keep it from taking effect. However, it's guaranteed to galvanize activists on both sides of the abortion debate ahead of the congressional midterm elections. The Reagan-era rule barred family planning clinics from discussing abortion with women. It never went into effect as written, although the Supreme Court ruled that it was an appropriate use of executive power. The policy was rescinded under President Bill Clinton, and a new rule went into effect that required \\"nondirective\\" counseling to include a range of options for women. According to a Trump administration summary, the new proposal will roll back the Clinton requirement that abortion could be discussed as an option along with prenatal care and adoption. Abortion is a legal medical procedure, but federal family planning funds cannot be used to pay for abortion procedures. Abortion opponents say a taxpayer-funded family planning program should have no connection to abortion. Doctors' groups and abortion rights supporters say a ban on counseling women trespasses on the doctor-patient relationship. \\"The notion that you would withhold information from a patient does not uphold or preserve their dignity,\\" said Jessica Marcella of the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, which represents family planning clinics. \\"I cannot imagine a scenario in which public health groups would allow this effort to go unchallenged.\\" She said requiring family planning clinics to be physically separate from facilities in which abortion is provided would disrupt services for women across the country. But Kristan Hawkins of Students for Life of America said, \\"Abortion is not health care or birth control and many women want natural health care choices, rather than hormone-induced changes.\\" Abortion opponents allege the federal family planning program in effect cross-subsidizes abortion services provided by Planned Parenthood, whose clinics are also major recipients of grants for family planning and basic preventive care. Hawkins' group is circulating a petition to urge lawmakers in Congress to support the Trump administration's proposal. Known as Title X, the nation's family-planning program serves about 4 million women a year through clinics, at a cost to taxpayers of about 260 million. Planned Parenthood clinics also qualify for Title X grants, but they must keep the family-planning money separate from funds used to pay for abortions. The Republican-led Congress has unsuccessfully tried to deny federal funds to Planned Parenthood, and the Trump administration has vowed to religious and social conservatives that it would keep up the effort. __ Associated Press writer David Crary in New York contributed to this report. ||||| Senate Committee Any Committee Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry (70th-115th) Armed Services (79th-115th) Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs (70th-115th) Budget (93rd-115th) Commerce, Science, and Transportation (79th-115th) Energy and Natural Resources (70th-115th) Environment and Public Works (79th-115th) Finance (70th-115th) Foreign Relations (70th-115th) Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (70th-115th) Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (70th-115th) Judiciary (70th-115th) Rules and Administration (79th-115th) Small Business and Entrepreneurship (81st-115th) Veterans' Affairs (91st-115th) State or Territory Indicated Any State or Territory Alabama Alaska American Samoa Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida Georgia Guam Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Northern Mariana Islands Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Puerto Rico Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virgin Islands Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming Nomination Actions Any Nomination Action Placed on calendar as privileged nomination Committee requested information was received Referred to committee Hearings held Ordered reported Reported to Senate Committee discharged Placed on calendar Placed on calendar with footnote Considered by Senate Unanimous consent agreement Cloture motion Cloture invoked/not invoked Rereferred to committee Received message of withdrawal Returned to president Confirmed by Senate |||||","completion":"The Trump Administration is planning a rule that would make clinics that provide or refer patients to places that do abortions lose federal funding.

Refer to this article about combing for more information. Continue combing until the comb does not catch any knots. It is best to use a spray as a cream can leave white flakes behind in your hair. Let the spray sit in your damp, combed hair for around 3-5 minutes before putting in the rollers. Divide your hair into equal 1-inch wide sections. Roll each of these sections into the roller so that your hair looks uniformly curly after the rollers are removed. Continue putting in the rollers until all of your hair is rolled up.

Muammar Gaddafi After the U.S. accused Libya of orchestrating the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing, in which two American soldiers died, Reagan decided to retaliate militarily. The Central Intelligence Agency were critical of the move, believing that Syria were a greater threat and that an attack would strengthen Gaddafi's reputation; however Libya was recognised as a \\"soft target.\\" Reagan was supported by the U.K. but opposed by other European allies, who argued that it would contravene international law. In Operation El Dorado Canyon, orchestrated on 15 April 1986, U.S. military planes launched a series of air-strikes on Libya, bombing military installations in various parts of the country, killing around 100 Libyans, including several civilians. One of the targets had been Gaddafi's home. Himself unharmed, two of Gaddafi's sons were injured, and he claimed that his four-year-old adopted daughter Hanna was killed, although her existence has since been questioned. In the immediate aftermath, Gaddafi retreated to the desert to meditate, while there were sporadic clashes between Gaddafists and army officers who wanted to overthrow the government. Although the U.S. was condemned internationally, Reagan received a popularity boost at home. Publicly lambasting U.S. imperialism, Gaddafi's reputation as an anti-imperialist was strengthened both domestically and across the Arab world, and in June 1986, he ordered the names of the month to be changed in Libya.

After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles, Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" be released as a single, and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one. The album topped the Billboard 200 for five weeks, and sold over four million copies in the US. It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album.

It is important to recognize that the effectiveness of a workout can vary for different individuals and be impacted by multiple factors. Despite the lack of an incline setting, you can still achieve a good workout on a flat treadmill, though it may limit the variation and intensity of your exercise. In comparing treadmills with incline features to those without, there are several aspects to consider: 1. Workout variety: A treadmill with adjustable incline settings offers more versatility in workouts, allowing users to simulate uphill running or walking, which can enhance muscle engagement, offer a greater challenge to the cardiovascular system, and increase calorie burn. This may lead to more dynamic and engaging workouts compared to a treadmill with just one flat angle setting. 2. Muscle engagement: Using an incline setting on a treadmill can help target different muscle groups, such as the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. On a flat treadmill, the engagement of these muscles is less diverse, but they are still exercised, specifically during running or walking at higher speeds. 3. Intensity: A treadmill with incline settings typically allows users to increase the intensity of their workouts, maximizing the cardiovascular benefits and overall fitness gains. While a flatt treadmill may not provide this added intensity, you can still increase the intensity of your workout by focusing on speed or interval training. 4. Joint impact: Running on a flat surface can impose greater stress on joints, such as the knees and ankles, particularly if done for long periods. An incline setting can help alleviate some of this pressure and encourage a more natural running stride. However, it is essential to adapt to your body's needs and be mindful of your joints when using any treadmill. In conclusion, the presence of only one flat angle setting on your treadmill does not necessarily mean you cannot get a good workout. It may limit the variation and intensity of your exercise to some extent, but there are still ways to optimize your workout, such as interval training, increasing speed, and incorporating complementary exercises to target different muscle groups. Each individual's fitness level, preferences, and goals play a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of their treadmill workouts, whether on a flat treadmill or one with an incline setting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The harrowing experience of the girl and her siblings has sent shockwaves throughout not only Austria but the world. As news of their captivity and the horrifying events that took place behind the walls of the Fritzl family home spread, communities everywhere were left reeling, questioning how such a monstrous act could go unnoticed for so long. The case of Josef Fritzl and his imprisoned daughter highlights the distorted reality of an individual who was able to maintain a double life for 24 years, deceiving friends, family, and neighbors. The situation also raises concerns about the effectiveness of social services in detecting and addressing instances of abuse, especially in cases as extreme as the Fritzl family's. As the story of the Fritzl family came to light, various organizations and agencies worked together to try to provide the appropriate assistance, therapy, and legal help for the abused children and their mother. The process of healing and adapting to a life of freedom is undoubtedly a tremendously difficult one, yet it is a necessary journey for these once-captive family members. The Fritzl case demonstrates the importance of increased vigilance within communities, reinforcing the need for open communication and timely reporting of suspicious behaviors. It is also a stark reminder that, even in seemingly quiet and peaceful towns, unimaginable horrors may be lurking behind closed doors. As society grapples with the ramifications of this deeply unsettling case, the focus must be on supporting and assisting the survivors in their transition to a better, safer life.

Article: Copper has been in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been extracted since 1900, and more than half was extracted in only the last 24 years. As with many natural resources, the total amount of copper on Earth is vast (around 1014 tons just in the top kilometer of Earth's crust, or about 5 million years' worth at the current rate of extraction). However, only a tiny fraction of these reserves is economically viable, given present-day prices and technologies. Various estimates of existing copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 years to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate. Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world. Because of these and other factors, the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate, including the concept of peak copper, analogous to peak oil. Question: How much copper is estimated to exsist on earth?","completion":"Copper is estimated to exist in a vast amount on Earth, particularly in the top kilometer of Earth's crust. Approximately 10^14 tons (100 trillion tons) of copper is believed to be present in the crust, which, at the current rate of extraction, would be equivalent to around 5 million years' worth of copper resources. However, it's essential to note that only a tiny fraction of these reserves is considered economically viable for extraction, given the present-day prices and technologies. Furthermore, the estimates of existing copper reserves available for mining can vary significantly, ranging between 25 years and 60 years, depending on the core assumptions such as the growth rate.

Here is a question about this article: In the general election, Kerry was initially favored to defeat the Republican candidate, former State Representative Paul W. Cronin, and conservative Democrat Roger P. Durkin, who ran as an Independent. A week after the primary, one poll put Kerry 26-points ahead of Cronin. His campaign called for a national health insurance system, discounted prescription drugs for the unemployed, a jobs programme to clean up the Merrimack River and rent controls in Lowell and Lawrence. A major obstacle, however, was the district's leading newspaper, the conservative The Sun. The paper editorialized against him. It also ran critical news stories about his out-of-state contributions and his \\"carpetbagging\\", because he had only moved into the district in April. Subsequently released \\"Watergate\\" Oval Office tape recordings of the Nixon White House showed that defeating Kerry's candidacy had attracted the personal attention of President Nixon.

The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true. The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis. It makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis. It makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true.

Premise: PersonX rings PersonY's bell. Hypothesis: As a result, PersonX feels social. Update: PersonX has a gift basket dangling from their arm. Step 1: Understand the premise, hypothesis, and update. - The premise tells us that PersonX is at PersonY's place and rings their bell. - The hypothesis assumes that ringing PersonY's bell makes PersonX feel social. - The update gives more information about the situation, stating that PersonX is holding a gift basket. Step 2: Analyze the impact of the update on the hypothesis. - The update shows that PersonX is not just visiting PersonY spontaneously but seems to have a specific purpose for the visit (bringing a gift basket). - This could indicate that PersonX's actions are driven by social etiquette or a desire to connect with PersonY, which aligns with the hypothesis of PersonX feeling social. Step 3: Determine if the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis. - The update (PersonX having a gift basket) makes it more likely that PersonX's actions are influenced by social motivations. - Therefore, the update strengthens the hypothesis.

The Brazilian shares a joke with Luis Suarez during a training session at the Ciutat Esportiva. All eyes were on Neymar at the press conference ahead of Barcelona's Champions League clash. Barcelona stars looked in high spirits during their training session before meeting Dutch club Ajax. Suarez jokes with defender Gerard Pique as he ties his boots during the session. The former Liverpool striker was all smiles as he closes in on playing his first game for the club. 'I don't know if this is a new version but I feel more at home, relaxed, and you notice this on the pitch,' Neymar told a news conference. 'Everything is playing its role in my level improving. The trainer, the players, all this when you put them together gives you the results.'

Ajax beat Barca in Amsterdam last season during the group stages and Luis Enrique is not underestimating them. 'They move the ball around well, they know how to pressure and don't take risks at the back,' he said. 'They are also strong on the counter-attack. They are a complete side which unites the qualities of Dutch football and the Ajax school. 'We have a good feeling and the team are winning most of our games.

The Fruitless Search On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, a Boeing 777, disappeared en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. The disappearance of the plane and the 239 people on board hit the headlines worldwide, leading to one of the most extensive search operations in history. However, despite utilizing the best science and cutting-edge technology, the deep-sea search has been terminated without any trace of the missing plane, as reported by Reuters. The last vessel has departed the search area, and the families of the passengers and crew have been notified of the decision. The statement issued by the authorities mentioned, \\"The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness.\\" After thoroughly scanning a 46,300-square mile search area in the Indian Ocean, the three countries had decided last year that the search would be suspended.

This is why the association with military service is the most reasonable option among those provided. Let's briefly examine the other options to understand why they're not appropriate: 1. Quake 2: This is a first-person shooter video game released in 1997, developed by id Software and published by Activision. It features virtual characters using weapons such as machine guns, but it does not represent real people using machine guns as part of their job or duty. 2.

While machine guns can be part of an arsenal, this term doesn't directly connect to the people using those machine guns. 3. In a: This option seems incomplete or out of context, and it does not offer any meaningful connection to people using machine guns. 4. Armory: An armory is similar to an arsenal, referring to a building or room where firearms and other munitions are stored and maintained.

But the bureau never kept tabs on al-Bayoumi — despite receiving prior information he was a secret Saudi agent , the report says . Are these sentences conveying the same meaning?","completion":"Yes, these sentences convey the same meaning. Both sentences highlight that the FBI did not monitor or keep track of al-Bayoumi despite having received information that identified him as a secret Saudi agent. The sentences use slightly different phrasing and word choices, but the overall meaning remains the same. Here's a breakdown of the differences: 1. In the first sentence, \\"But the FBI never kept tabs on al-Bayoumi\\" is used, whereas in the second sentence, \\"But the bureau never kept tabs on al-Bayoumi\\" is used. \\"The FBI\\" and \\"the bureau\\" are synonymous terms, both referring to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 2. In the first sentence, the phrase \\"even though it had received information\\" is used, while in the second sentence, the phrase \\"despite receiving prior information\\" is employed. Both phrases convey a similar meaning. However, the first sentence emphasizes that the information was already received, while the second sentence specifically highlights that the information was received before the described situation took place. 3. Lastly, both sentences end with the same information, stating that al-Bayoumi was a secret Saudi agent. The first sentence uses \\"the document says,\\" while the second sentence says, \\"the report says.\\" These two phrases are interchangeable, and both are used to attribute the source of the information. In summary, while the sentences have minor differences in phrasing and structure, they communicate the same key message: the FBI did not closely monitor al-Bayoumi despite being aware of his connection to being a secret Saudi agent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Roshanak in Bactrian) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent. He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now Pakistan, to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis(Indian name Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \\"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold\\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality. On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC. In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos. The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to Curtius, \\"Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble\\". A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.

Article: The Kinsey scale has been praised for dismissing the dichotomous classification of sexual orientation and allowing for a new perspective on human sexuality. However, the scale has been criticized because it is still not a true continuum. Despite seven categories being able to provide a more accurate description of sexual orientation than a dichotomous scale it is still difficult to determine which category individuals should be assigned to. In a major study comparing sexual response in homosexual males and females, Masters and Johnson discuss the difficulty of assigning the Kinsey ratings to participants. Particularly, they found it difficult to determine the relative amount heterosexual and homosexual experience and response in a person's history when using the scale. They report finding it difficult to assign ratings 2-4 for individuals with a large number of heterosexual and homosexual experiences.

Given the below context: Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march.

Question: If cells are the basic units of the structure and function of tigers, then cells are the basic units of the structure and function of what? Answer choices: - water - mammals - ice - tigers - animals - humans - plants - the Sun Answer:","completion":"Cells are the basic units of the structure and function of not only tigers, but also other living organisms, including mammals, animals, humans, and plants. Let's discuss each of these in detail to understand why cells are the basic units of their structure and function. 1. Mammals: Tigers are a part of the mammalian group, characterized by having fur or hair, giving birth to live young, and producing milk to nourish their offspring. Like tigers, other mammals such as humans, dogs, and whales are composed of cells, each of which work collectively to build tissues, organs, and organ systems, resulting in the complex body structures and functions that enable these creatures to survive and thrive in their respective environments. 2. Animals: The animal kingdom encompasses a diverse range of species, from mammals and birds to reptiles and amphibians. All these multicellular organisms share a common feature: their bodies are composed of cells - specialized units that perform various functions within the organism. From the tiniest microscopic protozoa to the largest whales, all animals rely on cells to build their body structures and carry out vital physiological processes such as digestion, respiration, and reproduction. 3. Humans: As a part of the mammal category, humans are also composed of cells, which make up tissues, organs, and organ systems. The human body contains trillions of cells, which vary in their structure and function, enabling the intricate processes of life to occur, such as the beating of the heart, the electrical signaling of the nervous system, and the ability to regenerate new skin when injured. 4. Plants: Although plants may seem drastically different from animals, they too rely on cells as their fundamental structural and functional units. Plant cells differ from animal cells in several ways, including the presence of a rigid cell wall, chloroplasts (the site of photosynthesis), and a large central vacuole. These unique cellular components enable plants to perform functions such as growing towards light, producing food through photosynthesis, and providing structural support to prevent collapsing. However, cells are not the basic units of structure and function for water, ice, or the Sun, as these entities are not living organisms: 1. Water: Water is a chemical compound composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H2O). Water molecules do not contain cells, as they are not living organisms but rather an essential component of living organisms. 2. Ice: Ice is the solid form of water that occurs when water molecules bond together in a crystalline structure at freezing temperatures. Like water, ice does not have cells and is not a living organism. 3. The Sun: The Sun is a massive celestial body primarily composed of hydrogen and helium gases undergoing nuclear fusion. As a non-living entity, the Sun does not contain cells, which are found exclusively in living organisms. In summary, cells are the basic units of the structure and function of mammals, animals, humans, and plants, but not for water, ice, or the Sun."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Electromagnetic fields obey what laws?

This does not directly answer the question about electromagnetic fields. To answer your question about the laws that electromagnetic fields obey, they are governed by a set of four fundamental laws called Maxwell's equations. These equations describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields and how they interact with charges and currents. Named after James Clerk Maxwell, these equations are: 1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: This law states that the electric flux passing through a closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed by the surface. Mathematically: ∮E・dA = Q_enclosed / ε₀ 2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: This law states that there are no isolated magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles). The total magnetic flux passing through a closed surface is zero. Mathematically: ∮B・dA = 0 3. Faraday's Law: This law explains the relationship between a changing magnetic field and the electric field it induces. It states that the electromotive force (EMF) induced in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit. Mathematically: ∮E・dl = -dΦ_B/dt 4. Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition): This law relates the magnetic field around a closed loop to the electric current passing through the loop and the rate of change of the electric field. The law accounts for both stationary charges that produce a steady magnetic field (Ampère's Law) and the time-varying electric field that can also create a magnetic field (Maxwell's addition). Mathematically: ∮B・dl = μ₀(I_enclosed + ε₀ dΦ_E/dt) Maxwell's equations form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, and they play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of electromagnetic fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sword was named after Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Dynasty. The practice started when Osman I was girt with the sword of Islam by his mentor and father-in-law Sheikh Edebali. The girding of the sword of Osman was a vital ceremony which took place within two weeks of a sultan's accession to the throne. It was held at the tomb complex at Eyüp, on the Golden Horn waterway in the capital Constantinople. Even though the journey from Topkap Palace (where the sultan resided) to the Golden Horn was short, the sultan would board a boat amid much pomp to go there. The Eyüp tomb complex was built by Mehmed II in honour of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, a companion of Muhammad who had died during the first Muslim siege of Constantinople in the 7th century. The sword girding thus occurred on what was regarded as sacred grounds, and linked the newly enthroned sultan both to his 13th-century ancestors and to Muhammad himself. - The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman Beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror. - Mehmed VI (\\"Memed-i sâdis\\", \\"Vahideddin\\", or ), who is also known as \\"ahbaba\\" (meaning \\"Emperor-father\\") among his relatives, (14 January 1861 16 May 1926) was the 36th and last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, reigning from 1918 to 1922. The brother of Mehmed V, he succeeded to the throne as the eldest male member of the House of Osman after the 1916 suicide of Abdülaziz's son Yusuf Izzettin Efendi, the heir to the throne. He was girded with the Sword of Osman on 4 July 1918, as the thirty-sixth \\"padishah\\". His father was Sultan Abdülmecid I and mother was Gülüstü Hanm (1830 1865), an ethnic Abkhazian, daughter of Prince Tahir Bey Çaçba and his wife Afie Lakerba, originally named Fatma Çaçba. Mehmed was removed from the throne when the Ottoman sultanate was abolished in 1922. - Gülüstü Hanm; (1840 1865) was the Empress consort of Sultan Abdülmecid I. She was the mother of Mehmed VI, the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. - Abdülmecid I (Ottoman Turkish: \\"Abdül-Mecd-i evvel\\"; 23/25 April 182325 June 1861), also known as Abdulmejid and similar spellings, was the 31st Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and succeeded his father Mahmud II on 2 July 1839. His reign was notable for the rise of nationalist movements within the empire's territories. Abdülmecid wanted to encourage Ottomanism among the secessionist subject nations and stop the rise of nationalist movements within the empire, but failed to succeed despite trying to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into Ottoman society with new laws and reforms. He tried to forge alliances with the major powers of Western Europe, namely the United Kingdom and France, who fought alongside the Ottoman Empire in the Crimean War against Russia. In the following Congress of Paris on 30 March 1856, the Ottoman Empire was officially included among the European family of nations. Abdülmecid's biggest achievement was the announcement and application of the Tanzimat (Reorganization) reforms which were prepared by his father and effectively started the modernization of the Ottoman Empire in 1839. For this achievement, one of the Imperial anthems of the Ottoman Empire, the March of Abdülmecid, was named after him. - The Ottoman Empire used anthems since its foundation in the late 13th century, but did not use a specific imperial or national anthem until the 19th century. During the reign of Mahmud II, when the military and imperial band were re-organized along Western lines, Giuseppe Donizetti was invited to head the process. Donizetti Pasha, as he was known in the Ottoman Empire, composed the first Western-style imperial anthem, the \\"Mahmudiye Mar\\". - The March of Abdülmecid (Turkish: \\"Mecidiye Mar\\") was the national anthem of the Ottoman Empire. The title refers to Abdülmecid I (18391861). There were different anthems for each sultan. - Mehmed V Reshad ( Ottoman Turkish : Memed - i âmis , Turkish : Mehmed V Read or Reat Mehmet ) ( 2 November 1844 -- 3 July 1918 ) was the 35th Ottoman Sultan . He was the son of Sultan Abdülmecid I. He was succeeded by his half - brother Mehmed VI . - Padeshah, Padshah, Padishah or Badishah is a superlative royal title of Persian origin, composed of the Persian \\"pd\\" \\"master\\" and the widespread \\"shh\\" \\"king\\", which was adopted by several monarchs claiming the highest rank, roughly equivalent to the ancient Persian notion of \\"The Great\\" or \\"Great King\\", and later adopted by post-Achaemenid and Christian Emperors. Its Arabized pronunciation as Badshah was used by Mughal emperors. - Mahmud II (Ottoman Turkish: \\"Mahmud-u sn\\", \\"Mahmud-u Âdlî\\") (20 July 1785 1 July 1839) was the 30th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1808 until his death in 1839. He was born in the Topkap Palace, Constantinople, the posthumous son of Sultan Abdul Hamid I. - Ottomanism (\\"Osmanllk\\" or \\"Osmanlclk\\") was a concept which developed prior to the First Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire. Its proponents believed that it could solve the social issues that the empire was facing. Ottomanism was strongly influenced by thinkers such as Montesquieu and Rousseau and the French Revolution. It promoted equality among the \\"millet\\"s. The idea originated amongst the Young Ottomans in areas such as the acceptance of all separate ethnicities in the Empire regardless of their religion, i.e. they were all 'Ottomans' with equal rights. Put simply, Ottomanism stated that all subjects were equal before the law. Ideally, all citizens would share a geographical area, a language, culture, and a sense of a 'non-Ottoman' party who were different than them. The essence of the \\"millet\\" system was not dismantled, but secular organizations and policies were applied. Primary education, conscription, head tax and military service were to be applied to non-Muslims and Muslims alike. - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits.

When I get there, the guy (Who I later heard refer to himself as the manager) asked me a few questions. He mumbled, so I asked him to repeat himself... He looked at me like I was stupid and repeated himself dramatically slowly. After a few minutes of the small group of us playing with the cute pup, he sits down next to one of the prospective moms. He attempts to lower his voice, but I wasn't sitting very close and I heard him tell her that it was between her and another girl. Uh, why am I still here then? I felt stupid sitting there. I wasn't looking for a shoulder to cry on or even be let down easy, but it would have been nice and proper for him to maybe thank us for our interest and encourage us to look around. I'm a little heartbroken that I wasn't chosen to adopt the little fellow...I'm sure that it is common that people feel like this in these situations, and this guy was pretty cold and heartless.

News article: Cholera outbreak threatens Haiti's capital PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI -- A cholera outbreak that already has left 250 people dead and more than 3,000 sickened is at the doorstep of an enormous potential breeding ground: the squalid camps in Port-au-Prince where 1.3 million earthquake survivors live. Health authorities and aid workers are scrambling to keep the tragedies from merging and the deaths from multiplying. Five cholera patients have been reported in Haiti's capital, heightening worries that the disease could reach the sprawling tent slums where abysmal hygiene, poor sanitation and widespread poverty could rapidly spread it. But government officials said Sunday that all five apparently got cholera outside Port-au-Prince, and they voiced hope that the deadly bacterial disease could be confined to the rural areas where the outbreak originated last week. \\"It's not difficult to prevent the spread to Port-au-Prince. We can prevent it,\\" said Health Ministry director Gabriel Timothee. He said tightly limiting movement of patients and careful disposal of bodies can stave off a major medical disaster. If efforts to keep cholera out of the camps fail, \\"the worst case would be that we have hundreds of thousands of people getting sick at the same time,\\" said Claude Surena, president of the Haiti Medical Association. Cholera can cause vomiting and diarrhea so severe that it can kill from dehydration in hours. Doctors Without Borders issued a statement saying that some Port-au-Prince residents were suffering from watery diarrhea and were being treated at facilities in the capital. Cholera infection among the patients had not been confirmed, however, and aid workers stressed that diarrhea has not been uncommon in Port-au-Prince since the earthquake. \\"Medical teams have treated many people with watery diarrhea over the last several months,\\" Doctors Without Borders said. Aid workers in the impoverished nation say the risk is magnified by the extreme poverty faced by people displaced by the Jan. 12 earthquake, which killed as many as 300,000 Haitians and destroyed much of the capital. Haitians living in the camps risk disease by failing to wash their hands, or scooping up standing water and then proceeding to wash fruits and vegetables. \\"There are limited ways you can wash your hands and keep your hands washed with water in slums like we have here,\\" said Michel Thieren, an official with the Pan-American Health Organization in Haiti. \\"The conditions for transmission are much higher.\\" Aid workers are coaching thousands of impoverished families how best to avoid cholera. Various aid groups are providing soap and water purification tablets and educating people in Port-au-Prince's camps about the importance of hand-washing. Aid groups also began training more staff about cholera and where to direct people with symptoms. The disease had not been seen in Haiti for decades, and many people don't know about it. Members of one grass-roots Haitian organization traveled around Port-au-Prince's camps booming warnings about cholera from speakers in the bed of a pickup. \\"In a way, it couldn't have happened at a better moment than now because everyone is on the field - lots of [nongovernmental organizations], lots of money. We haven't had any hurricanes so far this fall but people are here, and people are prepared,\\" said Marc Paquette, Haiti director for the Canadian branch of Medecins du Monde.

What's worrying is that this sickness might spread into places where many people are living because their homes were destroyed in an earthquake. These places are not very clean and might make it easy for cholera to spread more. Cholera is a really bad sickness that can make people throw up and have diarrhea so much that they can die because their bodies run out of water. Five cases have been seen in the capital city, but everyone is hoping to keep it from spreading more. They're trying to do this by keeping sick people from moving around and making sure any people who die are dealt with carefully. There's a fear that if cholera gets into the big camps where the earthquake survivors live, many, many people could get sick all at once. Aid workers are educating people about how to not get cholera, like washing their hands well. They're also training more people about cholera and where to send people who have symptoms. Lastly, despite the current situation, there is some relief as there has been a good response from support organizations and no hurricanes have occurred yet this fall."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Regular script has been attributed to Zhong Yao, of the Eastern Han to Cao Wei period (c. 151–230 AD), who has been called the \\"father of regular script\\". However, some scholars postulate that one person alone could not have developed a new script which was universally adopted, but could only have been a contributor to its gradual formation. The earliest surviving pieces written in regular script are copies of Yao's works, including at least one copied by Wang Xizhi. This new script, which is the dominant modern Chinese script, developed out of a neatly written form of early semi-cursive, with addition of the pause (頓/顿 dùn) technique to end horizontal strokes, plus heavy tails on strokes which are written to the downward-right diagonal. Thus, early regular script emerged from a neat, formal form of semi-cursive, which had itself emerged from neo-clerical (a simplified, convenient form of clerical script). It then matured further in the Eastern Jin dynasty in the hands of the \\"Sage of Calligraphy\\", Wang Xizhi, and his son Wang Xianzhi. It was not, however, in widespread use at that time, and most writers continued using neo-clerical, or a somewhat semi-cursive form of it, for daily writing, while the conservative bafen clerical script remained in use on some stelae, alongside some semi-cursive, but primarily neo-clerical.

They reside with Hank's ailing father, Buck (Peter Boyle), a racist retired corrections officer whose wife committed suicide. Hank is a deputy warden. He oversees the execution of convicted murderer Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs). As explained to Sonny by Hank, at the diner bar the night before, a \\"Monster's Ball\\" is what the execution team calls that night's get-together. The proceedings prove too intense for Sonny, who begins to vomit and then collapses as he is leading Lawrence to the electric chair. Hank confronts Sonny in the jail's bathroom afterwards and slaps him for being so \\"soft\\" and ruining a man's last walk. At home, Hank attacks Sonny in his bed and tells him to get out of the house. Sonny grabs a gun, and threatens his father, who backs off. The confrontation ends in their living room with Hank at gunpoint, lying on the carpet, and Sonny in Buck's customary chair. Sonny asks his father if he hates him. After his father calmly confirms that he does and always has, Sonny responds, \\"Well I always loved you,\\" and then shoots himself in the chest, dying instantly. Hank buries Sonny in the back garden with no real funeral because, as Buck observes, \\"He was weak.\\" Hank subsequently quits his job, burns his uniform in the backyard, and locks the door of Sonny's room.

Ulman asks to meet her but stands her up, later apologizing and offering to pay double the original salary. Samantha accepts and gets a ride to the remote mansion from her best friend, Megan (Greta Gerwig), who expresses her distrust. At the house, Mr. Ulman pulls her aside and reveals that he does not have any children to be monitored; the babysitting job is to attend to his wife's ailing mother. Samantha balks but finally agrees, if he will pay her 400, a significant increase in her pay. Megan immediately leaves, citing Ulman's lies and peculiar behavior, but she reluctantly promises to pick up Samantha later. Samantha stays, after accepting the money. On the way home, Megan stops in her car to smoke a cigarette. When her car lighter will not work, a stranger (A.J. Bowen) suddenly appears out of nowhere, startling her, and lights her cigarette for her. When Megan reveals that she is not the babysitter hired by the Ulmans, she is abruptly shot and murdered by the stranger. After ordering a pizza, Samantha dances around the house while listening to her Walkman, accidentally breaking a vase in the process. While cleaning up the mess, she discovers a cupboard filled with old family photographs. In one photograph a different family than the Ulmans' stands next to the Volvo she and Megan saw upon pulling up to the house.

You can even go back over the stencil with a second color to add shading. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time for this project, however, as stenciling can take a while. Here's a list of what you will need: Wall stencils Painter's tape or repositionable spray adhesive Foam roller or good quality stencil brush Acrylic paint or wall paint Paint pan or paint palette Paper towels You can place it anywhere you want. If you want to cover your entire wall with the design, you can start off by placing it in the top left corner of your wall or right in the middle of your wall. Once you know where you want your stencil, trace the corners lightly with a pencil. You can also outline the corners with some painter's tape. Consider using a level tool to ensure that your stencil is straight. It looks like a metal or plastic ruler, with a short, fluid-filled tube in the middle of it. The air bubble inside the tube moves around as you tilt the level about. Your project is leveled if the bubble is in the middle of the tube. You can do this by taping it to the wall along the edges with painter's tape. You can also spray the back with a repositionable spray adhesive, wait for the adhesive to get tacky, then press the stencil against the wall. Consider sealing the edges off with a few rows of painter's tape, especially if the design on your stencil is close to the edge. The painter's tape will prevent you from accidentally going over the edges of the stencil and painting the wall by mistake. Acrylic paint would be great for small areas, but if you are stenciling your entire wall, you might want to consider some wall paint instead. Choose a finish that matches the original finish of your wall: glossy, satin, eggshell, matte, etc. Do not pour too much paint out at once, or the paint will dry before you can use all of it. This way, you won't be wasting any paint. If you are using a foam roller, pour the paint out onto a paint pan. Foam rollers are great for covering large stencils and large areas. If you are using a stencil brush, pour the paint out onto a paint palette. Stencil brushes are great for covering small stencils. They are also good for designs with multiple colors. You don't want to apply too much paint all at once, or you might get drips. The paint may also leak under the stencil and create blotches. Because of this, it is much better to apply many thin coats of paint rather than one thick coat. If you are working with a stencil brush, you can tape several folded paper towels onto the wall next to your work. This way, you can hold the palette in one hand and the brush in the other. Everything will be close by. Just make sure that your paper towels are folded thick enough so that the paint does not bleed through them and onto the wall. Apply the paint using light to medium pressure. You don't want to press down too hard with your brush or foam roller, or you will squish the paint out and create blob. Work with one color at a time, and use a fresh paint roller or brush when you do. If you are using a foam roller, simply roll back and forth lightly across the pencil. If you are using a stencil brush, lightly tap the brush over the stencil. At some point, you will probably need to reload the roller or brush with more paint. Do this only when your roller or brush completely runs out of paint. Whenever you dip your roller or brush into paint, be sure to tap the excess paint off onto a paper towel. If you accidentally painted outside the stencil, wipe the paint off using a damp paper towel or a baby wipe. Consider adding some shading to your design using a stencil brush. Use a slightly darker color to do this, not straight black. This will look more realistic. A great places to use shading is around the edges or tips of your design. If some paint got under the stencil and onto the wall, use a damp Q-tip to clean the excess paint off. If there are any gaps along the edges of your design, use a thin paintbrush and some extra paint to fill in those gaps. If you painted a design, such as a branch with flowers and leaves, your stencil may have left some gaps between the different shapes. You can fill those gaps in using a thin paintbrush and extra paint for a more authentic, hand painted look. If you plan on reusing the stencil, double-check underneath it. If any paint got underneath the stencil, you might end up transferring that paint into your wall. If you see any leaked paint, wipe it off using a damp paper towel. If you attached your stencil using painter's tape, pull off the old pieces and use new ones. If you used repositionable spray adhesive, you may need to re-spray the back before you press the stencil down again. Refer to the label on your paint can or bottle. Just because something is dry to the touch does not necessarily mean it is fully dry. Most acrylic paints will be dry in 20 minutes, while some may require up to two hours. Latex wall paints will require a much longer drying and curing time. What is a summary?","completion":"Stenciling is an effective way to add designs to walls with various patterns and shading. To stencil a wall, gather materials like wall stencils, painter's tape or repositionable spray adhesive, a foam roller or stencil brush, acrylic or wall paint, a paint pan or palette, and paper towels. Begin by positioning the stencil on the wall, using a level tool to ensure it's straight, and attach it with painter's tape or spray adhesive. When applying paint, use several thin coats to avoid drips and blotches. For intricate designs, use a stencil brush for shading and filling in any gaps. Allow the paint to dry according to the label instructions before reusing the stencil for other parts of the wall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior. Now, I have a new situation: A team of geologists studied two islands. Large island had a lot of seismic activity, and Small island that presented almost no seismic activity. Answer this question please: Which island displayed more seismic waves? Answer:","completion":"The island that displayed more seismic waves was the Large Island. It's mentioned in the situation that the Large Island had a lot of seismic activity. Seismic activity refers to the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. The term 'a lot of seismic activity' refers to frequent occurrences of earthquakes in that particular region, in this case, the Large Island. These earthquakes produce seismic waves, which became an area of study for the team of geologists described in the situation. When an earthquake happens, it radiates waves of energy from its focus. This energy, traveling in the form of waves, are referred to as seismic waves. Thus, the more the seismic activity (or earthquakes), the greater the seismic waves that can be noted and studied. Conversely, the Small Island presented almost no seismic activity, indicating that it had very few or almost no earthquakes happening. Therefore, it can be deduced that due to the lack of earthquakes, there were fewer seismic waves produced in the Small Island. From the background given, we know that the absence of seismic waves can't help geologists understand the composition of the Earth's interior of that specific location. In this situation, the geological team might have an insufficient understanding of the Small Island's internal constitution as compared to the Large Island. It's also important to note that the number of seismic waves doesn't necessarily denote danger or safety. High seismic activity can indicate a tectonically active area, which might be more prone to earthquakes, but the severity of these earthquakes depends upon a multitude of factors like depth of the seismic focus, proximity to populated areas, building structures, etc. So to summarize, the Large Island displayed more seismic waves because it had more seismic activity or more earthquakes happening there. This produced more seismic waves, allowing geologists to have a better understanding of the Earth's interior in this location."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies. He cited a recent upsurge in attempted border crossings. Question: Where is Elijah Cummings a Congressman from?

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: This article: The underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music. The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector. During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, subcultural identity. In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés the Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called \\"college rock\\".A 1985 Rolling Stone feature on the Minneapolis scene and innovative California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared, \\"Primal punk is passé. The best of the American punk rockers have moved on. They have learned how to play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the Grateful Dead.\\" By the mid-to-late 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock and post-punk forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as alternative rock. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including indie rock, gothic rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and grunge, among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.As American alternative bands like Sonic Youth, which had grown out of the no wave scene, and Boston's Pixies started to gain larger audiences, major labels sought to capitalize on the underground market that had been sustained by hardcore punk for years. In 1991, Nirvana emerged from Washington State's underground, DIY grunge scene; after recording their first album, Bleach for about 600, the band achieved huge... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the band that achieved huge commercial success with its second album, Nevermind?, what is it ?

Not to diminish the quality of this release, but I smell some late Superchunk in a couple tracks.The SACD ability is nice too so long as it doesn't go the way of Betamax... Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"Based on a thorough analysis of the product review given, it is apparent that this review depicts the product in a primarily flattering light, with a few minor concerns raised by the reviewer. The following points illustrate the reasoning behind this conclusion: 1. Positive remarks about the content: The reviewer has complimented the product, an audio CD, by mentioning the \\"distinct dreamy guitars and descriptive prose\\" present in the music. This positive appraisal suggests that the overall quality of the musical content is admirable and enjoyable, reflecting a flattering image of the product. 2. Comparisons to another band: The reviewer has mentioned, \\"Not to diminish the quality of this release, but I smell some late Superchunk in a couple of tracks.\\" While it is a comparison to another band, the statement starts with a disclaimer that the intention is not to diminish the quality of the product, which implies that the reviewer acknowledges the album's uniqueness and quality despite drawing similarities to another band. This comparison can still be considered as a part of a generally flattering depiction of the product. 3. Appreciation of the SACD capability: The reviewer points out the product's Super Audio CD (SACD) ability as a positive feature, which is seen as a bonus for the listeners who can experience high-quality audio and enjoy the album to its fullest potential. This notation further reinforces the flattering depiction of the product. 4. Concern over potential obsolescence: The only explicit concern raised by the reviewer is about the SACD capability, mentioning the hope that it \\"doesn't go the way of Betamax,\\" referring to the outdated video cassette format which was eventually replaced by VHS. This concern, however, does not directly reflect upon the quality or the content of the CD itself and is a relatively minor issue compared to the other positive points mentioned. In conclusion, the review presents the audio CD in a largely flattering light, praising its content, unique sound, and SACD capability. While there is a concern about the future relevance of the SACD format, it does not take away from the positive aspects of the product. As such, this review can be considered as one that depicts the product in a predominantly flattering manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was named 'Bridewell' after the Bridewell Palace, which during the 16th century had become one of the City of London's most important prisons. Tothill Fields later became the Westminster House of Correction. Sentence: Tothill Fields Bridewell is a prison with many names.","completion":"The sentence \\"Tothill Fields Bridewell is a prison with many names\\" is true. Throughout its history, Tothill Fields Bridewell was known by multiple names reflecting its location, purpose, and connections to other institutions in London. Firstly, it was referred to as Tothill Fields Prison, which indicates its primary function as a prison and its location within the Tothill Fields area. The name Tothill Fields Bridewell also connects this prison to the historical Bridewell Palace, which was originally a royal residence and, in the 16th century, was repurposed as a prison, eventually lending the term 'Bridewell' to other similar institutions. Thus, naming the prison Tothill Fields Bridewell provided a wider context for its use and operation in London's early modern incarceration system. Additionally, the prison went by the name of Westminster Bridewell due to its location within the borough of Westminster, which was and still is an important area in central London. Utilizing this name highlights the geographical component of the prison's identity and association with the region served by the institution. Finally, the prison was referred to as the Westminster House of Correction, particularly when it underwent administrative and functional changes. The term 'House of Correction' was commonly used throughout England to designate institutions responsible for the punishment, reform, and rehabilitation of minor offenders. This name emphasizes the prison's role in reforming its inmates through labor and other means, thus capturing the broader scope of its mandate and objectives. In conclusion, Tothill Fields Bridewell, which operated under several names, sheds light on the evolution of early modern prisons in London. These names reflect various aspects of the institution's identity, such as location, function, historical ties, and progressive intentions, all of which contribute to validating the truthfulness of the given sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - refrigerator - supermarket - pantry - shelf - trunk The answer is \\"shelf\\" because","completion":"there are several factors to consider when deciding where to put groceries after buying them and reaching your home. Each option can cater to different types of groceries. As you have selected \\"shelf\\" as the answer, I will provide you with a detailed explanation of why this might be the best choice for certain items and also touch upon the other options. A shelf is an appropriate storage space for a variety of groceries, particularly non-perishable items. Here is a more detailed breakdown of what type of groceries can be stored on a shelf and why: 1. Non-perishable goods: Shelves work well for dry, non-perishable foods like canned goods, pasta, rice, cereals, and baking ingredients. These items have a long shelf-life and do not require refrigeration to preserve their quality. 2. Snacks and treats: Shelves can also be used to store snack foods such as chips, cookies, and candies. These items typically come in sealed packaging that doesn't require refrigeration, so they can be easily displayed and accessed on a shelf. 3. Household and cleaning supplies: While not technically groceries, household items like cleaning supplies, laundry detergents, and paper products can also be stored on shelves. Placing them on a shelf can help keep them organized and within easy reach when needed. However, it's important to note that not all groceries are suitable for storage on a shelf. Some items require more specific storage conditions, which brings us to the other options mentioned: - Refrigerator: Perishable goods like meat, dairy products, fruits and vegetables, and some condiments are best stored in a refrigerator. This helps preserve their freshness and prevent spoilage, ensuring the food remains safe to consume. - Pantry: A pantry is a cool, dark, and dry storage space that can be used to store similar non-perishable goods as shelves, such as canned goods, pasta, and rice. It can also be a suitable storage space for items like potatoes and onions, which require a cool and dark environment but not refrigeration. - Supermarket: This option is not applicable after bringing groceries home and is where groceries are originally purchased. - Trunk: A trunk is useful for transporting groceries from the supermarket to your home but is not ideal for long-term storage. In conclusion, a shelf is a practical choice for storing a wide range of dry and non-perishable groceries at home. It keeps items organized, easily accessible, and within view. Other storage options, such as the refrigerator, are necessary for perishable goods that require specific temperature conditions to maintain their freshness. A combination of shelves, refrigerator, and pantry will likely be required to effectively store groceries at home, depending on the specific items purchased."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lyon Gaultier is a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion, stationed in Djibouti, North Africa. His brother, who is married to an American woman in Los Angeles, is burned alive during a drug deal gone wrong and suffers third-degree burns, dying shortly afterward. Lyon deserts his legion when he finds out they have been withholding letters from his brother's wife and ultimately refuse to let him see his dying brother. He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a tramp steamer headed for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Legion Commandant travels to Paris, arriving at the government Consulate, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant suggests sending two of his own men to bring Gaultier back, which is approved. Lyon arrives pennyless in New York City and is attracted to an illegal street fighting match that is being run by a New Yorker called Joshua, a man who runs fights for money. Gaultier steps forward to take part in the next fight and destroys his opponent, leaving Joshua looking astounded at what he just saw. Joshua takes Lyon to meet a person called Cynthia, also known as 'The Lady' who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and she decides to sponsor him.

Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...","completion":"The name of the person since whose death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged is Saint-Saëns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The term \\"D.F.\\" derives from the Spanish language, indicating an aspect of Spanish influence. However, to provide a more comprehensive answer to the question, it's important to understand that \\"defeños\\" might not be the only nickname that reflects the Spanish influence of the city. The term \\"chilangos\\" is another common nickname for Mexico City residents. The nickname is believed to have originated from the Nahuatl word \\"chil\\" (chilli) and the Spanish \\"sancochar\\" (to cook), perhaps reflecting a mixture of indigenous and Spanish culinary traditions in the city. Additionally, other regional nicknames in Mexico also draw from the Spanish language or historical Spanish influence. For instance, people from the northern states of Mexico are sometimes called \\"norteños\\" while those from the southern states may be called \\"sureños,\\" both nicknames derived from the Spanish words for \\"north\\" and \\"south\\" respectively. These terms might not reflect the Spanish influence on the city of Mexico City directly but do exhibit the overall Spanish impact on regional identities within the country. To answer the question more accurately and in greater detail: residents of Mexico City are often called \\"defeños\\" or \\"chilangos,\\" reflecting different aspects of Spanish influence, such as the postal abbreviation of the Federal District (D.F.) and a mixture of indigenous and Spanish culinary traditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which group would be able to hear higher frequency, group A or group B? David wants to categorize animals according to the sound waves they can hear. Eventually, he was able to categorize them in three different groups, group A, group B, and group C. He placed the animals that can only hear ifrasound in group A. Then he placed the animals that are only able to hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do in group B. The last group of animals were able to hear only ultrasound. He placed them in group C. Hint: The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz. Answer:","completion":"Group C would be able to hear higher frequency sounds. According to the information provided, David categorized animals into three different groups based on the sound waves they can hear: Group A with animals that can only hear infrasound, Group B with animals that can only hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do, and Group C with animals that can only hear ultrasound. The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz). Humans can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Infrasound refers to sounds with frequencies below 20 Hz, which is the range Group A can hear. Ultrasound refers to sounds with frequencies above 20,000 Hz, which is the range Group C can hear. Group B, on the other hand, can hear sounds in the same frequency range as humans (20 Hz to 20,000 Hz). Since Group C animals can hear only ultrasound, which is defined as having frequencies above 20,000 Hz, they would be able to hear higher frequency sounds compared to Group A (infrasound, less than 20 Hz) and Group B (same as humans, 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz). Examples of animals that can hear sounds in the ultrasound range include dogs (up to 50,000 Hz) and bats (higher than 100,000 Hz)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Test sentence: \\"Who's there?\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","completion":"Yes, the test sentence \\"Who's there?\\" is a correct grammatical English sentence. It is an interrogative sentence and adheres to the proper grammar rules of the English language. Let's break it down into individual elements to further analyze the correctness of this sentence. 1. Interrogative Sentences: In English, there are four types of sentences, which include declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory sentences. The test sentence in question is an interrogative sentence, as it is a question that seeks information or a response. It is indicated by the question mark (?) at the end of the sentence. 2. Contraction: \\"Who's\\" is a contraction of \\"who is\\" or \\"who has.\\" In this case, it means \\"who is.\\" Contractions are commonly used in English, and they are formed by combining two words with an apostrophe (') to indicate the omission of one or more letters. Using contractions, like the one in the sentence, is perfectly grammatical and acceptable in informal speech and writing. Moreover, \\"Who's\\" starts with a capital letter \\"W,\\" which is the correct way to start a sentence in English. The sentence has a subject (\\"Who\\") and a verb (\\"is\\"), making it a complete and grammatically correct sentence. 3. Word Order: The word order in any standard English sentence usually follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern. However, when forming questions with interrogative pronouns, such as \\"who,\\" \\"what,\\" or \\"where,\\" the subject and verb may switch places, followed by the rest of the sentence. In this test sentence, we have the interrogative pronoun \\"who\\" followed by the verb \\"is.\\" 4. Punctuation: The test sentence ends with a question mark, which is the proper punctuation for interrogative sentences in English. In addition, the sentence starts with a capital letter, conforming to the standard capitalization rules. In conclusion, \\"Who's there?\\" is a grammatically correct English sentence that follows the rules of creating interrogative sentences, employs a valid contraction, and uses proper punctuation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Meek’s Cutoff, review\\" Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Meek's Cutoff: A Journey Through the Perils of the Oregon Trail\\" Introduction Meek's Cutoff, directed by Kelly Reichardt, is a captivating indie film that transports its audience on an epic journey of survival, determination, and the complexities of the human spirit. Released in 2010, Meek's Cutoff places its focus on a small group of settlers on the Oregon Trail in the early 19th century, grappling with the harsh realities of the trail and the consequences of their decisions. This review aims to analyze the film's themes, setting, characterization, and the director's technique, shining a light on the brilliance of this arresting piece of cinema. Plot and Setting Set in the dry, arid plains of Oregon, the film follows a small group of settlers, led by Stephen Meek, a self-proclaimed expert guide boasting a wealth of knowledge in traversing the Oregon Trail. As the travelers soon realize, Meek's claims are full of embellishments and deceptions, resulting in a treacherous journey that tests their physical and emotional endurance. Meek's Cutoff presents a fresh perspective on the western genre, which often romanticizes the experience of those who sought new lives in the American West. Instead of finding easy riches and endless opportunities, the characters contend with thirst, hunger, exhaustion, and their faith in one another. Themes The primary themes explored in Meek's Cutoff center around trust, leadership, and group dynamics. At the foundation of the film's tension is whether the settlers can place their faith in the ill-natured Meek. With each day bringing new hardships, the group's trust in Meek deteriorates, resulting in a power struggle that exposes the fractures within the settlers' relationships. Reichardt delves deep into the psychology of leadership and decision-making. Meek's inability to guide the group to safety exposes the consequences of blind faith in those who make grand promises but cannot deliver. The settlers' plight also serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the importance of humility, adaptability, and teamwork in the face of adversity. Characterization Meek's Cutoff boasts an ensemble cast of exceptional actors, including Michelle Williams, Bruce Greenwood, Paul Dano, and Zoe Kazan. Through their performances, the true essence of each character emerges, making it easy for the audience to immerse themselves in their stories. Michelle Williams delivers a mesmerizing portrayal of Emily Tetherow, the film's primary protagonist. Emily serves as the group's moral compass, challenging Meek's decisions and questioning the consequences of their actions. Her resilience and strength represent the backbone of the group, proving that collaboration and communal support are integral to their survival. As the eponymous character, Bruce Greenwood is superb in his portrayal of Stephen Meek. Equal parts charismatic and infuriating, Meek represents the quintessential flawed leader—his overconfidence and ego preventing him from admitting his errors and seeking the help of others. Directorial Technique Reichardt's approach to storytelling is subtle and slow-burning. She allows the film to breathe, allowing the audience to soak in the stunning landscape while contemplating the complexities of humanity. The film maintains a sense of authenticity by showcasing the grit and toil of life on the trail, an effective counterpoint to the often-glamorized western genre. Meek's Cutoff is rich in symbolism, and Reichardt's keen eye for detail is ubiquitous throughout the film. The juxtaposition of Pioneer-era gender roles with Emily's defiance disrupts the stereotypical western narrative, offering a refreshing and nuanced portrayal of women in the American frontier. Additionally, the film's denouement hints at the dire stakes and potential consequences of the settlers' journey. Conclusion Meek's Cutoff is a visceral and thought-provoking experience that leaves the audience pondering the complexities of survival and the human spirit. With stunning performances and masterful storytelling, this film invites viewers to delve deep into the thematic core of trust, leadership, and our collective search for a better life. Meek's Cutoff is a hidden gem of the indie film scene and a haunting reminder of the American West's harsh reality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Would \\"The sticky, thick fluid secreted by the mucous membranes and glands is termed mucus .\\" be a reasonable answer? Possible answers: (A). No. (B). Yes. A:","completion":"B). Yes. The sticky, thick fluid secreted by the mucous membranes and glands is indeed termed mucus. Mucous membranes are specialized tissues that line the inner surfaces of many body cavities and organs, such as the respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, and reproductive systems. These protective tissues serve as the body's first line of defense against pathogens and foreign particles. Mucus is a complex, viscous liquid secreted by specialized cells called goblet cells or mucous-secreting glands, such as submucosal glands or the exocrine glands in some cases. The principal components of mucus are water, glycoproteins called mucins, various electrolytes, lipids, and a variety of immune cells and proteins that help defend the body from infection and maintain tissue homeostasis. The primary functions of mucus are numerous and vital to the body's health and well-being. Here are some of the essential functions of mucus: 1. Protection: Mucous membranes and their secreted mucus serve as a physical barrier between the body's internal environment and the external world, preventing the entry of harmful substances and microbes. 2. Lubrication: Mucus reduces friction between mucous membranes and other tissues, easing and facilitating movement in the body, such as swallowing, digestion, and respiration. 3. Hydration: The water content of mucus helps to keep mucous membranes moist, preventing them from drying out and maintaining their durability and flexibility. 4. Immune defense: Mucus contains numerous components of the immune system, such as immunoglobulins, lysozyme, and lactoferrin, that help neutralize and capture pathogens to protect the body from infection. 5. Ciliary movement: In the respiratory system, the presence of mucus and the coordinated movement of cilia on the surface of specialized epithelial cells create a \\"mucociliary escalator,\\" which helps to trap and expel foreign particles, microbes, and other debris from the lungs and airways. 6. Digestion: Mucus plays a significant role in gastrointestinal function, as it provides lubrication to facilitate the passage of food through the digestive tract and plays a role in protecting stomach lining from acidic digestive juices. Hence, the answer is B). Yes. \\"The sticky, thick fluid secreted by the mucous membranes and glands is termed mucus\\" is a reasonable answer, as it accurately describes the nature and origin of mucus in the context of mucous membranes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Queens is the easternmost and largest in area of the five boroughs of New York City. It is geographically adjacent to the borough of Brooklyn at the southwestern end of Long Island, and to Nassau County further east on Long Island; in addition, Queens shares water borders with the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx. Coterminous with Queens County since 1899, the borough of Queens is the second-largest in population (after Brooklyn), with a census-estimated 2,339,150 residents in 2015, approximately 48% of them foreign-born. Queens County also is the second-most populous county in the U.S. state of New York, behind the neighboring borough of Brooklyn, which is coterminous with Kings County. Queens is the fourth-most densely populated county among New York City's boroughs, as well as in the United States. If each of New York City's boroughs were an independent city, Queens also would be the nation's fourth most populous city, after Los Angeles, Chicago, and Brooklyn. Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. - Interscope Records is an American record company. A division of Interscope Geffen A&M Records, its parent company is the Universal Music Group, a subsidiary of Vivendi S.A. - San Francisco de Macorís is a city in the Dominican Republic located in the northeast portion of the island, in the Cibao region. It is the capital of the Duarte Province, and the sixth most populated city in the country. The name \\"San Francisco de Macorís\\" comes from a fusion of the name of Saint Francis, patron saint of the Franciscan Order (a religious organization from Italy that had come to this territory during colonization) and the territory's old name, which is \\"Macorix\\". - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western one-third of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean nation by area (after Cuba) at , and 3rd by population with 10.08 million people, of which approximately three million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city. - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements. - John David Jackson (born November 18, 1977), better known by his stage name Fabolous, is an American hip hop recording artist from Brooklyn, New York City.

A month later, Snaps awakes at his mansion and begins his important morning. He has a meeting with several prominent bankers, as he hopes to donate a large sum of cash and join the bankâs board of trustees, thereby having an honest job and keeping his word to his father. Anthony Rossano, Snaps's young, good-natured accountant, arrives at the mansion and tells his boss that heâs in love, asks for a 250% raise, then tells Snaps the true love he speaks of is actually \\"Snaps's daughter.\\" Snaps is furious, does not want his daughter marrying Anthony and goes to talk to his daughter, Lisa. Lisa is the only child of Snaps and Sofia, a spoiled daughter whose dreams of seeing the worldâs great sights run into a roadblock because of her overly protective father. Wishing to move out of the house, she lies to her parents (at the suggestion of the maid, Nora) and claims to be pregnant. Snaps, believing the father to be Anthony (as he wants to marry \\"Snaps's daughter\\"), is shocked when Lisa says the father is Oscar, the former chauffeur who is now serving overseas in the military. Things get even more complicated when Anthony learns that Theresa, the woman he fell in love with, is not actually Snaps' daughter as she had claimed to be. Before Anthony can catch on, Snaps tricks him into agreeing to marry his actual daughter, Lisa, who is supposedly pregnant but without a husband. Both Lisa and Anthony are unhappy at the hasty arrangement, and the pair luck out when Lisa falls in love with someone else: Dr. Thornton Poole, Snaps' dialectician, whose frequent world travels appeal to her adventurous nature.

I added that it was not a factor of distance . If he had been here in the US , he would still have to wait for my love . Answer the following question: Why is the narrator asking for patience ?","completion":"The narrator is asking for patience because they recognize that love and meaningful relationships are not something that can be rushed or forced. In this situation, the narrator is trying to convey the importance of taking the necessary time for genuine emotions and connections to develop and blossom. There are several reasons why the narrator might be emphasizing the need for patience: 1. Emotional Readiness: The narrator might not feel emotionally ready to engage in a deep romantic relationship, even if the other person is exhibiting strong feelings towards them. They might need time to process their emotions, thoughts, and past experiences before opening up and committing to a relationship wholeheartedly. 2. Trust and Understanding: Building trust and understanding is a crucial foundation for a strong and healthy relationship. The narrator may be asking for patience from the person pursuing their love, as it takes time to truly get to know someone, understand their values, dreams, and fears, and develop a solid trust between the two individuals. 3. Personal Growth: The narrator may be going through a period of personal growth and self-discovery, during which they wish to focus on their individual journey and well-being. In this context, the narrator's request for patience highlights the importance of personal growth before committing to a relationship, ensuring that both parties are emotionally stable and mature enough to navigate the challenges that might arise in the course of their union. 4. Fear of Repeating Past Mistakes: If the narrator has experienced disappointment or heartbreak in previous relationships, they could be cautious about rushing into a new one. They might be wary of the potential consequences of rushing into this relationship and would prefer to take their time to avoid making the same mistakes or falling into the same patterns. 5. Distance and Practicality: As the narrator mentioned the factor of distance, it could be that they are acknowledging the challenges and complications that long-distance relationships might bring. They might be asking for patience to see how the relationship develops and how both parties manage the aspects of distance and separation before fully committing to each other. In conclusion, the narrator's request for patience is a reflection of their desire for a strong, healthy, and lasting relationship. They understand that love is complex and delicate; thus, it requires time, effort, and patience to flourish. By emphasizing the need for patience, the narrator communicates a mature and thoughtful approach to their romantic life, ultimately seeking a meaningful connection with their potential partner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information: - The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990, and remains in operation. Although not the first space telescope, Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile, and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy. The HST is named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, and is one of NASA's Great Observatories, along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope. - The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. The descriptive \\"milky\\" is derived from the appearance from Earth of the galaxy a band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term \\"Milky Way\\" is a translation of the Latin ', from the Greek (', \\"milky circle\\"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies. - The Galactic Center is the rotational center of the Milky Way. The estimates for its location range from 7.6 to 8.7 kiloparsecs (about 25,000 to 28,000 lightyears) from Earth in the direction of the constellations Sagittarius, Ophiuchus, and Scorpius where the Milky Way appears brightest. There is strong evidence consistent with the existence of a supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center of the Milky Way. - WR 102ka , also known as the Peony star , is a Wolf - Rayet star that is one of several candidates for the most luminous known star in the Milky Way . An even more luminous yet closer star , WR 25 , appears to be most likely to the title . Another nearer star Eta Carinae , which was the second brightest star in the sky for a few years in the 19th century , appears to be slightly more luminous than WR 102ka , but is known to be a binary star system . There is also the more recently discovered Pistol star that , like the Peony star , derives its name from the shape of the nebula in which it is embedded , and which it has probably created through heavy mass loss via fierce stellar winds and perhaps also major \`\` mini-supernova - like '' eruptions as happened to Eta Carinae around the 1830s - 1840s creating the lobes observed by the Hubble Space Telescope . The luminosities of the Pistol Star , Eta Carinae , and WR 102ka are all rendered somewhat uncertain due to heavy obscuration by galactic dust in the foreground , the effects of which must be corrected for before their apparent brightness can be reduced to estimate their total radiated power or bolometric luminosity . Both Eta Carinae and WR 102ka are believed likely to explode as supernovas or hypernovas within the next few million years . As is typical of such extremely massive and luminous stars , both have expelled a considerable portion of their initial mass , when originally formed , in dense , massive stellar winds . As WR 102ka lies near the Galactic Center , it is the more distant and heavily obscured of the two , and is essentially totally obscured in visible wavelengths . Thus it must be observed in longer wavelength infrared light , which is able to penetrate the dust . The Spitzer Space Telescope observed WR 102ka at wavelengths of 3.6 µm , 8 µm , and 24 µm on April 20 , 2005 . The observations were carried out by L. Oskinova , W. - R. Hamann , and A. Barniske of Potsdam University , Germany . WR 102ka was previously observed by the Two Micron All... - Eta Carinae (abbreviated to Carinae or Car), formerly known as Eta Argus, is a stellar system containing at least two stars with a combined luminosity over five million times that of the Sun, located around 7500 light-years (2300 parsecs) distant in the constellation Carina. First recorded as a 4th-magnitude star, it brightened considerably over the period 1837 to 1856 in an event known as the Great Eruption. Eta Carinae became the second-brightest star in the sky between 11 and 14 March 1843 before fading well below naked eye visibility. It has brightened consistently since about 1940, peaking above magnitude 4.5 in 2014. Eta Carinae is circumpolar south of latitude 30°S, so it is never visible north of latitude 30°N. - The Pistol Star is a blue hypergiant star, one of the most luminous known in the Milky Way. It is one of many massive young stars in the Quintuplet cluster in the Galactic Center region. The star owes its name to the shape of the Pistol Nebula, which it illuminates. It is located approximately 25,000 light years from Earth in the direction of Sagittarius. It would be visible to the naked eye as a fourth magnitude star if it were not for the interstellar dust that completely hides it from view in visible light. - The Pistol Nebula is located in the constellation Sagittarius. It surrounds one of the most luminous stars known, the Pistol Star. Both are located 25,000 light years away from Earth in the Quintuplet cluster, near the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The nebula contains approximately 9.3 solar masses worth of ionized gas that was ejected by the star several thousand years ago. The nebula was named in the 1980s for its shape as seen in low resolution images that were available at the time. The Pistol Star, a luminous blue variable is 1.6 million times brighter than the Sun making it one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way. - A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang. - A low Earth orbit (LEO) is an orbit around Earth with an altitude between (orbital period of about 88 minutes), and (about 127 minutes). Objects below approximately will experience very rapid orbital decay and altitude loss. What object entity has the relation of 'constellation' with the subject 'wr 102ka'?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this \\"Watch the masters. . Distort the mic. Move around. Get down into the crowd. Look like your audience\\"","completion":"Title: The Art of Stage Mastery: Embracing the Mantras of Performance Music may be the heart and soul of a live performance, but the magic ensues from how it is handled and delivered. Based on this mantra, \\"Watch the masters... Distort the mic...Move around... Get down into the crowd...Look like your audience\\", the essence of a captivating performance transcends beyond just talent. It merges principles such as learning from the greats, manipulating the tools of your trade, engaging the crowd physically and emotionally, and connecting with them on a human level. To begin, the starting point for any aspiring performer should be to \\"watch the masters\\". Understanding great performers and their techniques hold incredible value. It offers first-hand inspiration that can fuel artistic growth and polishes the natural talent one may possess. The masters - the likes of Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, Mick Jagger, or Beyonce - are regarded as such not just because of their vocal prowess or instrumental genius, but for their abilities to encapsulate an audience, their towering stage presence, and their unique delivery styles. Break down their performances, decipher their techniques, learn their art, and apply these lessons to your performances. The next mantra \\"distort the mic\\" refers to manipulating the tools of your trade, in this case, the microphone. The microphone is a performer's best friend. Learn its tricks, understand its nuances, and make it an extension of yourself. The power of microphone control can amplify emotion, focus attention and can transform a simple phrase into an unforgettable performance. How you hold it, how you move it around, and how you maintain your distance from it - all equates to how clearly, loudly or softly the audience hears your music. Ultimately, distortion of the sound can create a sense of closeness, a feeling of rawness, and an intense emotive connection to the audience. \\"Move around\\" and \\"get down into the crowd\\" embody yet another vital aspect of stage performance - crowd engagement. Static performances may feed the ears, but they certainly don't feast the eyes. Moving across the stage, exploring the space, and using your body language to narrate your music makes a significant difference in the overall performance. Moreover, coming down into the crowd has a literal and psychological implication. Literally, it means get close, be part of them, engage them in your performance, make it an experience they will never forget. Psychologically, it signifies humility, a shared experience and a deep connection which makes the audience feel as though they are part of the show. Finally, \\"look like your audience\\" is a mantra that transcends the mere physical, delving into deeper realms of emotional affinity and authenticity. It is about rendering yourself relatable to your audience, finding common ground, and using that to form a profound connection. This can be achieved through your outfit, your language, your interests or the themes of your songs. Authenticity here is key. It is not about pretending to be like your audience; it is about finding and emphasizing the similarities that exist. In conclusion, the secrets to delivering a captivating live performance float beyond talent alone. Embracing techniques and principles such as watching and learning from the masters, mastering your tools, actively engaging and connecting with your audience, and bringing authenticity to your stage persona are indispensable. Such a performer does not only entertain the audience but also creates an unforgettable experience, a bond between the performer and the listener that lasts long after the curtain falls."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although Jennifer was initially surprised by Tanya's request, she agreed to help her friend with the task. Upon entering Tanya's home, she found an impressive pile of clothing waiting to be ironed. Step 4: As Jennifer helps Tanya, they bond over the experience and learn from each other's perspectives. As Jennifer expertly handled the garments, Tanya marveled at her ability to turn the chore into an art form. The two friends chatted about other aspects of their lives, finding common ground in their love of fashion and personal style, despite their differing opinions on ironing. Step 5: As a result of their bonding, Tanya starts to change her views on ironing and its role in her life. By the time the last garment was pressed and hung, Tanya found that she had not only gained a deeper appreciation for Jennifer's skills but also a new perspective on ironing itself. While she still didn't particularly enjoy the task, she could now see the value in mastering the technique. Jennifer offered to help Tanya learn the basics, starting with her newly ironed dress. Step 6: Show how their relationship grows from the experience, with each person learning and growing as a result. Tanya gratefully accepted Jennifer's offer, and the two friends spent the next day learning and practicing the art of ironing. This shared experience helped to strengthen their bond and further enrich their friendship while also allowing them to develop newfound skills and understanding. Jennifer then started to understand why some people just couldn't stand ironing and Tanya learned ways to make it a more enjoyable task."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Francis George Steiner, FBA (born April 23, 1929) is a French-born American literary critic, essayist, philosopher, novelist, and educator. He has written extensively about the relationship between language, literature and society, and the impact of the Holocaust. An article in The Guardian described Steiner as a \\"polyglot and polymath\\", saying that he is either \\"often credited with recasting the role of the critic\\", or a \\"pretentious namedropper\\" whose \\"range comes at the price of inaccuracy\\" and \\"complacency\\". Among his admirers, Steiner is ranked \\"among the great minds in today's literary world.\\" In 1956 Steiner returned to the United States, where for two years he was a scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He also held a Fulbright professorship in Innsbruck, Austria from 1958 to 1959. In 1959, he was appointed Gauss Lecturer at Princeton, where he lectured for another two years. He then became a founding fellow of Churchill College at the University of Cambridge in 1961. Steiner was initially not well received at Cambridge by the English faculty. Many disapproved of this charismatic \\"firebrand with a foreign accent\\" and questioned the relevance of the Holocaust he constantly referred to in his lectures. Bryan Cheyette, professor of 20th-century literature at the University of Southampton said that at the time, \\"Britain [...] didn't think it had a relationship to the Holocaust; its mythology of the war was rooted in the Blitz, Dunkirk, the Battle of Britain.\\" While Steiner received a professorial salary, he was never made a full professor at Cambridge with the right to examine. He had the option of leaving for professorships in the United States, but Steiner's father objected, saying that Hitler, who said no one bearing their name would be left in Europe, would then have won. Steiner remained in England because \\"I'd do anything rather than face such contempt from my father.\\" He was elected an Extraordinary Fellow at Cambridge in 1969. After several years as a freelance writer and occasional lecturer, Steiner accepted the post of Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Geneva in 1974; he held this post for 20 years, teaching in four languages. He lived by Goethe's maxim that \\"no monoglot truly knows his own language.\\" He became Professor Emeritus at Geneva University on his retirement in 1994, and an Honorary Fellow at Balliol College at Oxford University in 1995. He has since held the positions of the first Lord Weidenfeld Professor of Comparative European Literature and Fellow of St Anne's College at Oxford University from 1994 to 1995, and Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University from 2001 to 2002. Steiner has been called \\"an intelligent and intellectual critic and essayist.\\" He was active on undergraduate publications while at the University of Chicago and later become a regular contributor of reviews and articles to many journals and newspapers including the Times Literary Supplement and The Guardian. He has written for The New Yorker for over thirty years, contributing over two hundred reviews. While Steiner generally takes things very seriously, he also reveals an unexpected deadpan humor: when he was once asked if he had ever read anything trivial as a child, he replied, Moby-Dick.

As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce.

The question is asking which genus, Zanthoxylum or Legousia, has more plants that produce flowers. Step 2: Research the genera Zanthoxylum and Legousia In order to provide an accurate answer, I will need to gather information on both genera. I will investigate each genus separately to understand their characteristics and number of plants that produce flowers. -Zanthoxylum: This genus belongs to the family Rutaceae and contains about 250 species of deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs. The plants in this genus have pinnately compound leaves, and they are known for their flowers and fruit. -Legousia: This genus belongs to the family Campanulaceae and consists of herbaceous plants. There are approximately 6-9 species in this genus, and they are known for their bell-shaped flowers.

Information: - The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War, often referred to in France as the War of 1870 (19 July 1871), was a conflict between the Second French Empire of Napoleon III and the German states of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. The conflict was caused by Prussian ambitions to extend German unification and French fears of the shift in the European balance of power that would result if the Prussians succeeded. Some historians argue that the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck deliberately provoked a French attack in order to draw the southern German statesBaden, Württemberg, Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadtinto an alliance with the North German Confederation dominated by Prussia, while others contend that Bismarck did not plan anything and merely exploited the circumstances as they unfolded. - The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German language: \\"Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes\\"), or simply the Knight's Cross (\\"Ritterkreuz\\"), and its variants were the highest awards in the military and paramilitary forces of Nazi Germany during World War II. - The Iron Cross (abbreviated EK) was a military decoration in the Kingdom of Prussia, and later in the German Empire (18711918) and Nazi Germany (19331945). It was established by King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia in March 1813 backdated to the birthday of his late wife Queen Louise on 10 March 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars (EK 1813). Louise was the first person to receive this decoration (posthumous). The recommissioned Iron Cross was also awarded during the Franco-Prussian War (EK 1870), World War I (EK 1914), and World War II (EK 1939, re-introduced with a swastika added in the center). The Iron Cross was normally a military decoration only, though there were instances of it being awarded to civilians for performing military functions. Two examples of this were civilian test pilots Hanna Reitsch who was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class and 1st Class and Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, who was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class, for their actions as pilots during World War II. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\").

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The swastika (also known outside the Indian subcontinent as the Hakenkreuz, gammadion cross, cross cramponnée, croix gammée, fylfot, or tetraskelion) (as a character or ) is an ancient religious symbol originating from the Indian subcontinent, that generally takes the form of an equilateral cross with four legs each bent at 90 degrees.

Background: Sheldon Gary Adelson (pronounced ; born August 4, 1933) is an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He is the founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Las Vegas Sands Corporation, which owns the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, and is the parent company of Venetian Macao Limited, which operates The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. He also owns the Israeli daily newspaper Israel Hayom and the American daily newspaper Las Vegas Review-Journal. Adelson, a lifelong donor and philanthropist to a variety of causes, also founded the Adelson Foundation in 2007, at the initiative of his wife, Miriam. Context: A June 2008 profile in The New Yorker detailed several controversies involving Adelson. In 2008 Richard Suen, a Hong Kong businessman who had helped Adelson make connections with top Chinese officials in order to obtain the Macau license, took Adelson to court in Las Vegas alleging he had reneged on his agreement to allow Suen to profit from the venture. Suen won a 43.8 million judgement; in November 2010, the Nevada Supreme Court overturned the judgment and returned the case to the lower court for further consideration. In the 2013 retrial, the jury awarded Suen a verdict for 70 million. The judge added another 31.6 million in interest, bringing the total judgment against Adelson to 101.6 million. Adelson is appealing again. Adelson faces another trial over claims by three alleged \\"middlemen\\" in the deal who are suing for at least 450 million. In February 2013, the Las Vegas Sands, in a regulatory filing, acknowledged that it had likely violated federal law that prohibits the bribing of foreign officials. Allegedly, Chinese officials were bribed to allow Adelson to build his Macau casino. Adelson successfully sued the Daily Mail of London for libel in 2008. The newspaper had accused him of pursuing \\"despicable business practices\\" and having \\"habitually and corruptly bought political favour\\". Adelson won the libel case, which was described as \\"a grave slur on Mr Adelson's personal integrity and business reputation\\", and he won a judgment of approximately PS4 million, which he said he would donate to London's Royal Marsden Hospital. In August 2012, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), after being threatened with a libel suit, apologized and withdrew two blog posts that claimed Adelson had donated \\"Chinese prostitution money\\" to Republicans. Another organization, the National Jewish Democratic Council, posted on their website that Adelson \\"personally approved\\" of prostitution at his Macau resorts. Adelson sued for libel, but a federal judge dismissed the suit in September 2013, ordering Adelson to pay the NJDC's legal fees. Question: What was the judgement due to?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The judgment was due to a legal dispute between Sheldon Adelson and Richard Suen, a Hong Kong businessman. In 2008, Suen filed a lawsuit against Adelson alleging that Adelson had reneged on his agreement to allow Suen to profit from the venture of obtaining a license for Adelson's Macau casino. Suen claimed that he helped Adelson make connections with top Chinese officials in order to secure the license for the Macau casino operation. Initially, Suen won a judgment of 43.8 million, but the Nevada Supreme Court overturned the judgment in November 2010 and sent the case back to the lower court for further consideration.

Article: Opened in 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first longspan bridge to carry motor traffic, and it quickly became the model for the great suspension bridges of the following century. Spanning New York's East River, it provided the first traffic artery between Manhattan Island and Brooklyn. Before that, the only transportation was by ferries, which were slow and could be dangerous in winter. The construction of a bridge over the EastRiver had been discussed since the early 19th century, but the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 _ all consideration of the project. When the war ended in 1865, the bridge became an important issue once more. In 1867, the New York State passed an act setting up the New York Bridge Company for the purpose of constructing a bridge between Manhattan Island and Brooklyn. John Augustus Roebling was chosen to design the bridge. Born in Germany in 1806, he held aggressive views as a student and was listed by the German police as a dangerous figure. He emigrated to America in 1830 to escape political discrimination. Roebling proposed a bridge with a span of 1,500 feet (465 m), with two towers in the East River serving as the main piers. The bridge that was actually built is longer--1,597 feet (486 m), the longest suspension bridge at that time.

Summarize this article: The enormous drought scorching the central USA will almost certainly cost at least 12 billion, making it the costliest since 1988, experts said Wednesday. \\"There does seem to be near-unanimous agreement from industry experts that this year's drought losses will surpass the 12 billion recorded in 2011,\\" says meteorologist Steve Bowen of Aon Benfield, a global reinsurance firm. The Department of Agriculture said Wednesday that food prices next year could go up by 3%-4% as a result, with beef expected to take the highest jump at 4%-5%. About 64% of the contiguous USA is in a drought, according to today's U.S. Drought Monitor, a federal website. \\"Right now, it is difficult to say whether we end up reaching the loss levels of 1988 (40 billion) and 1980 (20 billion), given that it will be several months for agricultural industries to fully assess the total extent of their losses,\\" Bowen says. If adjusted for inflation to 2012 dollars, Bowen says, those drought losses would be 78 billion and 56 billion, based on National Climatic Data Center figures. \\"If the intensity of this year's drought is prolonged throughout the rest of the summer, it may not be out of the question to experience losses that rival something seen out of those 1980s events,\\" Bowen says. Joseph Glauber, chief economist for the USDA, says his department won't have a clear picture of how much damage the nation's crops have sustained until a report Aug. 10. However, \\"it is safe to say\\" that this year's crop-insurance payments to farmers hit by drought will top the 10.8 billion paid last year, he says. Paul Walker, senior meteorologist for AccuWeather, says that in many areas of the Corn Belt, rain wouldn't help because \\"it is getting too late in the growing season.\\" David Friedberg, founder and CEO of the San Francisco-based Climate Corporation, which sells insurance to farmers to supplement their federal crop insurance, estimates that yields on the 160 million acres of corn and soybeans planted in the U.S. this year will eventually be 30% lower than in a typical weather year. \\"In 2013, as a result of this drought, we are looking at above-normal food-price inflation. … Consumers are certainly going to feel it,\\" Richard Volpe, USDA economist, says. Normal grocery price inflation is about 2.8%, he added, so even at the low end of the projected range people will see their grocery expenses rise more than usual in 2013. The USDA kept its projected food price increase for 2012 steady at 2.5% to 3.5%. ||||| Drought-damaged ears of corn are seen against dry, cracked earth on a farm near Fairbury, Illinois July 24, 2012. WASHINGTON | WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Food prices will race ahead faster than prices of other goods in the United States this year and next, due to the worst drought in more than a half a century, the government forecast on Wednesday. Food prices rose 3.7 percent in 2011, and American consumers may pay 3.5 percent more at the grocery store this year, with higher prices for meat, poultry and fruit, as the drought gripping the U.S. farm belt drives up crop prices. The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast that food prices would jump between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent in 2012 and then rise 3-4 percent in 2013. \\"The drought is really going to hit food prices next year,\\" said Richard Volpe, a USDA economist, adding the pressure on food prices would start to build later this year. \\"It's already affecting corn and soybean prices, but then it has to work its way all the way through the system into feed prices and then animal prices, then wholesale prices and then finally, retail prices,\\" Volpe said. Food prices will rise far more rapidly than the overall U.S. inflation rate, according to USDA, a turnabout from the usual pattern. The U.S. inflation rate is estimated for 2 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2013. Food inflation was 3.7 percent last year but only 0.8 percent in 2010. Corn and soybeans have hit record highs on concerns the drought will slash yields for grain that is already in tight supply globally. Corn for September delivery was up 3.5 cents on Wednesday to 7.93 a bushel after forecasts showing the region could expect only patchy rains and more of the scorching triple digit heat.

While these proposals are a step in the right direction, the charity asserts that significant financial investment is required to ensure their success. (Step 1: Provide a relevant and engaging title that highlights the main point of the article, along with a brief introduction that serves as a hook for the reader.) Body: The proposed greenways, which will span an impressive 1,000 km (620 miles), are designed to encourage more people to adopt environmentally friendly means of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and the use of electric scooters and public transit. These designated pathways aim to provide safer and more pleasant routes for individuals opting for these alternatives to traditional motor vehicle travel. (Step 2: Elaborate on the key details of the proposals, explaining the rationale behind the concept of greenways and their expected benefits.) The charity has long been campaigning for a reduction in reliance on cars, highlighting the various benefits green transportation methods offer. In addition to reducing air pollution, noise pollution, and carbon emissions associated with motor vehicles, swapping to eco-friendly methods promotes improved physical and mental health and fosters a stronger sense of community. (Step 3: Provide background information on the charity's goals and the advantages of green transportation.) Despite the excitement surrounding the proposed greenways, the charity emphasizes that significant funding is necessary to make their vision a reality. The required investment would not only cover the creation and maintenance of the pathways themselves but also ensure they are integrated effectively with existing transportation infrastructure, such as bike lanes and public transit systems. Furthermore, the charity believes that additional support is needed for ongoing initiatives that educate the public about the benefits of green transportation and encourage its widespread adoption. (Step 4: Explain the charity's stance on the necessity of substantial financial investment and elaborate on the various aspects that require funding.) In response to the call for increased investment, local and national government representatives have expressed their willingness to explore financing options for the greenways project. Various potential sources of funding include public-private partnerships, allocation of funds through municipal budgets, and financial support from environmental organizations and advocacy groups. (Step 5: Address the potential methods of acquiring necessary funding and show that the people in power are prepared to consider the options.) Conclusion: The proposal for an extensive 1,000 km (620 mile) network of greenways signifies a crucial development in the effort to create a more sustainable and eco-friendly nation. While the charity responsible for campaigning for greener transportation is keen on these initiatives, they firmly emphasize the necessity for significant investment to ensure the success and true potential of these pathways. As both local and national governments deliberate on funding options, there is a growing sense of optimism and commitment to protecting the environment and promoting healthier, greener communities.

The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease. With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1] Two neighboring countries with similar economies, followed different political and economical agendas. Niger developed its infrastructure and communications technology, while Nigeria didn't. Which country experiences a more noticeable distance decay effect? A:","completion":"Nigeria would experience a more noticeable distance decay effect because it did not develop its infrastructure and communications technology. These developments, as highlighted, help to mitigate the effects of distance decay by enabling quicker travel and easier communication over distances. Hence, without these developments, Nigeria's interactions with other locales, especially those further away, would be likely to decrease more significantly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. When impure (cast) iron is in contact with water, oxygen, other strong oxidants, or acids, it rusts. If salt is present, for example in seawater or salt spray, the iron tends to rust more quickly, as a result of electrochemical reactions. Iron metal is relatively unaffected by pure water or by dry oxygen. As with other metals, like aluminium, a tightly adhering oxide coating, a passivation layer, protects the bulk iron from further oxidation. The conversion of the passivating ferrous oxide layer to rust results from the combined action of two agents, usually oxygen and water. Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: does the quality of air and water affect the rusting process? Choose your answer from: [1]. no; [2]. yes;","completion":"[2]. yes; The quality of air and water does affect the rusting process. As mentioned in the text, when impure (cast) iron comes into contact with water, oxygen, other strong oxidants, or acids, it rusts. If salt is present, such as in seawater or salt spray, the iron tends to rust more quickly due to electrochemical reactions. In addition, pure water and dry oxygen have little effect on iron.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols?\\" is \\"glucose\\", given that oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's first break down the components and processes involved in cellular respiration for organisms consuming Volatile Organic Acids (VOAs) and alcohols. Step 1: Identify the role of VOAs and alcohols in cellular respiration Volatile Organic Acids (VOAs) and alcohols, such as ethanol, are alternative carbon sources for certain organisms. These organisms have the ability to metabolize VOAs and alcohols to generate energy through cellular respiration. Step 2: Identify the key elements involved in cellular respiration Cellular respiration is the process by which cells break down organic molecules, such as glucose, and convert this into ATP, the energy currency of the cell. There are three key stages in cellular respiration: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle), and the electron transport chain. Oxygen plays a crucial role as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, allowing the generation of a significant amount of ATP. Step 3: Compare the roles of glucose and oxygen in cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols Glucose is a common carbon source for most organisms and is broken down through glycolysis, followed by the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain to produce ATP. However, when organisms consume VOAs and alcohols, they metabolize these compounds to generate energy instead of glucose. Oxygen is essential because it serves as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, regardless of whether the organism is metabolizing glucose, VOAs, or alcohols. Step 4: Answer the question Given that oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols, the right answer to the question \\"what is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols?\\" is not \\"glucose.\\" Instead, oxygen plays a crucial role in this process, as it is required for the generation of ATP via the electron transport chain, regardless of the carbon source being utilized."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century Question: \\"What novellas are morality tales about Asia's Femme Fatale White Snake?\\" Answer: \\"âThe Lust of the White Serpantâ & âEternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagodaâ\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct. \\"The Lust of the White Serpent\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\", a traditional Chinese story, are indeed novellas that serve as morality tales about Asia's Femme Fatale Madame White Snake. These stories depict her not just as a villainous entity but also as a complex and multi-dimensional character that evolves into a more realistic human figure, embodying qualities of both a loving wife and a dangerous snake demon. Both novellas demonstrate the character's transformation and journey as a femme fatale, drawing the readers into her world, which is fraught with passion, danger, and transgression. However, both stories also serve as cautionary tales, warning the reader of the dangers inherent in succumbing to the allure of a femme fatale. In the course of the narrative, Madame White Snake transitions from a snake demon preying on her human husband, to a caring, loving wife, who even assumes the role of a rescuer in times of adversity, thereby embodying the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife. Yet, the essence of her character as a femme fatale endures—intriguing, captivating, and dangerous—and is manifested in her sexuality, proving the point that she cannot lead a peaceful life with her human husband. The contradictions in her character thereby enhance her appeal, making the readers empathize with her, while simultaneously cautioning them about the potential dangers such a character could pose. Over the centuries, the legend of Madame White Snake has had a considerable influence on East Asian folktales, stories, and narratives, with her character emerging as an enduring symbol of the enigmatic and dangerous femme fatale. This enduring appeal of her character highlights the fascination for such figures in literature and underscores the intricate balance between attraction and danger, morality, and transgression, that they represent. Thus, these novellas not only offer an intriguing domain of a femme fatale but also prompt the reader to confront the moral dilemmas posed by such characters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After being raped and brutalized by a client, Vincent Corey, Aileen kills him in self-defense and decides to quit prostitution. She confesses her action to Selby, while Selby has been angry with her for not supporting the two of them. Aileen tries to find legitimate work; but because of her lack of qualifications and criminal history, prospective employers reject her and are occasionally openly hostile. Desperate for money, she returns to prostitution. She robs and kills her johns, each killed in a more brutal way than the last, as she is convinced that they are all trying to rape her. She spares one man out of pity when he admits he has never had sex with a prostitute but eventually kills another man who, instead of exploiting her, offers help. Aileen uses the money she steals from her victims to indulge herself and Selby. However, as Selby reads in the papers about the string of murders, she begins to suspect that Aileen may have committed them. She confronts Aileen, who justifies her actions by claiming she was only protecting herself. Horrified, Selby returns to Ohio on a charter bus. Aileen is eventually arrested at a biker bar and speaks to Selby one last time while in jail. Selby reveals some incriminating information over the telephone and Aileen realizes that the police are listening in.

Write an article based on this summary: Arrange your seating near any windows. Leave out a few creative pieces. Make a spot for guests to leave their coats. Add 1 or more tables for food and drinks. Article:","completion":"Title: Enhancing Your Living Space: Tips for Creating a Welcoming Atmosphere Introduction: A well-arranged living space can set the tone for a comfortable and enjoyable environment, whether you're relaxing alone or entertaining guests. In this article, we will explore some simple yet effective ways to optimize your living space, focusing on seating arrangements, creative decor, guest-friendly features, and functional furniture such as tables for food and drinks. Step 1: Arrange your seating near windows The first thing you can do to create a welcoming atmosphere is to consider the placement of your seating. Positioning your seating arrangements near windows not only takes advantage of natural light but also provides a visually-pleasing view for you and your guests. Ample sunlight gives a feeling of warmth and brightness, making your space more inviting and comfortable. Remember, natural light can also help to lift your mood and increase productivity. Step 2: Display creative pieces Incorporating a few creative pieces into your living space can add personality and make your space uniquely yours. Consider adding artwork, sculptures, or even a small collection of items that reflect your interests and passions. The key is to select pieces that have a meaningful connection to you without overwhelming the space or causing visual clutter. Keep in mind that attractive decor can also serve as a conversation starter for guests. Step 3: Create a designated area for coats and belongings When inviting guests over, it is essential to provide a designated area where they can comfortably leave their coats and belongings. This could be as simple as a coat rack, a separate closet, or a designated area near the entrance. Providing a designated space helps your guests feel at ease, ensuring they can enjoy the gathering without worrying about their possessions. Step 4: Add tables for food and drinks Finally, including one or more tables dedicated to food and drinks adds a practical yet essential touch to your living space. Having a designated area for snacks and refreshments encourages guests to help themselves and mingle while preventing spills that could damage your belongings or create potential hazards. Consider the size of your space and the number of guests you typically entertain when selecting the right table size and style. Conclusion: By strategically arranging your seating near windows, showcasing personal creative pieces, creating a designated area for coats, and adding tables for food and drinks, you can greatly enhance your living space and create a welcoming atmosphere for both relaxation and entertainment. So don't be afraid to get creative and make adjustments based on your unique tastes and needs – a little effort can go a long way in transforming your living space into a comfortable and inviting sanctuary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Matt and his brother Jesse are twins. They look almost identical.

It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset. - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770. - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about .

They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. - The Mekong giant catfish, \\"Pangasianodon gigas\\" (, ; /\\"try riec\\"/), is a very large, critically endangered species of catfish (order Siluriformes) in the shark catfish family (Pangasiidae), native to the Mekong basin in Southeast Asia and adjacent China. In Thai folklore, this fish is regarded with reverence, and special rituals are followed and offerings are made before fishing it. - The Ictaluridae , sometimes called ictalurids , are a family of catfish native to North America , where they are important food fish and sometimes as a sport fish . It includes about 51 species . They include fish commonly known as bullheads , madtoms , channel catfish , and blue catfish . - Loricariidae is the largest family of catfish (order Siluriformes), with 92 genera and just over 680 species to date, with new species being described each year. Loricariids originate from freshwater habitats of Costa Rica, Panama, and tropical and subtropical South America. These fish are noted for the bony plates covering their bodies and their suckermouths. Several genera are sold as \\"plecos\\", notably the suckermouth catfish, \\"Hypostomus plecostomus\\", and are popular as aquarium fish. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - Ictalurus is a genus of North American freshwater catfishes. It includes the well-known channel catfish (\\"Ictalurus punctatus\\") and blue catfish (\\"Ictalurus furcatus\\"). - Corydoras is a genus of freshwater catfish in the family Callichthyidae and subfamily Corydoradinae. The species usually have more restricted areas of endemism than other callichthyids, but the area of distribution of the entire genus almost equals the area of distribution of the family, except for Panama where \\"Corydoras\\" is not present. \\"Corydoras\\" species are distributed in South America where found east of the Andes to the Atlantic coast, from Trinidad to the Río de la Plata drainage in northern Argentina. Species assigned to \\"Corydoras\\" display a broad diversity of body shapes and coloration. \\"Corydoras\\" are small fish, ranging from in SL. - The wels catfish (or ; \\"Silurus glanis\\"), also called sheatfish, is a large species of catfish native to wide areas of central, southern, and eastern Europe, in the basins of the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas. It has been introduced to Western Europe as a sport fish and is now found from the United Kingdom all the way east to Kazakhstan and China and south to Greece and Turkey. It is a scaleless freshwater fish recognizable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth. Wels catfish can live for at least fifty years and have very good hearing to compensate for their poor sight. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Channel catfish (\\"Ictalurus punctatus\\") is North America's most numerous catfish species. It is the official fish of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Tennessee, and is informally referred to as a \\"channel cat\\". In the United States, they are the most fished catfish species with approximately 8 million anglers targeting them per year. The popularity of channel catfish for food has contributed to the rapid expansion of aquaculture of this species in the United States. - Detritivores, also known as detrivores, detritophages, detritus feeders, or detritus eaters, are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces). There are many kinds of invertebrates, vertebrates and plants that carry out coprophagy. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles. They should be distinguished from other decomposers, such as many species of bacteria, fungi and protists, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead live by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale (saprotrophic nutrition). However, the terms detritivore and decomposer are often used interchangeably. - Candiru (English and Portuguese or \\"candirú\\" in Spanish), \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\", also known as cañero, toothpick fish, or vampire fish, is a species of parasitic freshwater catfish in the family \\"Trichomycteridae\\" native to the Amazon Basin where it is found in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. - Callichthyidae is a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes), called armored catfishes due to the two rows of bony plates (or scutes) running down the length of their bodies. This family contains some of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish, such as the species of \\"Corydoras\\". - The blue catfish (\\"Ictalurus furcatus\\") is the largest species of North American catfish, reaching a length of and a weight of . The average length is about 2546 in (64117 cm). The fish can live to 20 years. The native distribution of blue catfish is primarily in the Mississippi River drainage, including the Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas Rivers, and the Rio Grande, and south along the Gulf Coast to Belize and Guatemala. . These large catfish have also been introduced in a number of reservoirs and rivers, notably the Santee Cooper lakes of Lake Marion and Lake Moultrie in South Carolina, the James River in Virginia, Powerton Lake in Pekin, Illinois, and Springfield Lake in Springfield, Illinois. This fish is also found in some lakes in Florida. The fish is considered an invasive pest in some areas, particularly the Chesapeake Bay. Blue catfish can tolerate brackish water, thus can colonize along inland waterways of coastal regions. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: An EU official said Turkey was not heading in a European direction, as he gave an annual appraisal of its progress towards EU membership. The Turkish president challenged the EU to \\"make your final decision\\". For days there has been a war of words, with Europe accused of failing to take terrorism in Turkey seriously. And a Turkish minister rejected the latest appraisal as \\"not objective\\". The worsening relations have led to fears that an EU-Turkey deal on migrants in March could collapse. Under the March 2016 agreement, migrants arriving in Greece are now sent back to Turkey if they do not apply for asylum or their claim is rejected, but Turkey complains it has not got its end of the bargain. A conditional promise of visa-free travel now seems a long way off. Nonetheless, the Commission statement stopped short of severing talks or imposing sanctions - reflecting the reliance of each side on the other, say commentators. Negotiations on Turkey's accession to the EU began in 2005, and its progress on 72 benchmarks are reported on annually along with other would-be new members. In a tweet sent as the report was launched, EU enlargement commissioner Johannes Hahn said there had been \\"serious backsliding in areas of #RuleofLaw and #fundamentalrights\\". The post-coup crackdown, he said, had \\"affected all spectrums of society\\". The Commission highlighted several issues of concern including: In a statement on Tuesday, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, condemned last Friday's bomb attack in the south-eastern, mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir which followed the HDP detentions and killed 11 people, demanding an end to violence. But she added that actions against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) had to be proportional and respect human rights. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, meanwhile, used blunt words to voice his disdain for Turkish actions. \\"I say this with bitterness, I who am a friend of Turkey, that every day Turkey is moving further away from Europe,\\" he said on Tuesday. \\"We need Turkey... but we cannot compromise on our main principles\\", he said, challenging Turkey to \\"clearly say whether it wants to be a member of the EU or not\\". Earlier this week, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn compared Turkey's purge to methods used by Nazi Germany. The EU's criticisms have been angrily rejected by Turkish leaders. On Tuesday, the Turkish foreign ministry branded the criticisms \\"unacceptable\\", saying European nations \\"insistently refused to understand Turkey's sensitivities concerning terrorism\\" - and for tolerating the PKK despite its EU status as a terrorist organisation. \\"The EU has lost its plausibility and credibility with the Turkish people on the issue of the struggle against terrorism,\\" the statement said. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan gave a frustrated response on Wednesday, telling a business group in Istanbul: \\"They say unabashedly and shamelessly that the EU should review its negotiations with Turkey.\\" \\"You are late, go and review them as soon as you can. But don't just review them - go and make your final decision.\\" He referred explicitly to the migrants packed into Turkish camps under the terms of the March deal, saying: \\"What if the negotiations end and they open the gates, where would we put those three million refugees? \\"That is their worry. That is why they cannot come to the end point.'' Summary:","completion":"Turkey wants to be a part of the European Union (EU), but the EU is worried about some things happening in Turkey.

We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system.

But on this earth, we can be with him as well, by simply praying and engaging in a relationship with him. As we build our faith, we can gain a deeper understanding of Jesus through studying the Bible, attending religious services, and participating in communities of fellow believers. Remember, heaven is not solely a destination, but it is also a connection we can have with Jesus in the present moment, impacting our daily lives and reinforcing our spiritual growth. It is important to recognize that interpretations of heaven and biblical teachings differ among individuals and denominations, but at the core, the belief in heaven ingrained in Christianity is unified by the promise of being with Jesus Christ eternally. This promise brings hope and solace to people who may face difficulties, struggles, and loss in their lives. The presence of Jesus offers a sense of spiritual comfort and guidance, even during the darkest times. Additionally, Matthew 2:7-10 reminds us of the fundamental values of Christianity: love, forgiveness, and seeking justice for the wrongs committed. The Bible encourages us to strive for righteousness in our actions and to treat others with compassion and mercy. In doing so, we are living out the teachings of Jesus and emulating the spirit of heaven here on earth. In conclusion, to know what heaven is like, one must study the Bible, engage in a personal relationship with Jesus, and strive to live according to the teachings of Jesus throughout life. Heaven is not just a far-off destination but can be experienced daily through the loving connection we have with Jesus and our commitment to living in a manner that reflects his love and mercy.

I took to a very private social media account that only those I was closest to could see. I used that account to rant about my problems. It was my coping mechanism and how I kept myself sane. Somehow just typing it out got it off my chest in ways writing in a journal couldn’t (now, I try to use Quora for this purpose instead). One night in early March I went to a performance that my friends were part of. I went alone. While I was there, I got a series of texts regarding my girlfriend. I knew that what those texts said would cause me an immense amount of stress and sleepless nights. I went onto my social media account. I don’t remember exactly what I posted. It wasn’t specific, but rather something along the lines of “I’m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don’t know how I’m going to handle this.” Whatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point. They called an anonymous tip line and reported that they believed I was in danger of killing myself. I got home from the performance at midnight and my dad was in my driveway. I asked him why. He told me he’d been contacted and that someone reported a concern about me. I was admitted to the hospital the next day, and I spent a week an an inpatient psychiatric unit where I received better medication, therapy and coaching on positive coping mechanisms. Whoever called saved me, but in a way I saved my own life that day. What I thought was just another routine post about stress got me the help I so desperately needed. I know without it, I would have ended my own life that day. Funny how that works. Question: After the end of this story, he had probably: Options: A. Continued a bad medication regimen.

An uprising led by the Retail Clan, a powerful conglomerate of merchants and trade corporations, threatens to disrupt the balance of power on the Galactic Capitalist Council. Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi are summoned by the Council to lead a clone army against the Retail Clan forces in a bid to protect the economic stability of the galaxy. As they prepare for battle, Anakin and Obi-Wan discover that the Retail Clan is led by the charismatic and elusive figure, Baron Vendi. They learn that Vendi has devised a dangerous plan to monopolize all resources, goods, and services in the galaxy. The Council fears this would lead to crippling inflation and economic devastation, with billions of lives at stake. Anakin and Obi-Wan, determined to put an end to the Retail Clan threat, embark on a perilous journey through the commerce planets. Along the way, they forge unlikely alliances with small business rebels and independent traders willing to resist the Retail Clan's oppressive monopoly. As the battle intensifies, our heroes infiltrate Retail Clan's headquarters on the planet E-Mart and confront Baron Vendi. However, Vendi reveals a shocking secret - the Retail Clan's rise to power was orchestrated by none other than Darth Sidious. The Sith Lord had been manipulating the Council and key trade routes, hoping to create chaos and instability that would ultimately lead to the collapse of the Republic. Armed with this newfound knowledge and a greater understanding of the internal corruption plaguing the Republic, Anakin and Obi-Wan face a choice: eliminate Baron Vendi and restore temporary order, or expose Darth Sidious, knowing that doing so could unleash the Sith's wrath upon the galaxy.

In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

President Trochu resigned on 25 January and was replaced by Favre, who signed the surrender two days later at Versailles, with the armistice coming into effect at midnight. Several sources claim that in his carriage on the way back to Paris, Favre broke into tears, and collapsed into his daughter's arms as the guns around Paris fell silent at midnight. At Tours, Gambetta received word from Paris on 30 January that the Government had surrendered. Furious, he refused to surrender and launched an immediate attack on German forces at Orleans which, predictably, failed. A delegation of Parisian diplomats arrived in Tours by train on 5 February to negotiate with Gambetta, and the following day Gambetta stepped down and surrendered control of the provincial armies to the Government of National Defence, which promptly ordered a cease-fire across France.\\".

Which person made a fire that burned less bright? Danny went camping and made a fire in the woods. he used large logs he fell a few months back. Bob was camping 300 yards away and he made a fire using small sticks, kindlings and sawdust he had left over. Bob's fire burned fast and bright. Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: resentful toward Jordan B: grateful to Jordan C: angry at Jordan Answer:","completion":"Jan would most likely feel grateful to Jordan. According to the context provided, Jordan found Jan's wallet in the back of the car and returned it to Jan. This act demonstrates honesty, helpfulness, and thoughtfulness on Jordan's part. Losing a wallet can be a stressful situation, as it often contains valuable personal items like cash, credit cards, and identification documents. By returning the wallet, Jordan actively prevented those items from being lost, stolen or misused, and saved Jan from potential worry and the inconvenience of having to replace those items. Given the positive aspects of Jordan's actions, Jan would feel a sense of relief that their wallet has been found and returned to them. Consequently, the most appropriate answer to the question is B: grateful to Jordan. A: resentful toward Jordan - Resentment is an emotion that stems from feelings of unfairness and being hurt or wronged by someone else. In this context, Jordan's actions don't reflect any aspect of causing harm or being unfair to Jan, so there would be no reason for Jan to feel resentful toward Jordan. C: angry at Jordan - Anger is an emotion characterized by antagonism towards someone or something that caused harm or interfered with personal goals or desires. In this context, Jordan's actions have not caused harm and, in fact, were beneficial to Jan.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: A wide variety of commercial cleaning products can help you clean brass. While the specific directions for these products vary with manufacturer, generally you will spray the product on the brass hinge, then wipe it down with a clean cloth. Popular brass cleaning products include Wright’s Premium Brass Cleaning Polish and Brasso Multipurpose Polish. Test the cleaning product on an inconspicuous area of the hinge before applying it to the whole thing. If the cleaning product causes the brass plate to flake off, discontinue use of that product and try another instead. Consult manufacturer directions before using any brass cleaning product. Apply a thin patina of ketchup, marinara sauce, or tomato paste to the brass hinge using a paper towel or hand cloth. Allow the tomato-based product to remain on the brass hinge for about 60 minutes. Dip a clean cloth or sponge in hot, soapy water, then scrub the brass hinge. This technique also works with Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce. Combine equal parts vinegar, salt, and flour. For instance, you might combine two tablespoons of vinegar, two tablespoons of salt, and two tablespoons of flour. Smear this paste across the surface of the brass hinge. Wait for about 60 minutes. Rinse the hinge off with warm water. Wipe it down with a dry cloth until it shines. Cut a lemon in half and remove the seeds from one half. Cover the half of the lemon you removed the seeds from with salt. Rub the face of the lemon (the flat side covered in salt) over the brass hinge. As you rub the hinge, add additional coats of salt to the lemon as it flakes off. Wipe the hinge down with a clean cloth. Combine two tablespoons of cream of tartar and one tablespoon of lemon juice. Rub the paste on the hinge using a clean paper towel or an old toothbrush. Allow the paste to sit for 30 minutes. Then, dip a clean cloth in warm water and wipe the paste away. Mix equal parts white vinegar and baking soda in a bowl with steep sides. For example, you could combine two tablespoons vinegar and two tablespoons baking soda. The ingredients will fizz when combined. Dip a soft-bristled brush or a soft cloth in the mix and wipe down the brass hinge for a minute or two. Wipe the hinge clean with a damp rag, then dry it with a clean dish cloth. Use a spatula to lightly cover the hinge in plain yogurt. Try to stand the hinges on their edges so as to coat the maximum surface area possible with yogurt. Allow the yogurt to dry overnight. Rinse the hinges thoroughly using warm water. Use a toothbrush to get the yogurt out of any recesses where it might have coalesced. Another dairy-based cleaning solution involves combing equal parts water and milk. For instance, you might mix five tablespoons of water and five tablespoons of milk in small pot. Whatever volume of each you choose to combine, ensure it coats the hinges completely. Place the hinges in the pot, bring it to a boil, then turn the heat to its lowest setting. The amount of time it takes to get your brass hinges clean by simmering them in milk depends on the extent of grime and tarnish the hinges have acquired. Use tongs to pull the hinges out every 10 minutes and examine them. If they’re clean, turn the stovetop off and rinse your hinges in water. If the hinges are not clean, drop them back in their milk bath. Place your brass hinges in a crockpot. Cover the hinges with water. Set the crockpot to low and let the hinges “cook” for a few hours. Pull the hinges out using tongs or just conduct a visual inspection to discern whether the paint is coming off. If the paint is coming off, remove it and restore the hinge to its rightful place. If it is not, place it back in the crockpot for another few hours. If, after another dip in the crockpot, the paint is still not coming off or has only partially come off, rub a cloth dampened with mineral spirits over the entire surface of the hinge. This should further loosen the paint. This technique also works for removing lacquer from brass hinges. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses various methods for cleaning brass hinges using both commercial products and homemade solutions. Commercial cleaning products like Wright’s Premium Brass Cleaning Polish and Brasso Multipurpose Polish can be used by following the manufacturer's instructions. Homemade solutions include using tomato-based products like ketchup or marinara sauce, a mixture of equal parts vinegar, salt, and flour, using a lemon with salt, a mix of cream of tartar and lemon juice, a combination of white vinegar and baking soda, plain yogurt, and a solution of equal parts water and milk. Another method involves placing the brass hinges in a crockpot, covering them with water, and setting it to low for a few hours. This technique also works for removing lacquer from brass hinges. To ensure the best results, it is important to test a small, inconspicuous area of the hinge before applying any cleaning product or solution and to consult the manufacturer's directions for use."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I'm going to be a senior next year. Should I take AP bio and AP chem or take ASB and a yearbook? Available choices: *no; *yes;","completion":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. They both touch upon the topic of Advanced Placement (AP) courses, but they are asking about different aspects and situations. The first question is asking about taking AP classes during a gap year while college admissions start before the AP exams. The student is wondering if they can still use their AP scores in admissions decisions or for course credit, even though the exams take place later than the admissions process. The second question is asking about whether a student should take both AP Biology and AP Chemistry during their senior year or take the classes ASB (Associated Student Body) and yearbook instead. This is more about deciding the appropriate course load and the potential trade-offs between the choices. In more detail: 1. The first question relates to the timing of AP exams and college admissions. Since AP exams usually take place in May, and college admissions decisions often occur earlier in the year, students may have doubts about whether they can still use their AP scores in their college applications. The answer depends on the specific college or university policies regarding AP scores, their deadlines, and their flexibility in accepting later scores. Some institutions may allow students to report AP scores they receive after the application deadline, while others may not. Additionally, depending on the AP score situation, students might still be able to use their scores for course placements, credit or advanced standing, but might not impact the admission process itself. 2. The second question is about choosing classes for the senior year of high school. The student is debating between taking two AP science courses (AP Biology and AP Chemistry) or opting for extracurricular activities through the Associated Student Body (ASB) and yearbook classes. The answer depends on multiple factors, such as the student's personal interests, their career goals, the importance of the AP classes for college applications, and the potential workload. The decision also depends on how competitive the student's college applications are and whether they feel taking AP courses will strengthen their academic profile. On the other hand, it is also essential to consider the potential benefits of ASB and yearbook involvement, which could be valuable in building soft skills, leadership qualities, and teamwork abilities."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Jackson) is a twenty-eight-year veteran of the LAPD. A single and widowed father, he is particularly strict with his two children, Marcus (Jaishon Fisher) and Celia (Regine Nehy). As his kids leave for school, the new neighbors begin moving in next door. They are a young interracial couple, Chris and Lisa Mattson (Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington), who are recently married and buying their first home. Chrisâs first exchanges with Abel have somewhat hostile undertones, with Abel making comments about Chrisâ smoking (which Chris hides from Lisa) and listening to hip hop music. The following night, Chris and Lisa have sex in their swimming pool. Unknown to them, Abel's children are watching. Abel arrives home to see this spectacle and is upset, so he repositions the home security floodlights so they shine into Chris and Lisa's window, keeping them awake. When Chris confronts him, Abel claims that the lights are part of his security system to prevent crime and says that it is a complex process to shut down the system and the lights. Abel attends a housewarming party hosted by Chris and Lisa. He is garrulous but has an edge, and criticizes Chris and his friends for their liberal political and social tendencies. He also exposes Chris' smoking to Lisa, as Chris has been discarding his cigarette butts on Abel's lawn. As he leaves, Chris tells Abel that he is starting to take offense to him, but does not plan to move. One evening, they hear noises downstairs, and find the tires of Chris' car slashed. They suspect Abel and call the police. However, because of Abel's status within the LAPD, the arriving officers are unable to do anything.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who is involved in repairing a 400-year-old clock mechanism? from the following article ? Mr. Wilson of the United Nations War Crimes Commission is hunting for Nazi fugitive Franz Kindler, a war criminal who has erased all evidence which might identify him, with no clue left to his identity except \\"a hobby that almost amounts to a mania—clocks.\\" Wilson releases Kindler's former associate Meinike, hoping the man will lead him to Kindler. Wilson follows Meinike to the United States, to the town of Harper, Connecticut, but loses him before he meets with Kindler. Kindler has assumed a new identity and is known locally as \\"Charles Rankin,\\" and has become a prep school teacher. He is about to marry Mary Longstreet, daughter of Supreme Court Justice Adam Longstreet, and is involved in repairing the town's 400-year-old Habrecht-style clock mechanism with religious automata that crowns the belfry of a church in the town square. When Kindler and Meinike do meet, Meinike, who is repentant, begs Kindler to confess his crimes. Instead, Kindler strangles Meinike, who might expose him. Eventually, Wilson deduces that Rankin is Kindler, but not having witnessed the meeting with Meinike, he has no proof. Only Mary knows that Meinike came to meet her husband. To get her to admit this, Wilson must convince her that her husband is a criminal—before Rankin decides to eliminate the threat to him by killing her. Kindler's pose begins to unravel when Red, the family dog, discovers Meinike's body. To further protect his secret, Kindler poisons Red.

Rickey has acted since he was 6, both on and off camera. After school, his grandmother-- a manager and acting coach--helped him develop his skills by doing voice exercises and reading aloud. Voice-over actors do many kinds of acting. They are the voices of cartoon characters on television, in movies and video games, and for communicating toys. In films, they replace the foreign language conversation with English version. They create crowd noises, make commercials, act in radio plays, and record telephone instructions and public announcements. They read books on tape and even record museum tours. Like other actors, voice-over actors need to understand scripts, interpret characters, and breathe correctly. They have to master voice techniques, such as pacing, volume, and range. Sometimes they use their normal voices; other times they change their voices to create different characters or noises. Rickey receives his Danny Phantom scripts only a few days before he tapes each episode . He writes helpful notes on the script to guide himself on speaking his part. Rickey practices, then tapes at the recording studio. He and the other cast members sit in a soundproof booth, acting out their characters as they read their lines into the microphones. \\"The cartoon gets created after we record the words, so we have to imagine everything in our mind,\\" says Rickey.

Philosophy of space and time In 1781, Immanuel Kant published the Critique of Pure Reason, one of the most influential works in the history of the philosophy of space and time. He describes time as an a priori notion that, together with other a priori notions such as space, allows us to comprehend sense experience. Kant denies that either space or time are substance, entities in themselves, or learned by experience; he holds, rather, that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience. Spatial measurements are used to quantify how far apart objects are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between (or duration of) events. Although space and time are held to be transcendentally ideal in this sense, they are also empirically real—that is, not mere illusions. Q: What did Kant say was similar notion to time?","completion":"Immanuel Kant argued that space was a similar notion to time. According to Kant, both space and time are a priori notions, which means they are pre-existing structures within our minds that shape our experiences and understanding of the world. These notions are not derived from experience or external objects; rather, they serve as a necessary framework for organizing and comprehending sensory input. So, both space and time play fundamental roles in structuring and interpreting the phenomena we encounter in our day-to-day lives, making them transcendentally ideal but also empirically real aspects of human experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it is not entirely conclusive, as the premise only provides partial information that supports, but does not confirm, the hypothesis. The premise provides information about the grandiose interior of a space filled with 12th- and 13th-century mosaics that depict the complete cycle of the Old Testament. The mosaics in the nave and apse include a 66-ft high Christ Pantocrator with saints, while those in the aisle depict the miracles of Jesus. From this description, we can deduce that the space underwent significant artistic work and design in the 12th and 13th centuries. The hypothesis claims that the interior was completed in the 13th century. Although the fact that 13th-century mosaics are present in the space gives us reason to believe that the interior might have been completed during this time, it does not provide sufficient evidence. It is possible that other parts of the interior were completed earlier or later than the 13th century. The premise doesn't mention the entire interior but only focuses on the mosaics. In conclusion, although the information provided in the premise partially supports the hypothesis that the interior was completed in the 13th century, it doesn't provide a solid basis for this claim.

The 10 women who made Beyoncé Bessie Smith was the highest paid black entertainer of the Jazz Age, but her New York Times obituary was barely a paragraph long.

Most importantly, Smith made the path for black female singers far easier to tread in her wake. (James Fortune / Rex Features) Peggy Lee, best known for her 1958 hit Fever, was a pioneer of stagecraft. The Grammy-winning country singer didn’t perform gymnastic dance routines, but meticulously choreographed her movements on stage and controlled her lighting and costumes. Lee’s single finger-click in Fever may be subtle, but it was as key to her image as Beyoncé’s Crazy In Love bum-wiggle. (Everett Collection / Rex Features) Before there was Independent Women and Run The World (Girls), there was Respect. Franklin’s 1967 single became a global anthem for the feminist and civil rights movements, helping to break down the gender barriers for future generations of female singers. Furthermore, Beyoncé’s vocals echo Franklin’s gospel-inspired singing, and they were both chosen to sing at President Obama’s inaugurations. Unlike Beyoncé, Franklin, now in her seventies, chose to sing live. (Brian Rasic / Rex Features) Beyoncé played Ross in the musical Dreamgirls, a film about the 1960s girl group The Supremes, which Ross fronted. Their career paths are eerily similar: Ross left the group she fronted as a teen to have an impressive solo career and both separated from the male managers who defined their early success. Beyoncé co-write Listen for Dreamgirls, and the song reflects the steely work ethic behind both divas: “I’m more than what you made of me / I followed the voice you gave to me/But now I’ve gotta find my own.” Beyoncé is worth an estimated 350 million, and she’s not shy about how she made it. But Dolly Parton preceded her in making music into business. Ventures such as her Dollywood theme park, and Dolly Records, have earnt Parton over 500 million and she’s proud of her brand. Both women are also traditionalists and firm supporters of matrimony: Dolly has always maintained both her status as a wife and an independent woman, and so has Beyoncé, naming her latest tour The Mrs Carter Show. Fashion, vocals, stage presence: Beyoncé has been compared to the Tina Turner in many ways, despite the fact the singers have different musical styles. Fans of big hair, big voices and big, flashy stage shows, Turner and Beyoncé proved they were compatible during the 2008 Grammy awards, when, in matching silver outfits, they performed Proud Mary, a song about a woman who shared their strong work ethic. (SIPA PRESS / Rex Features) Beyoncé is rarely found singing perched on a stool - dance is central to her live and video performances. Madonna was a pioneer of eye-catching dance routines - she brought underground New York dance craze Voguing to the masses in 1990 - and her provocative videos were perfect for the new MTV generation. Madonna still, like Beyoncé, uses dance to evoke power and sexuality. Meanwhile, Beyoncé has reinvented the video once again, sparking viral remakes of her routines on YouTube and combining the advert for her fashion line with the release of new song Standing On The Sun. Mary J. Blige has criticised Beyoncé for being “groomed to be a pop artist”, but Beyoncé was growing up while Blige was releasing her own music: an influential bridge between hip-hop and contemporary R’n’B which came out of her Bronx background. Blige has since become a matriarch of hip-hop culture, and allows herself to be glamourous while talking about female sexuality. (Fotex Medien Agentur GMBH/REX FEATURES) Along with Queen Latifa, Salt-n-Pepa were the first women to confront misogyny and sexism in hip-hop in the only way it would understand: by beating the boys with their rhymes. The Brooklyn trio used infectious tracks to discuss issues like gender equality and female sexuality with fierce attitude, inspiring Destiny’s Child less than a decade later. Furthermore, their efforts weren’t limited to the underground: they won a Grammy award in 1995 for None of Your Business, a feminist clarion call against slut-shaming. Beyoncé and Aaliyah were contemporaries in the early noughties R’n’B scene, the latter was even romantically linked with Beyoncé’s husband Jay-Z. However, Aaliyah’s brief career ended after a tragic plane crash in 2001. But as shown in her track Age Ain’t Nothing But A Number - reportedly about her controversial relationship with R Kelly - youth didn’t prevent Aaliyah from being in control of her sexuality without being objectified, something Beyoncé went on to emulate and build into a brand.

Summarize this article: The National Retirement Risk Index (NRRI) measures the percentage of working-age households that are at risk of being unable to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living in retirement. It addresses one of the most compelling challenges facing the nation today: ensuring retirement security for an aging population. Key findings in the NRRI show that: The retirement landscape is shifting dramatically, making the outlook for retiring Baby Boomers and Generation Xers far less sanguine than for current retirees. 50 percent of households are “at risk” of not having enough to maintain their living standards in retirement. Explicitly including health care in the Index further drives up the share of households “at risk.” Saving more and working longer may substantially improve the outlook.

This index takes into account the critical challenge of ensuring retirement security for an aging population in the United States. Recent findings in the NRRI indicate that the retirement landscape has changed considerably, resulting in a less optimistic outlook for Baby Boomers and Generation Xers in comparison to current retirees. Currently, 50 percent of households are considered \\"at risk\\" of not having sufficient funds to maintain their living standards upon retirement. When healthcare costs are explicitly included in the index, the percentage of \\"at-risk\\" households increases even more. To combat these challenges and improve the outlook for future retirees, researchers suggest that saving more money and working longer can help substantially. The NRRI has published numerous research studies on various aspects of retirement security, including how factors such as race, ethnicity, divorce, raising children, housing, inheriting wealth, and student loan debt affect retirement readiness. Overall, the NRRI serves as an important tool for understanding and addressing the challenges facing an increasingly aging population in terms of retirement security. This index helps highlight the need for individuals, policymakers, and the financial industry to take action to improve retirement preparedness for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's solve the equation step by step: We have: 0 = 58*k + 60*k + 7*k - 125 First, let's add all the numbers with 'k' together: (58 + 60 + 7) * k = 125*k So now, our equation looks like this: 0 = 125*k - 125 Next, we want to get 'k' by itself. To do that, we need to add 125 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 125 = 125*k Now, it looks like this: 125 = 125*k Finally, we need to find out what 'k' is. Since 125*k means 125 multiplied by 'k', we should divide 125 by 125 to find 'k': k = 125 / 125 And when we do the division, we find out that: k = 1 So the answer is: k = 1.

Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, William Turner established a herb garden, which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.Elizabeth I gave the chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, creating a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended with the onset of the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailor, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair. The bishop went into retirement and some of the clerics were reduced to performing menial tasks.

I'm a blind teenager girl, but I am ashamed of it if it is known. I refuse to use a white stick and hate asking for help, and I couldn't bear people to look at me and think I am not like them. I must be a terrible danger on the roads. Coming across me wandering through the traffic, motorists probably would have to step rapidly on their brakes. Apart from that, there are all sorts of disasters that used to occur on the way to and from work. One evening, I got off the bus about halfway home where I had to change buses, and as usual I ran into something. \\"I'm awfully sorry,\\" I said and stepped forward only to run into it again. When it happened a third time, I realized I had been apologizing to a lamppost. This was just one of the stupid things that constantly happened to me. So I carried on and found the bus stop, which was a request stop, where the bus wouldn't stop unless passengers wanted to get on or off. No one else was there and I had to try to guess if the bus had arrived. Generally in this situation, because I hated showing I was blind by asking for help, I tried to guess at the sound. Sometimes I would stop a big lorry and stand there feeling stupid as it drew away. In the end, I usually managed to swallow my pride and ask someone at the stop for help. But on this particular evening no one joined me at the stop; it seemed that everyone had suddenly decided not to travel by bus. Of course I heard plenty of buses pass, or I thought I did. But because I had given up stopping them for fear of making a fool of myself, I let them all go by. I stood there alone for half an hour without stopping one. Then I gave up.

During a sixty-year career, he wrote music in several classical genres and styles, from film scores to opera. His best-known works include Façade, the cantata Belshazzar's Feast, the Viola Concerto, the First Symphony, and the British coronation anthems Crown Imperial and Orb and Sceptre. Born in Oldham, Lancashire, the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Façade, which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score. In middle age, Walton left Britain and set up home with his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works. Walton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the 21st century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the work that was criticised as old-fashioned?, what is it ?

The answer is:","completion":"The Blue Picardy Spaniel and Alpine Dachsbracke are both breeds of domestic dogs, which are scientifically classified under the species Canis lupus familiaris. These particular dog breeds belong to different breed groups, originating from separate regions, and have distinct historical backgrounds, physical characteristics, personalities, and roles they were bred for. The Blue Picardy Spaniel, known as \\"Epagneul Bleu de Picardie\\" in its native France, originated in the Picardy region of Northern France in the 19th century. It was developed by crossing the old French spaniels with the now-extinct English (or Gordon) Setter, which led to the emergence of its beautiful bluish-gray coat. This breed is classified under the sporting group and excels as a gundog due to its strong hunting instincts and excellent scent-tracking abilities. These medium-sized dogs are known for their amiable nature, high energy levels, and incredible intelligence, making them ideal for both hunting and as family companions. Initially bred for its hunting skills, the Blue Picardy Spaniel is ideal for various terrains from marshlands and water to thick forests, where it efficiently hunts, flushes, and retrieves different game like pheasants, ducks, and hares. Being highly trainable, it can successfully participate in dog sports like agility, tracking, and obedience competitions. Their gentle and affectionate temperament makes them great with children and other pets, requiring a family that can provide ample physical activity and mental stimulation to keep them happy and avoid destructive behavior. The Alpine Dachsbracke, on the other hand, comes from Austria, where they are known as \\"Alpenländische Dachsbracke.\\" Alpine Dachsbracke was developed in the mid-19th century by crossing the larger Austrian Hound with the Dachshund, aiming to create a breed with the Dachs' size and the Hound's agility. Classified under the scent hound group, the Alpine Dachsbracke was primarily bred for scent-tracking and pursuing wounded game in challenging alpine terrains. Along with its distinctive short legs, the Alpine Dachsbracke possesses a muscular body, waterproof coat, and robust constitution that aids in its efficiency as a hunting dog. Owing to their hunting background, these dogs are known for their fierce loyalty, devotion to their family, and a strong protective instinct. Despite the hunting lineage, the Alpine Dachsbracke also thrives as a family pet, bonding closely with its owners, and enjoying the company of children and other animals. Their unique, low-to-the-ground build and hunting skills make them active participants in various dog sports such as tracking, scent work, and even earth dog trials. In conclusion, the Blue Picardy Spaniel and Alpine Dachsbracke are both breeds of domestic dogs, distinct in their backgrounds, appearances, and skill sets. Their shared quality of being excellent hunters, trainable, loyal, and affectionate makes them not only reliable sporting dogs but also lovable family pets."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Information: - A monastery is a building or complex of buildings comprising the domestic quarters and workplaces of monastics, monks or nuns, whether living in communities or alone (hermits). A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may be a chapel, church or temple, and may also serve as an oratory. - Prior, derived from the Latin for \\"earlier, first\\", (or prioress for nuns) is an ecclesiastical title for a superior, usually lower in rank than an abbot or abbess. Its earlier generic usage referred to any monastic superior. - Lanfranc ( Latin : Lanfrancus ; 1005 x 1010 at Pavia -- 24 May 1089 at Canterbury ) was a celebrated Italian jurist who renounced his career to become a Benedictine monk at Bec in Normandy . He served successively as prior of Bec Abbey and abbot of St Stephen in Normandy and then as archbishop of Canterbury in England , following its Conquest by William the Bastard . He is also variously known as Lanfranc of Pavia ( Italian : Lanfranco di Pavia ) , Lanfranc of Bec ( French : Lanfranc du Bec ) , and Lanfranc of Canterbury ( Latin : Lanfrancus Cantuariensis ) . - A title is a prefix or suffix added to someone's name in certain contexts. It may signify either veneration, an official position or a professional or academic qualification. In some languages, titles may be inserted before a last name (for example, \\"Graf\\" in German, Cardinal in Catholic usage or clerical titles such as Archbishop). Some titles are hereditary. - Abbot, meaning father, is an ecclesiastical title given to the male head of a monastery in various traditions, including Christianity. The office may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not actually the head of a monastery. The female equivalent is abbess. - In Christianity, an abbess (Latin \\"abbatissa\\", feminine form of \\"abbas,\\" abbot) is the female superior of a community of nuns, which is often an abbey. - Pavia (Lombard: \\"Pavia\\" Medieval Latin: \\"Papia\\") is a town and \\"comune\\" of south-western Lombardy, northern Italy, south of Milan on the lower Ticino river near its confluence with the Po. It has a population of c. 68,000. The city was the capital of the Kingdom of the Lombards from 572 to 774. - Medieval Latin was the form of Latin used in the Middle Ages, primarily: as a medium of scholarly exchange; as the liturgical language of Chalcedonian Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church; and as a language of science, literature, law, and administration. Despite the clerical origin of many of its authors, medieval Latin should not be confused with Ecclesiastical Latin. There is no real consensus on the exact boundary where Late Latin ends and medieval Latin begins. Some scholarly surveys begin with the rise of early Ecclesiastical Latin in the middle of the 4th century, others around 500, and still others with the replacement of written Late Latin by written Romance languages starting around the year 900. - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. What is the relationship between 'lanfranc' and 'catholic church'? Answer:","completion":"Lanfranc was a prominent figure in the Catholic Church during the 11th century, and his relationship with the Church was multifaceted. As a Benedictine monk, a prior, an abbot, and later an Archbishop, his ecclesiastical positions allowed him to contribute significantly to the Church's development and reforms during this period. Born in Pavia, Italy, Lanfranc renounced his successful career as a jurist to become a Benedictine monk at Bec Abbey in Normandy, France. As a monk, he devoted his life to prayer, study, and service within the monastic community, exemplifying the principles and values of the Catholic Church. Lanfranc's intellectual abilities led to his appointment as the prior of Bec Abbey. In this role, he was responsible for the monastery's day-to-day administration and spiritual well-being of the monks under his care. As a prior, he also collaborated closely with the abbot, thus participating in the broader affairs of the Church. His effective leadership as a prior led to his appointment as the abbot of St Stephen in Caen, Normandy. Here, Lanfranc continued to be an influential figure within the Catholic Church, responsible for overseeing the spiritual and administrative matters of the Abbey. He implemented several reforms in the monastic community, emphasizing discipline and spiritual rigor that eventually helped in shaping Church practices over the years. Lanfranc's reputation as a wise and capable ecclesiastical leader reached England, where William the Conqueror appointed him the Archbishop of Canterbury after the Norman Conquest. In this role, Lanfranc held the highest ecclesiastical position in England, making him a key figure in the Catholic Church and a direct representative of the Pope. He enacted numerous reforms within the English Church, in both administrative and spiritual matters, aligning it more closely with the Roman Catholic practices and traditions. As archbishop, Lanfranc also participated in several Church councils and synods, both in England and the broader European context, addressing various aspects of ecclesiastical governance and doctrine. He contributed significantly to the Church's intellectual life by engaging in theological debates, notably in defense of the doctrine of transubstantiation in the Eucharist against Berengar of Tours' teachings. In summary, the relationship between Lanfranc and the Catholic Church was one of devotion, service, and leadership across a range of ecclesiastical roles - from a Benedictine monk to the Archbishop of Canterbury. His intellectual, administrative, and spiritual contributions had a profound and lasting impact on the Church's development and practices during the 11th century and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These computers connected well.","completion":"The word \\"connect\\" is used in both sentences, but it is employed in slightly different ways in each of them. Let's analyze the usage of \\"connect\\" in both contexts to understand these differences. 1. In the first sentence, \\"Operator, could you connect me to the Raffles in Singapore?\\", the word \\"connect\\" is used as a verb in the context of establishing a communication link, in this case, a phone call. Here, the speaker is asking the operator to establish a connection between their phone line and the phone line of the Raffles in Singapore. Essentially, it is about creating a direct or indirect link between two parties so that they can communicate with each other. 2. In the second sentence, \\"These computers connected well.\\", the word \\"connect\\" is also used as a verb and signifies that two or more computers were linked together successfully, presumably in a network or through other methods of computer communication. This might imply that the computers are sharing data, applications, or resources, and they can efficiently communicate or interact with one another. In conclusion, while the overall meaning of the word \\"connect\\" remains constant - that is, to establish a link or a communicative channel between two or more entities - the specific context differs in these two sentences. The first instance is about building a communication line for a phone call between two parties, while the second one refers to the successful linking of computers, likely in a network or similar platform, enabling data and resource sharing.

Summarize this article: As the Miami Heat faced off against the San Antonio Spurs in Game 5 of the NBA finals Sunday night, a curious TV ad aired near the end of the second quarter featuring rap star Jay-Z in a studio, riffing with a cast of characters including producer Rick Rubin and artist Pharrell Williams. At one point, a member of the posse is shown taking notes on a tablet device. More than two minutes into the three-minute video, Samsung Electronics Co.’s tagline flashes across the screen: “The Next Big Thing.” ||||| Never forget: Watch the throne. Because while Kanye has been eating up the headlines with Yeezus and the new baby girl, Jay-Z has quietly been getting ready to drop his twelfth studio album. It's coming July 4, which is already a totally Jay-Z-is-America-is-the-new-Jay-Gatsby thing to do, but it'll also be called Magna Carta Holy Grail. Let that sink in for a moment, ponder if it's more grandiose than Yeezus as a title, and then, if you will, recall how Vulture totally said this summer will belong to Hova. The video announcing the record shows Rick Rubin, Pharrell, Timbaland, and Swizz Beatz in the studio. Jay narrates about writing new rules and implementing lush sounds and live instrumentation. Immediate questions begging to be asked: Did anyone guess Jay-Z would follow Kanye's industry-bucking route, skipping hype and singles and just sneaking up with an album? (And is Beyoncé going to do the same thing? Where is her record?) Is \\"go Picasso\\" gonna be the new \\"go H.A.M.\\"? Is this the most well-lit studio of all time? Did Kanye contribute any tracks? If so: Was he too busy to have as big a part of this album as he did The Blueprint 3? Did you know that one came out in 2009, making this the longest spell without a Jay-Z solo album ever, surpassing his non-retirement by a year? Lastly and maybe most importantly for some: Do you own a Samsung Galaxy? 'Cause if you do, you may be one of 1 million people to get the album for free with an app. (Stay tuned for the requisite discussion of albums as branded experiences/phone apps.) ||||| Jay-Z shared some big news tonight during Game 5 of the NBA Finals: He's got a new album coming out in less than a month.

Let's denote the first word by X and the second word by Y. An 'IsA' relation holds when 'X is a kind of Y'. An 'Antonym' relation holds when 'X can be used as the opposite of Y'. A 'Synonym' relation applies when 'X can be used in place of Y, without changing the meaning'. A 'PartOf' relation holds when 'X is a part of Y'. A 'MemberOf' relation holds when 'X is a member of Y'. A 'MadeOf' relation holds when 'X is made of Y'. An 'Entailment' relation holds when 'If X is true, then Y is true as well'.

Entails: Studying generally involves reading, but reading doesn't necessarily involve studying. However, if you are studying a subject, it is highly likely that you read something related to it. So, the Entails relation holds to some extent. 2. HasProperty: The words do not describe a property or characteristic of each other. 3. Synonym: Although \\"study\\" and \\"read\\" can be related in certain contexts, they are not synonyms that can be used interchangeably without changing the meaning. 4. Antonym: They are not opposites. 5. HasA: Neither word contains or has the other. 6. MemberOf: Neither word is a member of the other. 7. PartOf: Neither word is a part of the other. 8. MadeOf: Neither word is made of the other. 9. IsA: Neither word is a kind of the other.

Oakland is a diverse city with various neighborhoods, each having its unique qualities, strengths, and challenges. East Oakland itself is quite diverse, with some areas experiencing more crime and poverty than others. While Elmhurst is a residential neighborhood, and the Eastmont Town Center is a key commercial area within it, there are other neighborhoods in East Oakland, each with their own character, resources, and challenges.

On Sunday, Sheen seemed to resurrect some of that bad blood by tweeting: “D Richards is a heretic washed up piglet Shame pile.” “Happy Father’s Day!!!” he added.

But it's hardly the first time Oliver or Kate have spoken out about their biological father. The siblings have both gone on record to say that they consider their mother Goldie Hawn's longtime partner Kurt Russell to be their real father. \\"[Bill Hudson] doesn't know me from a hole in the wall. But I don't care. I have a dad [Russell]. The bottom line is, you call your kids on their f--king birthday. I'm glad I had a dad who was there on my birthday,\\" Kate told Vanity Fair back in 2000. Meanwhile, Bill Hudson had his say when he released his tell-all book, 2 Versions: The Other Side of Fame and Family in 2011, in which he also said some unkind things about his children. \\"I love Kate, but ... She has done stuff which is just awful. She is a spoiled brat in my eyes and at the end of the day, she should meet her little sister. I should meet my grandchild and she should help her grandmother,\\" he wrote. Meanwhile this Father's Day, the actress made no mention of her biological father, she only celebrated Russell with a sweet photo on Instagram that she captioned, \\"Pa, just simply.....

Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: \\"RS\\"), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO. The capital and largest city is Ljubljana. - The Garigliano is a river in central Italy . It forms at the confluence of the rivers Gari ( also known as the Rapido ) and Liri . Garigliano is actually a deformation of \`\` Gari - Lirano '' ( which in Italian means something like \`\` Gari from the Liri '' ) . In ancient times the whole course of the Liri and Gagliano was known as the Liris . For the most part of its 40 km ( 25 mi ) length , the Garigliano River marks the border between the Italian regions of Lazio and Campania . In medieval times , the river ( then known as the Verde ) marked the southern border of the Papal States . - A boot is a type of footwear and a specific type of shoe. Most boots mainly cover the foot and the ankle, while some also cover some part of the lower calf. Some boots extend up the leg, sometimes as far as the knee or even the hip. Most boots have a heel that is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the sole, even if the two are made of one piece. Traditionally made of leather or rubber, modern boots are made from a variety of materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality protecting the foot and leg from water, extreme cold, mud or hazards (e.g., work boots may protect wearers from chemicals or use a steel toe) or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction requirements (e.g., hiking) and for reasons of style and fashion. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - The Liri (Latin Liris or Lyris, previously, Clanis; Greek: ) is one of the principal rivers of central Italy, flowing into the Tyrrhenian Sea a little below Minturno under the name Garigliano. - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile. - San Marino, officially the Republic of San Marino, also known as the Most Serene Republic of San Marino, is an enclaved microstate surrounded by Italy, situated on the Italian Peninsula on the northeastern side of the Apennine Mountains.

The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water. - The Tyrrhenian Sea (, , , ) is part of the Mediterranean Sea off the western coast of Italy. It is named for the Tyrrhenian people, identified since the 6th century BCE with the Etruscans of Italy. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\".

He spent his early adult years in Virginia Beach as a police officer. He plays the organ at church, has unenthusiastic sex with his wife, Debbie, and spends his off-hours searching for his biological mother, who had placed him for adoption as a child. Steven locates his biological mother, but she rejects him. He then quits the police force and moves to Texas and works for Sysco, the family business. After a car crash on the way to a homosexual tryst, Steven leaves his family and life behind, though he keeps in touch with his wife and young daughter, and explores the world as his true self â a gay man. He moves to Miami, where he finds a boyfriend, Jimmy, and they adopt a luxurious lifestyle. To keep themselves in the style to which they have become accustomed, Steven becomes a con man. Steven is pursued by the police, and, after jumping off a parking garage, is sent to prison, where he falls in love with inmate Phillip Morris. Steven cannot bear to be separated from Phillip. After being released, he helps get Phillip freed from prison by posing as a lawyer, then attains wealth by fraudulently acquiring a position as Chief Financial Officer of a large medical management company called USAMM. Steven eventually is caught embezzling. While in the police car he reminisces about Jimmy in Florida dying of AIDS. He asks the police for Phillips insulin and injects himself. He goes back to prison, Phillip is also sent to prison as an accomplice and angrily tells Steven he never wants to see him again.

Please answer a question about the following article about Alaska: Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area. Linguistic and DNA studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge.[citation needed] The Tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon. Also in Southeast were the Haida, now well known for their unique arts. The Tsimshian people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887, when President Grover Cleveland, and later the U.S. Congress, granted them permission to settle on Annette Island and found the town of Metlakatla. All three of these peoples, as well as other indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s, resulting in high fatalities and social disruption.

Problem:Napoleon is in exile on St. Helena after the battle of Waterloo, and his followers smuggle a look-alike to the island, and smuggle Napoleon to a ship headed back to Europe. The plan is for the imposter to masquerade as Napoleon until the Emperor has time to reach Paris, and then for the imposter to declare his role as imposter, so that the real Napoleon can announce his return to Paris. The people of France will then flock to their leader and rise in glory under Napoleon once again.The trouble is, the imposter quickly warms to the role, privileges, and fine life of an exiled Emperor. He refuses to reveal his true identity, and when one of Napoleon's generals in exile with him tries to turn the imposter in, the imposter has the general sent away, as having lost his mind in the isolation of St. Helena. Meanwhile, the real Napoleon can't just stand in the square in Paris and announce his return, because the people all believe he is on St. Helena. Almost none of the citizenry has ever seen Napoleon up close, and in any case he's older and seedier looking now. In fact, we learn that whole groups of inhabitants of the Paris insane asylum walk around in Napoleon costumes, claiming to be the emperor!So the real Napoleon is stuck.

We can subtract 16 from both sides: 2 - 16 = 14*d - 16 + 16 Simplify the left side: -14 = 14*d Step 3: Now we need to isolate d.

Article: Teenagers who drink alcohol are at higher risk of becoming victims of violence, a Cardiff University study has found. A team from the School of Dentistry's Violence Research Group studied drinking habits in children aged 11 - 16 in England. They found not only a link between drink and violence but also that children who drank were more likely to be hit, even if they weren't violent themselves. The researchers are now calling for measures to prevent alcohol misuse to reduce injury risk. Current policy focuses on reducing aggression but this research shows that there should be equal effort to reduce victimization. More than 4,000 children were surveyed at 13 schools at four local authorities in the North, the Midlands, London, and the South. The study found that 25% of 11-year-olds were drinking monthly and 3.6% daily, with 12.8% admitting to getting drunk 3 to 5 times a year. By the age of 16, 40% were drinking weekly and 6.2% were drinking every day. The research also showed 22.6% of 16-year-olds were getting drunk more than 21 times a year. The study, which has just been published in the Journal of Adolescence, found a strong link between frequency of drinking and frequency of hitting other people. However, children who reported drinking monthly were also three times more likely to be hit. Adolescents who drank but didn't get into fights were more likely to be hit than those who did fight. Professor Jonathan Shepherd, who led the research, said a lot of previous alcohol-related violence work had focused on the offenders rather than the victims. His team is calling for more prevention work from parents and teachers in the first two years of secondary school by taking advantage of the \\"teachable moment\\", that is, immediately after a student has missed school because of drunkenness. Previous work by Professor Jonathan Shepherd has shown drinkers may be more at risk of violence because of reduced physical co-ordination, poor decision-making in threatening situations and isolation while out late at night.

Upon meeting his brother, Kenneth explains that he wants Leland to take control of Zevo Toys once he dies. This strikes Leland as a very strange request, since he is not at all like his brother, and is more concerned with the 'rank and file' of his former glory days.Eventually, Kenneth dies, and Leland is still not sure what to do. He goes to consult with their father, a bed-ridden, retired 4-star general. But even this doesn't lead to any answers. Leland finally decides to fulfill his brother's request, but even with Leslie and Alsatia welcoming him to the factory and trying to get him acclimated, Leland seems largely like a 'fish out of water,' not seeing the humor or fun in the factory's workings.During a board meeting, word of industrial espionage rouses his attention. Consulting with Kenneth's former advisor, Owen Owens, Leland decides to implement some changes.At a formal dinner at Leslie and Alsatia's home, they are introduced to Leland's son, Patrick, a master of camouflage. Leland takes the opportunity to explain to everyone about his upcoming plans. Patrick is being implemented to step-up security measures to prevent future information leaks, and Leland also plans to start a new line of 'war toys,' a concept that has never been introduced in the factory.Some months pass, and a major security detail is now in place, with the once happy workers now rather dour. Leland has grown upset that the design teams are not fulfilling his vision for a war toys line, and berates them, much to Leslie's displeasure.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The opera begins without any prelude; the opening chords of the Scarpia motif lead immediately to the agitated appearance of Angelotti and the enunciation of the \\"fugitive\\" motif. The sacristan's entry, accompanied by his sprightly buffo theme, lifts the mood, as does the generally light-hearted colloquy with Cavaradossi which follows after the latter's entrance.

The domination, in that aria, of themes which will be repeated in the love duet make it clear that though the painting may incorporate the Marchesa's features, Tosca is the ultimate inspiration of his work. Cavaradossi's dialogue with Angelotti is interrupted by Tosca's arrival, signalled by her motif which incorporates, in Newman's words, \\"the feline, caressing cadence so characteristic of her.\\" Though Tosca enters violently and suspiciously, the music paints her devotion and serenity. According to Budden, there is no contradiction: Tosca's jealousy is largely a matter of habit, which her lover does not take too seriously.After Tosca's \\"Non la sospiri\\" and the subsequent argument inspired by her jealousy, the sensuous character of the love duet \\"Qual'occhio\\" provides what opera writer Burton Fisher describes as \\"an almost erotic lyricism that has been called pornophony\\".

Jack refers her to Tess for an audition, in which Ali is rejected instantly and ushered out by Sean (Stanley Tucci) the costumer for the dancers. Instead of leaving, Ali begins serving customers at the club as a waitress, while Tess and Sean observe with Jack asking Tess to give Ali a chance. Tess reluctantly hires Ali to work as a waitress.After returning to her apartment after work a few days later, Ali finds it in disarray having been broken into and that her money and all her belongings have been stolen. She shows up at Jack's apartment in the pouring rain and he agrees to let her stay with him for a few nights.One night at the club, Ali, attempts to talk to Tess and tell her she finds lip-synching limiting, but Ali is told that the customers prefer it that way. When one of the dancers, Georgia (Julianne Hough) becomes pregnant, auditions are held to replace her. Ali begins her audition when everyone leaves, and after performing to \\"Wagon Wheel Watusi\\", persuades Tess to allow her to become one of the club's dancers, much to the lead dancer Nikki's (Kristen Bell) annoyance. When Nikki appears drunk, Tess orders Ali to take her place. Behind the scenes, Tess... My question: Who hired Ali? Answer:","completion":"In the movie plot provided, Tess, who is played by Cher, is the one who hired Ali. Initially, Tess refuses to give Ali an on-stage job after her audition, but she eventually hires Ali as a waitress for the Burlesque club. Later in the plot, when one of the club's dancers becomes pregnant, Ali auditions again and persuades Tess to hire her as a dancer instead. This implies that Tess is in a position to hire and fire staff at the club, making her likely the manager or owner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q: How was the case of two bills mistakenly assented corrected both in 1796 and 2001? A: In 1976, a bill originating in the House of Representatives was mistakenly submitted to the Governor-General and assented to. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"To provide a more accurate and complete answer: The case of two bills being mistakenly assented was corrected in different ways in 1796 and 2001. 1796: In the United States, President George Washington mistakenly signed two copies of the same bill in 1796. The error was discovered, and the duplicate bill was returned to Congress, where it was canceled and removed from the official records. 2001: In Australia, in 2001, a similar situation occurred when two bills were mistakenly submitted to the Governor-General and assented to. The solution involved passing a bill called the Acts Interpretation (Substituted Acts – Section 58A) Act 2001, which deemed one of the assented bills to be the correct one while voiding the other. In summary, both instances of mistakenly assented bills were resolved by identifying the errors and taking corrective measures - either by returning the duplicated bill to Congress and removing it from records (in the 1796 case) or passing a specific act to void the mistaken bill and validate the correct one (in the 2001 case)."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Use a pencil and sketch your lines in lightly so you’re able to erase them easily. Make the circle in the center of the page, leaving room on each side of it so you have space to add more features. The circle doesn’t need to be perfectly round, but you may use a compass to help you draw your lines if you want. The drawing of the dragon head will be in profile view when you’re finished. If you plan on adding the rest of the dragon’s body to your drawing, then make sure the circle is small enough so you can fit the body on your sheet of paper. If you want your dragon to have a longer face, then make a horizontal oval instead of a circle. Choose either the left or right side of the circle depending on which way you want the dragon head to face. Draw the top horizontal line of the snout coming from the top of the circle so it’s the same length as the circle’s diameter. Make another horizontal line coming from the bottom of the circle to make the bottom of the snout. Connect the 2 lines so the corners are rounded. You can make the snout longer or shorter depending on how you want the dragon to look. Don’t leave sharp corners on the end of the snout or else your dragon won’t look natural. Start one of the lines where the bottom of the snout connects to the head. Make a curved line coming down from the head as long as you want it. Then draw another curved line that’s parallel to the first one on the opposite side of the head. The dragon’s neck usually gets wider closer to its body, so you can make the lines get further apart near the bottom if you want to. Start drawing the mouth in the middle of the trapezoid’s narrow end. Extend the line horizontally so it ends near the middle of the dragon’s head. Curve the end of the mouth up if you want your dragon to look like it’s smiling, or angle it down if you want it to frown. Put a parallel line underneath the mouth if you want it to look like your dragon has a bottom lip. You can either add teeth that point up or down along your dragon’s mouth. Choose anywhere along the mouth and draw a triangle that points up or down starting from the mouth line. Add 5-6 separate teeth in your dragon’s mouth so it looks more fearsome. Don’t line the entire mouth with teeth or else your drawing may start to look messy. You can have teeth pointing both up and down. Place the eye next to where the top of the snout connects to the side of the circle. If you want your dragon to look more realistic, draw a small circle for the eye so there’s a small gap between it and the top of the snout. For a dragon that looks angrier, add a horizontal triangle so the point faces the snout. Don’t make the eye too large or else you won’t have room to add other features. Search for pictures of other reptiles to see what their eyes look like so you can use them as a reference. Dragons don’t have smooth skin, so their heads will look bumpy and knobby from their scales. Use the outlines you currently have as guides and go over them to add curves to the snout. Use wavy or zig-zag lines going from the end of the snout toward the back of its head. For example, you may add a large bump above the dragon’s eye if you want to give it a prominent brow. You can add as many or as few bumps and ridges to the dragon depending on how you want it to look. If you want to add horns to your dragon, make a vertical line extending out from the top of the dragon’s head. Extend the line out so it’s about the same length as the snout. Add another line that starts on the back side of the dragon’s head and connects to the end of the first line to complete the horn. Make the horn shorter if you want to make it seem like your dragon is younger. You can make the horns any shape you want. Look up horns on real animals to get influences for what you can include on your dragon. You may also choose to add horns or spikes running down the back of the dragon’s neck if you want to. Go over your drawing with an eraser and get rid of any lines that aren’t still a part of your dragon. For example, you may erase the circle or the original outline of the snout if you added more bumps to it. Continue erasing any guides or mistakes you made, and blow off the shavings when you’re finished. Darker lines will be harder to erase than lightly sketched lines. Get a clickable detail eraser if you need to erase lines in small areas. You can get special erasers from an art store or online. Once you erase the guide lines, start adding the final details into your drawing. Start with small ovals or circles for the nostrils at the end of the snout. Once you add the nostrils, draw in U-shaped lines on the sides of the dragon’s head and down its neck give the illusion of scales. You don’t need to draw every scale on the dragon’s face since it could make your drawing look messy or unclear. Shade your drawing with a pencil or colored pencil if you want to add more perspective or color. Summary:","completion":"To draw a dragon head, sketch a circle lightly in pencil for the base. If desired, make it a horizontal oval for a longer face. Draw horizontal lines from the circle's edges to form the snout, and curve the corners. Add a curved line for the neck, extending from the bottom of the snout. Draw the dragon's mouth in the middle of the snout's narrow end, with optional teeth. Add a small circular eye near the top of the snout. Create texture with wavy lines and scales on the dragon's head. Add horns or spikes if desired and use references from real animals for inspiration. Erase unnecessary lines and add final details such as nostrils and scale-like lines.

In this view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features. These features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle. The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form). An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments. Furthermore, the generativists folded morphophonology into phonology, which both solved and created problems.

The individual's injuries stemmed from the ongoing unrest between protesters and law enforcement in the region. Upon sustaining injuries during the protest, the individual was rushed to the hospital where medical professionals promptly provided aid. The swift and efficient treatment allowed for the protester's recovery and subsequent return to their home. While in the hospital, the protester received support and encouragement from fellow demonstrators and well-wishers. Over time, their condition improved significantly, and doctors eventually deemed that they were fit to be discharged. Upon being cleared by medical professionals, the protester expressed their gratitude to the healthcare team and those who supported them during their recovery period. As the pro-democracy demonstrations continue in the Hong Kong Islands, the situation remains tense between authorities and citizens advocating for their rights. Despite the ongoing conflict, moments of hope and unity like this serve as a reminder of the powerful resilience displayed by protesters and their supporters. The return of the injured protester to their home marks an end to their personal struggle, but also highlights the ongoing battles faced by others who remain caught in the midst of the unrest. Situations like these continue to draw attention to the conflict and the need for a peaceful resolution on the Hong Kong Islands. In summary, the Hong Kong Islands protester's recovery and subsequent return home signifies both personal victory and a broader call for unity, support, and the promotion of social justice.

Gifts should show that you care and that you specifically care for her. You don't want to give a gift that could be just as nice for your ex-girlfriend or your sister. Give a gift that is significant to her. Try giving her something in her favorite color, something she said she wanted or needed, or (best of all) something that reminds you of significant moments that you've had together or inside jokes that you share. If she calls or texts you and mentions that her day is not going very well, bring her some flowers on your lunch break or when you get home. If she tells you at the end of the day, have the flowers sent to her first thing in the morning with a note like \\"I hope these help today go better than yesterday.\\" Bonus points if the flowers are unique, such as giving her a tiny Christmas tree during a tough holiday season or a \\"bouquet\\" of stuffed kittens. Leave her a series of notes, each one telling her something you love about her and a clue to the next location. End the scavenger hunt with dinner and a gift. Use your creative skills to make something for her. It doesn't have to be fancy or perfect. It just has to show that you think she's worth the time and effort. You can make her a card on nice paper, make her a necklace pendant, or make hr a sculpture for her desk (check your local art store for polymer clay). When you've had a hard day, the last thing you want to do is add insult to injury by having to slave over the stove for half an hour, right? When you know she's stressed (or even when she isn't), help her out by cooking her a nice dinner. Write her letters as often as you can manage. You don't even have to talk about anything interesting, but it is a very useful time to talk about your feelings. This vintage touch will show her just how much you care, and charm your way into her heart. Make a cd/tape/USB stick with songs that are significant to your relationship or remind you of her. Try to tell the story of your love (how you felt before you had her in your life, how you met her, what you first thought, etc) through the songs that you choose. Women, like anyone, want to feel useful. They want to feel like they serve a purpose, especially to people that they care about. Let her be and feel useful by asking her for advice about problems that you have in your life. Importantly, you should take her advice and let her see that you've taken her advice. Know her for who she really is, not just who you want her to be or the face that she puts on for everyday life. Talk to her about things that matter and find ways to show her that you get her.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. After seeing this film months ago, it keeps jumping back into my consciousness and I feel I must buy it or at least see it again, even though I watched it at least 3 times when I rented it at that point. I fell in love with Hal Hartley's directing many years ago - I found that these films could make me laugh in an place that is rarely entertained. It is a strange feeling, granted, and I assume most people out there really just don't get it, or it makes them feel confused and somewhat uncomfortable - I guess I just really get it - its as if these films were made for me. Although I don't remember if I actually laughed out loud during this film, it remains one of the funniest films I've seen in many years. If you don't see the humor of the grocery bag Fay carries from the street to a church, to her brother's publisher's office, to her son's principal's office you may lack the intelligence to be highly impressed by this film. The bag is a silent character in itself, being dragged around as an icon of motherhood the usually brash, bitchy Parker Posey must carry before the international intrigue of the remainder of the film besets her. I consider \\"Henry Fool\\" my least favorite of Hartley's films. I honestly don't remember it very well - I think the character himself was so despicable I found it tedious. Hartley's forte seems to be feminine character development. Aside from Posey's brilliance, it was wonderful to see Elina Lowensohn, one of my favorite actresses, again. Her extravagant naiveté is perfect for Hartley's direction. His ability to make the outrageous seem banal helps define his style as a delicious chronic irony throughout. This film erupts into a highly relevant international intrigue story, explaining political situations in Afganistan. This is never suspected at the beginning. The complexity of this film's development is unparalleled. This is the epitome of a \\"stand alone\\" sequel. The less you know about Henry Fool the more mystery is spun around him, the less you expect his appearance toward the end of the film - as an alcoholic chain-smoking complaint machine, hurling insults at his Islamic terrorist caretaker who somehow seems to respect him. Its like finding out Santa Claus is actually a 12-year-old schoolyard bully. Although I was impressed and satisfied with Hartley's other recent films \\"the Girl from Monday\\" and \\"No Such Thing\\", \\"Fay Grim\\" goes far beyond what I expected, with a sense of humor and originality no Oscar winner would ever dare.

Article: Hello, I'm Severn Suzuki speaking for E.C.O.--The Environmental Children's Organization. We are a group of twelve and thirteen-year-olds from Canada trying to make a difference. Vanessa Suttie, Morgan Geisler, Michelle Quigg and me. We raised all the money ourselves to come six thousand miles to tell you adults you must change your ways. Coming here today, I have no hidden agenda. I am fighting for my future. I am here to speak on behalf of the starving children around the world whose cries go unheard. I am here to speak for the countless animals dying across this planet because they have nowhere left to go. I am afraid to go out in the sun now because of the holes in the ozone . I am afraid to breathe the air because I don't know what chemicals are in it. I used to go fishing in Vancouver with my dad until just a few years ago we found the fish full of cancers. And now we hear about animals and plants going _ every day. In my life, I have dreamt of seeing the great herds of wild animals, jungles and rainforests full of birds and butterflies, but now I wonder if they will even exist for my children to see. Did you have to worry about these little things when you were my age? All this is happening before our eyes and yet we act as if we have all the time we want and all the solutions . I'm only a child and I don't have all the solutions, but I want you to realize, neither do you! Question: When giving this speech, Severn Suzuki probably felt _ . Options: A: bored B: sleepy C: impatient D: worried Answer:","completion":"When giving this speech, Severn Suzuki probably felt D: worried. The content and tone of Severn Suzuki's speech indicate a sense of concern and urgency. As a representative of the Environmental Children's Organization, she is addressing serious global issues that affect not only her generation but future generations as well. Suzuki discusses various environmental problems, such as the holes in the ozone layer, air pollution, and the extinction of animals and plants. She emphasizes the need for immediate action and change, stating that she is \\"fighting for her future.\\" Throughout the speech, Suzuki highlights the potential consequences of inaction, such as the loss of wild animals, jungles, and rainforests. She questions whether these natural wonders will even exist for her children to see, expressing a deep concern for the disappearing biodiversity of our planet. Moreover, Suzuki emphasizes her own fear when she mentions being afraid to go out in the sun and breathe the air, both due to environmental hazards. She also touches upon the fact that she is a child, and though she may not have all the solutions, she wants adults to acknowledge that they don't either. This statement implies that there is a need for people to come together, irrespective of age, and work towards finding solutions to environmental issues. Given the content, context, and tone of her speech, it is evident that Severn Suzuki most likely felt worried when delivering it. She expressed her fear and concerns for the future of our planet and urged adults to recognize the urgency of the situation and to take appropriate action to protect the environment for current and future generations."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What did Demetrius do after negotiating with Ptolemy and Athens?\\" Context: \\"After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"After negotiating with Ptolemy and Athens, Demetrius crossed over to Asia Minor and waged war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, while leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Problem: Solve -88*v - 833*v = -22104 for v. And the answer is...","completion":"Okay little buddy, let's solve this problem together, step by step! We have the equation: -88*v - 833*v = -22104 First, we need to simplify the left side of the equation, which has '-88*v' and '-833*v'. When we combine these two parts, we are actually adding the numbers -88 and -833 but keeping the 'v' part the same. So, -88 - 833 = -921 and the left side becomes, -921*v. Now, our equation looks like this: -921*v = -22104 To find the value of 'v', we need to 'untangle' it from the -921. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -921. So, the equation becomes: v = -22104 / -921 When we divide -22104 by -921, we get the answer: 24 So the answer is, v = 24! Great job, little buddy!

The archive ranges from charming letters to his future wife Mileva Marić after the birth of their first child to his battle to come to terms with fame and his stance as a pacifist in the wake of the First World War. Scroll down for video. An online collection of 5,000 Albert Einstein documents includes letters to his future wife Mileva Marić. The pair are pictured together. But it also highlights his prolific output as a physicist as well as lecture notes, extensive workings and a a telegram informing him he had won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921 for the photoelectric effect. It includes documents about his most famous equation E=mc2, which said that the energy 'stored' in objects is equal to their mass multiplied by the speed of light squared. The transcribed and translated Digital Einstein Papers take readers on a journey through the life of the genius from 1879 to 1923, when he turned 44 - and anyone with an internet connection can now browse through the archive. It includes letters from a 22-year-old Einstein to his former classmate Marić, sent to her from Berne in Switzerland, in February 1902. It reveals his joy at learning of the birth of his daughter. Writing to his 'beloved sweetheart', he asks of baby Lieserl: 'Is she healthy and does she already cry properly? What kind of little eyes does she have? Whom of us two does she resemble more? Who is giving her milk? Is she hungry? And so she is completely bald. I love her so much and I don't even know her yet! 'Couldn't she be photographed once you are totally healthy again? Will she soon be able to turn her eyes toward something?' The archive includes love letters Einstein (right) wrote to Elsa Löwenthal (left). The pair married after his first wife granted a divorce. In 1903, he wrote to his friend Michele Besso that he was living a 'very pleasant, cozy life with my wife'. 'She takes excellent care of everything, cooks well, and is always cheerful,' he wrote. The pair would go on to have two sons but Einstein later began an affair with his cousin, Elsa Löwenthal. In one letter to her on May 7 1912, he writes: 'Both of us are poor devils, each shackled to his unrelenting duties. I cannot tell you how sorry I am for you, and how much I would like to be something to you. 'But if we give in to our affection for each other, only confusion and misfortune will result. You know this only too well. He continues: 'I love you. I would be happy if I were allowed to walk a few steps at your side even if only from time to time, or if I could otherwise rejoice in being close to you.' He later married Löwenthal, who had children of her own, after Marić granted a divorce. In other letters Einstein describes how fame was affecting his personal life, writing that 'The postman is my archenemy, I cannot shake myself loose from his slavery' The transcribed and translated collection shows how Einstein was a prolific writer of letters and postcards. Pictured above is a post card, from a separate archive, that he once wrote to his wife Elsa. In other letters he describes how fame was affecting his personal life, writing that 'The postman is my archenemy, I cannot shake myself loose from his slavery'. And the scientist, who died at the age of 76, sets out his pacifist stance following the horrors of the First World War writing to hi friend Carl Herman Unthan: 'I must admit that it always pains me when the few little blossoms that grew in my flowerbed must suffer by being used to decorate the banner of nationalism. Revealing his excitement about the birth of his first child in 1902, he wrote to Mileva Marić:. ‘I love her so much and I don’t even know her yet! Couldn’t she be photographed once you are totally healthy again? In a 1912 love letter to Elsa Lowenthal, the woman he was having an affair with, he wrote:. ‘Both of us are poor devils, each shackled to his unrelenting duties. I cannot tell you how sorry I am for you, and how much I would like to be something to you. Explaining his hopes for peace after the First World War in a letter in April 1920, he said:. ‘I am a pacifist and, in these times of hate, am steadily intent on encouraging reconciliation’ 'For I am a pacifist and, in these times of hate, am steadily intent on encouraging reconciliation.' Having documented the first 44 years of his life, the team behind the project plans to add more volumes to the archive as they are compiled and printed. The 14th volume, with more than 1,000 documents, is set to be released in January and will be digitised at a later date. The website is a collaboration involving the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Princeton University Press and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It includes both the German originals and the English translations. Diana Kormos-Buchwald, director of the Einstein Papers Project at Caltech is quoted by the Los Angeles Daily News as saying: 'This is an ongoing project. We have reached his 44th birthday.

Article: Tracy Caulkins is known as the first American to set an American record and win an American title in each of four swimming strokes : breaststroke, butterfly, backstroke, freestyle. Tracy Caulkins was born in Minnesota and lived in Iowa until she was six. She began swimming when she was eight, after the family had moved to Nashville, Tennessee. While unwilling at first to swim in cold water or get her face wet, she began to train in earnest as her talent became clear. Though her father worked for the public schools, the family sent her to a private school when the public schools could not accommodate her training schedule. At age 13, Tracy Caulkins took part in the trials for the 1976 Olympics, but did not make the team. She continued to win national and international titles, and was disappointed in 1980 when the U.S. didn't attend the Moscow Olympics. She continued to train and compete. In 1981, Tracy Caulkins began college, graduating in 1985. In college, she continued competing and training, though she had slowed down from her peak years. Caulkins trained especially hard for the 1984 Olympics, and not only made the team, but was captain of the swim team and at Los Angeles, won three gold medals and was named Sportswoman of the Year by the U.S. Olympic Committee. After that she retired from swimming, and was a commentator for swimming events as well as taking advantage of her fame to do business. Tracy Caulkins married Australian swimmer, Mark Stockwell, in 1991, their romance having begun at the 1984 Olympics when he jumped into a warm-up pool to introduce himself. They married in Nashville and moved to Australia, where they had three children. Caulkins continued to be professionally involved in sports. Question: When was Tracy Caulkins born?

As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue.

According to Lagrange's theorem, finite groups of order p, a prime number, are necessarily cyclic (abelian) groups Zp. Groups of order p2 can also be shown to be abelian, a statement which does not generalize to order p3, as the non-abelian group D4 of order 8 = 23 above shows. Computer algebra systems can be used to list small groups, but there is no classification of all finite groups.q[›] An intermediate step is the classification of finite simple groups.r[›] A nontrivial group is called simple if its only normal subgroups are the trivial group and the group itself.s[›] The Jordan–Hölder theorem exhibits finite simple groups as the building blocks for all finite groups.

Families of theater shooting victims plan goodbyes While suspect James Holmes sits in a solitary confinement cell, the families and survivors of the Colorado theater massacre are beginning the heartbreaking task of planning funerals and trying to repair their lives. The city of Aurora has been the focus of the nation since Holmes allegedly went on a shooting rampage in a Cineplex there, killing 12 and injuring 58 at a midnight showing of the latest Batman movie early Friday. Thousands gathered for a memorial vigil for the dead. Denver Broncos players visited victims in the hospital. United Airlines has offered families of the deceased free roundtrip tickets to Denver. Now the string of memorial services and funerals begins. Some of those killed in the shootings will be buried back in their hometowns. Jessica Ghawi, 24, a blogger and aspiring sportscaster, will be buried Saturday in San Antonio. Her brother, Jordan, has been blogging constantly since the shootings. According to his blog, Jessica will be cremated in Denver and the family will fly her remains back home. A full military funeral and burial is planned for Aug. 3 in Reno for Jonathan Blunk, 26, who served three tours in the Middle East and planned to re-enlist with the goal of becoming a Navy SEAL. Blunk, a father of two, died after shielding his girlfriend from bullets by lying on top of her. Visitation for Matt McQuinn, 27, is scheduled for Friday at Maiden Lane Church of God in Springfield, Ohio. The funeral is set for Saturday morning. McQuinn will be buried at Lawrenceville Cemetery in Clark County. McQuinn went to the movie with his girlfriend and was hit by bullets in the chest and leg. He grew up in the suburbs of Dayton, Ohio, and moved from Ohio to the Denver area in September. Funeral services for Rebecca Wingo, a 32-year-old mother and veteran of the Air Force, will be held Friday in Colorado, according to KHON-TV in Honolulu. Alex Teves, 24, who dove to protect his girlfriend in the shooting, was born in New Jersey and later moved to Arizona where he graduated from high school. His family is planning to have memorial services in Phoenix and New Jersey, The (Newark) Star-Ledger reported. At least three services have been planned in Aurora. One of the first will be for Micayla Medek, 23, on Wednesday at the Newcomer Funeral Home & Crematory. Two days later Alexander \\"A.J.\\" Boik, an 18-year-old recent high school graduate, will be remembered. The family has asked that news media stay away from the service. Gordon Cowden, 51, the oldest person to be killed in the shooting, will be buried later this week with services at the Colorado Community Church in Aurora, according to the Denver Post. \\"This is a national event which may be helpful for (the families) because it's a shared experience,\\" said George Bonanno, professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University. \\"It was an event that a lot of people recognized and shared with them. They are part of the community that cares. … It's going to be hard as the dust settles and everyone goes back to their business.\\" Columbine students who survived what in 1999 was the worst school massacre in U.S. history are reaching out to help those who witnessed and survived the attack in Aurora. \\"Similar to the graduating senior class from Columbine, they may soon find themselves surrounded by people who have no clue that they were involved in a traumatic event,\\" Columbine survivor Ben Lausten wrote on a Facebook page for survivors of school shootings. \\"These victims have a challenging path ahead of them,\\" he said. Holmes is being held on suspicion of first-degree murder, and he could face additional counts of aggravated assault and weapons violations. He won't be formally charged until next Monday. Police expect months of working with behavioral analysts and scrutinizing Holmes' relationships to establish a motive. As for a trial, that could take more than a year, said prosecutor Carol Chambers. She said her office is considering the death penalty, but that a decision will be made in consultation with the victims' families. David Sanchez said that would be the appropriate punishment if Holmes is convicted. His pregnant daughter escaped without injury but her husband remains in critical condition with a shotgun wound to the head. Sanchez's daughter, Katie Medley, 21, delivered Hugo Jackson Medley at 7:11 a.m. local time Tuesday. The University of Colorado hospital in Aurora says both the mother and baby are doing great. \\"When it's your own daughter and she escaped death by mere seconds, I want to say it makes you angry,\\" Sanchez said.

One way to learn multiplication with ease is to recognize specific rules and patterns in the multiplication tables, which can save you time and effort in solving various problems. In this article, we will be discussing some of these fundamental multiplication rules that can simplify your understanding and enhance your math skills. Rule 1: Multiplication by 0 Recall that any number multiplied by 0 will always be 0. This rule applies to any integer, fraction or decimal you come across. No matter how large or small the number, the result remains the same: zero. This rule can be directly attributed to the mathematical definition of multiplication, which states that multiplying a number is equivalent to adding it a specific number of times. For example: 3 x 0 = 0 -7 x 0 = 0 1000 x 0 = 0 Rule 2: Multiplication by 1 Just as with the rule of 0, there is a similar rule for the multiplication of any number by 1. When a number is multiplied by 1, it will remain unchanged, resulting in the original number. This rule is known as the identity property of multiplication. For example: 3 x 1 = 3 -7 x 1 = -7 1000 x 1 = 1000 Rule 3: The 2 Table When multiplying any number by 2, the result is equal to adding the number to itself. This rule is an effortless way to calculate products in the 2 table and quickly solve problems involving multiplication by 2. For example: 3 x 2 = 3 + 3 = 6 -7 x 2 = -7 - 7 = -14 1000 x 2 = 1000 + 1000 = 2000 Rule 4: The 5 Table The remarkable pattern in the 5 table can make it simple to multiply numbers by 5. Whenever a number is multiplied by 5, the result will always end with either a 0 or a 5. For example: 3 x 5 = 15 6 x 5 = 30 9 x 5 = 45 Rule 5: The 6 Table Pattern with Even Numbers In the 6 table, there is a peculiar pattern when multiplying even numbers. When you multiply an even number by 6, the final digit of the product will be the same as the original even number. Utilizing this rule can be advantageous in speeding up calculations involving multiplication by 6. For example: 2 x 6 = 12 4 x 6 = 24 6 x 6 = 36 Rule 6: The 9 Multiplication Facts When multiplying a number by 9, the most straightforward method to find the product is to multiply the original number by 10 and then subtract the original number from the resulting product. This technique enables you to quickly solve multiplication problems involving the number 9. For example: 3 x 9 = (3 x 10) - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27 6 x 9 = (6 x 10) - 6 = 60 - 6 = 54 8 x 9 = (8 x 10) - 8 = 80 - 8 = 72 Rule 7: The 11 Multiplication Facts Multiplying a single-digit number by 11 follows a specific pattern: the digit is repeated in the result. This rule applies to any single-digit number, which simplifies multiplication problems involving 11. For example: 3 x 11 = 33 5 x 11 = 55 9 x 11 = 99 Conclusion Understanding and recognizing these basic multiplication patterns make the process of multiplying numbers much more comfortable and less time-consuming. By mastering these rules, you'll be well on your way to becoming more confident in your math abilities and being able to tackle more complex problems with ease."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},Y={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],j={key:0},E={key:1};function D(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",H,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",Y,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
