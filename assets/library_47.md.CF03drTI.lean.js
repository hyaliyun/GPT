As he explains: They held a tryout for 5-year-old boys and my father took me there. I didn't even have real skates. I had those blades that you screwed onto the soles of your shoes, but I was tall, and the 9-year-olds didn't have a goalie, so they put me in with them and thats where I fell in love with the game of hockey. Context: After his contract with the Red Wings expired, Hasek announced his intention to play for a Stanley Cup contender, and specifically named the Ottawa Senators as a possibility. On July 6, 2004, after trading Patrick Lalime to the St. Louis Blues, the Senators signed Hasek to a one-year deal. During the 2004-05 NHL lockout, Hasek toured with the Primus Worldstars. Similar to the tour Wayne Gretzky and IMG formed during the 1994-95 NHL lockout, the Primus Worldstars Tour ran December 7-23, playing in seven different countries (Riga, Latvia; Moscow and St Petersburg, Russia; Bratislava, Slovakia; Bern, Switzerland; Karlstad, Jonkoping and Linkoping, Sweden; Oslo, Norway; Katowice, Poland) in ten scheduled games. The tour competed against all-star teams or club teams of each country. Hasek played increasingly well for the Senators up until the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. During the season, he reached 300 career wins, and his GAA and save percentage were the second-best in the league. Upon departure to Turin, Hasek's equipment was accidentally left behind in Ottawa. This caused Hasek to miss a number of practices with the Czech national team. At the Winter Olympics, he injured his right adductor muscle while making a save in the first qualifying match against Germany, forcing him to leave the game after only 9 minutes and 25 seconds. Hasek's injury caused him to miss the rest of the regular season and post-season, despite several rumours that he would return in time for the playoffs. He said that if he were to be re-signed, he would play for a base salary of 500,000 with bonuses. After the Senators were eliminated in the second round, they opted not to re-sign Hasek.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the creator of the style that is thought to be the first to descend from the one reported in a journal in 1849? from the following article ? Hachijō-daiko (八丈太鼓, trans. \\"Hachijō-style taiko\\") is a taiko tradition originating on the island of Hachijō-jima. Two styles of Hachijō-daiko emerged and have been popularized among residents: an older tradition based on a historical account, and a newer tradition influenced by mainland groups and practiced by the majority of the islanders.The Hachijō-daiko tradition was documented as early as 1849 based on a journal kept by an exile named Kakuso Kizan. He mentioned some of its unique features, such as \\"a taiko is suspended from a tree while women and children gathered around\\", and observed that a player used either side of the drum while performing. Illustrations from Kizan's journal show features of Hachijō-daiko. These illustrations also featured women performing, which is unusual as taiko performance elsewhere during this period was typically reserved for men. Teachers of the tradition have noted that the majority of its performers were women; one estimate asserts that female performers outnumbered males by three to one. The first style of Hachijō-daiko is thought to descend directly from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called Kumaoji-daiko, named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style. Kumaoji-daiko has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the shita-byōshi (下拍子, \\"lower beat\\"), provides the underlying beat. The other player, called the uwa-byōshi (上拍子, \\"upper beat\\"), builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms. While there are specific types of underlying rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat. Kumaoji-daiko also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from ropes, and historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.The contemporary style of Hachijō-daiko is called shin-daiko (新太鼓, \\"new taiko\\"), which differs from Kumaoji-daiko in multiple ways.

Write an article based on this \\"The health minister has said he does not want to impose a contract on junior doctors despite the government announcing it will do so in England.\\"","completion":"Title: Health Minister Opposes Imposing Contract on Junior Doctors as Government Pushes Forward in England Introduction In a recent statement, the health minister has voiced his opposition to imposing a new contract on junior doctors, despite the government's announcement that it is implementing the measure in England. The controversial decision has generated heated discussions, with junior doctors expressing dismay over the new contract and organizing demonstrations to push for a change. This article aims to dissect the situation and provide a comprehensive examination of the key points surrounding the debate over the proposed contract. Health Minister's Opposition The health minister's stance is in stark contrast to the government's position on the issue, marking a potential rift within the government. The minister has cited concerns over the unfairness and the negative impacts it could have on the morale of junior doctors, which could ultimately affect the quality of patient care. He fears that the imposition might lead to resistance from the medical community, with the potential to damage the healthcare system in the long run. The New Contract The new contract introduced by the government imposes several changes that have raised concerns among junior doctors. Some of these changes include: 1. Redefining the concept of 'unsocial hours' and lowering pay rates during these periods 2. Removing financial penalties for hospitals that overwork junior doctors 3. Adjustments to the pay progression system that could disproportionally affect part-time workers and those taking parental leave Junior Doctors' Response Junior doctors have expressed outrage over the new contract, claiming that it is unfair, exploitative, and poses a significant risk to patient safety. Many argue that the new provisions would result in overexhausted and stressed doctors, increasing the likelihood of errors and jeopardizing patient care. In response, junior doctors have organized demonstrations and strikes, demanding that the government come up with a more equitable and reasonable contract. Effects on the Healthcare System The imposition of the new contract stands to create a significant impact on the healthcare system in England. As junior doctors play an essential role in delivering patient care, their dissatisfaction and potential departure from the National Health Service (NHS) could strain the already burdened system. Additionally, the ongoing strikes and demonstrations may result in delays in treatments and appointments, further prolonging patient wait times and increasing the risk of poor outcomes. Professional Associations' Perspective Various professional associations and medical bodies have also chimed in on the matter. Many organizations have expressed solidarity with the junior doctors, condemning the government's proposal, and voicing concerns over the potential implications on the healthcare system. The British Medical Association (BMA) and the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) are among the major institutions that have joined the call for a renegotiation of the contract, pushing for a more equitable resolution that prioritizes patient safety and respects the medical workforce. Possible Solutions and Recommendations The situation demands an urgent resolution in order to prevent further detrimental effects on the healthcare system. A few potential solutions include: 1. Engaging in a dialogue with junior doctors and professional associations, addressing their concerns and modifying the contract to ensure fairness 2. Establishing regulatory bodies to safeguard the rights and interests of junior doctors and monitor working conditions and the allocation of unsocial hours 3. Facilitating contract flexibility and providing options for tailored contracts that cater to individual circumstances, considering factors such as family commitments and work-life balance Conclusion The opposition of the health minister to the imposed contract on junior doctors reflects a growing concern surrounding the government's decision and its potential ramifications on the healthcare system in England. It is crucial that a meaningful conversation takes place between all stakeholders to address concerns and develop a fairer and more sustainable contract that promotes the wellbeing of both junior doctors and the patients they serve. Failing to do so may result in long-lasting negative consequences for the healthcare service, affecting patient care and the medical workforce."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date. I remember we went to a nice Italian place on Federal Hill! Here’s the Garden City location, where I worked. Question: The manager probably believes that: Options: A. not enough information B.

Similarities: 1. Both questions ask about the best laptop. 2. Both questions have a budget limit - under Rs. 60,000 or approximately 900. Differences: 1. The first question specifies the budget limit in dollars (900 approx), while the second question specifies it in Indian rupees (Rs. 60,000). Step 2: Analyze the context of using different currencies in each question. Since the laptop market is large and competitive, prices can vary by region, manufacturer, and model. However, there are many times when the local currency in each question can be converted accurately enough to maintain a similar meaning. Step 3: Verify the approximate conversion between these two currencies. As 60,000 Indian Rupees (Rs) roughly equal to 900, we can consider these two amounts to have similar purchasing power. Step 4: Determine if these questions are paraphrases of each other. Based on the similarities, differences, and approximate conversion between the two questions' budget limits, we can determine that these questions are indeed paraphrases of each other.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the pottery type that succeeded the most popular pottery until the 7th century? ? In medieval Nubia, pottery and its decoration were appreciated as an art form. Until the 7th century, the most common pottery type found at Soba was the so-called \\"Red Ware\\". These wheel-made hemispherical bowls were made of red or orange slip and painted with separated motifs such as boxes with inner cross-hatchings, stylized floral motifs or crosses. The outlines of the motifs were drawn in black while the interiors were white. In their design, they are a direct continuation of Kushite styles, with possible influences from Aksumite Ethiopia. Due to their relative rarity, it has been suggested that they were imported, although they bear similarities to the pottery type, known as \\"Soba Ware\\", that succeeded them.\\"Soba Ware\\" was a type of wheel-made pottery with a distinctive decoration very different from that found in the rest of Nubia. The shape of the pottery was diverse, as was the repertoire of painted decoration. One of the most distinctive features was the use of faces as painted decoration. They were simplified, if not geometric, in form and with big round eyes. This style is foreign to Makuria and Egypt, but bears a resemblance to paintings and manuscripts from Ethiopia. It is possible the potters copied these motifs from local church murals. Also unique was the application of animal-shaped bosses (protomes). Glazed vessels were also produced, copying Persian aquamaniles without reaching their quality. Beginning in the 9th century, \\"Soba Ware\\" was increasingly replaced by fine ware imported from Makuria.

These factors include subject, action or verb, and object. Let's break down these sentences and compare each factor. 1. Subject similarity: - In the first sentence, the subject is \\"A woman\\"; in the second sentence, the subject is \\"A man\\". Both subjects are human, but different in terms of gender. Therefore, the subject similarity could be considered moderately similar. We can rate this aspect a 3. 2. Action/Verb similarity: - In the first sentence, the action or verb is \\"riding\\"; in the second sentence, the action or verb is \\"lifting himself\\". These actions are quite different from each other, as \\"riding\\" refers to being on top of and controlling the movements of a large object or animal, whereas \\"lifting himself\\" implies using physical strength to elevate oneself. Therefore, the verb similarity is low. Giving this aspect a rating of 1. 3. Object similarity: - In the first sentence, the object is \\"an elephant\\"; in the second sentence, the object is embedded within the verb and refers to \\"himself\\" (i.e., the man). This makes the objects significantly different - an elephant is a large animal, while \\"himself\\" refers to the subject in the second sentence. The objects are not similar. We can assign this aspect a 0 rating. Now that we have considered all three factors, we can average the individual ratings to determine the overall similarity of the two sentences: (3 + 1 + 0) / 3 = 4/3 ≈ 1.33 Given this analysis, the overall similarity between the sentences \\"A woman is riding an elephant.\\" and \\"A man is lifting himself.\\" is approximately 1.33 on a scale of 0-5, which indicates that the sentences are not very similar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 2025, a corporation called \\"The Union\\" has perfected bio-mechanical organs to replace diseased organs. However, if they fall behind on payments, a \\"repo man\\" reclaims the artificial organ (artiforg) from the body; the procedure frequently results in the death of the customer due to them being crucial organs. Remy and his partner Jake Freivald are considered the best of the Union's repo men. However, Remy's wife Carol disapproves of his work, believing that it is a bad influence for their son Peter. At a family barbecue, Jake does a quick repossession on a passenger in a cab using a kitchen knife. Carol sees this and leaves with Peter, urging Remy to make a decision. While out driving with Jake, they discover a \\"nest\\", a refuge for Union customers who have defaulted on payments for their artiforgs and become fugitives to avoid the repo men. Remy and Jake raid the nest by themselves and reclaim 32 artiforgs, which impresses their boss Frank. He offers them the opportunity to become full-time raid captains. Remy refuses and attempts to ask Frank to transfer to sales, but Jake cuts him off. Jake tells Remy that what they do is important, but Remy's mind is made up. Jake suggests that Remy's last job be a musician that Remy is a fan of. After helping the musician finish one last song, he uses a defibrillator in order to stop the artificial heart, but the device malfunctions, and Remy is severely injured, requiring replacement of his heart with an artiforg. Carol divorces Remy for taking another job, so he moves in with Jake. In sales, he is unable to lie to potential customers about the consequences of non-payment and is forced back into repo to pay for his heart, but has developed sympathy for his victims and develops a psychological block that prevents him from repossessing their artiforgs....

Unless you are going to determine steps to make your wishes turn into goals AND you’re going to follow through with those steps, you probably should not make New Year’s resolutions. Full disclaimer before we completely dive in: I’m not against setting goals. I have always been a goal setter and sometimes even a goal achiever. If you’re the same, you may enjoy this audible, or if you’re interested in developing and achieving SMART goals try this e-book or this book. Why You Shouldn’t Make New Year’s Resolutions You’ll probably write the same things on a sheet of paper that you did the year before. Some of the common resolutions we’ve all heard are: Lose weight, exercise, spend less, save more, travel, go to church, and so on and so forth. There’s a reason these are common. We hear them (or write them) time and time again and…nothing changes. By mid-January, they’ll be long forgotten. Maybe even before January 15th, they aren’t a thought in our minds. They were good ideas two weeks prior (and the years before that), but that’s what they have remained…ideas. You didn’t think of a route to your destination. Saving money sounds great, but do you know what you’re already spending? Do you know what you need to cut and where you’ll put that amount? Have you factored in your new gym membership? What will you do with it? Will the autodraft payment that comes out each month help you shed those pounds? What churches are in your area? Do they have programs your family will be interested in? Do you know when the services are? You’re overwhelmed. You try to better yourself constantly. Maybe. Let’s say some of you try to better yourselves constantly. Which can be a good thing.

The tweet reads: \\"@brittanystreet Hmph. Okay...just keep tweeting. All weekend.\\" To start with, we can break down the tweet into components to get a clearer picture of its sentiment: 1. User mentioned: \\"brittanystreet\\" - The tweet is directly addressing or referring to a specific Twitter user, which could imply a conversational context. 2. Interjection: \\"Hmph\\" - Generally, this signifies disapproval, disagreement, or annoyance, which could potentially indicate a negative sentiment. 3. The statement: \\"Okay...just keep tweeting\\" - Despite using the word \\"okay,\\" the presence of the ellipsis hints at a possible sarcastic tone. This part of the tweet suggests that the author may be indirectly commenting on the other user's tweeting activity or content, possibly in a disapproving or uninterested manner. 4. Timeframe: \\"All weekend\\" - The inclusion of a specific timeframe emphasizes the author's apparent disinterest, lack of enthusiasm, or annoyance regarding the constant tweeting activity of the mentioned user. Taking all the above components into account, it can be predicted that the sentiment of this tweet is somewhat negative or sarcastic. The tweet seems to convey subtle disapproval, annoyance or disinterest in the other person's tweeting activities.

Mary Chapin Carpenter (born February 21, 1958) is an American singer-songwriter. Carpenter spent several years singing in Washington, D.C. clubs before signing in the late 1980s with Columbia Records, who marketed her as a country singer. Carpenter's first album, 1987's Hometown Girl, did not produce any singles, although 1989's State of the Heart and 1990's Shooting Straight in the Dark each produced four Top 20 hits on the Billboard country singles charts. Carpenter's most successful album to date remains 1992's Carpenter was born in Princeton, New Jersey, to Chapin Carpenter Jr., a Life Magazine executive, and Mary Bowie Robertson. Carpenter lived in Japan from 1969 to 1971 before moving to Washington, D.C. She attended Princeton Day School, a private coeducational prep school, before graduating from The Taft School in 1976. Carpenter described her childhood as \\"pretty typical suburban\\", with her musical interests defined chiefly by her sisters' albums of artists such as The Mamas & the Papas, The Beatles, and Judy Collins. When Carpenter was 16 her parents divorced, an event that affected Carpenter and that she wrote about in her song \\"House of Cards\\". Carpenter spent much of her time in high school playing the guitar and piano; while at Princeton Day School, her \\"classmates threatened to cut her guitar strings if she played 'Leaving on a Jet Plane' one more time.\\" Despite her interest in music, Carpenter never considered performing publicly until, shortly after graduating from Taft, her father suggested that she perform at a local open-mic bar, a stressful experience for the shy Carpenter, who recalled, \\"I thought I was going to barf.\\" Carpenter also hosted an open-mic night at a bar in the Cleveland Park neighborhood of Washington, DC for a number of years. Carpenter graduated from Brown University in 1981 with a degree in American Civilization. Carpenter played some summer sets in Washington's music scene, where she met guitarist John Jennings, who would become her producer and long-time collaborator. However, she considered music a hobby and planned on getting a \\"real job\\". She briefly quit performing, but after several job interviews decided to return to music. Carpenter was persuaded by Jennings to play original material instead of covers. Within a few years, she landed a manager and recorded a demo tape that led to a deal with Columbia Records.","completion":"This text is about Mary Chapin Carpenter, an American singer-songwriter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. I can use this background: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. Now, I have a new situation: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop. Answer this question please: Which crop would be less beneficial to farmers, crop A or crop B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Crop B would be less beneficial to farmers, as it is not tolerant of herbicides. This means that farmers would have a harder time controlling weeds in their fields, and crop yields could potentially be lower due to increased weed competition and potential harm from the herbicides. In contrast, crop A, being herbicide-tolerant, would allow for better weed management with fewer or no adverse effects on the crop itself, ultimately leading to increased crop yield and reduced input costs for the farmers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First, let's simplify the equation. Combine the like terms (the terms involving s): -2s + 20s = 18s Now, the simplified equation becomes: 18s + 90 = 0 Now we need to isolate s to find its value. To do that, you can follow these steps: Step 1: Move the constant term (90) to the other side of the equation: 18s = -90 Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of s, which is 18: s = -90 / 18 Step 3: Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 18 in this case: s = (-90 / 18) * (1 / 1) s = (-5) So, the solution to the equation -2s + 20s + 90 = 0 is s = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Denham Fouts was the inspiration for characters by the writer and intellectual of what nationality? Answer:","completion":"Denham Fouts, born in 1914, was a prominent American socialite, courtesan, and muse who inspired numerous notable writers and artists during the 20th century. As a well-known figure in the artistic and intellectual circles, his life influenced the works of several renowned authors. The specific writer and intellectual in question who drew inspiration from Denham Fouts is the British author and poet Christopher Isherwood. Christopher Isherwood, born in 1904 in England, was a prolific writer and a significant figure in the British literary scene throughout the 20th century. His works include novels, plays, and screenplays, with some of the most famous being \\"Goodbye to Berlin\\" (which later inspired the movie \\"Cabaret\\"), \\"A Single Man,\\" and \\"Christopher and His Kind.\\" In Isherwood's novel \\"Down There on a Visit,\\" the character of Paul is noted to be directly inspired by the charm and enigmatic personality of Denham Fouts. Isherwood and Fouts first met in 1937 and had a romantic relationship for some time, which strengthened the connection between Fouts' life and Isherwood's literary creations. In his autobiography \\"Christopher and His Kind,\\" Isherwood further recalls his relationship with Fouts, shedding light on how Fouts became a muse for various artists, writers, and intellectuals during his time. As Denham Fouts inspired one of the characters in the works of Christopher Isherwood, a prominent British writer and intellectual, it can be concluded that the writer and intellectual of the asked nationality is British."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"It also involves diseases of other systems, where immune reactions play a part in the pathology and clinical features.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"Where can these three elements occur in the immune system?\\"","completion":"The given statement \\"It also involves diseases of other systems, where immune reactions play a part in the pathology and clinical features.\\" does not contain the direct answer to the question \\"Where can these three elements occur in the immune system?\\" as it is not explicitly mentioning the three elements in question. However, it does involve a discussion about immune system reactions and their roles in disease pathology and clinical features. To provide a detailed and long answer to the question, it is essential to know what the three elements being referred to are. Since those three elements aren't specified, let's assume that they could be T-cells, B-cells, and antibodies, as these are three key components in the adaptive immune response. 1. T-cells: T-cells, or T-lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell that plays a critical role in the immune system. They are produced in the bone marrow and then mature in the thymus gland, hence the name \\"T-cells\\". T-cells can be found in various parts of the body, including the spleen, lymph nodes, blood, and tissues affected by infection. They can recognize and destroy infected cells or cancerous cells, as well as help other cells in the immune system by coordinating responses. There are two primary types of T-cells: a. Helper T-cells - These cells assist in activating other immune cells, such as B-cells, to produce antibodies and guide killer T-cells to destroy infected cells. b. Cytotoxic T-cells (killer T-cells) - These cells locate and kill cells that are infected with viruses or have become cancerous. 2. B-cells: B-cells, or B-lymphocytes, are another type of white blood cell that is vital in the immune system. They are produced and mature in the bone marrow. B-cells circulate in the blood and lymphatic system and can be found in lymph nodes, the spleen, and other lymphoid tissues. They function by producing antibodies in response to foreign substances known as antigens, which can be found in viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens. 3. Antibodies: Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins (Ig), are proteins produced by B-cells in response to the presence of antigens. Antibodies can be found in blood plasma, lymph, and within tissues that are directly affected by an infection. They neutralize pathogens by binding to specific antigens, thus preventing them from infecting cells or marking them for destruction by other immune cells. There are five main classes of antibodies: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE, each with its unique function and location within the immune system. In conclusion, the three elements in this context - T-cells, B-cells, and antibodies - occur in various parts of the immune system, such as the blood, bone marrow, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and other tissues affected by infection. They each play a critical role in the adaptive immune response and contribute to the overall protection against pathogens and disease. Although the original statement does not directly answer the question, the connection between these immune system components and their roles in diseases involving immune reactions can be inferred."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: What name is given to a number sequence in which each term is the sum of the two preceding terms?","completion":"The name given to a number sequence in which each term is the sum of the two preceding terms is the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is an essential concept in mathematics and has various applications in different fields, including computer science, economics, and even biology. It is named after Leonardo Fibonacci, an Italian mathematician who introduced the sequence to the Western world through his 1202 book, Liber Abaci. The Fibonacci sequence starts with the first two terms as 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is obtained by adding the previous two terms. In mathematical notation, the Fibonacci sequence is defined using the following recurrence relation: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with initial conditions F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1. The first several terms of the Fibonacci sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, ... A fascinating aspect of the Fibonacci sequence is the appearance of various patterns and its connection to the golden ratio, an irrational number denoted by the Greek letter phi (φ) and approximately equal to 1.618033988749895. As the Fibonacci sequence progresses, the ratio of two consecutive terms converges towards the golden ratio. That is: (F(n) / F(n-1)) ≈ φ The golden ratio is famous for appearing in various facets of art, architecture, and nature, and is believed to have aesthetically pleasing properties. Apart from the above, the Fibonacci sequence is utilized in different algorithms, search techniques, and data structures in computer science. It is also employed in diverse fields like financial modeling, numerical analysis, and even the study of plant and animal population growth in biology. In conclusion, the Fibonacci sequence is a remarkable number sequence found extensively in nature, mathematics, and multiple scientific domains. Its unique property of each term being the sum of the two preceding terms has rendered it a crucial subject in both theoretical and applied sciences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. Question: John was studying the species in African Savannah. He noticed that elands, which is a prey animal, are basically nocturnal. On the other hand, wild boars, another prey animal, are not nocturnal. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which species would be less active at night, elands or wild boars? Hint: Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. Answer:","completion":"Wild boars would be less active at night compared to elands, as elands are basically nocturnal while wild boars are not."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(2) Ray Bergman -- who was in one of Stephens 's youth choirs -- also disputes any claims that Stephens was homosexual . Do these two sentences mean the same thing? 1. no. 2. yes.","completion":"Yes, the two sentences essentially convey the same meaning, but with slight variations in sentence structure and punctuation. Let's break down both sentences and examine their similarities and differences: Sentence 1: (1) Ray Bergman -- who was in one of the youth choirs of Stephens -- also disputes any claims that Stephen 's homosexual was. In this sentence, there appears to be a minor grammatical error, as the phrase \\"Stephen 's homosexual was\\" seems to be incorrect. It should be written as \\"Stephen was homosexual.\\" Also, the phrase \\"youth choirs of Stephens\\" could be rewritten as \\"one of Stephens's youth choirs\\" for better readability. Sentence 2: (2) Ray Bergman -- who was in one of Stephens 's youth choirs -- also disputes any claims that Stephens was homosexual. This sentence is more grammatically correct and concise in its structure. It clearly states that Ray Bergman, a member of one of Stephens's youth choirs, disputes any claims of Stephens being homosexual. Comparing the two sentences, both are talking about Ray Bergman, who was a member of one of the youth choirs associated with Stephens. Both sentences also mention that Ray disputes any allegations regarding Stephens's homosexuality. The primary difference between the two sentences lies in the syntax and grammar. While sentence 1 has slightly incorrect phrasing, sentence 2 is more properly constructed and easier to comprehend. In summary, although both sentences may have some slight structural and grammatical differences, their overall meaning remains the same: Ray Bergman, a member of one of Stephens's youth choirs, disputes any claims that Stephens was homosexual."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's important to note that these reasons are not explicitly mentioned in the provided choices; therefore the correct answer would be \\"None of the above choices.\\" 1. Adaptability and socialization: Max, the German Shepherd, seems to be a highly adaptable and sociable dog, easily accepting Charly's presence in his life and territory. This adaptability is a result of his inherent personality traits, which enables him to respond positively to new and unfamiliar situations. 2. Innate nurturing instincts: Max may possess a strong nurturing instinct, allowing him to develop a bond with Charly despite the difference in their sizes. He may have intuitively recognized that Charly needed support and guidance, making him more accepting of the newcomer into his life. 3. Charly's behavior: Charly's demeanor could have played a significant role in Max's acceptance of him. If Charly approached Max with a friendly and non-threatening attitude, it would have been easier for Max to accept him as a companion instead of seeing him as a potential competitor for resources or territory. 4. The bond between Max and his human family: A strong connection with his human family could make Max more amenable to the introduction of a new dog into the household, especially if the family took the time and effort to ease the transition through proper introductions and supervised interactions between the two dogs. 5. Past experience or social exposure: Max's past experiences or social exposure with other dogs could have played a role in his receptiveness to Charly. If Max had positive experiences with other dogs, either through playdates or regular walks where he encountered other friendly dogs, it would have prepared him to be more accepting of new dogs entering his life.

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Embryo is C - Embryo grows and develops into a fetus inside the woman&#x27;s womb - The fetus is born - Begins to grow and develop through infancy and childhood - In the teenage years the human experiences puberty - Reaches sexual maturity - At 18 the human becomes an adult - Adult may procreate continuing the cycle. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the process you've outlined is the initial stage of human reproduction, which involves the union of male and female reproductive cells. Here is a detailed overview of the entire process, including the missing first step: 1. Fertilization: The process begins with the union of a sperm cell from a male and an egg cell (ovum) from a female. These reproductive cells, or gametes, merge during sexual intercourse or assisted reproductive technologies, resulting in the formation of a single cell called a zygote. This union of sperm and egg is known as fertilization, and it triggers the start of human development. 2. Embryo formation (Cleavage): The zygote then undergoes several rapid cell divisions, known as cleavage, resulting in the formation of a multicellular structure called an embryo. This early stage of embryonic development is characterized by a mass of cells that are not yet specialized. 3. Embryo growth and development: The embryo continues to grow and develop inside the woman's uterus (womb), undergoing a series of differentiation processes. These processes result in the formation of specialized tissues, organs, and systems. During this time, the embryo relies on the woman's body for nourishment and protection. 4. Fetal stage: After about eight weeks of development, the growing organism is referred to as a fetus. This stage encompasses the remainder of the pregnancy, during which the fetus further matures and develops the structures and functions necessary for life outside the womb. 5. Birth: Following approximately nine months of intrauterine growth, the fetus is born. The newborn transitions from the uterus into the external environment, marking the beginning of infancy. 6. Growth and development through infancy and childhood: As the infant grows, they progress through various milestones of physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development. Throughout childhood, the individual continues to refine and expand their skills and abilities. 7. Adolescence and puberty: During the teenage years, the human undergoes significant physical, mental, and emotional changes. Puberty marks the development of secondary sexual characteristics and the onset of reproductive capability. 8. Sexual maturity: Upon reaching sexual maturity, the individual is biologically capable of reproducing, closing the loop on this cycle of human development. 9. Adulthood and procreation: At 18 years old, or the age of legal adulthood, the person may choose to engage in relationships and procreate, thus continuing the cycle of human development through future generations. In summary, the missing first step is the union of male and female reproductive cells (sperm and egg) through fertilization, which marks the beginning of human development. From this point onward, the human progresses through a series of stages that contribute to the full cycle of growth, maturation, and reproduction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, but with night skies around 1,000 times brighter than globally accepted levels, it gains a bad reputation for its light pollution. A study by Hong Kong University found that brightness levels in the southern Chinese city's popular shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui were 1,200 times greater than the international dark sky standard. The crowded city of 7 million residents , full or residential high-rises, towering office blocks and neon advertisements, has no laws to control outdoor lightning. The result is that light pollution is thought to be much worse than in other large cities, including London, Sydney, Tokyo and Shanghai. \\"In Hong Kong , you can't go anywhere outdoor in the evening without your eyes being blinded by this really disturbing outdoor lightning,\\" the light pollution survey's head Jason Pum told AFP. \\"The fact that we have all this light in the sky means energy is wasted,\\" he said, adding that too much artificial lightning also affects nightly wildlife. Research has suggested that light pollution can cause a number of harmful health effects in humans, including sleeplessness and headaches and can also interrupt body clocks and hormones . The university survey, the result of five million measurements taken from points across the city, was released just days before the start of the annual Earth Hour event, organized by the World Wildlife Fund.

A) neon advertisements B) residential buildings C) a dark sky with twinkling stars D) high office blocks A:","completion":"C) a dark sky with twinkling stars Hong Kong, being one of the most densely populated cities in the world, has a significant issue with light pollution. This problem is mainly due to a combination of factors, such as crowded residential high-rises, towering office blocks, and neon advertisements. Additionally, Hong Kong currently lacks any laws to control outdoor lighting. As a result, the night sky in Hong Kong is around 1,000 times brighter than globally accepted levels, making it incredibly challenging to observe a dark sky with twinkling stars. A study by Hong Kong University discovered that brightness levels in Tsim Sha Tsui, a popular shopping district in the city, were 1,200 times higher than the international dark sky standard. Consequently, Hong Kong is said to have worse light pollution than other major cities, including London, Sydney, Tokyo, and Shanghai. According to Jason Pun, the head of the light pollution survey, people in Hong Kong cannot venture outdoors in the evening without experiencing discomfort from the overwhelming artificial lighting. This excessive light pollution not only wastes energy but also disturbs nocturnal wildlife and has been associated with adverse health effects in humans, such as sleeplessness, headaches, interruptions in body clocks, and hormonal imbalances. To raise awareness about the environmental impact of light pollution and climate change, the annual Earth Hour event is organized by the World Wildlife Fund. People worldwide are encouraged to turn off their lights for an hour on a designated night. In previous years, several major buildings in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour participated in this event by going dark to emphasize the importance of reducing excessive lighting for the environment's benefit. In summary, when walking out at night in Hong Kong, you can encounter neon advertisements, residential buildings, and high office blocks, but it is highly unlikely to observe a dark sky with twinkling stars due to the city's severe light pollution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was very nerve-wracking.\\" But the new world No. 5 put together a run of four birdies in six holes in the middle of his final round to move above overnight leaders Graeme McDowell, who missed a 25-foot putt at the 18th to force a playoff, and fellow American Jim Furyk. \\"I'm pretty excited, I'm pretty worn out,\\" he said, after clinching the third PGA Tour title of his four-year career and taking home the 1.44 million first prize. \\"It's such a long week, such a grueling week on your mind, and this place is hard to walk.

Different families give different amounts of pocket money. The average for eight-to-fifteen-year-olds in the UK is about PS6 a week. Children in Scotland receive slightly more than the national average and Londoners get the most. Teenagers, logically, get more money than younger children. Some fifteen-to-nineteen-year-olds receive more than PS100 a month. The report found that many children save at least a quarter of their weekly pocket money and that more boys than girls save their money. Lots of young people have to do housework to get their pocket money. They help at home with jobs like cleaning and cooking. A part-time job is a choice for teenagers who don't have pocket money or who want to earn extra money. About 15% of teenagers have a job. Popular part-time jobs for teenagers include delivering newspapers, shop work, and working in a restaurant or cafe. There are strict government laws about working hours. Only children over 13 can work (there are some exceptions, for example, for actors.) On a school day they can work a maximum of 2 hours a day but not during school hours.

The given statement can be broken down into two parts: 1. The master threw the toy for the dog. 2. The dog brought it back. Part 1: \\"The master threw the toy for the dog.\\" In this part of the statement, we understand that there is a master who performs an action, which is throwing the play toy.

Helped by his assistant, Katy Bradshaw (Alona Tal), Taggart learns that Cathleen is seeing Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler), the campaign manager of Hostetler's rival in the upcoming elections, Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper). At a fundraiser for Hostetler's campaign, Cathleen reveals to Taggart that she knows he has been following her, and advises him not to trust her husband. Taggart delivers to Mayor Hostetler photos taken of Cathleen meeting with Andrews. At a film debut party, Barrow reveals that her real name is Natalia Barea, and that Yesenia was her sister. At the screening, Taggart is shocked at Natalie's sex scene, and strongly disapproves. He had thought it would express poetic love, but finds it akin to porn. Combined with guilt over working for Hostetler, Taggart descends into regular drinking bouts. He argues with Natalie over the scene and about the people she is seeing during her work. She breaks off the relationship. Taggart gets drunk, brawling with strangers while walking the city streets. He receives a phone call from Katy telling him Chief Fairbanks wants him at a murder scene. When he arrives, he learns that Andrews, Vaillant's campaign... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Broken City,\\" Cathleen Hostetler and Paul Andrews are revealed to be in a romantic relationship. Cathleen Hostetler, portrayed by Catherine Zeta-Jones, is the wife of Mayor Nicholas Hostetler, acted by Russell Crowe. Paul Andrews, played by Kyle Chandler, is the campaign manager of Mayor Hostetler's political rival, Jack Valliant. Suspecting his wife of infidelity, Mayor Hostetler hires a private investigator, Billy Taggart, played by Mark Wahlberg to track Cathleen. Assisted by his assistant Katy Bradshaw, Taggart soon finds out that Cathleen is romantically involved with Paul Andrews, making their relationship an affair due to Cathleen's marital status. This affair is layered with political implications due to Paul Andrews's professional position as the campaign manager of Mayor Hostetler’s competitor in the upcoming election. Later in the movie, in a private encounter, Cathleen admits to Taggart that she's aware of his surveillance, advising him not to trust her husband, Mayor Hostetler. Taggart then provides Mayor Hostetler with photographs evidencing Cathleen's meetings with Andrews. Given Paul Andrews's important role in the opposite political campaign, this affair is suggestive not only of personal betrayal but also potentially professional and political intrigue, influencing the overarching narrative of the movie. These intricate relations and engagements accentuate the movie's themes of politics, power, betrayal, and corruption. Therefore, in the context of the movie \\"Broken City,\\" Cathleen and Andrews are related through a secret romantic relationship, which is entangled in the web of political rivalry, creating a plot full of suspense and intrigue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center paid a 17,000 ransom in bitcoin to a hacker who seized control of the hospital's computer systems and would give back access only when the money was paid, the hospital's chief executive said Wednesday. The assault on Hollywood Presbyterian occurred Feb. 5, when hackers using malware infected the institution's computers, preventing hospital staff from being able to communicate from those devices, said Chief Executive Allen Stefanek. The hacker demanded 40 bitcoin, the equivalent of about 17,000, he said. Join the conversation on Facebook >> “The malware locks systems by encrypting files and demanding ransom to obtain the decryption key. The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key,” Stefanek said. “In the best interest of restoring normal operations, we did this.” The hospital said it alerted authorities and was able to regain control of all its computer systems by Monday, with the assistance of technology experts. Stefanek said patient care was never compromised, nor were hospital records. Top hospital officials called the Los Angeles Police Department last week, according to police Lt. John Jenal. Laura Eimiller, an FBI spokeswoman, said the bureau has taken over the hacking investigation but declined to discuss specifics of the case. Law enforcement sources told The Times that the hospital paid the ransom before reaching out to law enforcement for assistance. The attack forced the hospital to return to pen and paper for its record-keeping. Phil Lieberman, a cybersecurity expert, said that, while ransomware attacks are common, targeting a medical institution is not. “I have never heard of this kind of attack trying to shut down a hospital. This puts lives at risk, and it is sickening to see such an act,” he said. “Health management systems are beginning to tighten their security.” The 434-bed short-term acute care hospital on Vermont Avenue is owned by CHC of South Korea. Under federal law, hospitals are required to report potential medical data breaches involving more than 500 people. Since 2010, at least 158 institutions, including medical providers, insurers and hospitals, have reported being hacked or having information technology issues that compromised patient records, federal records show. Ransom attacks are still relatively rae. But cyberattacks on hospitals have become more common in recent years as hackers pursue personal information they can use for fraud schemes. Last July, hackers may have accessed as many 4.5 million patient records in UCLA Health System's computer network.

Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center says they're in the midst of an \\"internal emergency.\\" The attack began last Friday. Hospital workers say the computers have been shut down after the hackers locked patient files in exchange for a ransom. Melissa Garza is one of hundreds of patients still being treated at the hospital. \\"I wasn’t feeling very well, went in for a checkup and they said they’re computers were down. I asked, what’s going on here and they said we were hacked,\\" Garza said. While the hospital says patient care hasn’t been compromised, they admit the hack has impacted their day-to-day operations causing some hold ups in the Emergency Room. That's where Jeff Wilkinson says he was waiting with his daughter for hours. \\"I’m surprised they didn’t tell us this,\\" Wilkinson said regarding the attack. \\"Coming in [you'd think they would say] that there might be some delay because of it, I’m at a loss for words,\\" Wilkinson said. This hack attack is not a usual one. FOX 11's Christine O'Donnell wanted to know why hackers would target a hospital and how easy it would be. So, she took those questions to long-time computer forensics we took those questions to a computer forensics expert Eric Robi has worked in computer forensics for 13 years. \\"I don’t know why they chose a hospital specifically.\\" Robi said. \\"Maybe they're thinking it’s a greater sense of urgency because it’s a hospital and the’ll get payed,\\" Robi said. Robi says he's worked half a dozen cyber attacks against LA businesses in the past year, but the ransom was no where near as high as it is at the Medical Center. \\"The hackers have demanded, I think 9,000 bitcoin or so that’s a little over 3 Million,\\" Robi said. It's an unfortunate hack, a ransomware hack where they're asking for money in exchange for unlocking records at the hospital,\\" Robi said. He says most of the time it's cheaper to pay the ransom than to pay to fix the problem. \\"They're horrible, I know,\\" Robi said.

Mendez said she and her mother had to drive more than an hour to Palmdale to pick up medical tests in person. 2015 Southern California Images in the News \\"It's bad,\\" she said. \\"She's an older person. It's not right she has to do this.\\" Several hospital staff members said the computer system was hacked and was being held on a ransom of 3.4 billion in bitcoins, and in exchange, the hackers would send back the key codes to restore the system. Stefanek said the cyber attack was \\"random\\" and was not malicious. Stefanek said 911 patients that were transported by ambulance are being sporadically diverted to other hospitals, and all registrations and medical records are being written on paper. Belmont West said he came into the hospital Friday and was told he couldn't access his grandmother's medical test results. \\"It's a little worrying because when you go to a hospital you expect the best care, but it seems there is some sort of delay and failure in the system,\\" he said. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center has paid a 17,000 ransom in bitcoin to a hacker who seized control of the hospital's computer systems, demanding the payment in return for handing back control of the devices, according to the hospital's CEO, Allen Stefanek.

Question: Monica and Jill are two friends. They study and party together most of the time. One day Monica shared a needle with a drug addict at a party. She later found out that she'd been infected with HIV. Jill was scared and helped her as much as she could. Which friend has a virus that is transmitted by sexual contact? Answer:","completion":"Monica is the friend who has acquired a virus that can be transmitted by sexual contact. This particular virus is the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV. HIV is primarily transmitted through sexual contact, sharing needles or syringes with an infected person, or through contact with infected blood, vaginal fluids, or semen. In this scenario, Monica shared a needle with a drug addict at a party and later discovered that she had been infected with HIV. Sharing needles is one of the riskiest behaviors for acquiring HIV, as the virus can survive within the tiny amounts of blood present in used needles or syringes. Jill, on the other hand, is just Monica's friend and has not engaged in any risky behaviors that would put her at significant risk for contracting HIV. It is essential to understand that HIV cannot be transmitted through casual contact, such as hugging, holding hands, or sharing food and drink. It requires a direct exchange of specific bodily fluids, like blood, semen, or vaginal fluids, for the transmission to occur. Since Monica is the one who has contracted HIV in this situation, it is important for her to seek immediate medical attention and begin antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible. This treatment can slow the progression of the virus and improve her overall quality of life. Additionally, Monica must take preventive measures to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to others, including practicing safe sex and informing any potential sexual partners of her HIV status. Jill, as a friend, should continue to support Monica in her journey and educate herself further on HIV to better understand the challenges Monica might face. By being a compassionate and informed ally, Jill can contribute to breaking the stigma surrounding HIV and help create a more inclusive and understanding environment for Monica and others living with the virus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article using the following points: Workers make the most of the torrential downpours and gusty winds to extend their Christmas break. Train stations, underground platforms and city centre streets deserted as rush hour hits. On what is traditionally the first normal trading day after Christmas, Britain faces shutdown. Before the storm hit analysts had predicted £2.97billion could be spent on the High Street and online today. Article:","completion":"Title: Stormy Weather Extends Christmas Break as Britain Comes to a Halt Introduction: Torrential downpours and gusty winds have given workers across Britain an unexpected opportunity to extend their Christmas breaks, leading to deserted train stations, underground platforms, and city centre streets during what would traditionally be rush hour. On what is usually the first normal trading day after Christmas, Britain is facing a virtual shutdown, with analysts' earlier predictions of £2.97 billion in spending on the High Street and online today now uncertain. Step 1: Establish the background and extent of the situation The stormy weather has taken its toll throughout the country, with workers taking advantage of the conditions to enjoy an extra day or two of their festive break. This unforeseen reaction to the inclement weather has resulted in a significant drop in the number of people commuting to work and, subsequently, fewer people spending money in shops and online. Step 2: Discuss the impact on public transport and city life Public transport hubs, such as train stations and underground platforms, have been unusually quiet during what is ordinarily one of the busiest times of the year. Similarly, shopping centres, restaurants, and cafes have experienced a sharp decline in customer footfall, leaving city centre streets feeling eerily empty. Step 3: Address the potential economic impact The nationwide response to the weather has put a dent in retail and online sales, making analysts' previous predictions of £2.97 billion in spending look increasingly unlikely to be met. This abrupt dip in trade could have widespread repercussions for businesses across the country that are already grappling with pandemic-related challenges. Step 4: Offer possible reasons for the extended break It could be argued that the extended Christmas break is not just a result of the stormy weather, but also an amalgamation of factors like seasonal fatigue, ongoing concerns about the pandemic, and a desire to make the most of the additional time off work. The storm merely offered a convenient excuse for workers to take advantage of the situation as public transport slowed to a crawl, adding fuel to the fire. Step 5: Conclude with the potential long-term consequences While the temporary shutdown may feel like a welcome reprieve for many workers as they enjoy an extra day or two of rest, it is important to consider the potential long-term effects of the storm on the British economy. At a time when the nation is already facing multiple challenges, every pound spent makes a difference, and the unexpected downturn in trade could have far-reaching impacts on an already struggling market. In conclusion, the storm has provided an unexpected opportunity for workers to extend their Christmas breaks, resulting in a deserted, almost eerie atmosphere in city centres and public transportation hubs throughout Britain. However, the impact of this extended break on the economy remains to be seen, as the previously predicted £2.97 billion in spending is now hanging in the balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How many words contain the letter 'f' in the sentence. A:","completion":"The first step to achieve this task is to break the sentence down into its individual words. The sentence 'a man watching a plane in the ocean' can be separated into the following words: ['a', 'man', 'watching', 'a', 'plane', 'in', 'the', 'ocean']. Once we have this list of words, the next step is to iterate through the words, checking if the letter 'f' exists in each word. We can use Python's 'in' operator for this task.

Let me perform the task: The letter 'f' does not exist in 'a'. The letter 'f' does not exist in 'man'. The letter 'f' does not exist in 'watching'. The letter 'f' does not exist in 'a'. The letter 'f' does not exist in 'plane'. The letter 'f' does not exist in 'in'. The letter 'f' does not exist in 'the'. The letter 'f' does not exist in 'ocean'.

The airport is located in Atlantic City and it is an 'International' airport, meaning it hosts flights from and to different parts of the world. Justification: Airport names often indicate the city, town, region, or cultural aspect they serve, but they can also commemorate a person or event. The term 'International' suggests that the airport has customs and immigration facilities enabling passengers to travel between countries. 2. \\"RUNWAY_SURFACE_TYPE\\" - This keyword indicates the type of surface for the airport's runway. Justification: Runway Surface Type is important because it has implications for aircraft performance. Some planes may be equipped to handle specific types of surfaces better than others. 3. \\"Asphalt/Concrete\\" - This refers to the type of material used for constructing the runway of Atlantic City International Airport. The runway is made from Asphalt and Concrete. Justification: The kind of material used for constructing the runway is important because it affects the durability, service life, maintenance costs, and airplane operations. For example, asphalt/concrete runways are more resilient and able to support heavy aircraft, but also require regular maintenance to check for cracks and other degradation. Therefore, the data point given describes an aspect of the Atlantic City International Airport - specifically that it has a runway made of an asphalt and concrete mix.

Answer this question: when did the windsors come to the throne??","completion":"The House of Windsor, the reigning British royal family, came to the throne on July 17, 1917, when King George V changed the dynastic name from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the House of Windsor. The First World War was a time of strong anti-German sentiment in Britain, so the royal name change was seen as a move to distance the monarchy from its German connections. Prior to the House of Windsor, the British royal family belonged to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, a name that was inherited from the marriage of Queen Victoria to Prince Albert in 1840. Prince Albert was a member of the German ducal family of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. When Queen Victoria passed away in 1901, her son, Edward VII, ascended the throne and also belonged to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Edward VII reigned until his death in 1910, and his son, King George V, succeeded him. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 saw Britain eventually pitched against Germany, causing deep anti-German sentiments to arise within the British population. In response to these sentiments, King George V and his advisors decided that it was important to demonstrate the monarchy's loyalty to the British nation and to shed any German connections or affiliations. As a result, on July 17, 1917, King George V issued a royal proclamation renouncing any German titles and changing the house name to Windsor. The name was chosen due to its strong connection with British history and heritage as it was derived from the famous Windsor Castle, a significant royal residence that had been in the royal family for centuries. The proclamation also included the decision to abandon any German titles held by members of the royal family and change them to British titles or styles, further demonstrating the commitment to distancing themselves from German affiliations. Since then, the House of Windsor has continued to reign over the United Kingdom and its associated Commonwealth realms. Following King George V's reign, his son King Edward VIII briefly succeeded him, but he abdicated in 1936, leading to his brother, King George VI, to ascend the throne. King George VI reigned until his death in 1952, succeeded by his daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, who remains on the throne today as the longest-reigning monarch in British history. The House of Windsor continues to represent the British monarchy through its successive generations, with its members carrying the legacy of the historical decision made by King George V in 1917."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What are the first names of the people whose employers forbid them from creating a human-animal hybrid? , can you please find it? Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren.

News article: Fundraising Deadline Looms for Republicans Hoping to Engineer the Fall of Trump The Summer of Trump will come to an end in one week—at 4:21 a.m. on Sept. 23, to be precise. That’s the moment of the fall equinox. A nervous Republican field is hoping the Summer of Trump won’t be followed by an Autumn of Trump. Instead, they’d prefer to see the fall of Trump, so that one of their own can at last climb atop the presidential polls that the billionaire presidential candidate has dominated for two months. There’s little sign that’s about to happen. Donald Trump has risen steadily in the polls for weeks now, as this chart from Huffington Post makes perfectly clear: One reason for Trump’s rise is that his competitors face a collective-action problem: everyone would love to see Trump attacked and taken down, but most candidates have concluded that the risk of being eviscerated by him outweighs the reward of possibly denting his strength. That’s why the candidates on stage with Trump at the Aug. 6 debate in Cleveland were so deferential. (The one exception, Rand Paul, wound up serving as a cautionary tale of the perils of challenging Trump, who, after a pair of attacks from the Kentucky senator, delivered an accurate and stinging put-down: “You’re having a hard time tonight.” Paul has since faded to insignificance.) For a whole host of reasons, Wednesday night's debate at the Reagan presidential library in Simi Valley, California, should be a much different affair. First, the idea that Trump will implode on his own looks increasingly far-fetched. Second, as a recent New York Times/CBS News poll illustrates, voters who haven’t cottoned to Trump are mainly lining up behind retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, another non-traditional outsider, rather than former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, or Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. Finally, the quarterly fundraising deadline is two weeks away, which puts enormous pressure on the many underperforming candidates to make enough of a splash in the debate that the money keeps flowing from frustrated donors. For candidates who don’t have a breakthrough moment, a Republican operative told Politico's Mike Allen, money will dry up “and they’ll effectively be written off” come the Oct. 15 reporting deadline. Candidates needn’t look any further than former Texas Governor Rick Perry’s cash-starved and kaput presidential bid to see the fate that awaits them if they can’t stand up to Trump. The huge—or is it “yooooge”?—television audience sure to tune in on Wednesday night makes this debate the one event between now and the end of the quarter that is certain to register in the minds of rich GOP financiers. While many campaign strategists are telling reporters that they’re content to wait out Trump and hope that somebody (or some organization) can take him down, nearly every incentive for the 10 candidates flanking Trump on the CNN stage pushes them toward confrontation, spectacle, and aggression. Who knows? Maybe they’ll wither when the cameras roll. But if they don’t, the second debate could turn out to be a full-blown, WWE-style battle royale. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1. Republican presidential candidates are hoping for the fall of Trump's dominance in the polls as the fundraising deadline approaches. 2. Most candidates have avoided attacking Trump due to the risk of being eviscerated by him, as seen in the August 6th debate. 3. The second debate, taking place at the Reagan presidential library, is expected to be different due to various factors: Trump's continued rise in polls, many voters supporting outsider candidate Ben Carson, and the quarterly fundraising deadline putting pressure on underperforming candidates. 4. With the Oct. 15 reporting deadline, candidates who don't make a significant impact in the upcoming debate may see their funding dry up and potentially end their bid for the presidency. 5. The incentives for the 10 candidates on stage with Trump push them towards confrontation and aggression, potentially leading to a more dramatic second debate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Firstly, he proposed a correction to the length of the year. The mean tropical year is 365.24219 days long. As the average length of a Julian year is 365.25 days, the Julian year is almost 11 minutes longer than the mean tropical year. The discrepancy results in a drift of about three days every 400 years. Lilius's proposal resulted in an average year of 365.2425 days (see Accuracy). At the time of Gregory's reform there had already been a drift of 10 days since the Council of Nicaea, resulting in the vernal equinox falling on 10 or 11 March instead of the ecclesiastically fixed date of 21 March, and if unreformed it would drift further. Lilius proposed that the 10-day drift should be corrected by deleting the Julian leap day on each of its ten occurrences over a period of forty years, thereby providing for a gradual return of the equinox to 21 March. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How much difference does the extra 11 minutes make over 400 years time?","completion":"Let's calculate the difference made by the extra 11 minutes over a period of 400 years. 1. Start by converting the 11 minutes to a fraction of a day. 11 minutes = 11/60 hours = 11/60/24 days ≈ 0.007638888889 days 2. Calculate the difference for 1 year. Difference per year = 365.25 (Julian year) - 365.24219 (mean tropical year) ≈ 0.00781 days 3. Calculate the difference for 400 years. Difference over 400 years = 0.00781 days/year × 400 years ≈ 3.124 days So, the extra 11 minutes results in a drift of approximately 3.124 days over a 400-year period."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 28-year-old IT consultant pledged to run 26.2 miles a day for 26 days -- a total of 681.2 miles -- to raise money and awareness for the Three Square Food Bank of Southern Nevada. \\"My hopes are that people will see and hear about this epic mission and open their eyes a little bit,\\" Black said on day eight of his challenge. \\"Las Vegas isn't all about the sparkling lights and big hotels and casinos. In the shadows and down the alleys that surround the Strip, people are hungry.\\" The mission. Black first came to CNN's attention through longtime iReporter Chris Morrow, who was in Las Vegas and read about his campaign. Black spent Thanksgiving Day on the street. He woke up, went to church and ran all day. After completing his daily marathon, Black came home for a Thanksgiving meal of salad and protein shakes. CNN iReport: 26 marathons in 26 days. He's not complaining. He says he started this challenge to draw attention to impoverished people who go hungry on a daily basis. \\"You drive around any city in the United States, and there's always someone somewhere holding a sign or digging through a garbage can for something to eat,\\" he says. \\"It's great that everyone donates a turkey at Thanksgiving, but this is something bigger than just Thanksgiving.\\" An estimated 16.2% of the Southern Nevada population is considered \\"food insecure,\\" meaning people do not know when or from where their next meal will come. That's above the national average of 14.5% for 2012, according to Feeding America. Nationally, some 17.6 million households are considered \\"food insecure.\\" Matt Muldoon, chief development officer at Three Square Food Bank, says Southern Nevada's continued poverty is due in large part to the \\"triple whammy\\" that occurred in 2008: home foreclosures, bankruptcies and high unemployment. \\"The economic recovery -- if there's any going on in the country -- has really not entrenched itself here,\\" Muldoon says. Though Black has never participated in an official race, he often runs marathon distances. The most he has ever run in one day is 52 miles. When Black pitched his idea, Muldoon knew he could trust Black to complete this challenge to raise money and awareness for the food bank. \\"The first observation I made about Jay was that he was very calm,\\" Muldoon says. \\"And with that calmness was a very big aura of confidence that he could physically accomplish this feat.\\" One step at a time. Each day, Black woke up at 4:15 a.m. He went to the kitchen for an energizing shake, then took a hot shower and got ready to run another 26.2 miles. But it wasn't always easy. Because he wasn't racing, it took Black five to six hours to complete the distance each day. He usually ran outside but often had trouble finding an open road to run on. He also suffered from a shin injury and a stress fracture, but it didn't stop him. \\"I kind of look at my body as an engine,\\" he says. \\"Unless doctors say you can't go any further, then we're going to get to the finish line.\\" When he first told his friends that he would complete 26 marathons in 26 days, they had mixed reactions. \\"Some of my friends said, 'You are nuts. How is your body going to handle it?' And then I told them why I was doing it,\\" he says. \\"They would start off dumbfounded, but they would always walk away inspired.\\" Even though Black was confident, he sometimes worried he might not be able to cross the finish line. If he got seriously injured, there was no other plan than to quit. But all doubts vanished when Black ran along the Las Vegas Strip. \\"We ran into a lot of homeless people downtown, and once you tell them what you're doing, they get a little sparkle in their eye,\\" he says. \\"And they thank you. That's probably one of the most gratifying parts of this whole thing -- knowing that I have an opportunity to tell these people that we haven't forgotten about them.\\" The finish line. Black set out with a mission to raise both financial donations and nonperishable food items for the food bank. Muldoon says he didn't want to peg Black's efforts to a specific dollar amount. In fact, Muldoon hasn't even kept track of the amount of money raised during the challenge. \\"If I am focused on just the dollar amount, then I'm missing the purpose of exactly what he's trying to accomplish here,\\" he says. Black started with a goal of 4,000. He raised a total of 4,024. All of his proceeds will go to the Three Square Food Bank. Because of the food bank's efficiencies, Muldoon says each dollar can be turned into three meals. To commemorate his achievement, the Clark County Board of Commissioners in Nevada declared December 23, 2013, Jayson Black Day. \\"For the first time in my life, I feel truly blessed. It's not really a sense of relief, it's a sense of accomplishment,\\" Black said after finishing. \\"We don't have any specific plans yet, but we'll wrap up 2013 with a big bow and then we'll get a team together and start thinking about next year.\\" Though Black's mission came to an end Monday, he wants people to know they can make a positive contribution in their own communities no matter where they are located. \\"You don't have to run 26 marathons in 26 days to make someone smile,\\" he says. \\"You don't have to do crazy epic stuff. Any one of us can make a difference.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Jayson Black, a 28-year-old IT consultant, decided to take a unique approach to giving back to his community by running 26 marathons in 26 days to raise money and awareness for the Three Square Food Bank of Southern Nevada.

Currently facing extradition proceedings, Radu Nemes and his wife, Diana, have been accused of conspiring with high-ranking officials in the Romanian government in a profitable tax dodge. The Nemes have extensive properties in Yelm – federal investigators now contend they used laundered money to pay for a 3 million log home, and were running a number of shell businesses in Washington. The Nemes were arrested in early March and have been jailed since as federal prosecutors seek to have the couple returned to Romania. Diana Nemes, a 38-year-old currently pregnant with her third child, is fighting to be released from custody. Recently unsealed statements to the court show an FBI-led investigation is ongoing into a money-laundering scheme the Nemes and others are suspected of operating in Western Washington. Neither has been charged publicly with any offenses in the United States. According to court papers, investigators searching the couple’s 53-acre Yelm property discovered a “fully equipped and furnished underground bunker” that could be sealed from the inside. “That bunker could comfortably have housed the entire family for months if not years, given the supply of food found in storage in that structure,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Norman Barbosa said in court papers. FBI agents searching the Nemes home found four pistols and two rifles, including an AR-15-style assault rifle, according to prosecutors’ statements. As non-immigrant visitors, neither Nemes is allowed to possess firearms. Arresting the couple on March 18, FBI agents searched the couple’s Vail Road Southeast property, as well as a neighboring property occupied by two associates. Investigators came to believe the couple had buried boxes of gold “liberty” coins on the properties and returned with ground-penetrating radar. Working with Romanian authorizes, the FBI’s Seattle division began investigating the Nemes in 2012 after it was discovered they were living in Yelm. Anti-corruption officials in Romania contend Radu and Diana Nemes cheated the government out of 68 million in taxes due on nearly 1 million tons of diesel fuel. The couple is alleged to have conspired with high-ranking Romanian finance officials to perpetrate the fraud. Investigators contend the Nemes laundered the proceeds of the scheme through banks in Dubai and the United States before fleeing Romania. They previously created several businesses in Western Washington, purportedly to aid in money laundering. The Nemes are alleged to have spent millions in laundered money on construction equipment, gold and real estate, as well as at least one yacht. Writing the court, Diana Nemes' attorney, Martha Boersch, described the purported scheme as a legitimate tax dispute and claimed the money at issue was earned legally. “Ms. Nemes and her husband operated several companies in Romania that were highly profitable, and were engaged in lawful commercial activities,” Boersch said in court papers. “At most, there appears to be a tax dispute about the amount of excise tax paid on diesel fuel,” the continued. “There is no crime in openly investing the profits of a lawful business in businesses and properties in the United states, and it is insulting for the government to treat the Nemeses as if they were drug dealers who were ‘laundering’ money.” In a recently unsealed search warrant affidavit, though, a Seattle-based FBI special agent said the couple’s finances are “permeated with fraudulent money laundering activity and have been funded primarily, if not exclusively, with the proceeds of their Romanian tax evasion scheme.” The FBI became involved in the investigation in November 2012 after Romanian authorities contacted the bureau’s Bucharest attaché. Romanian investigators suspected the couple was living in Western Washington. Charged in Romania with tax crimes, the couple is alleged to have imported automotive diesel masquerading as industrial fuel. That fuel is taxed at a 4 percent the rate of commercially available diesel. Romanian investigators contend Radu Nemes was helped in the fraud by the nation’s top tax collector and his chief deputy, as well as the head of the Romanian customs department. Nemes is believed to have bribed the men for their assistance. On July 9, 2012, Romanian investigators swept up the organization, executing 70 search warrants and arresting several conspirators. The web of paperwork supporting the operation unraveled as investigators found homeless people at the heads of several shell companies. FBI agents in the United States identified several bank accounts apparently controlled by the Nemes, and learned Radu Nemes and a friend frequently traveled with large amounts of cash. Arriving in the United States in May 2011, Radu Nemes and an associate had more than 41,000 in cash split between the two of them. The day he arrived, Radu Nemes bought a Chevy truck for 31,000; he paid cash for the pickup, handing over a stack of 100 bills. According to the FBI agent’s account, the Nemes passed a 100,000 cashier’s check to the owner of a small South Sound pizza chain. That man tried to cash the check; when his bank refused, he deposited it and slowly withdrew the money over several days. Bank records showed Radu Nemes spent more than 1 million at a Federal Way-based precious metals dealer, buying gold bullion. Investigators believe he bought additional gold from several other coin sellers. “The Nemes are using the proceeds of their crimes held at banks in Dubai to purchase gold in the United States and later convert the gold back to cash,” the FBI agent said in court papers. Writing the court, the FBI agent said the Nemes have been traveling the United States, flying first class and staying at luxury hotels. In just more than a year, they spent more than 235,000 at designer boutiques and withdrew hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash. The Nemes appear to have moved their yacht – the Ramaya – to the Americas from the Mediterranean in late 2012. The 70-foot Azimut yacht was sold months later for 2.3 million. According to search warrant affidavits, the Nemes are suspected of paying 2.8 million in laundered money to the construction firm building a log house on the Yelm property. Business records indicate the Nemes own parts of a commercial property in Thurston County as well as a winery nearby in Rainier. Both are alleged to have been bought with laundered money, which investigators claim also financed a business operated by the mother of one of Radu Nemes’ purported conspirators. The FBI special agent contends the Nemes also used a trust account belonging to a Los Angeles attorney to further clean their dirty money. An attorney with the firm is alleged to have represented herself as an executive with one of Radu Nemes' businesses. All told, they moved more than 3 million through the trust account, which is generally meant to house payments to or from an attorney’s clients. Agents searching the Nemes’ properties seized most of their valuables, including 21 boxes packed with silver coins, more than a dozen cell phones, seven vehicles and a riding lawnmower. Also seized was a large quantity of building materials, including a collection of solar panels apparently for use on the log house. The Nemes remain jailed. Publicly accessible court records don’t show any charges against the 10 men and women living in the United States suspected of assisting them.

The Nemes are wanted in Romania in connection with a 68 million tax evasion scheme, according to the documents. According to Romanian authorities quoted in U.S. court filings, Radu Nemes and his alleged co-conspirators -- including some top Romanian government officials -- allegedly sold nearly a million tons of diesel fuel, but reported that their product was lower-grade industrial and maritime fuel, thereby saving millions in taxes. Radu and Diana Nemes. Interpol Diana Nemes is portrayed in court papers filed in the U.S. as the author of a complex money-laundering operation that funneled the ill-gotten Romanian gains into banks in Dubai and then to the United States after the couple obtained visas and moved here in 2012 -- shortly before charges were filed in their homeland. Their U.S. visas have expired. The defense asked the court to throw out the extradition request, arguing that the Nemes have never been formally charged with a crime in Romania. Essentially, the Nemes' lawyers said, Romania was seeking to have them deported over a tax dispute in another country. Prosecutors countered by arguing that Diana Nemes continued her money-laundering activities after arriving in the U.S. Citing an FBI investigation, they argued in a document opposing her attempts to be released on bail that she and her husband used funds from various accounts in Dubai to \\"purchase real estate, automobiles, at least one yacht, construction equipment, precious metals … and to fund their living expenses.\\" Among their purchases, according to the document, were four properties in Yelm, Wash., about 50 miles south of Seattle, and a two-thirds interest in the Eagleview Hill Winery in Rainier, Wash. The Nemes were building a large log home on one of the sites, according to the document. When FBI agents swept in on March 18 to search the property, they also found \\"a fully equipped and furnished underground bunker,\\" complete with kitchen, living room, bathroom, multiple bedrooms and enough food and supplies for many months. \\"The bunker entrance was controlled by steel doors which could be sealed from the inside and the bunker itself contained multiple diesel generators, solar power processing, a battery back-up system, water filtration and other basic life-support systems,\\" it said. The bunker found when FBI agents served a search warrant on a property owned by Radu and Diana Nemes in Yelm, Wash., had enough food and supplies for several months, plus generators, solar power and water filtration. Department of Justice Authorities also found four pistols and two rifles, including an AR-15-style assault rifle, on the property -- weapons the Nemes were not legally allowed to possess, according to the document. The precious metals included millions of dollars' worth of gold and silver coins purchased from coin dealers in the U.S., the document said. FBI agents interviewed two neighbors who reported that they had helped the Nemes bury some of the gold on their property. They also helped dig it up at a later date so the Nemes could use it for various investments, it said. But when an FBI forensic accountant added up the coins recovered at the Nemes' home and properties with their coin purchases, then subtracted the sales, he found that gold coins worth 2.622 million and silver coins valued at 126,000 could not be accounted for. And searches of the Nemes' properties with ground penetrating radar found no sign of any buried treasure. Prosecutors used the missing coins to argue against Diana Nemes' release from a federal detention facility, saying they increased the likelihood she would flee. They also are seeking forfeiture of the Nemes' U.S. real estate. Follow NBC News Investigations on Twitter and Facebook. In seeking release, Nemes' cited her pregnancy and her role as caretaker for the couple's other two children as special circumstances justifying her release on bail. U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen Strombom ruled against her, finding that she presented a flight risk and had not cleared the special circumstances hurdle. Neil Fox, the Nemes' lawyer in Seattle, declined to comment on the couple's decision to waive extradition. \\"Our position is reflected in our legal filings,\\" he said. |||||","completion":"A Romanian couple, Radu and Diana Nemes, accused of tax fraud in Romania for approximately 68 million, are currently jailed in the US and facing extradition.

Dorothy Jane Roberts (May 8, 1929 - September 5, 1984) was an American author, poet, self-proclaimed psychic, and spirit medium, who claimed to channel an energy personality who called himself \\"Seth.\\" Her publication of the Seth texts, known as the Seth Material, established her as one of the preeminent figures in the world of paranormal phenomena. The Yale University Library Manuscripts and Archives maintains a collection entitled Jane Roberts Papers (MS 1090), which documents the career and personal life of Jane Roberts, including journals, poetry, correspondence, audio and video recordings, and other materials donated after her death by Roberts' husband and other individuals and organizations. Roberts and the Seth Material have attracted critiques from outside the paranormal community. The poet Charles Upton, in his collection of essays titled The System of Antichrist, posited that Roberts multiplied the self due to a fear of death. His opinion was that the Seth texts are based on a misunderstanding of both Christianity and of Eastern religions. Professor of psychology and noted critic of parapsychology James E. Alcock opined, \\"In light of all this, the Seth materials must surely be viewed as less than ordinary. There certainly was the time and talent for fraud to play a role, but we cannot discriminate between that possibility and the possibility of unconscious production--at any rate, given these circumstances, there seems little need to consider the involvement of any supernatural agency.\\" Seth's teaching of a philosophy far more detailed than and not in keeping with traditional Church-authority, God-separate-from Creation, one-mortal-life, Jesus-centered messages has also received its share of criticism from some Christian believers. Various ministries have warned their members about the dangers and deceptions of reading channeled messages from Roberts and others. The Seth Material has been considered in certain circles to be \\"a book entirely written by a demon. A woman simply wrote it down as it was dictated to her by the demon; and, of course, it just destroys everything that is true in terms of God's revelation,\\" and as evidence for \\"Devil possession.\\" Videos such as Jane Roberts' Seth Speaks is Anti-Catholic Hate Books - Allowed By The Media protested that Seth was \\"a demon from hell contacted through a ouija board.\\" Science writer Karen Stollznow has written that much of Roberts work was \\"criticized for being a rip-off of Christian and Eastern philosophy. It comes as no surprise that Seth influenced such authors as Deepak Chopra and Louise Hay.\\" Since Roberts' death, others have claimed to channel Seth. In the introduction to Seth's first dictated book, Seth Speaks, \\"he\\" says, \\"communications will come exclusively through Ruburt [Seth's name for Jane] at all times, to protect the integrity of the material.\\" In The Seth Material, Jane Roberts wrote: \\"Several people have told me that Seth communicated with them through automatic writing, but Seth denies any such contacts.\\" At least one person has claimed more recently to channel Roberts. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: How did they channel Seth?","completion":"The text provided does not directly specify or quote any methods that Dorothy Jane Roberts used to channel Seth. However, it does mention Roberts being a self-proclaimed psychic and spirit medium, terms which generally refer to individuals who claim to communicate with spirits or other non-physical entities. The text also mentions Roberts writing down the content as it was dictated to her and someone protesting that Seth was contacted through a Ouija board. It's worth noting that the Ouija board reference seems to be an allegation rather than a confirmed method. In the broader sense, mediums often use various practices such as meditation, automatic writing, or using a board or other device to facilitate communication, but a specific method used by Roberts isn't explicitly mentioned in the text provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Following up from my recent blog post explaining why dietary supplements offer few benefits for most people, new research has found that people who take a mineral supplement actually consume more minerals from their normal diet than non-supplement users. The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. For someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement ‘just in case’ offers little to no benefit.

Process: - Two birds meet each other - Egg is produced after fertilziation - Mother sits on egg until it hatches - Bird Hatches - Grows up - Flee the next - Starts family - Dies. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less eggs hatch happens, how will it affect LESS birds. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis you propose does have a direct effect on the process. If fewer eggs are hatched, this will result in fewer birds, which will then have a range of consequences on the overall bird population, their ecosystem, and the entire life cycle of these birds. The perturbation that has caused less egg hatching could be due to factors like environmental changes, human intervention, predation, or changes in bird behavior. Let's explore the effects this will have on the different aspects of the avian life cycle and ecosystem. 1. Decreased bird population: If fewer eggs hatch, it will directly result in a decrease in the overall population of birds. This reduction in bird population can lead to potential consequences for the balance of the ecosystem in which these birds are a part of. The reduced number of birds might limit their capacity to control pests and insect populations, pollinate plants, or disperse seeds. 2. Limited genetic diversity: With fewer birds hatching, there will be a smaller pool of bird species available for reproduction. This reduction in genetic diversity could lead to inbreeding and ultimately weaken the genetic strength of the bird population. Inbreeding can result in decreased fertility, increased susceptibility to diseases, and a range of other health problems that could reduce the life expectancy and overall vitality of the bird population. 3. Changes in predator-prey dynamics: Birds often play a vital role in the food chain as predators, prey, or both. If there are fewer birds available, this could cause a shift in the predator-prey dynamics in their ecosystem. Predators that rely on birds as a primary food source may experience a decline in their populations, while prey species that are typically controlled by these birds may witness a surge in their numbers. This disruption in the food chain can have a cascading effect on the entire ecosystem and its inhabitants. 4. Altered social behaviors: Birds often engage in social behaviors such as group-foraging, flocking, and cooperative breeding. A decrease in the bird population could affect these essential social behaviors, as there may not be enough members to form flocks, share responsibilities, or work together to protect their young. 5. Increased competition for resources: A reduced population of birds could lead to intensified competition for available resources such as food, nesting sites, and mates. This increased competition can put further stress on the remaining birds, potentially reducing their survival and reproductive success rates. 6. Potential extinction risk: If fewer eggs continue to hatch, over time, there could be a decline in certain bird populations or even extinction. This loss of species diversity can have a lasting impact on the overall health and balance of an ecosystem. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggesting less egg hatching has a direct effect on the process of the birds' life cycle. This reduction in the bird population can lead to a series of consequences, including decreased population, limited genetic diversity, changes in the food chain dynamics, altered social behaviors, increased competition for resources, and a potential risk of extinction. These effects highlight the importance of understanding and, if necessary, addressing the factors causing the decrease in egg hatching to preserve the balance of these avian ecosystems and their broader environmental and ecological significance."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Bailey shaved Addison's head as a mean prank after Addison fell asleep at the sleepover.

Use this fact to answer the question: A bird is a pollinating animal Which is likely to spread seed? Available choices: i. a car; ii. a sun beam; iii. a whale; iv. a hummingbird; The answer is:","completion":"The correct answer is iv. a hummingbird. As mentioned in the given fact, a bird is a pollinating animal, which means that birds play a significant role in the process of pollination, which is the transfer of pollen from the male reproductive organ (anther) of a plant to the female reproductive organ (stigma) of another plant. This process allows plants to reproduce and produce seeds. Among the available choices, the hummingbird is the only option that falls under the category of birds, and therefore, it is the one most likely to spread seeds. Hummingbirds are known for their unique ability to hover in front of flowers while drinking nectar with their long, specialized beaks and tongues. While doing so, they inadvertently collect pollen on their heads and beaks, and then transfer it to the next flower they visit. This act of pollination is crucial for many plant species, as it directly affects their ability to produce seeds and propagate. i. a car: Cars do not contribute significantly to plant pollination directly. Any seed dispersal resulting from the presence of cars is purely accidental, such as when seeds hitch a ride on the tires or undercarriage. ii. a sunbeam: Sunbeams or sunlight play a vital role in the process of photosynthesis, which enables plants to produce the energy they need for growth and reproduction. While sunlight is crucial to plant health, it does not actively participate in the spreading of seeds or pollination. iii. a whale: Whales are marine mammals and have no direct interaction with plant pollination or seed dispersal. Their primary habitat is the ocean, far from the terrestrial environment where plants engage in pollination and seed dispersal. In summary, the most likely choice to spread seeds among the given options is a hummingbird, as it is a pollinating animal belonging to the bird family and plays a vital role in plant pollination, which directly affects seed production and dispersal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve 54 = 3*h + 60 for h.","completion":"To solve the linear equation 54 = 3*h + 60 for the variable h, follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the equation and identify the variable to solve for. The equation given is 54 = 3*h + 60, and we need to solve for the variable h. Step 2: Isolate the variable. To do this, we'll first try to get rid of any constants on the side of the equation where the variable we're solving for, h, is located. In this case, there is a constant 60 on the right side of the equation. We need to cancel out this constant by performing the opposite operation. Since 60 is being added, we will subtract 60 from both sides of the equation. 54 - 60 = 3*h + 60 - 60 Simplifying this gives: -6 = 3*h Step 3: Solve for the variable h. Now, we have a simpler equation with the variable h on one side: -6 = 3*h To solve for h, we need to perform the opposite operation of what is being done to the variable. In this case, it's multiplication by 3. What we do to one side of the equation, we must do to the other side to maintain the balance of the equation. Divide both sides of the equation by 3: (-6) / 3 = (3*h) / 3 Simplifying this gives: -2 = h Step 4: Write the solution. The solution to the equation 54 = 3*h + 60 is h = -2."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can.

Question: - Babies become infants - Infants become children - Children learn skills - Children become teenagers - Teenagers undergo puberty - Teenagers become adults - Adults have children - Adults become elderly - Elderly humans die. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step in this developmental process is the conception of a human life, which forms the foundation for the entire journey. Conception occurs when a sperm cell from the male successfully fertilizes an egg cell from the female, typically through sexual intercourse or assisted reproductive technology. This event marks the beginning of a new human being, and sets the stage for the various stages and transformations that the individual will go through during their lifetime. At the moment of conception, a single-celled zygote is formed, which contains the genetic information from both parents. Over the next several days, this zygote undergoes rapid cell division and turns into a multicellular embryo. The embryo then continues to grow and develop, eventually forming a fetus. This entire process takes place within the mother's womb, where the developing baby receives nutrients, oxygen, and protection from the mother's body. Throughout the nine months of pregnancy, the fetus matures and prepares for life outside the womb. Organ systems, muscles, and bones develop, as well as essential features like the brain, heart, and lungs. Towards the end of pregnancy, the fetus reaches a level of development where it is capable of sustaining itself independently of the mother's body. The culmination of this pregnancy journey is the birth of the baby. Delivering the baby usually occurs through a natural process called childbirth - which can involve vaginal delivery or a cesarean section. Once the baby is born, it takes its first breath, and life outside the womb officially begins. Now, as a newborn baby, it transitions through the various stages of life that were mentioned in your question. These stages are significantly influenced by the baby's genes, environment, and societal norms: 1. Babies become infants: The baby grows and develops into an infant, acquiring essential skills such as crawling, sitting up, and holding objects. Feeding, sleeping, and cognitive development are crucial during this phase. 2. Infants become children: As they grow, infants transition into early childhood. In this stage, they further develop their motor skills and begin to learn language, social skills, and gain a sense of independence. 3. Children learn skills: During childhood, play, exploration, and interaction with others shape their learning processes. They acquire various abilities such as problem-solving, communication, and creative thinking. 4. Children become teenagers: Adolescence is marked by physical, emotional, and social changes. Puberty brings about body transformations, while teenagers navigate new relationships and increasingly complex societal expectations. 5. Teenagers undergo puberty: Hormonal changes in puberty result in sexual maturation, growth spurts, and emotional development during this stage. 6. Teenagers become adults: Reaching adulthood signifies the assumption of greater responsibility, a growing sense of self, and often the beginning of a career or the pursuit of higher education. 7. Adults have children: Many adults decide to have children, thus continuing the cycle of human life. 8. Adults become elderly: As the aging process continues, adults enter their senior years, which can involve retirement, new hobbies, and adjusting to a more leisurely lifestyle. 9. Elderly humans die: Eventually, the body succumbs to the natural aging process, leading to the end of life. In summary, the first step in the process of human development is conception, which sets the stage for a continuous journey of growth, learning, and transformation that spans the entire course of an individual's life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Promotion is a chess rule that requires a pawn that reaches its eighth rank to be immediately replaced by the player's choice of a queen, knight, rook, or bishop of the same color . The new piece replaces the pawn on the same square, as part of the same move. The choice of new piece is not limited to pieces previously captured , thus promotion can result in a player owning, for example, two or more queens despite starting the game with one. Pawn promotion, or the threat of it, often decides the result in an endgame. Since the queen is the most powerful piece, the vast majority of promotions are to a queen.

This decision has wide-ranging implications, fully empowering workers to take legal action to protect their rights concerning pension, retirement, and healthcare benefits. As the court continues to amplify worker protection and ensure adherence to benefits laws, the dynamics of the employer-employee relationship will shift significantly. Benefits Law Background: Benefits laws, encompassed under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, govern the administration of employee benefit plans, primarily covering private sector workers. ERISA mandates that employers provide clearly stated information about their benefit plans, set minimum standards for the management of benefit plans, and enables employees to recover lost benefits. The Supreme Court Decision: The recent Supreme Court ruling significantly impacts the rights and recourse of employees in relation to benefits laws. In the past, individual employees faced many hurdles when attempting to sue their employers for benefits law violations. Access to the legal system was limited, and workers often found themselves unable to secure their rights and recover lost benefits. However, this latest Supreme Court decision changes the landscape, granting employees the authority to pursue legal action against their employers under benefits laws. This ruling strengthens overall worker protection and demonstrates that the highest court in the United States is committed to ensuring the fair application of benefits laws, no matter the size or influence of the employer. Implications for Employers and Employees: This decision marks a watershed moment in employee rights and will likely create a more balanced employer-employee relationship. For employees, empowerment to use benefits laws as a legal tool means better protection of their interests when it comes to pension, retirement, and healthcare benefits. Furthermore, this change also highlights the importance of understanding one's rights and being proactive in exercising those rights. Employers, on the other hand, must be aware of the changing legal environment and ensure that they comply with all aspects of benefits law. With the specter of potentially expensive litigation looming, employers can no longer afford to be lax about their obligations under benefits law. It is crucial for them to stay informed and conduct their businesses with complete transparency and accountability. Potential Long-term Effects: This Supreme Court decision may also have broader implications for workplace dynamics. As employees become better informed about their rights and feel increasingly confident in utilizing these legal tools, a more balanced and equitable working environment can emerge. Employers will need to stay vigilant and ensure that they maintain legal compliance, promoting workplace cultures that prioritize the rights and well-being of their employees. Moreover, this ruling could stimulate discussions around other labor-related issues, encouraging workers to explore the full extent of their rights under other statutes. By doing so, the ripple effect of this ruling may spread beyond benefits law, pushing employers to review and possibly reform their current employment practices. Conclusion: The Supreme Court's ruling represents a significant victory for employees and their rights under benefits law. By granting access to legal recourse, workers can now hold their employers accountable for non-compliance and demand the benefits to which they are entitled. As the new legal landscape emerges, employers must adapt, ensuring that they meet the mandates of benefits laws and provide fair, transparent workplaces that respect and safeguard employee rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-select problem: How does the next paragraph end? How to know if you have hyperhidrosis Look for abnormal sweating. Sweating is a completely normal process and an important way your body maintains a consistent temperature. However, if you find that you sweat much more often than seems appropriate, you may have hyperhidrosis. Pick your answer from: (1). Elevated blood pressure is the reason a person may have hyperhidrosis. If you notice blood or fluid dribbling down your neck, you may have hyperhidrosis.; (2). Unexplained sweating that continues for too long may indicate hyperhidrosis. Try tapping your fingers on your thighs as though you are trying to touch your sweating glands.; (3). Hyperhidrosis causes sweating in the absence of physical activity or stress. Sweating when your body is not actively trying to regulate your body temperature is the number one symptom of hyperhidrosis.; (4). Fluid build-up can also lead to overactive sweating glands, called hyperhidrosis, which increases your leptin levels. These glands are located along your skin and secrete sweat.;","completion":"To complete this task, I will analyze each answer and choose the one that best completes the paragraph on how to know if you have hyperhidrosis. (1) This answer is incorrect because elevated blood pressure is unrelated to hyperhidrosis. Also, the mention of blood or fluid dribbling down the neck does not fit the context of the paragraph. (2) This answer is also incorrect as it provides an unrelated solution (tapping fingers on thighs) and does not properly address the symptoms of hyperhidrosis. (3) This answer seems appropriate as it directly explains a key symptom of hyperhidrosis – excessive sweating in the absence of physical activity or stress. This choice highlights the primary indicator of the condition and supports the topic of the paragraph. (4) This answer is incorrect because it introduces the concept of fluid build-up and its relation to elevated leptin levels, which is not related to hyperhidrosis. Based on the analysis, the best option to complete the paragraph is answer (3): How to know if you have hyperhidrosis: Look for abnormal sweating.

How does Friday night lights end? Why did Friday Night Lights end? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, these two questions are related but not paraphrases of each other. They address different aspects of the show \\"Friday Night Lights.\\" Let's separately answer each of them. Question 1: How does \\"Friday Night Lights\\" end? \\"Friday Night Lights\\" is a television drama series that aired from 2006 to 2011, based on the 1990 non-fiction book by H. G. Bissinger and the 2004 film adaptation. The series revolves around the ups and downs of the Dillon Panthers, a high school football team in the fictional town of Dillon, Texas. The show is centered around head coach Eric Taylor, his wife Tami Taylor, their daughter Julie Taylor, and various members of the football team and the community. In the series finale, aptly titled \\"Always,\\" several storylines are wrapped up: 1. Coach Eric Taylor and Tami Taylor: After Tami receives a job offer to be the Dean of Admissions at a prestigious college in Philadelphia, Coach Taylor decides to prioritize her career and agree to move with her, thus resigning from his coaching position in Dillon. 2. Football game and the championship: The finale features the Lions playing against another Texas team in the state championship game. After an intense back-and-forth match, the Lions win the championship at the very last moment by scoring a game-winning touchdown. 3. Reconciliation: Several characters reconcile or find closure in their relationships. Matt Saracen proposes to Julie Taylor, and her parents, Eric and Tami, eventually give them their blessings. Tyra Collette and Tim Riggins rekindle their on-and-off-again relationship. Landry Clarke, who is not present in the finale, is mentioned to be attending college in California. 4. Tim Riggins: After being released from prison early, Tim has a difficult time finding his footing in his hometown. In the finale, he finally decides to start building his dream house on a piece of land he bought with his brother, Billy Riggins. This signifies their fresh start and hope for a better future. In the last scene, viewers see Coach Taylor coaching his new team in Philadelphia, while Tami watches from the stands, signifying that life goes on, and they continue to support each other. Question 2: Why did \\"Friday Night Lights\\" end? \\"Friday Night Lights\\" concluded after five seasons, as the show dealt with low ratings throughout its run. Despite being critically acclaimed and having a dedicated fan base, the series never managed to achieve high viewership numbers. The show was on the brink of cancellation after its second season, but NBC negotiated a deal with DirecTV's The 101 Network for a three-season renewal, which saw the show air on The 101 Network first before airing on NBC. The decision to end the series was a mutual one between the creators and the networks involved in producing and airing the show. During its final season, the producers and writers were given ample time to wrap up storylines and bring the series to a satisfying conclusion for its fans."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Option A: 1000 Option B: 1200 Option C: 1250 Option D: 3000 Option E: 5120 A:","completion":"The task is asking to calculate the population of a city after 2 years if it decreases annually (every year) at the rate of 20% p.a (per annum). Guidelines provided are: 1. Initial population of the city: 8000 2. Annual rate of decrease: 20% p.a Using these guidelines, here is how you calculate the answer: Step 1: Understand what a decrease of 20% means. It means that each year, the population is reduced to 80% of its size at the start of the year (since 100% - 20% = 80%). Step 2: Calculate the population after the first year. To do this, we multiply the initial population by 80% (or 0.80 in decimal form). So, after the first year, the population would be: 8000 * 0.80 = 6400. Step 3: Calculate the population after the second year. We apply the same rate of decrease to the population at the end of the first year, so 6400 * 0.80 = 5120. So, the population after 2 years would be 5120. This corresponds to Option E.

Instead , they fear the conference is an attempt by corporate farming and biotech interests to push into new markets . Are the two sentences saying the same thing?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences are conveying the same fundamental idea. Let's break down both sentences to compare and contrast them better: 1. \\"Activists say they fear the gathering is an attempt by corporate farming to push bio-engineered crops on starving countries.\\" 2. \\"Instead, they fear the conference is an attempt by corporate farming and biotech interests to push into new markets.\\" Both sentences talk about activists expressing fear towards either a 'gathering' or a 'conference.' In each case, it's described as an attempt by corporate farming. The first sentence mentions 'bio-engineered crops,' and the second sentence refers to 'biotech interests,' both of which point towards genetically manipulated catch crop production. The first sentence specifies that such crops are being pushed onto 'starving countries.' By contrast, the second sentence refers to pushing into 'new markets.' Depending on the context, 'new markets' may well refer to these 'starving countries' looking for new solutions to address hunger, therefore implying the same point. In conclusion, although the wording is slightly different, the major points—activists' fears, the involvement of corporate farming, and the push of bio-engineered/biotech products—are essentially similar in both sentences.

Step 1: Emily tries to recall the incident to gauge how much she should reveal. Emily thought back to the day when she had accidentally hit the cat while riding her bike through the park. Although it was an accident, she feared that Tanya, being a known animal lover, would never forgive her. Step 2: Emily decides to partially conceal the truth. Emily knew she had to tread carefully if she wanted to maintain her friendship with Tanya and avoid getting into trouble. She decided to partially conceal the truth and told Tanya that she had only found the dead cat lying on the ground while she was passing by. Step 3: Emily fabricates additional details to make the story more believable. To make her story more believable, Emily added details about how she had seen a fast-moving car speeding through the park just before she discovered the cat's body. She hoped this would help convince Tanya that the cat had been hit by a careless driver and not her. Step 4: Emily tries to gauge Tanya's reaction to her response. As Emily was finishing her fabricated story, she carefully observed Tanya's facial expressions and body language to see if she was buying the story or showing any signs of suspicion. She knew she might need to provide more information or change her story if Tanya seemed skeptical. Step 5: Emily attempts to change the subject. Once Emily finished her story, she was quick to change the subject, asking Tanya about her weekend plans and suggesting that they should hang out together. She hoped this would divert Tanya's attention away from the dead cat and protect their friendship. Throughout this process, Emily carefully navigated the conversation.

This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules. If they left their space ship and did not use their electronics, they would not be able to hear each other. Next time you watch a science fiction movie, think about this factoid. When spaceships are destroyed by hostile alien beings, there would be no sound heard. Sound waves can travel through many kinds of matter.

The exultant anticipatory buzz preceding the premiere of NBC 's \\"Smash\\" has grown so intense that the conversation is no longer about whether it's any good (\\"Good? Darling, it's!\\") or if it will be a hit for a network that needs one. Instead, everyone's wondering why no one thought of doing this kind of show before.\\"This kind of show\\" being a spare-no-expense showcase chronicling the gestational stages of a Broadway musical. Chorus boys! Dueling divas! Post-audition meltdowns!I'll tell you why: Because it's extremely difficult to do.The wonder of \\"Smash\\" is not that it's a grown-up \\"Glee\\" (it isn't) or that it stars \\"American Idol\\" runner-up Katharine McPhee (bringing the modern evolution of musical television full circle) or that the show-within-the-show — \\"Marilyn: The Musical\\" — seems prepped and ready for a real Broadway run.It's that creator Theresa Rebeck and her team have managed to capture the grand and sweeping gesture that is musical theater and inject it with the immediate intimacy of television.Or maybe it's the other way around. Either way, no one's ever done it before. At least not recently.Theater and television may tell similar stories, but they do it very differently. The stage is big; the TV screen is small. Onstage, actors play to the front row and the balcony; on television, actors play to the camera, often mere inches away. Theater is at once more bombastic than television and more minimalist — a bare platform can be a balcony, a car, a bedroom.The creators of \\"Smash\\" honor both genres, and what easily could have lurched across the screen like some dramatic-arts Frankenstein is instead as supple as a showgirl. Without benefit of voice-over, green-screen or any other narrative crutch, \\"Smash\\" moves effortlessly between the broad strokes of the musical — \\"Hey, I've got an idea for a show, and (pause, jot-jot, plink, plink) here's the first number!\\") — and the more personal demands of TV, giving the characters just as much attention as the choreography.Embodying this embrace of two worlds are the women competing for the big part in \\"Smash.\\" Megan Hilty, who plays longtime trouper Ivy, is a real Broadway star, and you can tell the moment she shows up. With her enormous eyes, big singer's mouth and delightful curves, Hilty has much more oomph than most women on television are generally allowed. By contrast, McPhee's Karen is decidedly waifish in her charms, a fact wisely acknowledged by the characters trying to decide between them as they cast the starring role in \\"Marilyn: The Musical.\\"\\"Marilyn\\" is a new play emerging, even as the show progresses, from the pad and piano of Julia Houston ( Debra Messing ) and Tom Levitt (Christian Borle), longtime collaborators who love each other in the way only straight women and gay men can love in a show like this one.Although Julia has promised her (loving, dull) husband Frank (Brian d'Arcy James) that she is going to take time off from being part of \\"Broadway's hottest team\\" to adopt a baby daughter, the mere mention of Monroe as a musical subject is far too tantalizing. Before you can say \\"Joltin' Joe,\\" she and Tom are cranking out a number and catching the attention of Big Time Producer Eileen ( Anjelica Huston ). Whose ugly divorce proceedings have frozen all her assets including, wouldn't you know it, a new production of \\"My Fair Lady.\\" Which frees up the lascivious but super-talented director Derek Wills ( Jack Davenport ). Whom Eileen snags and offers to Julia and Tom, waving away their but-we-only-have-one-number bewilderment even as she pencils in the out-of-town opening.It's all totally absurd, of course, but in a breathlessly wide-eyed and knowing way that is terrific fun to watch. And for every bit of bizarre business (are Julia and Frank the only people on the planet who do not know it takes a long time to adopt a baby from China?) there are seven or eight real-life details (\\"We are not the chorus, we are the ensemble\\") to keep things from floating too high into the rafters.The return of Messing to network television doesn't hurt either. Swathed in Creative Type scarves, colorful Tina-Fey specs and that signature hair, her Julia is both endearing and irritating. As are most of the characters, each a promising balance of one thing and another — in early episodes Hilty's Ivy especially vacillates between ego and insecurity in a most convincing and moving way.Not that \\"Smash\\" is to be confused with a moody character study or a biting backstage satire. This is one big unapologetic feather-headress-waving, sequined derriere-twitching, high-note-holding love song to the siren call of song, dance and the theatrical life.But if there is no adversity, there can be no triumph. And \\"Smash\\" is a triumph. ||||| NBC’s musical-about-a-musical, Smash, debuts next Monday, but after the massive promotional blitz, you’d be excused for feeling like you’ve already seen the entire 15-episode season. (The pilot has been available for streaming and download for a few weeks now.) NBC has high hopes for the show–I’ll be surprised if it doesn’t do huge ratings, at least at first–and it’s already collected a lot of bouquets. My review (subscription required) is in the current TIME, and while there was a lot I liked in the first four episodes of Smash, let’s call it a dissenting opinion. (There’s some plot detail in the review, but not nearly as much spoilage as NBC has put in its own promos): Right up front, NBC’s Smash gives you a reason to feel good about yourself for watching. Broadway lyricist Julia (Debra Messing) bemoans the current crop of musicals to her songwriting partner Tom (Christian Borle): “Revivals and movies–why doesn’t anyone do new musicals anymore?” she asks. Smash is the TV musical about the making of just such a show: the life story of Marilyn Monroe. And there you are, watching it! You get it! You’re not part of the problem! Julia’s complaint reads as a kind of manifesto for Smash (NBC, Mondays, 10 p.m. E.T.). American Idol, NBC’s The Voice and, of course, Glee all piggyback on the power of existing pop hits. With its original music and urbane characters, Smash feels like an attempt to do Glee for adults: age-appropriate escapism. It’s classy, not campy. (Instead of kids throwing slushies, Oscar winner Anjelica Huston throws martinis.) It’s got a creative team with pedigrees to overfill a marquee: Steven Spielberg produces with theater vets Craig Zadan and Neil Meron; playwright Theresa Rebeck created and writes it; Tony winners Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman (Hairspray) do the music. It’s polished, professional and reverent of Broadway–sometimes to a fault… There are so many layers of meta in Smash that you need to review it on a few levels. As a business enterprise, it’s risky: it’s expensive, it’s a tricky genre for TV and it required sketching out a series about a musical and the musical itself (which supposedly could be produced on Broadway itself someday), with several highly produced songs an episode, including one original song per outing. As a musical, it’s polished but not really original: the Marilyn musical is straight-up old-school Broadway, while–for all the “It’s not Glee!” buzz–the series is still a jukebox musical, right down to Glee standbys like the heavily-promoted cover of “Beautiful.” (There’s also a dance number to “Rumour Has It.” Glee would never do that!) And as an actual network drama–for me, the most important test–it relies too much on conventional showbiz plotlines and characters for me to get invested in it. Having said that, you might disagree, because a lot of my colleagues do: for instance, Jace Lacob, the TV critic for The Daily Beast and Newsweek, likens Smash to a West Wing for Broadway. It’s a fruitful comparison, but for good and bad reasons. Like The West Wing, Smash is a high-gloss, high-minded attempt to bring viewers behind the scenes of a rarefied world, and it tries to engage that world on its own terms. There’s also the vague sense that there’s something high-minded and ennobling about the show’s very existence. But also like The West Wing, it tends to idealize its subject, sometimes at the expense of the realism of its characters, who could use a few more dings and nicks. I feel like Smash wants to do the kind of cable-show-on-network storytelling of a show like The Good Wife, but where The Good Wife complicates its characters and shades them morally, Smash deals much more in recognizable stereotypes: the Iowa ingenue, the sexy starlet, the sleazy director and so on. Smash is about sophisticated people, yes, but that doesn’t mean it’s actually doing sophisticated storytelling. Which may be one reason that–much like with The West Wing–I find a lot to admire in Smash, but I don’t actually love it, on a gut level, as much as a lot of other critics I usually agree with (Lacob, Tim Goodman and Mo Ryan among them). Another useful Sorkin comparison here, though, is to Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, which had some of the same Sorkin trademarks but the additional challenge of putting on a show-within-a-show. What we see of Marilyn: The Musical is definitely better than the sketch comedy on Studio 60; “Let Me Be Your Star,” the emotional closer of the pilot episode, is literally and figuratively a show-stopper. But other glimpses of the production don’t seem nearly as good as the characters keep telling us they are. A duet between Marilyn and Joe DiMaggio literally had me unintentionally laughing, and songs like “The National Pastime” will depend on your taste for elbow-through-the-ribs double entendre. What concerns me most, though, is the way the show characterizes Marilyn: partly a made-for-TV-biopic “lonely girl looking for love” narrative, partly a hammy, boop-boop-be-doop sexpot performance that makes her into a character from one of her movies. (One lyric: “Here’s a lesson they should teach in school / When a girl gets curvy and the boys all drool / If math and science just ain’t your style / Just give that teacher a wink and a smile / For a passing grade you won’t have to wait / And you can thank him later when you graduate!” Ewww.) Now, the musical-within-a-musical is much less important than the drama itself. But these issues sort of represent my issues with Smash itself: for all the talk of its ambition, it was pretty much exactly what I’d expect a middlebrow, adult-oriented NBC show about Broadway to look like, just as Marilyn: The Musical looks just like what I’d expect a mainstream Broadway bio-musical to look like. Some of this is probably a matter of personal taste: Marilyn is not the kind of musical I’d go out of my way to see, but you probably can’t make a network hit out of Sondheim and The Book of Mormon is cable material. I’m harping a lot on the show’s negatives here, but that’s partly because I think Smash is being sold as something more groundbreaking and brilliant than it actually is so far. (Flame me, but I would argue that Glee at its best—however unreliably its best manages to show up these days—is more ambitious and original, lack of original music notwithstanding. Where you come down on the two shows probably depends partly on how important consistency is to you; I’ll take occasional brilliance over reliable competence any day.) But I’m a sucker for a TV musical–I wouldn’t have stuck it out with Glee otherwise–and if Smash actually became a kind of singing Good Wife, with writing that matched its technical slickness, I’d watch gladly. For now, I’m keeping an eye on it from the cheap seats. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"NBC's \\"Smash\\" is a unique and ambitious television series that combines the grand gestures of musical theater with the immediate intimacy of television.

She has been announced as the richest woman of the world by BRW (formerly Business Review Weekly) in May 2012. Let's read more about her life and journey to the top. Georgina \\"Gina\\" Hope Rinehart was born on 9th February, 1954 in Perth, Western Australia, to Hope Margaret Nicholas and Lang Hancock, the mining king. Her father discovered one of the world's biggest reserves in the early 1950s. Gina gained lots of knowledge of the iron-ore industry while working with her father. She married an Englishman Greg Milton, at the age of 19 and together they had two children, John Langley and Bianca Hope. Soon the marriage broke off and she remarried in 1983. Frank Rinehart and Gina had two children: Ginia and Hope. Frank died in 1990. Since then, Gina has devoted herself to her work and empire. She was the sole heir of her family's wealth. Then after her father died in 1992, she started her professional career as the Executive Chairman of Hancock Prospecting Pty Limited (HPPL) and other privately owned group of companies. At that time, the company centered its functioning to mining-related explorations and accumulation of vast mining leases . From there, Rinehart worked her way towards transforming the leases into profit earning mines. She also worked together with other companies to raise capital. Her efforts made the business increase three times in 2011 as much as before. At home, Rinehart was working to expand the family business, but she did not satisfy herself with it. In 2010, she stepped into the media industry by acquiring 10% stake in Ten Network Holdings. Afterwards, she went on to hold stake in Fairfax Media, proving that mining is not her only interest.

You'll need whole milk, a spray bottle, and a way to heat the milk. You start by boiling milk to release preservatives. Then, you'll cool the milk before applying to hair. By leaving this treatment on for thirty minutes once a week, you'll see significant improvement in the overall condition and manageability of your hair. If you have wavy hair, using a milk treatment may completely straighten it. For tighter curls, the milk provides a more relaxed wave, and improves the effect of other straightening methods. Boil milk and pour into a spray bottle. Then, place the spray bottle in the refrigerator to cool. Section damp hair and spray milk evenly covering every strand, and comb through hair. Let the milk sit on hair for half an hour to 45 minutes. Then, wash and condition hair. These two ingredients are added to numerous products to improve shine, clean oil and buildup from the scalp naturally, and help hair retain moisture. A simple at-home treatment that combines the two will turn kinky, frizzy curls into sleek, manageable tresses. Start with enough coconut milk to completely coat your hair. Overestimate to make sure you have enough. Mix the fruit of one lemon into the coconut milk. Let the mixture cool in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. Starting with damp or dry hair, coat thoroughly and leave in for about an hour. Then, wash and condition as usual. Lemon juice can also lighten your hair, so this may not be an ideal treatment, if you are trying to maintain your dye color. Castor oil is a great natural treatment for a number of health and beauty concerns. From dry skin to upset stomach, castor oil does it all. It's also a simple way to relax curls. Castor oil seeps into hair follicles and naturally reduces kinks and curls, leaving hair sleeker and straighter. Apply castor oil to damp or dry hair, and wrap hair in a towel. Use pins or clips to hold the towel in place. Leave on at least an hour, but let the product sit over night for best results.

Fulham's tactical changes: As the first half of the match concluded without any goals on the scoreboard, Fulham's management decided to reassess their game strategy. Their tactical changes proved to be the turning point of the match. The introduction of fresh legs from the bench brought up the much-needed energy and creativity that had seemed to diminish in the first half.

Richard misses his wife Anna greatly; he literally counts the days since he's seen her and tells Karl about her and their home in detail. When he decides to escape, Karl comes with him. While crossing a desert Richard collapses. He asks Karl to go on without him, but Karl refuses to leave his friend and carries him. But when Karl leaves to get water, Richard is recaptured and sent to work in a lead mine. Karl makes it back to Hamburg, where he meets Anna and occupies a spare room in her flat.

So, only two Popes were involved this year. - In 1999-2000, John Paul II was the only Pope. Step 2: Review the remaining Popes in the 20th Century and identify years where the papacy changed hands. Popes during 20th Century: 1. Pius X: 1903-1914 2. Benedict XV: 1914-1922 3. Pius XI: 1922-1939 4. Pius XII: 1939-1958 5. John XXIII: 1958-1963 6. Paul VI: 1963-1978 7. John Paul I: 1978 8.

The film opens in East Berlin in 1984 with a sequence that alternates scenes from an interrogation with scenes from a training class for aspiring officers of the Stasi, or secret police. Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), code name HGW XX/7, is demonstrating his interrogation technique using audio of his own interrogation of a suspect. Wiesler instructs the students on how to tell whether a subject is lying. A student asks a question that Wiesler judges to be a bit too compassionate (read \\"bourgeois\\"), and the professor marks the student's name on the attendance record: surely this student has just flunked the course, or worse. During the feature's first thirty minutes, writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck draws a portrait of Wiesler that borders on caricature: Wiesler is a highly skilled officer of the Stasi, a proud, zealous, disciplined and entirely cold-blooded professional. He is one of the many cogs in the wheel of \\"the System,\\" working anonymously and tirelessly, convinced that his efforts are building a better Socialist society.At the end of the class, Lieutenant-Colonel Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), Wiesler's old school friend (and probably his only friend), who has risen to the position of head of the Culture Department at Stasi, comes to invite Wiesler to a theatrical premiere. The play is by the celebrated East German playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), and its leading character is played by Dreyman's lover, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), an actress of great reputation. Dreyman, who writes plays about the heroic proletariat, lives a rather comfortable life in a plush East Berlin apartment, enjoying a certain notoriety among DDR officials who value him because he's one of the few East German writers whose work is read in the west. He preserves the respect of the artistic community by using his (relatively) secure position for occasional interventions in favor of dissident fellow artists....

Step 1: Analyze the options - Lakes are bodies of fresh water, which doesn't necessarily lead a crab to the ocean. - Shallow waters may be part of the ocean, but it doesn't specify a location the crab has to cross in order to reach the ocean. - Tidepools can be found on rocky shores and are pockets of seawater, but they are already part of the ocean environment. - The Atlantic Ocean is one specific ocean, but the question does not specify that the crab is trying to reach the Atlantic Ocean specifically. The ocean also includes other large bodies of water like the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean.

Wood will have flaws like scratches and dents. Whether marks have come from the machines at the mills, or it has become scratched or gouged during handling, or from wear and tear. Hypothesis: The machines at the wood mills cost about 15000.","completion":"Based on the given context, we cannot accurately draw the hypothesis that the machines at the wood mills cost about 15000. The information provided focuses on finishing wood, and the factors that may cause wood flaws, like scratches and dents in the wood. There is no mention of costs associated with the machinery used at wood mills. To formulate an appropriate hypothesis from the given context, we could instead consider hypotheses related to the consequences of these flaws on the wood or the effectiveness of sanding to improve the wood's appearance. Here are a couple of examples: 1. Hypothesis: Proper sanding techniques can restore the appearance of wood that has been scratched or gouged during the milling process or from wear and tear. This hypothesis is relevant to the context, as it suggests that sanding can help improve the condition of flawed wood. Further research or experiments could be conducted to evaluate the validity of this hypothesis. 2. Hypothesis: The quality of wood sourced from mills may be impacted by machine-induced flaws, resulting in a higher demand for proper wood finishing techniques. This hypothesis is directly related to the context, as it discusses the presence of machine-induced flaws in wood sourced from mills. This could also be investigated further to determine whether the demand for wood finishing techniques is indeed higher in mills where machine-induced flaws frequently occur. In conclusion, it is essential to draw a hypothesis that relates directly to the context provided. In this case, the cost of machinery at wood mills is not mentioned or relevant to the context of finishing wood, so the suggested hypothesis is not appropriate. Instead, hypotheses that explore the effectiveness of sanding or the impact of machine-induced flaws on wood quality would be more fitting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Statements made by teenager Philip Chism confessing to the 2013 murder of his 24-year-old teacher Colleen Ritzer in Danvers were ruled ineligible in court Tuesday by an Essex County Superior Court judge. Judge David Lowy said that Chism did not waive his Miranda rights “beyond a reasonable doubt” when speaking to Danvers police October 23, 2013, just hours after the murder, and thus his statements would not be allowed in court. Chism, who is being charged as an adult, has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder and aggravated rape. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below In the written decision, Lowy said police did not adequately inform Chism of his Miranda rights, despite the then-14-year-old’s reluctance to answer questions and his mother twice asking for an attorney. However, since the confession was made voluntarily, the statements will be available to prosecutors, if Chism testifies, to discredit his testimony. Lowy did deny Chism’s request to suppress evidence, including a blood-stained boxcutter that was taken from his backpack at the Topsfield police station. Defense lawyers had argued that it was an unconstitutional seizure, but Lowy said that the items would inevitably have been recovered by police with constitutional justification upon further questioning. Police say Chism raped and murdered Ritzer, his math teacher, in a Danvers High School bathroom, put her body in a recycling bin, and dumped her body in the woods off a cross-country trail. Topsfield police picked him up walking along Route 1 the night after the murder. In June 2014, Chism allegedly choked and beat a female employee at the Department of Youth Services facility in Boston where he was being held. According to reports, Chism followed the worker into a bathroom, armed with a pencil, and attacked her until other employees were able to restrain him. ||||| (Published Tuesday, March 3, 2015) A judge on Tuesday granted a defense motion suppressing some of the evidence in the case of a Massachusetts teenager charged with raping and killing his high school math teacher in 2013. Among that evidence is an alleged confession Philip Chism gave to Danvers Police after the killing, as well as certain cell phone evidence police had gathered as a result of that interview. Additional motions seeking to suppress statements made to Topsfield Police as well as evidence seized at Danvers High School and from Chism's pockets and backpack were denied by the judge. Chism, now 16, is charged with murder as an adult in the October 2013 slaying of Danvers High School teacher Colleen Ritzer. Chism was 14 at the time. Superior Court Judge David Lowy said in his ruling that the videotape of the Danvers interview makes it \\"readily apparent\\" that Chism's mother wanted an attorney present with her son during questioning. \\"Despite this desire, the officers persisted in initiating a conversation and reminded her of a previous desire to find out what happened that night,\\" Lowy said in his ruling. The judge said he isn't convinced beyond a resonable doubt that Chism was paying attention to the Miranda warnings to the extent that he could have waived his Miranda rights. While Chism's statements were made voluntarily, Lowy said they must be suppressed because she cannot find beyond a reasonable doubt that Chism \\"knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights.\\" Lowy also ruled that Chism's cell phone and the victim's cell phone, which were found by police outside Hollywood Hits, should not be allowed at trial because they were discovered as a result of the police interview with Chism conducted at the Danvers police station. \\"The police were only made aware of the location of the cell phones from their interview of the defendant,\\" the judge wrote. \\"Since the defendant's statements during the interview at the Danvers interview must be suppressed and the Commonwealth has not argued an alternative theory of admissibility, the cell phones must be suppressed.\\" The family of Ritzer released a statement Tuesday afternoon saying in part, \\"We respect the court ruling and we are confident that law enforcement acted responsibly and lawfully. We are also confident in the ability of the District Attorney's Office to successfully prosecute the individual charged with this horrific crime so that justice is served for Colleen and our family.\\" Necn legal analyst Randy Chapman says tossing some evidence won't make or break the case. “There’s still substantial evidence about his culpability. They have videotape, they have him in possession of the murder weapon,” Chapman explained. “It’s not going to result in the case being crippled.\\" ||||| FILE - In this Jan. 9, 2015, file photo, Philip Chism sits in Salem Superior Court, in Salem, Mass., during a hearing.

(Associated Press) FILE - In this Jan. 9, 2015, file photo, Philip Chism sits in Salem Superior Court, in Salem, Mass., during a hearing. A Massachusetts judge has ruled that Chism's confession to police that he killed... (Associated Press) BOSTON (AP) — A Massachusetts teenager's confession to police that he killed his math teacher cannot be used in his murder trial, a judge ruled Tuesday even as he allowed a bloody box cutter and other key pieces of evidence to be admitted. The ruling came in the case of 16-year-old Philip Chism, who has pleaded not guilty to raping and killing 24-year-old Danvers High School teacher Colleen Ritzer on school grounds in October 2013. Chism's lawyers had argued that police coerced their client, then 14, into making detailed statements about the killing, despite invoking his right to remain silent. Prosecutors maintained Chism and his mother had never absolutely demanded a lawyer. Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett, through a spokeswoman, said his office was still reviewing the decision. Calls to Chism's public defenders seeking comment were not immediately returned. Ritzer's family said in a statement it respected the court ruling and was confident that law enforcement \\"acted responsibly and lawfully\\" in investigating their daughter's killing. The 48-page decision came after days of arguments and testimony on the defense's motion to suppress key pieces of evidence in the case. Salem Superior Court Judge David Lowy concluded that Chism had willingly talked to police in the town of Topsfield on the night of the killing, calmly answering questions and even correcting officers at various points. But Chism's demeanor changed when he was taken to the Danvers police station and further interrogated in his mother's presence, the judge noted. At that point, Lowy said, Chism grew uncomfortable and somewhat hostile. He twice indicated his disinterest in speaking with Danvers police and \\"did not appear to be fully engaged\\" or to appreciate the seriousness of what officers asked him as they explained his Miranda rights, the judge wrote. \\"It is clear that the defendant wanted to talk to the police without his mother present in the room,\\" Lowy said in his ruling. \\"It is also clear that he had no intention of talking while his mother was in the room.\\" As a result, the judge said, he would allow the statements Chism made to Topsfield police to be introduced as evidence but not his taped confession at the Danvers police station. He also allowed items gathered at Danvers High School, as well as those seized from Chism's pockets and backpack. They included Ritzer's ID and credit cards, a bloody box cutter and women's underwear. But Lowy ruled prosecutors cannot use evidence from Chism's and Ritzer's cellphones, which were found near a movie complex. Authorities say surveillance video from Oct. 22, 2013, shows Chism following Ritzer into a school bathroom, wearing gloves and a hood, then later walking out of the bathroom alone. A short time later, the video shows Chism pulling a recycling barrel through the school and outside. Ritzer's body was later found in nearby woods, naked from the waist down and with her throat slit and a note that read, \\"I hate you all.\\" Authorities said she was sexually assaulted with a stick. A bloody recycling bin was found nearby. Chism, who had recently moved to Massachusetts from Clarksville, Tennessee, was found that night by Topsfield police walking along a nearby highway. Prosecutors allege that after the killing, Chism used Ritzer's credit card to buy fast food and attend a movie at the mall. Chism's trial is scheduled for Oct. 7. Both sides are expected back in court for a pre-trial hearing on April 9. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"In 2013, teenager Philip Chism confessed to the murder of his 24-year-old teacher Colleen Ritzer in Danvers.

A group of middle school students is measuring the temperature of various liquids for a chemistry lab using a mercury thermometer. They have a beaker of boiling water, a beaker of ice water, and a beaker of water at room temperature. If the students move the thermometer from one beaker to another and the mercury levels rise, is the temperature higher or lower? Hint: A thermometer is a device used to measure temperature. It is placed in contact with an object and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the object (they will have the same temperature). The operation of a thermometer is based on some property, such as volume, that varies with temperature. The most common thermometers contain liquid mercury, or some other liquid, inside a sealed glass tube. The liquid expands and contracts faster than the glass tube. Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube. The positions of the liquid in the tube can then be calibrated for accurate temperature readings. Other properties that change with temperature can also be used to make thermometers; liquid crystal colors and electrical conductivity change with temperature, and are also relatively common thermometers. The answer to this question is:","completion":"When the students move the thermometer from one beaker to another and the mercury levels rise, the temperature of the liquid in the new beaker is higher. This is because the mercury inside the thermometer expands and rises in the glass tube as the temperature increases. The thermometer is calibrated based on the positions of the liquid in the tube, allowing for accurate temperature readings. So, if the mercury levels rise when placed in a new beaker, it indicates that the new beaker's liquid has a higher temperature compared to the previous one."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Write some highlights for the following article: Glasgow's emphatic support for Scotland's unsuccessful independence movement may have had a detrimental impact on tourism there, at least in the short term. As interest from potential visitors significantly rose in the country's other major cities following the surprisingly comfortable referendum margin in favour of pro-union voters, the same cannot be said for Scotland's most populous city which was strongly in favour of leaving the United Kingdom. Travel interest for Inverness, Edinburgh and Aberdeen increased markedly on Friday compared to the previous Friday, when Scotland's future remained uncertain and polls predicted a tight vote. Scroll down for video. Renewed interest: After overall interest in Scotland dropped, cities such as Inverness are popular again. Searches on travel site Trivago for for accommodation in the next two months have risen by 33 per cent for Inverness, 27 per cent for Edinburgh and 10 per cent for Aberdeen since last week. Conversely, site searches for accommodation in Glasgow increased by just two per cent from the Friday before. 'This is hardly surprising considering the strength of the \\"yes\\" vote there,' said Trivago's Denise Bartlett. 'Perhaps it will take a little longer for travellers to feel comfortable visiting Glasgow again.' In the week leading up to the vote interest on the site for Scotland as a tourist destination had plummeted by 29 per cent year-on-year as travellers awaited the outcome of the referendum. 'This definitely indicates an increase in travel interest from the rest of the UK to Scotland,' Bartlett said. 'Hopefully this indicates a return to normality for Scottish tourism, as it would be a shame for the country to suffer and unfortunate for visitors to miss out on everything Scotland has to offer.' High on the hill: Searches for Edinburgh have risen 27 per cent on the website Trivago last week. On the up: Castlegate in the city centre of Aberdeen, for which accommodation searches have risen 10%. Before the referendum there were reports of visitors from outside Scotland cancelling holidays due to the perception of anti-English feeling in the country. But when asked if the 'no' vote would have any impact, positive or negative, on visitors choosing to go to Scotland from south of the border VisitScotland's spokeswoman gave a simple: 'No'. 'We are not aware of cancellations - people come to Scotland because of the friendly people, the landscapes, cities and amazing events and will continue to do so,' the spokeswoman said.

You could constantly nag at him about doing chores, criticize his clothing, break plans with him continuously, or even cheat on him so that he will end things with you. Then, you won’t have to do it. However, that technique will make you dislike yourself and harm him, too. Your partner might not understand what you’re doing. If you’ve acted consistently and kindly, but change your behavior overnight, he might not take the hint. He may even worry that something is going on with you. You might cause this good person to doubt his self-worth. Why do something like that? It might be uncomfortable, but just tell him the truth. You’re not doing yourself any favors by remaining in a relationship just to avoid hurting someone’s feelings. If the nice guy and you don’t have complimentary personalities or dreams, let him go or else you will become stressed. Stress heightens your cortisol levels, which can make you gain weight. Most women dislike gaining weight, and getting into a new relationship won't be fun or easy if you don't like how you look. Heightened cortisol can throw your immune system, your digestive system, and even your reproductive organs out of wack. Keep that stress in check--don't procrastinate having this conversation! Most people dread breaking up with someone and may choose to procrastinate or simply stop interacting with that person altogether. Leaving your significant other in the dark is bad form and will make you both feel worse. The end of something significant, like a relationship or a job, is heavy stuff. Recognize that the break up will emotionally impact both your boyfriend and you. We recall beginnings and endings more vividly than the middle parts of our experiences. Don't end things in a way that will tarnish the memories that you had of one another. When people have closure, they feel at peace instead of obsessing over went wrong. As a result, they exert energy on other people or life pursuits rather than on mulling over the relationship. Both of you deserve the ability to quickly move on.","completion":"Before making a decision about ending a relationship, take time to consider the pros and cons of being with your partner and evaluate your reasons for breaking up. Avoid treating them poorly as a way to initiate the breakup, instead, be honest and open about your feelings. Keep in mind that ending a relationship will impact both parties emotionally. Providing closure allows both individuals to move on and focus on other aspects of their lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"It is not necessarily true that if Sentence 1 is accurate, Sentence 2 must also be accurate. Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 convey different aspects of a specific atmosphere, and each can be true or false independently. Sentence 1, \\"Lively, young, buzzing atmosphere,\\" describes an environment that is vibrant, full of young people and excitement. This type of atmosphere denotes energy and excitement, likely associated with social interaction, entertainment, or other activities that capture the enthusiasm of the people present. On the other hand, Sentence 2, \\"The atmosphere is very bustling starting very early,\\" conveys the information that the particular environment gets busy quite early in the day. \\"Starting very early\\" in this context indicates the time at which the hustle and bustle begin. It is important to note that a \\"bustling\\" atmosphere typically refers to a crowded and busy environment, while \\"lively\\" and \\"buzzing\\" atmosphere (from Sentence 1) implies a more energetic and thrilling scenario. There is no direct correlation between the two sentences that automatically makes the second sentence true if the first sentence holds. For example, a lively, young, and buzzing atmosphere could exist at a late-night concert, whereas a bustling atmosphere starting very early might describe a busy outdoor market that starts filling up at the crack of dawn. The overlap between these two settings could exist; however, this isn't necessarily the only possible scenario. It is entirely possible for an environment to only exhibit a lively, young, buzzing atmosphere, without being bustling early in the day. On the contrary, it is also possible for the atmosphere to be bustling starting very early, without necessarily being lively, young, and buzzing.

'Michael Owen was a fantastic forward but nowhere near being a captain'","completion":"Title: The Impact of Racism in the FA: A Deep Dive into Sol Campbell's Claims Introduction: Football has been credited with bridging gaps and uniting people from all walks of life under the common love for the game. However, the dark cloud of racism continues to plague the sport, casting a shadow over its accomplishments. Recently, Sol Campbell has brought the role of discrimination in the Football Association (FA) to the public eye, claiming that the organization is institutionally racist. This article aims to explore Campbell's claims further, discussing his experiences and the possible implications for the future of football in England. Sol Campbell's Claim on FA's Institutional Racism: Former English footballer Sol Campbell, who had an illustrious career playing for clubs like Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, and Portsmouth, has accused the FA of being institutionally racist. He attributes this to the fact that despite winning 73 England caps between 1996 and 2007, he was never given the opportunity to captain the national team for an extended period. Campbell's Captaincy Contention: Campbell strongly maintains that if he were white, he would have been offered the role of England captain for a decade. He insinuates that his race played a significant part in the FA's decisions regarding team leadership, therefore preventing him from fulfilling his potential as captain. Reflecting on past appointments, Campbell points to Michael Owen, a former English striker, who, despite being a fantastic forward, lacked the leadership skills necessary to fulfill the captain's role. Counterarguments and Critiques: While Campbell's claims may seem bold, the lack of diversity in the FA raises questions about the legitimacy of the system. Racial imbalance is evident in the employment of former players and coaches, as well as in the wider football community. However, some may argue that captaincy is based on various factors beyond race, and Campbell may not have met those criteria. It is essential to consider these counterarguments to provide a balanced debate about racism within the sport. Implications for the Future: If Campbell's claims were to be substantiated, it could pose significant challenges for the FA, who will need to examine and rectify their discriminatory practices. It is crucial for the FA to address these concerns and actively work towards creating an inclusive and diverse environment for players, staff, and fans alike. Doing so will help restore public faith in the football institution and ensure equal opportunities for all those involved in the sport. Conclusion: Sol Campbell's claims of institutional racism within the FA stir conversations about the state of football in England, the opportunities offered to players of different ethnic backgrounds, and the role race plays in these decisions. It is essential for the FA, players, and football fans to engage in these discussions meaningfully. The hope is that through open dialogue, football can truly become the unifying force it has always strived to be, eradicating discrimination from the beautiful game and giving everyone an equal chance to shine on and off the field."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Fly A:","completion":"Title: Sky Terror Step 1: Establishing the Setting The movie plot will be set in a small, picturesque coastal town known for its beautiful beach and thriving tourism industry. In recent years, the inhabitants of this town have been dealing with a mysterious increase in piranha attacks, in and around the local waterways, which has led to a negative impact on their businesses and residents' safety. Step 2: Introducing Main Characters Our main characters are Dr. Jane Thompson, a talented marine biologist who has been trying to figure out the reason behind the sudden, aggressive behavior of the piranhas, and Officer Jack Edwards, a dedicated local law enforcement officer, who is desperate to keep the peace and protect the townspeople. Step 3: Establishing the Conflict While analyzing some specimens, Dr. Thompson stumbles upon something extraordinary: the piranhas have developed the power to fly! This new ability allows the piranhas to cause havoc not just in the water, but on land and in the air as well. Thousands of flying piranhas swarm the town, attacking people and creating a state of panic. The authorities are helpless, and the town is in a state of emergency. Step 4: The Resolution Dr. Thompson theorizes that the piranhas' new ability might be linked to a rare compound found in the waters near the town and that disrupting the source of this compound could potentially neutralize the piranhas' flying powers. Together, Dr. Thompson and Officer Edwards embark on a dangerous mission to locate and neutralize the source of the compound. Along the way, they have to battle hordes of flying piranhas and face their own fears. In a thrilling climax, our heroes manage to destroy the source of the compound, rendering the piranhas unable to fly. The town begins to rebuild, and businesses and tourists slowly return. Step 5: Character Growth and Subplots Throughout their journey, both Dr. Thompson and Officer Edwards develop a mutual understanding and respect for one another, eventually forming an emotional connection. Additionally, a subplot could involve a group of local business owners who band together to help protect the town, learning the value of unity and collaboration. Step 6: Ending Notes With the town recovering and the flying piranha threat neutralized, Dr. Thompson and Officer Edwards contemplate the consequences of their actions. They ponder on the importance of seeking answers and working on solutions when facing seemingly insurmountable challenges. The movie \\"Sky Terror\\" provides not only thrilling and action-packed scenes with flying piranhas but also touches on themes of perseverance, the power of teamwork, and the importance of scientific discovery.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please write a short summary for the following article: What can I do for my chronic constipation? I strongly recommend you consult a gastroenterologist. Chronic constipation is the most common digestive complaint and is associated with significant economic costs. For most people it is a mild inconvenience. For a few it can be a serious problem. Most with this malady would do better by simply eating the recommended five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables per day, drinking at least 60 ounces of water per day and getting some exercise, even walking. Some with more severe and chronic constipation would benefit from additional fiber in the diet. We often suggest Metamucil or fiber bars. Let me give you an idea of how constipation is addressed after those interventions have not solved the problem. First, there are varied meanings to the term constipation and the physician would have to find out just what the patient means. Some people will complain of stool being too hard, too small, or that having a bowel movement is too difficult or occurs infrequently. These are clues. Several years ago, a committee of gastroenterologists came together to create a definition and criteria for constipation. The result is called the Rome III Criteria. It helps us approach this problem in a more rigorous and scientific way. In essence, constipation is when stool does not move through the colon or anorectum -- the distal portion of the digestive tract, including the entire anal canal -- in an ordered way. The colon or large bowel is a long tube, 4 to 6 feet in length in most adults. There are muscles in the colonic wall. These muscles contract in an ordered way to propel the waste matter. There can be dysfunction caused by a motor disorder, meaning that the muscles of the colon walls do not propel food adequately, the stool is too hard or there is a physical obstruction of the large bowel. A nerve problem or neurogenic disorder may prevent the muscles from contracting in an ordered sequence. Common causes of neurogenic bowel disease in adults include diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease. Spinal cord injury can also cause constipation. Non-neurogenic causes of bowel muscle dysfunction include low thyroid dysfunction, pituitary failure or low serum potassium. High blood calcium levels, which can result from an overactive parathyroid or several cancers, can also be a non-neurogenic cause of constipation. Certain muscle diseases such as myotonic dystrophy occasionally cause constipation. Drugs that can cause constipation include analgesics, especially opiate pain medicine, cold medicines such as antihistamines, antidepressants and anti-pschycotics. Iron supplements can also cause constipation. Several anti-hypertensive drugs are famous for causing constipation through dehydrating and hardening stool and interfering with nerve conduction to bowel wall muscle. A physician will review known diagnoses and the drugs a patient is taking. Blood studies to assess electrolytes and thyroid function are commonly done. If there is any suspicion of a partial bowel obstruction from a developmental defect, a prior abdominal surgery, a polyp or a colon cancer, a scoping procedure to evaluate the colon and possibly a barium X-ray study of the bowel will be done. Summary:","completion":"Chronic constipation is a widespread digestive issue that can range from a mild inconvenience to a severe problem. To combat constipation, it is recommended that individuals consume five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables daily, drink at least 60 ounces of water, and partake in light exercise. If additional fiber is needed, products like Metamucil or fiber bars can be helpful. However, if these interventions fail, a physician should be consulted. Constipation can be caused by motor disorders, neurogenic disorders, non-neurogenic causes, and medications such as analgesics, antihistamines, antidepressants, and anti-psychotics. Blood tests for electrolyte and thyroid function may be conducted, as well as colonoscopies and barium X-rays in cases where bowel obstruction is suspected."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Only ended up travelling to Ohio to live with a family. But after Only got into a physical fight with one of his elder would-be brothers, the family changed their minds. Back in Florida, Only passed through four different temporary homes over the following year, until he called Connie Going, his adoption case worker, to make a special request. Only had known Going for nearly ten years, and had asked every year if she would adopt him, but she always hesitated. \\"I always believed there was a better family than us out there,\\" Going said in an interview. But last July, when Only called and asked again if she might adopt him, Going said something felt different. \\"When he asked me, my heart felt this ache and I just knew he was my son,\\" she said. So Going, 52, invited Only to start spending time with the rest of her family-her two daughters, Sydney, 21, and Carly 17, and a son Taylor, 14, who she also adopted out of foster care. Eventually, after seeing how well the arrangement was working, Going, who had rented a bigger home, started adopting Only.

Please answer the following question: Information: - \\"Take Me to the River\\" is a 1974 song written by singer Al Green and guitarist Mabon \\"Teenie\\" Hodges. Hit versions were recorded by both Syl Johnson and Talking Heads. In 2004, Al Green's original version was ranked number 117 on \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine's list of the Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. - Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz. - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - Al Green Explores Your Mind is the eighth album by soul singer Al Green . Unlike previous Al Green albums , this album featured only one major hit , the U.S. # 7 hit \`\` Sha - La - La ( Make Me Happy ) '' , but did contain the original version of \`\` Take Me to the River '' , a song which went to # 26 on the Billboard chart when covered by Talking Heads in 1978 . In 2004 , the song \`\` Take Me to the River '' was ranked number 117 on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time .

Inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, Green was referred to on the museum's site as being \\"one of the most gifted purveyors of soul music\\". He has also been referred to as \\"The Last of the Great Soul Singers\\". Green was included in the \\"Rolling Stone\\" list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, ranking at No. 65. - Ralph Joseph Gleason (March 1, 1917 June 3, 1975) was an American jazz and pop music critic. He contributed for many years to the \\"San Francisco Chronicle\\", was a founding editor of \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine, and cofounder of the Monterey Jazz Festival. - \\"Love and Happiness\\" is a 1972 song by Al Green from his album \\"I'm Still in Love with You\\". Green co-wrote the song with Teenie Hodges. It was released as a single in the United Kingdom on London Records in 1973 and in the United States on Hi Records in 1977.

Here is a news article: Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy Spitzer: Weiner shouldn’t be mayor By Jonathan Easley - Tweet Former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer (D) said Monday that former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner (D) shouldn’t be mayor of New York City and that he’d personally fire a public official for the kind of online behavior Weiner engaged in. “Fair point, that’s correct,” Spitzer responded. Matthews also asked Spitzer, who is looking to revive his own political career as New York comptroller, if he would fire a public official found to be sexting if he’s elected. “I think the answer is yes,” Spitzer said. “We have had a number of instances over the years where inevitably, of course, municipal employees, state employees have used computers and the like for improper purposes and there is an appropriate sanction for that and there should be.” Spitzer resigned as governor of New York in 2008 after admitting he solicited prostitutes. According to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Monday, Weiner has fallen to fourth in the New York mayoral race after leading in the polls just over a week ago. Weiner has been plagued by a new round of revelations that he continued exchanging lewd messages with women on the Internet long after a similar scandal drove him from office in 2011. “You’re not going to vote for Anthony Weiner, can you just say that now?,” MSNBC host Chris Matthews asked Spitzer. “You don’t think he should be mayor of New York.”“Fair point, that’s correct,” Spitzer responded.Matthews also asked Spitzer, who is looking to revive his own political career as New York comptroller, if he would fire a public official found to be sexting if he’s elected.“I think the answer is yes,” Spitzer said. “We have had a number of instances over the years where inevitably, of course, municipal employees, state employees have used computers and the like for improper purposes and there is an appropriate sanction for that and there should be.”Spitzer resigned as governor of New York in 2008 after admitting he solicited prostitutes.According to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Monday, Weiner has fallen to fourth in the New York mayoral race after leading in the polls just over a week ago.Weiner has been plagued by a new round of revelations that he continued exchanging lewd messages with women on the Internet long after a similar scandal drove him from office in 2011.

There is almost no gender gap, but a wide racial gap on this question: Women say 54 - 42 percent that Weiner should drop out, compared to men at 52 - 37 percent. But black voters say 53 - 42 percent that Weiner should stay in the race, while white voters say 64 - 25 percent he should get out. Weiner gets 16 percent of likely Democratic primary voters today, compared to his first- place position with 26 percent in a July 24 survey by the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe- ack) University. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn leads the Democratic pack with 27 percent, with 21 percent for Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, 20 percent for former Comptroller William Thompson, 6 percent for Comptroller John Liu and 2 percent for former Council member Sal Albanese, the poll finds. Seven percent of likely Democratic primary voters remain undecided. If Weiner drops out, Quinn gets 30 percent, with 25 percent each for Thompson and de Blasio and 9 percent for Liu. \\"With six weeks to go, anything can happen, but it looks like former Congressman Anthony Weiner may have sexted himself right out of the race for New York City mayor,\\" said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. \\"And with Weiner in free-fall, it begins to look like a three-way race again.\\" A July 24 Quinnipiac University poll showed Quinn at 30 percent if Weiner drops out, with 26 percent for Thompson and 21 percent for de Blasio. In today's survey, Weiner gets 24 percent of black Democratic likely primary voters, down from 31 percent last week. Thompson gets 22 percent, with 21 percent for Quinn and 16 percent for de Blasio. Weiner's support among white voters drops from 23 percent last week to 7 percent today. Having a \\"strong personal moral character\\" doesn't describe Weiner at all, 38 percent of New York City likely Democratic primary voters say, compared to 26 percent who said \\"not at all\\" last week. A total of 14 percent say having moral character characterizes Weiner a great deal or a good amount, compared to 17 percent last week. Weiner's behavior is a legitimate issue in the mayoral campaign, voters say 65 - 34 percent. This behavior disqualifies him from consideration as a candidate, 40 percent of voters say, compared to 23 percent last week. Another 40 percent say this behavior is a factor, but doesn't disqualify him and 20 percent say it is not a factor at all. Thompson leads Quinn 50 - 40 percent in a Democratic primary runoff. He leads 53 - 41 percent among men, 49 - 40 percent among women, 49 - 40 percent among white voters and 58 - 33 percent among black voters. Based on results of last week's poll, de Blasio was not included in a runoff question. \\"Don't bet your paycheck. This is a really goofy election year,\\" Carroll said. \\"Lots of potential voters have been staying home in primaries and this poll evaluates those who are likely to turn up September 10. This is our second survey of these likely Democratic primary voters, a more nuanced look than earlier surveys of all registered voters.\\" From July 24 - 28, Quinnipiac University surveyed 446 likely Democratic primary voters with a margin of error of +/- 4.6 percentage points.

Passage: Other forms of plague have been implicated by modern scientists. The modern bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30–75% and symptoms including fever of 38–41 °C (100–106 °F), headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 percent die within eight days. Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free flowing and bright red. Septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.

The original sentence describes a specific action taken by the boy and the young woman - making peace signs. Peace signs are typically made by holding up the index and middle fingers in a \\"V\\" shape, symbolizing peace. This action is different from high fiving, which involves two people slapping their palms together as a gesture of celebration, agreement, or greeting. Although it is possible that the boy and the young woman high fived each other at some point during their interaction, this information is not mentioned in the original sentence. To infer or assume that they high-fived each other based on the given details would be speculative and not supported by the information provided. In summary, it is important to analyze the specific information and context that the original sentence provides. In this case, the original sentence details a specific action performed by the two individuals – making peace signs.

Paragraph : So the higher an object is above a surface, the more potential energy it has. Question: A ball that is on the top of the empire state building about to be dropped off will have more or less potential energy than a ball on the ground? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the potential energy of an object increases as its height above a surface increases. Therefore, a ball positioned on the top of the Empire State Building, which is significantly higher than the ground level, will have more potential energy than a ball on the ground. When the ball is on the top of the Empire State Building, it has a substantial amount of gravitational potential energy due to its elevated position. This is because the potential energy is directly related to an object's height above a reference point, such as the Earth's surface, and the force of gravity acting upon it. Mathematically, the gravitational potential energy (PE) can be calculated using the formula: PE = m * g * h Where: PE is the potential energy, m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s² on Earth), and h is the height of the object above the reference point. In the given scenario, since the height (h) of the ball on the top of the Empire State Building is considerably greater than the height of the ball on the ground, the potential energy (PE) of the ball on the Empire State Building will be much higher than that of the ball on the ground."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - Watling Street is the name given to an ancient trackway in England and Wales that was first used by the Britons mainly between the areas of modern Canterbury and using a natural ford near Westminster. The Romans later paved the route, which then connected the Kentish ports of Dubris (Dover), Rutupiae (Richborough), Lemanis (Lympne), and Regulbium (Reculver) to their bridge over the Thames at Londinium (London). The continuation northwest passed Verulamium (St Albans) on its way to Viroconium (Wroxeter). The Romans considered the continuation on to Blatobulgium (Birrens) beyond Hadrian's Wall to be part of the same route, leading some scholars to call this Watling Street as well, although others restrict it to the southern leg. Watling Street was the site of Boudica's defeat by the Romans and the southwestern border of the Danelaw. In the early 19th century, the course between London and the sea was paved and became known as the Great Dover Road. Today, the route from Dover to London forms part of the A2 road and the route from London to Wroxeter forms much of the A5 road. - Loughborough (or ) is a town within the Charnwood borough of Leicestershire, England.

This House would make English the official language of the United States What is a possible side to this debate?","completion":"A possible side to the debate could be the proposition side, arguing in favor of making English the official language of the United States. Step 1: Identify the key arguments supporting this position. The primary argument might be to improve national communication and unity. Making English the official language can be seen as promoting more effective national communication since everyone would have a common language to understand and use. This could also lead to greater unity, reducing linguistic divisions among diverse communities. The secondary argument could be related to resource allocation. Translating government documents and providing interpreters in all public facilities for hundreds of languages can be a hefty and unsustainable economic burden. By standardizing the official language, the government can arguably streamline its operations. The tertiary argument could be enhancing economic prospects for individuals. English is the dominant language for global business, so being fluent can open more economic doors, not only within the United States but also internationally. Step 2: Research and present factual evidence that supports these arguments. Quantitative data demonstrating the costs of translation, interpretation and language learning resources in public facilities can lend weight to the resource allocation argument. Testimonials or case studies showing how proficiency in English has led to better economic opportunities could illustrate the economic argument. Historical or comparative examples of countries that have an official language and have seen improved national unity could lend credence to this claim. Step 3: Strategically present these arguments in a persuasive and respectful manner. In a debate, it is crucial not only to have strong arguments but also to present them effectively. This includes being aware of the audience, demonstrating respect to the other side, and employing effective rhetorical strategies to persuade the audience. It's important to note that this is just one side of the debate, and this decision would impact millions of Americans who speak other languages.

Ibn Jubayr (1 September 1145 -29 November 1217; Arabic: bn jbyr), also written Ibn Jubair, Ibn Jobair, and Ibn Djubayr, was an Arab geographer, traveller and poet from al-Andalus. His travel chronicle describes the pilgrimage he made to Mecca from 1183 to 1185, in the years preceding the Third Crusade. Ibn Jubayr also travelled to Medina, Mecca, Damascus, Mosul, Acre and Baghdad at Basra he saw how Indian timber was carefully used to make Lateen sail ships, returning in 1185 by way of Sicily. His path was not without troubles, including a shipwreck. On both occasions he travelled on Genoese ships. Frequently quoted is Jubayr's famous description of Muslims prospering under the Christian crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: We moved from Tibnin - may God destroy it - at daybreak on Monday. Our way lay through continuous farms and ordered settlements, whose inhabitants were all Muslims, living comfortably within the Franks... They surrender half their crops to the Franks at harvest time, and pay as well a poll-tax of one dinar and five qirat for each person. Other than that they are not interfered with, save for a light tax on the fruit of their trees. The houses and all their effects are left to their full possession. All the coastal cities occupied by the Franks are managed in this fashion, their rural districts, the villages and farms, belong to the Muslims. But their hearts have been seduced, for they observe how unlike them in ease and comfort are their brethren in the Muslim regions under their (Muslim) governors. This is one of the misfortunes afflicting the Muslims. The Muslim community bewails the injustice of the landlord of its own faith, and applauds the conduct of its opponent and enemy, the Frankish landlord, and is accustomed to justice from him. Jubayr travelled to the East on two further occasions (1189-1191 and 1217), without leaving any account. He died on the 29 November 1217 in Alexandria during the second of these trips.

During the nine-month-long Bangladesh war for independence, members of the Pakistani military and supporting Islamist militias from Jamaat-e-Islami killed up to 3,000,000 people and raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape. Some estimates mention the number of people killed between 300,000500,000, and describe the 3 million number as excessively inflated. The actions against women were supported by Imams and Muslim religious leaders, who declared that Bengali women were 'war-booty'. It is estimated that up to 30 million civilians became internally displaced. During the war there was also ethnic violence between Bengalis and Urdu-speaking Biharis. Several thousand non-Bengalis were also killed during the war. - Bangladesh ( , \\"The country of Bengal\\"), officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh ( \\"Gônôprôjatôntri Bangladesh\\"), is a country in South Asia. It shares land borders with India and Myanmar (Burma). Nepal, Bhutan and China are located near Bangladesh but do not share a border with it. The country's maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal is roughly equal to the size of its land area. Bangladesh is the world's eighth most populous country. Dhaka is its capital and largest city, followed by Chittagong which has the country's largest port. - East Pakistan, present-day Bangladesh, was a provincial state of Pakistan that existed in the Bengal region of the northeast of South Asia from 1955 until 1971, following the One Unit programme that laid the existence of East Pakistan. - The right of nations to self-determination (from ) is a cardinal principle in modern international law (commonly regarded as a \\"jus cogens\\" rule), binding, as such, on the United Nations as authoritative interpretation of the Charters norms. It states that nations, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity, have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference. This principle can be traced to the Atlantic Charter, signed on 14 August 1941, by Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, and Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who pledged The Eight Principal points of the Charter. It also is derived from principles espoused by United States President Woodrow Wilson following World War I, after which some new nation states were formed, or previous states were revived after the dissolution of empires. The principle does not state how the decision is to be made, nor what the outcome should be, whether it be independence, federation, protection, some form of autonomy or full assimilation. Neither does it state what the delimitation between nations should benor what constitutes a nation. There are conflicting definitions and legal criteria for determining which groups may legitimately claim the right to self-determination. - The Bangladesh Liberation War ('), also known as the Bangladesh War of Independence, or simply the Liberation War in Bangladesh, was a revolution and armed conflict sparked by the rise of the Bengali nationalist and self-determination movement in East Pakistan and the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. It resulted in the independence of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. The war began after the Pakistani military junta based in West Pakistan launched Operation Searchlight against the people of East Pakistan on the night of 25 March 1971. It pursued the systematic elimination of nationalist Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia, religious minorities and armed personnel. The junta annulled the results of the 1970 elections and arrested Prime Minister-elect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. - West Pakistan was one of the two exclaves created at the formation of the modern State of Pakistan following the 1947 Partition of India. - Pakistan (or ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia. It is the sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 200 million people. It is the 36th largest country in the world in terms of area with an area covering . Pakistan has a coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast respectively. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman. - Operation Searchlight was a planned military operation carried out by the Pakistan Army to curb the Bengali nationalist movement in the erstwhile East Pakistan in March 1971, which the Pakistani state justified on the basis of anti-Bihari violence by Bengalis in early March. Ordered by the central government in West Pakistan, this was seen as the sequel to \\"Operation Blitz\\" which had been launched in November 1970. The original plan envisioned taking control of the major cities on March 26, and then eliminating all opposition, political or military, within one month. President Yahya Khan at a conference in February 1971 said \\"Kill three million of them and the rest will eat out of our hands.\\" Prolonged Bengali resistance was not anticipated by the Pakistani military leaders. The main phase of Operation Searchlight ended with the fall of the last major town in Bengali hands in mid-May. The operation also precipitated the 1971 Bangladesh genocide and caused roughly 10 million refugees to flee to India as well as the death of up to 3,000,000 civilians. Bengali intelligentsia, academics and Hindus were targeted for the harshest treatment, with significant indiscriminate killing taking place. These systematic killings enraged the Bengalis, who declared independence from Pakistan, to establish the new state of Bangladesh. - Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (17 March 1920 15 August 1975) was the founding leader of Bangladesh. He served twice as the country's President and was its strongman premier between 1972 and 1975. Rahman was the leader of the Awami League. He is popularly known as the Bangabandhu (\\"Friend of Bengal\\"). He is credited as the central figure in Bangladesh's liberation movement and is considered the founding father of Bangladesh. His daughter Sheikh Hasina Wajed is the current Prime Minister of Bangladesh. - Ranadaprasad Saha ( Bengali : ) ( 15 November 1896 -- May 1971 ) , also known as RP Saha and Ranoda Proshad Shaha , was a famous Bangladeshi businessman and philanthropist , who during the Bangladesh Liberation War was picked up from home by the Pakistani army on 7 May 1971 and never returned home . - Bengal (bgl; Bengali: , and ) is a region in Asia which is located in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent at the apex of the Bay of Bengal.

Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which island had more big-beaked birds survive and reproduce? Two bird islands experienced different levels of rainfall. West island experienced a lengthy drought that lasted several years. Many birds were affected by this drought. East island had several normal years as far as rainfall was concerned. Hint: A period of very low rainfall occurred while the Grants were on the islands. The drought resulted in fewer seeds for the finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks were better off. They could eat seeds of all sizes. Therefore, there was more food available to them. Many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. More of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced. Within just a couple of years, the average beak size in the finches increased. This was clearly evolution by natural selection. The answer is:","completion":"Based on the provided paragraph and hint, the answer is: West island had more big-beaked birds survive and reproduce. Step 1: Identify the key information from the paragraph. - West island experienced a lengthy drought. - East island had normal rainfall. - Drought resulted in fewer seeds for the finches to eat. - Birds with bigger beaks were better off, as they could eat seeds of all sizes. Step 2: Connect the dots. Due to the drought on West island, there was a scarcity of seeds. The birds with smaller beaks struggled for food, while birds with bigger beaks could eat all types of seeds. This meant that more big-beaked birds survived and reproduced on West island. On the other hand, East island had normal rainfall, which did not result in a scarcity of seeds, so the advantage of having a big beak did not play as significant of a role in the birds' survival there. Hence, West island had more big-beaked birds survive and reproduce."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Options are: [a].

How to do a flip turn (freestyle ) Start your turn when you see the black t on the pool floor. There is a black line at the bottom of your pool lane. The perpendicular line lets you know that the wall is two feet away. Answer:","completion":"[b]. You can use the black t to let yourself know it's time to start executing your turn. This can be hard to judge because it all depends on the length of your legs. To successfully perform a flip turn in freestyle swimming, it is important to follow these steps: 1. Approach the wall: As you swim toward the wall, maintain a steady pace and keep an eye on the black line and the \\"T\\" at the bottom of the pool. This will help you gauge your distance from the wall and prepare for the turn. 2. Timing: The right moment to initiate the flip turn depends on the length of your legs. As soon as the \\"T\\" comes into your peripheral vision, be ready to start your turn. Ideally, you want to initiate the flip when your body is about 1-1.5 feet away from the wall. 3. Start the flip: As you approach the wall, tuck your chin toward your chest, pull your legs toward your chest, and begin rotating your body in a forward motion. Keep your head tucked and use your arms to help generate momentum for the flip. 4. Rotate: Your body should resemble a tight ball as you flip, with your legs tucked close to your chest. Keep your arms by your sides or hug them to your chest to maintain a streamlined position. 5. Plant your feet: As you complete the flip, extend your legs and plant both feet against the wall, toes pointing up. Your knees should be slightly bent, similar to a squatting position. Make sure your feet are shoulder-width apart to provide a solid base for pushing off. 6. Push off: Utilize your leg muscles to push off the wall with force while simultaneously extending your arms above your head and streamlining your body. Your body should be in a straight line, aiming for maximum distance underwater. 7. Transition to swimming: As you glide underwater, maintain your streamlined position for a few seconds before initiating the dolphin kick. Once you reach the surface, resume your freestyle stroke, and continue swimming down the lane. Practicing flip turns can greatly improve your overall swimming performance and help you maintain a consistent speed in the pool. It may take time to perfect the technique, but with practice and patience, you'll find that flip turns become a natural part of your swimming routine."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For instance, a mild case of begging might involve your dog sitting near you while you eat and gazing longingly at you. A more serious case might involve your dog barking in addition to sitting and staring at your during mealtime. And a very serious case of begging would involve your dog jumping up on you or leaning against the table and barking while you dine. One reason why your dog might beg is because it is hungry. In order to prevent begging, feed your dog before you eat so that it is not hungry during your mealtime. Don’t just feed your dog any old food. Ensure your dog is getting a healthy and balanced food that was formulated by a company with credentials in animal nutrition. Talk to your vet to ensure that your dog is getting everything it needs from its diet relative to its age, activity level, and size. You may have heard about adding digestive enzyme supplements to your dog’s meal to help with digestion. Generally there is no reason to use these supplements unless your dog has a medical condition diagnosed by your vet. Give your dog a chew toy or KONG toy stuffed with kibble to keep it occupied while you eat. This will ensure that your dog never even knows that you are eating. And if your dog doesn’t know you’re eating, it cannot engage in unwanted begging. The most important thing you can do to prevent your dog from begging is to consistently refuse to give it food while it begs. Never give your dog food from your meal while you are eating.

It's important we give them good healthy food that's just right for them, and not just anything. Sometimes, people think about adding special things called \\"digestive enzymes\\" to their puppy's meal, but usually, puppies only need those if a vet says they have a certain health problem. We can also give puppies a toy filled with food to play with while we're eating. This way, they'll be busy with their own food and won't know we're eating.

This nutrient-rich blood reaches the liver through the hepatic portal vein. It's at this point that the liver begins its several functions. Firstly, it processes these bloodborne nutrients into forms that the rest of the body can utilize. For instance, it can convert glucose into glycogen for storage, or it can synthesize proteins from amino acids for various bodily functions.

Given the question: I can use this background: Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them. Now, I have a new situation: It is winter and Johnathan's car won't start, so he needs to walk to work. Even though it's sunny outside he's going to have to bundle up due to the cold temperature. In his closet there is a large black coat and a large white coat. He can't decide which coat to wear. Answer this question please: Which coat will absorb more sunlight? The answer is:","completion":"The large black coat will absorb more sunlight. This is because dark colors, like black, are more effective at absorbing light rather than reflecting it. When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of the material, making the black coat warmer in comparison to the white coat. In the given situation of winter and cold temperatures, wearing the black coat would be advantageous for Johnathan because it will absorb more sunlight, ensuring that he stays warmer while walking to work in the chilly weather. The white coat, on the other hand, will reflect more sunlight and will not absorb as much heat as the black coat, making it less effective at keeping him warm in cold conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His famous series of sixteen great designs for the Apocalypse is dated 1498, as is his engraving of St. Michael Fighting the Dragon. He made the first seven scenes of the Great Passion in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the Holy Family and saints. The Seven Sorrows Polyptych, commissioned by Frederick III of Saxony in 1496, was executed by Durer and his assistants c. Around 1503-1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the Life of the Virgin, which he did not finish for some years. Neither these, nor the Great Passion, were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers. During the same period Durer trained himself in the difficult art of using the burin to make engravings. It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father, as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith. In 1496 he executed the Prodigal Son, which the Italian Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality. He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably Nemesis (1502), The Sea Monster (1498), and Saint Eustace (c. 1501), with a highly detailed landscape background and animals. His landscapes of this period, such as Pond in the Woods and Willow Mill, are quite different from his earlier watercolours. There is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere, rather than depicting topography. He made a number of Madonnas, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures. Prints are highly portable and these works made Durer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years. Question: \\"When did Durer first produce a set of seventeen prints illustrating the Life of the Virgin that was sold individually for several years?\\" Answer: \\"1505 - 1507\\" Is this answer to the question correct? Options: [+] no. [+] yes.","completion":"no.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1935 England, Briony Tallis is a 13-year-old from a wealthy family. She has just completed writing her first play to mark her brother's homecoming and plans to stage it later that day with her visiting cousins. Looking out of her bedroom window, she spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner, on whom Briony has a crush. Cecilia is undressing and dips into the fountain pool; a moment later, she climbs out, her undergarments wet, all while Robbie watches. Cecilia had gone to the pond to fill a vase, Robbie grabbed one of the handles, and it broke. A part fell into the pond, and Cecilia jumped in to retrieve it, but to Briony, it looked as if Robbie had ordered Cecilia to undress and go under the water. Robbie drafts a series of notes to Cecilia apologizing for the incident, namely breaking the vase and laughing about it. One contains an explicit expression of his sexual desire for her, including frequent and crude usage of the word \\"cunt\\": he writes it only as a joke, and it makes him laugh to himself. He writes another, more formal letter, and asks Briony to deliver it. Only after she has gone does he realise he has given her the explicit letter. Briony reads the letter before giving it to Cecilia. Later, she describes it to her older visiting cousin, Lola, who calls Robbie a \\"sex maniac\\". Paul Marshall, a visiting friend of Briony's older brother's and a chocolate magnate, introduces himself to the visiting cousins and appears to be attracted to Lola. Before dinner, Robbie apologises for the obscene letter, but Cecilia surprises him and confesses her secret love for him. They then proceed to make passionate love in the library when Briony walks in, and thinks that Cecilia is under attack.

For years, people on Facebook have wanted something more than the Like button to express their feelings about the posts they see on the social network. Despite the clamoring, though, all you see to click on below posts is a thumbs up. That could change before long, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in his second public town hall meeting at company headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., which was also webcast live. But the one thing Facebook likely won't do is provide a Dislike button, he said in answer to the first question at the meeting. \\"We’re thinking about it,\\" he said, before putting the kibosh on any intention to provide a thumbs-down button. But he said there are other emotions he knows people want to share, such as sadness about a post of a loved one who passed, for which a Like button is clearly inappropriate. \\"But we need to figure out a good way to do it. We don’t have anything that’s coming soon but it is an area of discussion.\\" That turned out to be one of the more interesting answers Zuckerberg provided in the hourlong event. But he also defended Facebook as much more than a waste of time, explained why there are seemingly endless privacy policy updates, and revealed that he likes fried chicken on his pizza. Here's what else he had to say, lightly paraphrased at times: Q: Advice on starting a company? A: Don’t worry about making mistakes too much. Mistakes are how you learn. The real question is how you learn from them. You gotta keep on powering ahead and not stress too much about it. Q: How can Facebook be a more productive medium, not just wasting time. A: I’m not sure I agree with the thrust of the question. Facebook is giving people a tool to stay connected with more people that they may not be able to do. I don’t really think it’s a waste of time at all. It’s sad that it’s considered a waste of time to cultivate relationships. Q: Why can’t I change my username? A: I have the username Zuck. We limit each person to having just one username so they can be found more easily. The username is less important than the fact that on Facebook, people use their real names. Asking everyone to use their real name grounds everything in reality. There’s more accountability if you’re connected to your real name. It’s all part of building a safe community that’s tied into the world. Q: What is the role of social media in bridging the divide that is now more obvious after events in Ferguson and other communities? A: We’ve been spending a lot of time discussing this internally. We take our role in this civic debate really seriously. There are two things we want to do. The first is we want to give everyone a voice. We’re trying to make it so every single person in the world has a voice. The second thing that’s really important is diversity of opinion. If you’re a Republican or a Democrat, you probably have friends who are in the other party on Facebook. Your network of friends, or friends of friends, is going to bring you more diverse opinions than you would have gotten from any other media. Q: Any New Year’s resolutions? A: It’s too early! I could use some suggestions. I’ve taken them pretty seriously the past five years. I had one resolution that led me to cooking a lot. Another led me to learn Mandarin. I’m bad at languages. My resolution this year was to write one thank-you note to someone every day. Q: How can your vision on Facebook be applied effectively in the public sector? A: It’s only at the beginning of what we hope to see happen. One example recently is we launched Safety Check, which gives people a chance to tell friends and family they’re safe when there’s a disaster. We turned it on in the Philippines this week. Another is just enabling elected officials to communicate with the people they serve. I recently went on a trip to India and Indonesia to work on Internet.org Internet access. Both countries’ leaders used Facebook in their election. We’re just at the beginning here. Q: There are so many privacy updates that I can barely keep up with them. Why so many? A: A lot of people wonder that. What we try to do is update the privacy policy about once a year to reflect the policy, technical, and business changes in the previous year. On the latest one, it used to be that Facebook was one product. Now Facebook offers a lot of different services--news feed, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, and a handful more we’re building. We just need to update our policy to make it clear how all these services will tie together. Also, technology advances like being able to do video or know where friends are requires that we decide what we’re going to do with that information. We don’t want to change this very often. It’s a lot to digest. Q: Have you thought of addressing challenges such as economic disparity? A: We spend a lot of time helping especially small businesses build their business up. We have Pages people can use for free to build up their audience. Q: (From a resident down the street.) Thank you for upping the price of my house. I’m loving it. What kind of community outreach do people in the company plan to do? A: That’s the first time anyone has thanked me for raising housing prices. I taught an entrepreneurship program at a local school. There are always going to be more things we want to do. We want to make the community more healthy. We would love feedback on what else we can do. Elliot Schrage, Facebook's VP of communications, public policy and platform marketing, adds: We take this idea of community outreach seriously not just in Menlo Park but around the world. Q: Share personal habits that contributed to your success? A: On a day to day basis, one of the most important things is focus my time proactively rather than reactively on whatever comes up. There are enough things that happen during the day that you could spend all your time on whatever comes up during the day. So I try to spend the majority of my time on things that I proactively want to be working on. The most important is to put time into things you want to see happen rather than what other folks want you to do. You do need to be open to the outside, which is why I’m doing these town halls. Q: What advice would you give your younger self? A: You’re going to make mistakes no matter what you do. A lot of people focus on avoiding mistakes. Most of what we do is mistakes. You’re successful because of only a few things you did well. Albert Einstein had this really pure idea of how the universe worked. His aesthetic view of the world led him to believe that black holes couldn’t exist. He got that wrong. But nobody remembers he got that wrong, except me, now. Q: What do you like on your pizza? A: My view on this important issue... is that as long as you’re eating pizza, you might as well have fried chicken on top of the pizza. Q: How does coding fit into Facebook’s mission statement? A: Growing up, one of the things that made me excited about coding is you can sit through and accomplish something in the end. What I do now is quite soft--seeing other people do the [coding.] It’s a very valuable outlet for young people to express their creativity. Also, you can have an impact without being high up in management. So it’s massively empowering. Understanding the discipline of coding gives you the skills you need for other work. Q: Will Graph Search be released in other languages like Spanish? A: Yes. But we want to get it right first. People always ask us for the ability to find stuff on Facebook. There’s a big opportunity here, such as recommendations on products and businesses people have tried. The ability to learn from the wisdom of all your friends is valuable, but it’s really not easy to do on Facebook. It’s a lot of work, because there are more than a trillion posts on Facebook. It’s taken a little longer than we all want to fully roll out search to everyone in the world. Please hang in there and we hope to deliver this sometime soon. Q: How does Facebook run experiments to improve its products while avoiding ethical concerns? A: There was this report that a Facebook data scientist that raised a lot of questions. We tightened things up a bit after that. We think the only way we can make our services better for the world is to try out new things and get feedback from the community. We want to make sure changes have positive impacts. My wife is a doctor and there’s a philosophy in medicine that there’s a cost to running a test, so you need an internal process to ensure the service is worthwhile before you potentially do any hard. Things on privacy we’re just not going to test. Anything around emotions that we made sure our people don’t have the ability to test. On the incident last summer, we wanted to see if lots of posts by friends on things they're doing made people sad. We don’t want to make people sad. But the way we did it, we could have done it a lot better. Q: Have you thought about helping people make connections in real life too? A: A lot of what Facebook tries to do is help people stay connected to people you know rather than help you make new friends. I wear contact lenses or glasses. Computers are the bicycle for your mind, Steve Jobs once said. What we’re trying to do with Facebook is extend this fundamental human capacity for maintaining social relationships. Through Facebook, we help people maintain relationships with many more than the 150 social scientists say we can. When I have the opportunity to see my wife or my mother in person, I’ll take that. But people don’t always have the opportunity to do that with everyone they’d like to. Q: If you and I were married, how would we handle Facebook with our daughter? A: I try to put myself in the shoes of having a child. On the one hand, I remember being real young and using technology and having a good sense of this stuff. I thought that was pretty positive. I think children are much more capable than we think. Bullying is really important and we try to make sure it doesn’t happen on the platform. Having real names helps. I would want my children to use technology because it’s one of the ways you become literate and acquire the tools of the modern world. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg says his site is \\"thinking about\\" how to implement a way to dislike posts (Video credit: Facebook). Facebook is thinking about adding a way to \\"dislike\\" posts on its site, founder Mark Zuckerberg has said. Speaking at a Q&A session in California, he said it was one of the most requested features the social network receives from its users. He said the site would need to find a way to make sure it did not become a way to demean people's posts. According to Facebook's own figures, 4.5 billion \\"likes\\" are generated every day. \\"One of things we've thought about for quite a while is what's the right way to make it so that people can easily express a broader range of emotions,\\" Mark Zuckerberg told an audience at Facebook's headquarters. \\"A lot of times people share things on Facebook that are sad moments in their lives.

The system has also come under fire due to a high volume of \\"fake likes\\" - when the popularity of a brand or piece of content is inflated artificially. Facebook has moved to combat the trade of so-called \\"like farming\\" - businesses that, for a price, will provide a huge number of likes quickly. This will be via automated robots, or by a network of humans paid a tiny sum for each click. Image copyright AFP Image caption Fake likes could stop businesses using Facebook, the social network believes An investigation by the BBC in July 2012 showed that a fake company, set up by the BBC, could gain thousands of \\"likes\\" - despite the fact that the company, which promised bagels via the internet, was quite clearly bogus. On closer inspection, many of the \\"likes\\" appeared to come from accounts that were not real people. Hardly any of the \\"likes\\" originated from places like the UK or US - instead the majority originated in places such as the Philippines. Facebook has initiated legal action against firms offering \\"fake likes\\" or other bogus business practices on the social network. Nervous advertisers Any enhanced method for expressing sentiment - particularly negatively - would be likely to make advertisers nervous, said Paul Coggins, chief executive of ad firm Adludio. \\"Facebook's big concern is revenue,\\" he told the BBC. \\"They need to keep their advertisers happy.

Guy Phillipson, chief executive of the Internet Advertising Bureau UK, said brands are now used to being openly criticised online. \\"If brands do put something out which people don't like, they find out pretty quickly.

In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes. - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodylinae, all of whose members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes \\"Tomistoma\\", is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes \\"Tomistoma\\", the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharials (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha. - Rhynchosaurs were a group of Triassic diapsid reptiles related to the archosaurs . - Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although resembling most lizards, they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia. Their name derives from the Mori language, and means \\"peaks on the back\\". The single species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which flourished around 200 million years ago. Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes). For this reason, tuatara are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs, birds, and crocodilians. - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago. - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - Diapsids (\\"two arches\\") are a group of amniote tetrapods that developed two holes (temporal fenestra) in each side of their skulls about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous period. The diapsids are extremely diverse, and include all crocodiles, lizards, snakes, tuatara, turtles, and dinosaurs (both avian and non-avian). Although some diapsids have lost either one hole (lizards), or both holes (snakes and turtles), or have a heavily restructured skull (modern birds), they are still classified as diapsids based on their ancestry. At least 7,925 species of diapsid reptiles exist in environments around the world today (nearly 18,000 when birds are included). Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'taxon rank' with 'order'. Answer:","completion":"The entity that has the relation 'taxon rank' with 'order' is Rhynchocephalia. This is evident from the information given about tuatara, which states that they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Most of the Korean Presbyterian denominations share the same name in Korean, 대한예수교장로회 (literally means the Presbyterian Church of Korea or PCK), tracing its roots to the United Presbyterian Assembly before its long history of disputes and schisms. The Presbyterian schism began with the controversy in relation to the Japanese shrine worship enforced during the Japanese colonial period and the establishment of a minor division (Koryu-pa, 고려파, later The Koshin Presbyterian Church in Korea, Koshin 고신) in 1952. And in 1953 the second schism happened when the theological orientation of the Chosun Seminary (later Hanshin University) founded in 1947 could not be tolerated in the PCK and another minor group (The Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea, Kijang, 기장) was separated. The last major schism had to do with the issue of whether the PCK should join the WCC. The controversy divided the PCK into two denominations, The Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap, 통합) and The General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea (Hapdong, 합동) in 1959. All major seminaries associated with each denomination claim heritage from the Pyung Yang Theological Seminary, therefore, not only Presbyterian University and Theological Seminary and Chongsin University which are related to PCK but also Hanshin University of PROK all celebrated the 100th class in 2007, 100 years from the first graduates of Pyung Yang Theological Seminary.

(Wired) -- The timeline for autonomous cars hitting the road en masse keeps getting closer. GM's Cadillac division expects to produce partially autonomous cars at a large scale by 2015, and the automaker also predicts it will have fully autonomous cars available by the end of the decade. Audi and BMW have also shown self-driving car concepts, with the former working with Stanford to pilot a modified TT up Pikes Peak. Meanwhile, Google is ripping along at its own rapid pace with a fleet of fully autonomous Toyota Prius hybrids that have logged over 300,000 miles. And the company has pushed through legislation that legalizes self-driving cars in Nevada. California is close behind, and Google has also been busy lobbying joyriding lawmakers in Washington, D.C.

Rob Smith (@robsmithonline) has all the details. Buzz60 Jack Dorsey, co-founder and CEO of Twitter attends the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference on July 6, 2016 in Sun Valley, Idaho. (Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images) Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey started a social media firestorm and then apologized after he tweeted that he ordered food from Chick-fil-A. Critics jumped on Dorsey for supporting Chick-fil-A during the month of June, which is Pride Month for the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning) community. Chick-fil-A came under fire from gay rights supporters in 2012 because of comments made by the fast food chicken chain’s CEO, Dan Cathay, expressing opposition to same-sex marriage. The company had also donated millions to anti-gay groups. The controversy spurred angry protests at stores by activists as well as supporters who came to rally behind the the company. Dorsey's tweet reignited the debate.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is getting a very public reminding that Chick-fil-A is not an LGBT-supportive company — though he’s far from the only one who has forgotten. If the crowds at your local Chick-fil-A are any indication, much of the United States, even in progressive cities and on college campuses, has forgotten that management of the restaurant chain is opposed to marriage equality and has kept right on giving money to anti-LGBT causes. Dorsey forgot that when he posted this tweet: The reaction was quick: This is an interesting company to boost during Pride month, @jack https://t.co/Wmhq6Obrp1 — Soledad O'Brien (@soledadobrien) June 10, 2018 Dorsey issued his regrets: You’re right. Completely forgot about their background — jack (@jack) June 10, 2018 Dorsey is far from the first to forget about that background. None other than BuzzFeed posted a fawning story in October headlined \\"15 Facts About Chick-fil-A That'll Make You Say, 'Woah, That's Crazy,” and it never mentioned its anti-LGBT history. The piece just talked about how delicious everything tastes. Even Democrats have sometimes forgotten, as evidenced during a sit-in for gun control in 2016, when they ordered out for Chick-fil-A. Aside from its record of questionable donations via its foundation, Chick-fil-A also scores a zero on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index. Although it has some vocal queer defenders, the company has taken no action that would show it welcomes LGBT customers — not a commercial, not a Pride proclamation, nothing. Last year, ThinkProgress reported on Chick-fil-A’s most recent financial disclosures that showed it was still giving in 2015 to anti-LGBT causes. That’s two years after CEO Dan Cathy swore he would stop. The mix of donations changed, with money going to less overtly anti-LGBT groups. But the theme remains. ThinkProgress noted 1 million to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which has a “sexual purity” policy that bans “homosexual acts.” Another 200,000 went to the Paul Anderson Youth Home, which teaches boys that abuse they faced as children “has produced all kinds of evil throughout the culture to include the explosion of homosexuality in the last century.” The Salvation Army got 130,000 — and yes, it’s still openly opposed to marriage equality. The restaurant chain was recently in the news again because Scott Pruitt, the anti-LGBT head of the Environmental Protection Agency, tried (and failed) to win a Chick-fil-A franchise for his wife. He praised the company as a “franchise of faith.” In other words, the right wing has not forgotten what Chick-fil-A stands for. Just the opposite. Mike Huckabee once hosted a national Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day in response to the backlash over its anti-LGBT donations. Now conservatives enjoy ordering Chick-fil-A just to show allegiance. They eat it so often that Sen. Lisa Murkowski once complained it was getting a little tedious to attend meetings. With this latest incident, the use of Chick-fil-A as symbology for social conservatism continues. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio jumped into the Twitter debate to claim the left has gone too far with its dislike for Chick-fil-A. This lunacy has gone too far. The CEO of @Twitter bullied into apology for patronizing @ChickfilA because owners support “biblical definition of marriage”. Holding a personal view taught by mainstream Christianity is now boycott worthy. https://t.co/EnChlPBStc via @cbsmoneywatch — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 11, 2018 At least one famous Twitter user gets the sense that Republicans use Chick-fil-A as a political football. ||||| Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey ignited a backlash after eating at Chick-fil-A. Getty Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey ignited a backlash online after revealing that he ate at Chick-fil-A this month. On Saturday, Dorsey posted a photo on Twitter with the caption \\"Boost @ChickfilA,\\" showing he had saved 10% on a 31.58 order at the fast-food chain. A \\"boost\\" is a cashback reward Square users can earn when using a Cash Card, which is a debit card from the payment platform. Critics immediately seized on Dorsey's support of Chick-fil-A — whose CEO has come under fire for his views on same-sex marriage in the past — during Pride Month. Twitter/@jack \\"You must love the taste of bigotry!\\" one person wrote in response. \\"Why is Twitter boosting a notoriously anti-gay company during #PrideMonth?\\" another person wrote. Among the critics was the former CNN anchor Soledad O'Brien, who said, \\"This is an interesting company to boost during Pride month, @jack.\\" Dorsey responded: \\"You're right. Completely forgot about their background.\\" Twitter/@jack Some people supported Dorsey's decision to eat at Chick-fil-A, saying that it's \\"great\\" and that he shouldn't have to apologize for eating a chicken sandwich. One person tweeted: \\"Don't give in to these people and their complaints. I'm gay and I LOVE ChickfilA. Ridiculous. Go on and eat that ChickfilA and post as much as you want about it!\\" The backlash shows Chick-fil-A still has lingering problems with its brand image following remarks six years ago by the company's CEO, Dan Cathy, regarding his views on same-sex marriage. Cathy set off a fury among gay-rights supporters in 2012 that led to nationwide protests after he told the Baptist Press that the company was \\"guilty as charged\\" for backing \\"the biblical definition of the family unit.\\" Reports soon emerged detailing Chick-fil-A's many charitable donations to anti-LGBTQ organizations. For months afterward, protesters rallied outside Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country and held \\"kiss-ins,\\" where same-sex couples kissed in front of onlookers and TV cameras covering the backlash. Since then, Chick-fil-A has worked to shed its controversial image, and over time, protests against the chain have largely dissipated. Given the backlash against Dorsey's Chick-fil-A meal, however, it seems the fast-food chain still has some work to do to move past Cathy's comments. |||||","completion":"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had a meal at Chick-fil-A and then posted about it on Twitter.

But what's in it, who hates it, and what happens next? (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) The United States and 11 other nations have come up with a trade deal after years of negotiations. But what's in it, who hates it, and what happens next? (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) President Obama hailed the historic 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal completed here Monday as an accord that “reflects America’s values,” but within hours the administration had turned from the negotiating table to selling the agreement on Capitol Hill, a reflection of the harsh political climate the controversial pact is expected to face in Congress. Obama pledged that the ­Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the largest free-trade agreement in a generation, would open new markets for U.S. goods and services and establish rules of international commerce that give “our workers the fair shot at success they deserve.” But almost immediately there were signs of the tough fight ahead to win final ratification from Congress next year. Lawmakers from both parties criticized the pact as falling short in crucial areas, raising the prospect that the White House could lose the support of allies who had backed the president’s trade push earlier this year. “Closing a deal is an achievement for our nation only if it works for the American people and can pass Congress by meeting the high-standard objectives laid out” by lawmakers in the spring, said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. “While the details are still emerging, unfortunately I am afraid this deal appears to fall woefully short.” Monday’s announcement that trade ministers had reached consensus on the deal, after five days of negotiations, started the clock on the final stages of winning approval from national legislatures. The United States, where the 2016 presidential campaign is underway, is not the only nation where political turbulence could affect completion of the deal. Protesters in Atlanta stage marches against the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. (Paul Handley/AFP/Getty Images) Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who backed the deal, is facing a tough reelection vote this month, and the opposition party has said it would not be bound by the terms of the deal. Leaders of Australia, New Zealand and several other countries made tough compromises that face stiff opposition at home. On the U.S. campaign trail, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, slammed the deal, saying that “Wall Street and other big corporations have won again.” Republican front-runner Donald Trump tweeted on Monday: “The incompetence of our current administration is beyond comprehension. TPP is a terrible deal.” And Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton has hedged on the TPP pact, despite having supported it while serving as Obama’s secretary of state. “I’ll leave the presidential politics to someone else,” U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said during a news conference in Atlanta. “Our job is to reach agreement and explain it fully to the American public. Given where we are in the calendar, this really is a 2016 issue for Congress to consider.” Obama must wait at least 90 days after notifying Congress of the deal before he can sign it and send it to Capitol Hill, and the full text of the agreement must be made public for at least 60 of those days. Congress is expected to receive the legal documents to start the 90-day clock later this week. Lawmakers will then have 30 days to review the deal before it is made public. The next step will be for the U.S. International Trade Commission to conduct a full economic review of the deal. The agency has up to 105 days to complete that work. Under the terms of “fast track” trade legislation approved by Congress this summer, lawmakers will not be able to amend or filibuster the TPP pact. The only leverage they have is to fully approve the deal or reject it in its entirety. Fast-track also ensures that it takes only a simple majority to pass the deal, but that majority support is far from guaranteed. Obama has battled trade skeptics in both parties this year in his quest to secure the expedited rules. The additional negotiations have done little to sway critics within his party. Capitol Hill staffers said votes in the House and Senate are not likely to take place before mid-April, at the earliest, and a reshuffling in the House Republican leadership after the announced resignation of Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) could produce even more uncertainty. While the GOP has been more supportive of Obama’s trade agenda, some conservatives have opposed a pact negotiated by a Democratic White House. Opponents in Obama’s party, who believe the deal will hurt working-class Americans, have vowed to turn the trade deal into a political issue in an attempt to block it. Only 28 of 188 House Democrats supported the fast-track trade bill in June. “Froman says this is a 2016 issue. That’s perfect timing because a presidential election year is the best opportunity to shine a light on all the bad trade provisions in this deal,” said Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), a fierce critic of the pact. The Obama administration “is supposed to be fighting for the American public, not high-priced lobbyists, but unfortunately this administration’s approach has been the exact opposite.” The TPP, which has been negotiated for eight years, is a sprawling, 30-chapter accord that addresses tariff reductions for agriculture and automobiles, as well as intellectual-property rights for movies and pharmaceutical drugs, the free flow of information on the Internet, wildlife conservation, online commerce and dispute settlement practices for multinational corporations. The 12 TPP nations — Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam — account for 36 percent of the world’s gross domestic product. Negotiators meeting here were under mounting pressure to close the gaps on several remaining issues. Efforts to reach final consensus during the last negotiating round in Maui in July broke off after deadlocks over dairy tariffs, rules governing where automobiles are manufactured and market protections for next-generation biologic drugs. According to U.S. officials, the talks in Atlanta were a marathon that stretched deep into the night and early morning. Plans to announce a deal were postponed several times as negotiators hashed out the technical details, and the language of the text was still being tweaked at 5 a.m. Monday, just hours before the news conference. But members of Congress warned in the final days that the pressure to close the deal could lead to bad compromises from the U.S. delegation. Hatch is reportedly upset over the terms that would govern how long pharmaceutical companies could maintain market exclusivity on genetically engineered drugs. U.S. law allows 12 years of patent-style protections, but the final agreement is reportedly closer to the five years allowed under Australian law. “The United States should not settle for a mediocre deal that fails to set high-standard trade rules,” Hatch said. Other lawmakers hailed separate portions of the agreement, including new labor standards to protect workers and a last-minute provision that would not allow cigarette companies access to a new international dispute settlement panel. Critics of such panels, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have charged that the pact would allow large corporations to sue TPP member nations for lost profits if they changed their public health laws or other regulations. “It’s now time for Congress and the public to examine the details of the TPP and assess whether it will advance the nation’s interests,” said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a key party supporter of Obama’s trade push. Officials in Atlanta emphasized that the agreement will pay long-term dividends, deepening multilateral relations in a way that develops common interests and reduces volatility in global markets. The TPP represents the largest U.S. trade pact since the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico in 1993. Obama aides have called the deal an important part of a foreign policy strategy to maintain an economic edge on China, which has been expanding its influence in Asia. The TPP has been crafted to allow other nations to join if they pledge to meet the standards, and South Korea already has expressed interest. “Long after details of things like tons of butter sold are regarded as a footnote in history, the bigger picture of what we achieved today will be what remains,” said New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser. “Our industry structures will change in response to the opportunities in this agreement. In future years, we will be absolutely certain of the depth of achievement we reached at this point in our collective history.” Kelsey Snell in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| Mike Drury retrieves a pallet at the Hardware Sales Inc. warehouse in Ferndale, Wash. Hardware Sales Inc. officials say the company's e-commerce division could benefit from streamlined customs regulations when the 12 Pacific Rim countries agree to a massive trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. (AP Photo) Deal reached on giant 12-nation trade pact The pact is expected to tear down trade barriers and establish rules in areas like labor, the environment and e-commerce. ATLANTA - Negotiators from the U.S., Japan and 10 Pacific Rim nations on Monday cinched the biggest trade pact in recent history, setting the stage for President Barack Obama to send the deal to a divided Congress early next year. \\"We, the trade ministers... are pleased to announce that we have successfully concluded the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiation,\\" United States Trade Representative Michael Froman declared shortly after 9 a.m. to a loud round of applause. \\"After more than five years of intensive negotiations, we have come to an agreement that will support jobs, drive sustainable growth, foster inclusive development and promote innovation.\\" Story Continued Below The pact, if approved by the member nations, would tear down trade barriers and establish rules in areas like labor, the environment and e-commerce for countries that produce 40 percent of the world’s economic output, from giants like the U.S. and Japan to developing nations like Peru, Malaysia and Vietnam. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is key to Obama’s “pivot” to Asia, aimed at anchoring the United States in a region increasingly dominated by China. But the decision to address currency manipulation in a side deal, rather than in the pact itself, was expected to disappoint lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. U.S. auto manufacturer Ford is already urging Congress to renegotiate the agreement on that basis. Trade ministers stayed four days past their expected departure to make the final, difficult concessions on auto, dairy and drug protections— knotty issues that will likely shape the votes in Congress, as well as in the legislatures of other nations. A congressional vote is likely months away, next February at the earliest, and perhaps later if Obama waits for final details to be ironed out before he gives Congress the legally mandated 90-days notice that he intends to sign it. But Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch signaled trouble for the deal right out of the gate. “While the details are still emerging, unfortunately I am afraid this deal appears to fall woefully short,” Hatch said in a statement, likely referring to the U.S.' inability to secure 12 years of patent protection for biological drugs, as he had sought. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, who along with Hatch and Sen. Ron Wyden drafted the trade promotion authority bill, said he is reserving judgment until he sees the final text. “[O]nly a good agreement … will be able to pass the House,” Ryan said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, without identifying specific issues, said in a statement that \\"serious concerns have been raised on a number of key issues\\" and said the deal “demands intense scrutiny by Congress.\\" Business groups have pushed for comprehensive tariff cuts and strict intellectual property protections. U.S. pharmaceutical companies in particular wanted 12 years of monopoly protections for a new class of life-saving medicines called biologics, but U.S. negotiators faced stiff opposition from other countries and had to settle for far less — five years of guaranteed protection and the possibility of additional time under two options that countries could elect. As for the currency manipulation side deal, it would give the administration a range of options, such as “cooperative mechanisms, enforceable rules, reporting, monitoring, transparency, or other means, as appropriate.” But it would not do what lawmakers have repeatedly requested, which is to directly punish currency manipulators by withdrawing their benefits under the trade deal. Still, the administration is banking that the overall economic heft and geostrategic importance of the agreement will overcome concerns in Congress about individual provisions. They argue that many farmers and businesses could benefit greatly from the agreement, especially in markets like Japan, Malaysia and Vietnam, where they now face significant trade barriers. “Whether you’re an orange grower in Florida, a rancher in Nebraska or a boat builder in Washington state, TPP will include cuts to trade barriers, like tariffs” that currently block exports, an Obama administration official said. The agreement throws another variable into the volatile 2016 presidential election campaign, with Republican front-runner Donald Trump criticizing the pact before it was even complete and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton adopting a wait-and-see approach on a major geopolitical play she touted as Obama’s secretary of state. The new trade deal also sets the stage for another potentially bruising battle in Congress, following this summer’s debate over trade promotion authority, which was narrowly approved in the House. That law allows Obama to submit the deal to Congress for straight up-or-down votes without any amendments, greatly easing its chances for approval. But it also allows lawmakers to strip that “fast track” provision if they feel the administration has not adequately consulted with them or followed congressional negotiating objectives. As Froman and his team pushed for the final deal, senior members of Congress grumbled that they weren’t being kept up to date about developments on key issues. “We expect you to intensify these consultations and coordination immediately,” the top Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee said in a letter to Froman on Wednesday. U.S. trade officials, however, bristled at the suggestion they haven’t kept Congress informed. Froman has met with 100 members since a previous TPP ministerial meeting in Maui in late July, including with the Senate and House advisory groups on negotiations, they said. Froman said on Monday that he would start briefing lawmakers about the final deal as early as the afternoon and added that he was “confident that people will see this as a very strong deal, very much consistent with the directives of Congress with regard to trade promotion authority.” The AFL-CIO labor federation and many environmental groups lined up behind congressional Democrats in the unsuccessful attempt to defeat the fast track trade bill. Still, the administration hopes what it describes as groundbreaking labor and environmental provisions will soften the opposition if not completely quiet it. “TPP will include the most robust enforceable environment commitments of any trade agreement, and will allow us to address pressing issues like wildlife trafficking, illegal logging and illegal fishing,” an administration official said. “TPP will put American workers first by including the strongest enforceable labor standards of any trade agreement in history, including in areas like child labor and forced labor and wages.” As part of the agreement, all 12 TPP member nations would have to abide by international standards that allow for the right to collective bargaining, prohibit child labor and prevent employee discrimination. Vietnam would be required to allow independent unions and Malaysia would have to address human trafficking concerns. Among the groups of lawmakers who will be taking a close look at the details of the deal will be those from dairy states, who sent letters this week expressing concern about U.S. producers giving up more sales in their home market than they gain in exports under the pact. Another high-stakes battle involved auto trade between Japan and the three North American Free Trade Agreement partners — the United States, Canada and Mexico. There, the U.S. auto industry won long phase-outs of the 2.5 percent tax on imported passenger cars and 25 percent tax on imported trucks. The final tussle was over how much of each vehicle had to be made from parts manufactured within the 12-nation TPP region to qualify for reduced duty treatment under the pact. Japan wanted a much lower standard than the 62.5 percent requirement for autos and 60.0 percent for auto parts under NAFTA, but had to reopen negotiations after Canada and Mexico pushed back. Those negotiations also produced a flurry of letters and op-eds from lawmakers and union leaders as negotiators shuttled between rooms at a hotel in downtown Atlanta searching for agreement. “We must do better under the TPP by increasing rules-of-origin standards, not lowering them,” a group of 23 House Democrats led by Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, said in a letter to Froman on Thursday. Meanwhile, many agriculture-state lawmakers were irked by Froman’s decision to insert language in the agreement that would prevent companies from challenging anti-smoking regulations and other “tobacco control measures\\" under an investor-state dispute settlement forum that is a standard feature of free trade agreements and investment treaties. The change was driven by an unresolved case brought by Philip Morris against Australia’s plain-packaging law critics hold up as a classic example of how ISDS can undermine government public health regulation. Opponents of the move argued that it would create a bad precedent to exclude any legal product, no matter how unpopular, from investment provisions of the trade deal. Sen. Thom Tillis said he would vote against TPP if the tobacco “carve-out” was included and 17 members of the House Agriculture Committee also expressed concern about the provision in another letter to Froman. Still, 21 Democrats who backed Obama’s request for trade promotion authority this summer urged Froman to include it in the deal. The agreement is also expected to contain a number of other reforms to the investor-state dispute settlement provisions in response to criticisms raised by many Democrats, including Clinton and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The United States, Japan, and 10 other countries around the Pacific have come up with a trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).

Here is an article: Earlier this week, Google CEO Larry Page finally revealed the reason behind his soft, hoarse-sounding voice: he suffers from a rare condition called vocal cord paralysis Though Page was able to speak on Wednesday at Google I/O, the company’s annual developer conference, he recently wrote on his Google Plus profile that he has struggled with vocal cord paralysis for the past 14 years. Page said he was first diagnosed with paralysis in his left vocal cord after a bad cold. However, his condition worsened last summer when his right vocal cord also became paralyzed. Experiencing paralysis in both vocal cords is extremely uncommon, according to Dr. Nicole Maronian, director of the Voice Center at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, who did not treat Page for his condition. “Since I’ve been in practice, since 1998, it’s been one patient. Having it affect both vocal cords, it’s pretty rare,” Maronian told FoxNews.com. Normal vocal cords open and then close completely every time they are stimulated by the nerves. \\"They have to close in a tight line to get the kind of strong voice out that you and I have today,” Maronian said. But when vocal cords become paralyzed, they are not able to close completely, leaving a gap. “If there’s a gap, air starts leaking through, and you start sounding breathy, softer,” Maronian explained. In addition to hoarseness, patients with this paralysis can also experience shortness of breath due to air leaking through the gap between the vocal cords. “They often get a little bit high-pitched, trying to project or pitch the voice. They get short of breath because of all that air leaking out, or have trouble getting full sentences out because of the air leaking out,” Maronian said. Some patients even experience aspiration, when recently swallowed fluids leak through the space in between the vocal cords. Aspiration can lead to coughing symptoms or even “aspiration pneumonia, which has significant morbidity and mortality,” Maronian said. While the paralysis is typically thought to be caused by a viral infection, such as a cold, pneumonia or bronchitis, other factors may be to blame as well. “Lots of things can affect the nerve: A virus, compression from a thyroid issue, other things like cancer, (or) surgeries where the nerve is ether stretched or pulled,” Maronian said. Page disclosed that he was also diagnosed with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis in 2008, an inflammation of the thyroid gland, which may or may not affect his vocal cord paralysis. “Sometimes the thyroid gets big which can compress the nerve and push on it. Usually though, the gland burns out and gets small and the nerve compression issue isn’t a piece of it anymore,” Maronian said. Recovery time for vocal cord paralysis can vary. Some patients rebound within months, while others take much longer to heal, Maronian noted. Depending on the needs of the patient, doctors can offer several treatment options for vocal cord paralysis. Patients can wait and see if the condition improves on its own, but many opt for vocal cord injections or surgical procedures to achieve faster relief and recovery. “In the office or operation room, we can (inject) a material next to the vocal cord that pushes it into a more natural position, so it can get closure. (We then) watch and hope it recovers on its own,” Maronian said. Page said in his statement that he plans to “fund a significant research program” through the Vocal Health Institute, led by Dr. Steven Zeitels from the Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts General Hospital Voice Center.

Why did big mama in Dredd 3D(2012) not blow up the building? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"1. Task: Determine if Judge Dredd could kill Deathstroke. Step 1: Analyze the abilities of each character. Judge Dredd is a highly skilled law enforcer in a dystopian future, with advanced weapons, armor, and a strong sense of justice. He has heightened accuracy, physical abilities, intelligence, and is an experienced hand-to-hand combatant. Deathstroke, on the other hand, is a DC Comics mercenary and assassin with enhanced strength, agility, stamina, and regenerative abilities. Deathstroke is also a skilled martial artist and possesses a genius-level intellect, which makes him tactically superior. Step 2: Compare their abilities. It is essential to compare the physical and mental strengths of the characters, as well as the technology and resources they possess. Deathstroke seems to have the edge with his enhanced abilities, regeneration, and strategic advantage, but Judge Dredd is a formidable opponent nonetheless. Step 3: Justify the outcome. Given the differences, Judge Dredd could potentially kill Deathstroke, but it would likely be a very difficult task. The outcome of such a confrontation would be highly dependent on the specific circumstances, skillsets, and tools available to each combatant. 2. Task: Determine why Big Mama in Dredd 3D (2012) did not blow up the building. Step 1: Analyze the motive behind Big Mama's actions. The character Ma-Ma (Big Mama) was a ruthless drug lord who wanted to maintain control over her territory and criminal activities in the building called 'Peach Trees'. Blowing up the building would have destroyed her drug manufacturing operation, her power base, and possibly killed her in the process. Step 2: Assess her strategic options. Big Mama's priority was to eliminate the threat posed by Judge Dredd and his associate, not to destroy the building. She took a more tactical approach by attempting to trap and kill them within the building rather than causing mass destruction. Step 3: Justify her decision. Big Mama's decision to not blow up the building can be justified by her desire to maintain power and control over her criminal enterprise. Blowing up the building would have resulted in catastrophic losses for her, both in terms of her drug operation and her power within the criminal underworld. 3. Task: Analyze if the two questions are the same. Step 1: Compare the nature of the questions. The first question is about a hypothetical confrontation between two fictional characters, while the second question is related to the motives and decisions of a character in a specific movie. Step 2: Assess the similarity. The two questions are not the same, as they address different aspects of the fictional works – one being a hypothetical scenario and the other focusing on a specific plot point within a movie. They are related to the universe of Judge Dredd, but each question requires a separate analysis to answer accurately. Step 3: Justify the conclusion. Based on the differences in the nature of the questions, it can be concluded that these two questions are not the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question 2: How would changing the 500 and 1000 currency notes help indian government in dealing with corruption? -- no -- yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, both questions 1 and 2 are asking about the potential effects of scrapping 500 and 1000 rupees notes in relation to curbing corruption and black money in India. To provide a detailed and long answer, I will collectively address the content of both questions. The decision to scrap or demonetize the 500 and 1000 rupees notes was primarily aimed at curbing corruption, black money, and counterfeit currency in India. Black money refers to income or transactions that are not reported to the tax authorities, thereby evading taxes. Corruption often involves using black money for bribery and illegal activities. Here are ways that scrapping high-denomination notes may help address corruption and black money: 1. Cash-based transactions: Black money transactions are predominantly cash-based, especially when it comes to corruption, as it's easier to hide and operate without a paper trail. By scrapping 500 and 1000 rupees notes, the government aimed at making it extremely difficult for people to carry out large unaccounted cash transactions that facilitate tax evasion, corruption, or illegal activities. 2. Bringing black money into the mainstream economy: One of the main goals of demonetization was to force those who possess black money to deposit their unaccounted cash in banks. As a result, the government could identify people who are holding large sums of money that is not accounted for, and the deposited cash can be taxed accordingly. Thus, demonetization may help in bringing that money back into the mainstream economy. 3. Elimination of counterfeit currency: A significant amount of counterfeit currency in circulation was in the form of 500 and 1000 rupees notes. By demonetizing these notes and introducing new designs with advanced security features, the government aimed at eliminating fake currency, which often funds illegal activities and terrorism financing. 4. Encouraging digital transactions: With less cash in circulation and people finding it challenging to transact in large sums, demonetization also aimed at promoting digital and cashless transactions. Digital transactions leave a digital footprint, which makes it difficult for parties involved to evade taxes and indulge in corruption. Hence, it may reduce corruption and the generation of black money in the long run. 5. Greater accountability and transparency: With more transactions moving to digital platforms and making it difficult for people to operate with unaccounted cash, the government's intention was to bring greater accountability and transparency to the economic system. This could make it difficult for people to misuse public funds or indulge in corrupt practices. However, it is essential to note that while scrapping 500 and 1000 rupees notes might have had some impact on corruption and black money, it is not a standalone solution. Addressing these issues requires a multi-faceted approach, including stricter regulation, enforcement, and creating a culture of transparency and accountability. Moreover, demonetization also had unintended consequences such as a temporary cash shortage, the distress faced by many individuals and businesses, and economic disruption."},{"prompt":"Q: Question: what is phylum cnidaria?

She wants to be a superstar so she can get a kiss from Sky Corrigan (Will Ferrell). When Mary is sent to Special Education because of hyperactivity, she makes a new best friend, the tomboyish and equally socially awkward Helen Lewengrub (Emmy Laybourne). Mary sees her chance to become a superstar when her school promotes a talent show. She wants to try out, but Grandma Gallagher (Glynis Johns) will not let her. Mary tries out anyway and, when she goes to sign up, a stereotypical cheerleader, Evian Carrie Graham (Elaine Hendrix), gets in a fight with her. The fight causes Evian and Sky to break up, and now Sky is a \\"single hunk of beefcake on the rebound\\". Mary is now determined to get in the talent show so Sky will notice her. When Grandma Gallagher finds out that her granddaughter got into the talent show, she finally tells the truth about how her parents died â they were stomped to death while performing in a Riverdance-like competition, rather than being eaten by Hammerhead sharks as her grandmother had told her. This is why Grandma Gallagher is against her granddaughter performing. However, Grandma Gallagher decides to help Mary do her act in the talent show, as long as she performs for herself. Mary and the other Special Education students spend days practicing. Mary wins the competition as well as Sky's heart.

In the course of a long and innovative career, he played a prominent role in the revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th century. Although much of his work was experimental and unusual, the piece with which he is most generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk-dance tune \\"Country Gardens\\". Grainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he established himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became a champion of Nordic music and culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters, sometimes in crudely racial or anti-Semitic terms. In 1914, Grainger moved to the United States, where he lived for the rest of his life, though he travelled widely in Europe and in Australia. He served briefly as a bandsman in the United States Army during the First World War through 1917–18, and took American citizenship in 1918. After his mother's suicide in 1922, he became increasingly involved in educational work. He also experimented with music machines, which he hoped would supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works, and as a future research archive. As he grew older, he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music. After the Second World War, ill health reduced his levels of activity. He considered his career a failure.

The Maronites are a Christian group who adhere to the Syriac Maronite Church with the largest population around Mount Lebanon in Lebanon. The Maronite Church is an Eastern Catholic sui iuris particular church in full communion with the Pope and the Catholic Church, with self-governance under the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, one of more than a dozen individual churches in full communion with the Holy See. They derive their name from the Syriac Christian saint Maron, whose followers migrated to the area of Mount Lebanon from their previous location of residence around the area of Antioch, establishing the nucleus of the Syriac Maronite Church. Some Maronites argue that they are of Mardaite ancestry, but most historians reject such claims. Phoenicianism is an identity on the part of Lebanese Christians that has developed into an integrated ideology led by key thinkers, but there are a few who have stood out more than others: Charles Corm, Michel Chiha, and Said Aql in their promotion of Phoenicianism. In post civil-war Lebanon since the Taif agreement, politically Phoenicianism is restricted to a small group. Among leaders of the movement Etienne Saqr, Said Akl, Charles Malik, Camille Chamoun, and Bachir Gemayel have been notable names, some going as far as voicing anti-Arab views. In his book the Israeli writer Mordechai Nisan, who at times met with some of them during the war, quoted Said Akl, a famous Lebanese poet and philosopher, as saying; Akl believes in emphasizing the Phoenician legacy of the Lebanese people and has promoted the use of the Lebanese dialect written in a modified Latin alphabet, rather than the Arabic one, although both alphabets have descended from the Phoenician alphabet. In opposition to such views, Arabism was affirmed at the March 1936 Congress of the Coast and Four Districts, when the Muslim leadership at the conference made the declaration that Lebanon was an Arab country, indistinguishable from its Arab neighbors. In the April 1936 Beirut municipal elections, Christian and Muslim politicians were divided along Phoenician and Arab lines in the matter of whether the Lebanese coast should be claimed by Syria or given to Lebanon, increasing the already mounting tensions between the two communities. Phoenicianism is still disputed by many Arabist scholars who have on occasion tried to convince its adherents to abandon their claims as false, and to embrace and accept the Arab identity instead. This conflict of ideas of identity is believed to be one of the pivotal disputes between the Muslim and Christian populations of Lebanon and what mainly divides the country to the detriment of national unity. In general it appears that Muslims focus more on the Arab identity of the Lebanese history and culture whereas the older, long-standing Christian communities, especially the Maronites focus on their history, and struggles as an ethnoreligious group in an Arab world, while also reaffirming the Lebanese identity, and refraining from Arab characterization as it would deny them their striving achievement of having fended off the Arabs and Turks physically, culturally, and spiritually since their conception. The Maronite perseverance lead to their existence even today.","completion":"This text is primarily about the Maronites, a Christian group that adheres to the Syriac Maronite Church, with the largest population found around Mount Lebanon in Lebanon.

If The Palais des Papes is the resulting combination of feudal fortress and opulent palace., can we conclude that \\"The Palais des Paes served multiple functions.\\"?","completion":"Yes, we can certainly conclude that the Palais des Papes, or the Palace of the Popes, served multiple functions. As you mentioned, it is a combination of a feudal fortress and an opulent palace, which signifies the different purposes it held over time. To provide a detailed explanation, let's explore the history and key features of the Palais des Papes, which further supports the assertion that it was multifunctional. The Palais des Papes is located in Avignon, France, and holds immense historical significance. It was constructed in the 14th century during a tumultuous period in the church's history, known as the Avignon Papacy. From 1309 to 1377, the Roman Catholic Church suffered a crisis when the papacy was moved from Rome to France due to the political turmoil in Italy. Consequently, the Palais des Papes served as the primary residence for popes during that time. As a feudal fortress, the Palais des Papes was designed to provide security and protection to its occupants, given the uncertain circumstances. Many architectural elements pointed to the defensive role it played, such as its thick walls, high towers, and drawbridges to control access. It was also strategically located on a rock with natural defenses in place, such as steep slopes and the Rhône River. The Palais-des-Papes was initially designed by the architect Pierre Peysson, who built the first structure known as the Old Palace, followed by architect Jean de Louvres, who built the New Palace. The old palace had fewer decorative elements and was predominantly built for protection, while the new palace was built primarily to showcase the popes' opulence and power. This combination of the two palaces gives the structure we see today as the Palais-des-Papes. Being an opulent palace, the building also demonstrated the wealth, power, and influence of the church. Beautiful frescoes adorned the walls, and the layout included numerous grand rooms, such as the Pope's personal apartments, chapels, and ceremonial halls. The palace also housed an extensive library that contained a diverse collection of manuscripts, supporting the intellectual aspect of the church. As such, the Palais des Papes signifies not only the church's political power but also its investment in art, culture, and knowledge. Furthermore, the palace was surrounded by gardens (such as the Jardin des Doms), vineyards, and a papal mint, which emphasize the economic aspect of its functioning. These resources facilitated trade and commerce, benefiting both the Vatican and the local economy. In conclusion, the Palais des Papes indeed served multiple functions as a symbol of religious power, a fortress to ensure security, an opulent palace emphasizing the wealth and grandeur of the church, and a center for art, culture, and knowledge. This combination of a feudal fortress and an opulent palace cements its status as a multifunctional structure and one of the most important monuments of medieval history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

North Walsham High School in Norfolk banned it for \\"safety reasons\\". The school said it \\"did not want to spoil fun\\" but minor injuries involving plastic bottles made the ban necessary. The challenge became an internet sensation after a video was posted in May of US high school student Mike Senatore performing tricks at a talent show. Since then people have been trying to outdo each other, landing their bottles on surfaces including walls and windowsills. Click here if you've got the bottle for more stories from Norfolk The ban was posted on the school's website and Facebook page on Monday. The school wrote: \\"Following a misunderstanding today, we would like to confirm that the 'bottle flip challenge' is not permitted in school. \\"Students caught doing this will have an immediate C3 detention.\\" The Facebook post elicited more than 120 comments. \\"It never fails to amuse me how much schools care about ridiculous things,\\" one person wrote. \\"It's flipping lost its bottle,\\" said another while others said the school was being \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"pathetic\\". One parent, however, supported it saying \\"they are there to learn, not to mess about\\". The Facebook post was later removed after the school said \\"inappropriate language\\" was being used in comments, but the detention notice remains on the website. Head teacher Neil Powell said: \\"Following one or two minor injuries sustained by students when water bottles hit them, we decided that for safety reasons we would ban the practice in school, before a more serious injury occurred. \\"We are aware of several schools in Norfolk taking similar action to ban the challenge.\\" Output:","completion":"North Walsham High School in Norfolk banned the \\"bottle flip challenge\\" due to safety concerns after minor injuries involving plastic bottles occurred, despite the challenge being an internet sensation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: If you are afraid of the dark,it's not a big deal.It's perfectly normal to feel afraid After all,animals do too. \\"Fear matters,\\"says Karen Warkentin,an ecologist.\\"It's a good thing,\\" she adds, \\"because fear makes you do things that keep you alive.\\" Like kids,many animals experience fear and they respond to the feeling in variety of ways.A frightened turtle pulls its head and legs inside its shell.A small fish will swim away when a big,hungry fish approaches. Some animals respond to fear in ways you might not expect.The first example is that the fear of being eaten can scare some frogs right out of their eggs. Warkentin made the surprising discovery while studying red--eyed tree frogs in Costa Rica. In this species,female frogs attach jellylike clumps of their eggs to the undersides of leaves.The leaves hang on branches that dangle over ponds.After they hatch from the eggs,the tadpoles then fall into the water,where they eventually grow into adult frogs. Tree frog eggs usually grow for 6 days before hatching.If they sense that a hungry snake is about to attack,however,they can hatch up to 2 days ahead of schedule. As the snakes are unable to swim,by falling into the water early,the tadpoles can escape. If hatching early helps protect red--eyed tree frogs from snakes,you might wonder why their eggs don't always hatch sooner.It turns out that hatching early brings its own danger.Once tadpoles land in the water,hungry fish and other animals like to eat them too.Staying in their eggs for a full 6 days,then,allows frog embryos to grow big and strong.This extra growth improves their chances of surviving in the water. Question: We are told in the passage that tree frogs _ . Options: A: face danger both inside their eggs and in the water B: will grow fast if they fall into the water later C: are surprisingly clever when inside their eggs D: stay in their eggs longer if they are frightened Answer:","completion":"A: face danger both inside their eggs and in the water Justification: The passage explains that tree frog eggs can hatch early if they sense a hungry snake is about to attack, allowing them to escape into the water. However, once tadpoles land in the water, they face danger from hungry fish and other animals. This shows that tree frogs face danger both inside their eggs and in the water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Options: - shaker - fast food restaurant - kitchen cupboard - people - table Explain why a human would choose \\"fast food restaurant\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","completion":"A human would choose \\"fast food restaurant\\" because they are known for adding excessive amounts of salt to their dishes to enhance flavor and taste. This high salt content makes the food more appetizing and addictive for some people, leading to increased consumption and profits for the restaurant. Additionally, fast food restaurants typically prioritize convenience and speed over health, making it more likely they would use too much salt in their preparation. It is important to note that the other options mentioned do not apply directly to salt usage: a shaker is a tool to dispense salt, kitchen cupboard and table are locations where salt may be stored or used, and people, though they may individually use too much salt, are not inherently associated with overuse of salt like fast food restaurants are."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: NASA Scientist Publishes 'Colonizing the Red Planet,' a How-To Guide A manned mission to Mars would be the greatest adventure in the history of the human race. And one man knows how to make it a reality. In fact, he just wrote the book on it -- literally. Joel Levine, senior research scientist with NASA's Langley Research Center and co-chair of NASA's Human Exploration of Mars Science Analysis Group, just published \\"The Human Mission to Mars: Colonizing the Red Planet.\\" The book reads like a who's who of Mars mission science, featuring senators, astronauts, astrophysicists, geologists and more on getting to Mars, studying its atmosphere and climate, the psychological and medical effects on the crew and other details. There's even a section detailing the science of sex on Mars, should NASA attempt to create a permanent colony there. \\"For the last three years, I've been co-chairing a panel of about 30 U.S. and Canadian scientists, coming up with a blueprint, purely from a scientific perspective, of humanity's role on Mars,\\" Levine told FoxNews.com. He was asked to put together a special edition of the Journal of Cosmology exploring the topic, which was just published as the new book. \\"The United States of America is the only country that can do this successfully right now,\\" he said. And to remain the technological leader of the world, he argued, we need to do this. And it's quite possible, the book notes; after all, a trip to Mars isn't even a lengthy one. \\"The trip to Mars would take on the order of 220 days using today’s chemical propulsion technology,\\" writes Steven A. Hawley, a former astronaut now with the department of physics and astronomy at the University of Kansas, in a chapter on the challenges and sacrifices of the trip to Mars. He suggests either a short duration or longer duration stay before the return trip. \\"The longer surface mission would enable significant science, but also expose the crew to greater risk if systems don’t function as planned.\\" But regardless of whether a colony is initially established, Levine is passionate -- and poetic -- about a trip to Mars. \\"When we do this, the human species will be a two-planet species for the first time ever,\\" he said. A trip to Mars would open up countless revelations and possibly answer one of the greatest questions science today seeks to answer: is there life elsewhere in the universe? \\"The search for life outside the Earth is one of the key questions in all of science,\\" he told FoxNews.com, \\"and of all the objects in the Solar System, Mars is the most likely.\\" Many scientists speculate that life may exist on the red planet today in the form of microorganisms, and the book concludes that a manned mission could very well answer that question for once and all. \\"All of the articles here conclude that yes, it's possible that when we go to Mars we will find microorganism at the surface or below the surface.\\" Another question Levine believes the mission will answer deals with the strange history of Mars -- which he called the most intriguing, and the most confusing planet in the solar system. Today Mars has no liquid water and a very, very thin atmosphere -- it's like the Earth's atmosphere at 100,000 feet, he said. Yet we have very, very strong evidence that its surface used to be covered with water. What happened to it all? \\"What catastrophic event led to Mars going from an Earth-like planet to a very inhospitable planet today?\\" he asked. The Mars mission would send humans there to study that, and see if there's a lesson in the planet for the future of Earth. Levine has a general timeline in mind for the mission, which he hopes to launch by 2040. He believes we could launch the missions far sooner, however -- if we could afford to. Tragically, the major problem for getting humans to Mars isn't building new spacecraft, furthering science, or inventing new technologies, he says. The only hold-up is the budget. \\"NASA's budget is 18 billion a year, and I don't think we can seriously plan a launch until 2040\\" given those funds, he said. \\"If NASA's budget went up 3 billion a year, or 5 billion a year, we could do it in half the time.\\" But Levine presents a solution for that problem in his book as well, something unprecedented for NASA: advertising. \\"The suggestion is marketing to different corporations and professional sports leagues for advertising, which is something NASA never does -- it's a whole new economic plan for financing what has to be the greatest adventure in the history of the human race.\\" Read the special edition of the Journal of Cosmology here.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Idol Meter: The finals Performance order: Studies by WhatNotToSing.com and others have established that singing first on the show is a clear handicap, while singing last is a big plus and second-to-last a lesser but still significant plus. So show-closers get 10 points, the second-to-last contestant gets 5, the opener gets minus 5, the rest zero. Performance quality: Buzz, judges' verdict and (especially) song choice are vital to a contestant's survival, but none of that would mean a thing without what we watch Idol for: the performance itself. It's worth anywhere from minus 10 to plus 10 points. Exceptional circumstances: Idol is live, and the unpredictable can happen. When it does, we'll dole out anywhere from minus 10 to plus 10 points for incidents including, but not limited to, emotional shout-outs or breakdowns, sickbed performances, superstar stage lighting, forgetting lyrics, false starts, major vocal gaffes, tantrums, overt sullenness, sassing a judge, being adopted as perverse causes clbres or anything else that might influence voting. Judges' verdict: Respect them or not, the judges' opinions can't help but influence voters. So positive comments from Randy, Steven and Jennifer are worth up to 6 points each, while a negative comment scores as much as minus 6. If a performance receives a unanimous, three-judge, flat-out rave, 3 bonus points will be added for a total of 21. Dial Idol: DialIdol.com, which calculates phone-voting strength from busy signals, has had a strong record of predicting eliminations over the years, though its accuracy might suffer this year as online voting is being allowed for the first time. While we monitor the situation, contestants receiving green (or safe) ratings from Dial Idol get 5 points. The lowest-rated contestant gets minus 5; the remainder, in the yellow danger zone, score zero. Online buzz: Standout performances tend to generate high volumes of post-show online searches, so contestants who spike in Google Trends, Yahoo Buzz, Twitter's popular topics or other queries get 14, 10 or 5 points. Outcome: Nothing spells danger for an Idol contestant more than showing up in the dreaded bottom three the previous week. Contestants score minus 5 points if they were in the bottom three or plus 20 points if they escaped. Contestants who elude elimination on their first trip to the bottom three get a one-week bounce worth 5 points.","completion":"The news article is about Idol Meter, a scoring system for a singing competition called Idol.

Tuareg fighters launched uprisings in the Sahara in the 1960s and 1990s, and renewed rebellions since early 2007 against the central governments of Niger and Mali have increased instability in a region where al Qaeda cells also operate. Fighting in Niger's rebellion, instigated by the Niger Justice Movement (MNJ), has killed more than 300 rebels and around 80 government soldiers.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? MNJ is an organization of Tuareg rebels. Select from: (A). yes. (B). no.","completion":"(A). yes. The sentence follows the preceding text because the text mentions that the Niger Justice Movement (MNJ) instigated Niger's rebellion and is fighting for equality and more political autonomy.

Article: About 3 months ago, my father was in hospital recovering from a major lung operation. My mother had recently passed away, and my father had taken the loss of his partner of 58 years very hard and had lost interest in life. It was quite difficult to try to get him to eat each day as he didn't want anything. The one thing, however, that he would ask us to bring him was ice cream. One evening, to our surprise, he refused to eat the ice cream, so I placed it in a staffroom refrigerator. A little while later, my son said he wanted it, so I fetched it for him. As I passed another ward , a woman asked, \\"Are there more where that came from?\\" When I explained, she seemed very disappointed. She then said that she had cancer and could eat very little other than the occasional ice cream. The next evening, I decided to buy two ice creams. On the way to dad's room, I came into the sick woman's room, and offered her the ice cream I'd bought for her. She was totally astonished that I had thought of her, and accepted the gift with tears in her eyes. I spoke with her for a few minutes, explaining what was happening in my family and listened to her similar story of pain and suffering. It was _ that she did not have many visitors. I repeated the gesture a few days later, and this time I received a warm hug.

Input: By Marie-Louise ConnollyBBC News NI Health Correspondent It is looking at when women are referred for further tests after an initial breast cancer screening at their local health trust. The Health and Social Care Board says staffing difficulties have meant \\"longer than acceptable\\" waiting times. The plan is to reduce the current number of specialist breast cancer services. Instead, so-called centres of excellence are hoped to be provided. For instance, there is a question mark over the future of assessment services in the Southern Health Trust. While its two mobile screening units will remain, the BBC understands that on-going staffing levels could mean that women who require further assessment may have to attend a different health trust. It is understood three potential locations are being considered - Altnagelvin, Dundonald and Antrim Area Hospitals. Plans to transform the local health and social care system includes less duplication of services. 'Staffing difficulties' While that could mean hospital buildings not closing, services inside could be dramatically transformed. For instance a hospital might lose or gain a service. That could mean specialist staff and patients being expected to travel elsewhere, maybe even a little further, to get the expertise required. In a statement, the Health and Social Care Board (HSC Board) and Public Health Agency (PHA) said there have been challenges in recent years to meet waiting list targets due to \\"difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialist staff in a number of trusts\\". \\"While a number of measures have helped to improve the waiting times for those referred for breast assessment, the need for a more sustainable model of care which can provide an assessment, within target timescales, for all people with a suspicion of breast cancer is widely recognised,\\" it added. It says a project board was established last year, which is expected to send a report to the Department of Health in December. \\"A consultation on the recommendations is expected during early 2019,\\" the statement added.

When Louise goes below deck, a large, strange cloud on the horizon passes over the craft, leaving a reflective mist on Scott's bare skin. The couple are puzzled by the phenomenon, which disappears as quickly as it had shown up. However, one morning six months later, Scott, who is 6Â ft 1Â in (1.85Â m) tall and 190 pounds (86Â kg), notices that his shirt and slacks seem to be too big, but blames it on the laundry service. As this trend continues, he believes he is shrinking and sees his physician, Dr. Bramson (William Schallert), who reassures him that he is in perfect health and that \\"people just don't get shorter.\\" Louise also dismisses his fears as silly, stating that he has simply been losing weight, but he continues to lose height and weight.

Adults of this family are almost always confined to fresh water. This is the only family in the superfamily Atyoidea. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Southeast Asia or Southeastern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of the countries that are geographically south of China, east of India, west of New Guinea and north of Australia. The region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with heavy seismic and volcanic activity. Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions: - The telson is the posterior-most division of the body of an arthropod. It is not considered a true segment because it does not arise in the embryo from teloblast areas as do real segments. It never carries any appendages, but a forked \\"tail\\" called the caudal furca may be present. The shape and composition of the telson differs between arthropod groups. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments. - A subregion is a part of a larger region or continent and is usually based on location. Cardinal directions, such as south or southern, are commonly used to define a subregion. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Bonnaroo Festival in Tennessee Wraps Up MANCHESTER, Tenn. — The 10th Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival ended on Sunday, and more than 85,000 people returned to civilian life, their ears ringing with too much music. Because it is a brand with a mysterious grip on hale young-adult Americans with mystical tendencies, because it broke little aesthetic ground and because it’s a milestone year, let’s do consumer service first. Jim James of My Morning Jacket on Day 2 of the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in Tennessee. More Photos » The latest on the arts, coverage of live events, critical reviews, multimedia extravaganzas and much more. Join the discussion. From left, Stephen Stills, Richie Furay and Neil Young, original members of Buffalo Springfield. More Photos » Bonnaroo is convenient, more so than, say, Coachella: it takes one unhazardous hour to get from the festival site to the Nashville airport, and Manchester, in Coffee County, is central to the mid-South. Security is good-natured, even humorous. The festival is well priced: at 210 to 250, a general-admission ticket can be 100 cheaper than Coachella, for four days instead of three. (For another 750, the organizers will set you up with a nice-looking tent the size of some New York studio apartments.) It is hot, and getting hotter: this is a June of record highs for Tennessee, with temperatures in the mid-90s, about 10 degrees above what they should be. The food on the grounds, absurdly plentiful, is a step above Italian sausages and corn dogs, though those were available too. There’s an enormous tent for microbrewed beer. You can find a decent cup of coffee. The big festivals are starting to look alike, but there is still no snob appeal to Bonnaroo, which is intriguing. You couldn’t say it welcomes everyone; you could say it welcomes anyone. On the nine-stage schedule, Gregg Allman competed with Robyn; Bruce Hornsby competed with Junip; Wiz Khalifa competed with Loretta Lynn and Bootsy Collins. There was a sports bar right off the hippie-beads and glass-blowing boulevard near the festival’s center, where a forest of dudes watched the Mavs beat Miami. (This festival took root in hippie loam before it sprouted elsewhere: into metal; hip-hop; Americana; bad early-morning, glow-stick techno; general alternative tweeness; and Mongolian power-rock.) The alternative to the microbrewed ales was Miller Lite. The amount of dust on the festival part of the site — maybe a quarter of the 750-acre plot owned by Bonnaroo’s organizers — was staggering, and finally hard to live with. Often, it felt like an effort to find an area without dust; often, the areas without dust were muddy. Camping? Lots of it, well demarcated, separated into areas with funny names, and I heard tales of deer ticks, but otherwise I can’t help you; I was at a price-jacked Holiday Inn. It all happened on time, with minimal slippage. Mr. Collins ran 40 minutes late with the funk, and Sunday night’s “Superjam” took 30 minutes for a Noah’s Ark sound check. Superjam! Lots of solos, you’d think, and few songs, called on the fly. Not so. Dr. John — whose 1974 album “Desitively Bonnaroo” gave the festival its name and who performed that album in full with the Meters and Allen Toussaint late on Saturday night — collaborated with Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys. They had two drummers: Patrick Hallahan, of My Morning Jacket, and Max Weissenfeldt, of the German rare-groove band Poets of Rhythm, a light-handed drummer who knows his rare 45’s, who knows the precise differences between the rhythms of James Black and Zigaboo Modeliste. (This is where snobs are useful.) They’d rehearsed and planned. They played Dr. John songs — “Jump Sturdy,” “Black John the Conqueror” — and other bits of New Orleans, like “Iko Iko” and Betty Harris’s fabulous “Break in the Road.” The Preservation Hall Jazz Band, from New Orleans, joined them with horns and bass drum. The superjammers were not too inclusive or too sloppy: they kept the funk to a quiet rustle, with few solos, except for Mr. Auerbach’s — scrappy, flavorless, short, a courtesy to his fans, no damage done. Oh, it was good. Summary:","completion":"The 10th Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, concluded on Sunday, with over 85,000 attendees returning home. The festival, which appeals to young-adult Americans, is conveniently located close to the mid-South region and Nashville airport. Well-priced general admission tickets and improved security measures have further enhanced the event's attractiveness. Bonnaroo's food offerings have also grown in variety and quality, including an enormous tent for microbrewed beer. While many big festivals are starting to look alike, Bonnaroo stands out for its inclusive atmosphere, welcoming a diverse range of acts over nine stages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: With the growth of the Internet and the ease of publishing content, more and more creative minds are coming online to share videos, music, software, products, services, opinions, and more. While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself. My goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend ‘Dealing With Disrespect’ as something that can help put things in perspective. According to the above context, answer the following question. How did the author come up with the idea to write the book? A:","completion":"The author came up with the idea to write the book \\"Dealing With Disrespect\\" after being bothered by the negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback that creators often receive on the internet.

Here is an article: Blake Griffin missed all of what should have been his rookie season with an injury, but clearly is making up for lost time. And his 47-point performance last night isn't the only sign the Clippers' big man is headed for greatness. What matters just as much is the way he's getting under the skin of the opposition. When you get in the other guy's head, that's when you've arrived in the NBA. Such was the case Sunday when Lamar Odom got in a tussle with Griffin rather than let the final seconds of a Lakers loss tick off peacefully. The video shows Odom grabbing Griffin's jersey in the way cornerbacks snatch at receivers who are about to beat them for touchdowns. After that game Kobe Bryant readily admitted to the Los Angeles Times that Griffin had \\"punked us.\\" That was the case again in Griffin's 47-point explosion against Indiana. Most of Griffin's damage came against 11-year vet James Posey, who was in no mood to share a kumbaya afterward. Posey also refused to shake hands with Griffin. \\"He tried to, I declined,\\" Posey told the Indianapolis Star, which reported the two exchanged harsh words several times during the Clippers' victory. \\"He already gave us 40 something and I'm going to shake his hand and thank him?\\" asked Posey. \\"I'm good.\\" With that game, Griffin improved to a 27.5 scoring average over the last 10 games, and also notched his 27 consecutive double-double. Here's four writers assessing Griffin's prospects for superstardom. (The vote here is slam-dunk.) And I like the comment from the LA Times' Lisa Dillman best: \\"Just get him a decent nickname and a high-profile actress girlfriend and this superstar thing might be happening a lot faster than even the longest-suffering Clipper fan ever thought.\\" See photos of: Los Angeles Lakers, Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles Clippers, Indiana Pacers, Lamar Odom, James Posey, Blake Griffin To report corrections and clarifications, contact Standards Editor .

Title: Antichrist Movie plot: Prologue[edit] A couple makes passionate love, as their toddler, Nic, climbs up to the bedroom window and falls to his death. Chapter One: Grief[edit] The mother collapses at the funeral, and spends the next month in the hospital crippled with atypical grief. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with psychotherapy. But it is not successful, and so when she reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, he decides to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide. He encounters a doe which shows no fear of him, and has a stillborn fawn hanging halfway out of her. Chapter Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns)[edit] During sessions of psychotherapy, she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex to escape the pain. The area becomes increasingly sinister to the man, including acorns rapidly pelting the metal roof, awakening with a hand covered in swollen ticks, and finding a self-disemboweling fox that tells him, \\"chaos reigns.\\" Chapter Three: Despair (Gynocide)[edit] In the dark attic the man finds the womanâs thesis studies: terrifying pictures of witch-hunts, and a scrapbook in which her writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible. She reveals that while writing her thesis, she came to believe that all women are inherently evil. The man is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. In a frenzied moment, they have violent intercourse at the base of an ominous dead tree, where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots. He suspects that Satan is her greatest, and hidden fear.

Question: Information: - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Jesus Christ Superstar is a 1970 rock opera with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. The musical started as a rock opera concept album before its Broadway debut in 1971. The musical is sung-through, with no spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the Gospels' accounts of the last week of Jesus's life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his disciples in Jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion. It highlights political and interpersonal struggles between Judas Iscariot and Jesus that are not present in the Bible narratives. - Slowhand is a 1977 album by Eric Clapton. Released on 25 November by RSO Records, and titled after Clapton's nickname, it is one of his commercially and critically most successful studio albums. \\"Slowhand\\" produced the two hit singles \\"Lay Down Sally\\" and \\"Wonderful Tonight\\", reached various international music charts and was honored with numerous awards and recording certifications. In 2012, a deluxe edition was released to celebrate the album's 35th anniversary. - \`\` Wonderful Tonight '' is a ballad written by Eric Clapton . It was included on Clapton 's 1977 album Slowhand . Clapton wrote the song about Pattie Boyd . The female vocal harmonies on the song are provided by Marcella Detroit ( then Marcy Levy ) and Yvonne Elliman . - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - \\"Lay Down Sally\\" is a song performed by Eric Clapton, and written by Clapton, Marcella Detroit (as Marcy Levy, the diminutive form of her birth name), and George Terry. It appeared on his November 1977 album \\"Slowhand\\", and reached No. 3 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 chart. - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Marcella Detroit (born Marcella Levy, June 21, 1952) is an American soprano vocalist (perhaps best known for her backup singing on many Top 20 Billboard hits), guitarist, and songwriter. She released her debut album \\"Marcella\\" in 1982 to little success before she joined Shakespears Sister with ex-Bananarama member Siobhan Fahey. Detroit sang the lead vocals on their biggest hit, \\"Stay\\", which was number one in the United Kingdom for eight consecutive weeks.

His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. - Yvonne Marianne Elliman (born December 29, 1951) is an American singer who performed for four years in the first cast of \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\".

Answer the following question: Skylar got good at sport that year by practicing all the time. Given the context: What will Others want to do next? OPTIONS: (i). tell Skylar that they are arrogant (ii). ask Skylar to practice with them (iii). be interested in sports Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, it seems that Skylar's dedication and hard work towards the sport they have been practicing have yielded fruitful results that year. It's not unusual for others in the community, such as friends, classmates, or teammates, to notice and potentially be inspired by Skylar's progress and success throughout that year. Given the options provided, the most likely response of others in the context would be: (ii). ask Skylar to practice with them There are several reasons why this option seems the most fitting in the given scenario: 1. Human nature tends to gravitate towards success: People generally like associating themselves with those who are successful or excel in a particular field. They may feel that by practicing with Skylar, they too could improve their sport skills and achieve similar success. 2. Skylar could be a valuable mentor or resource: Skylar’s consistent practice and evident improvement indicate that they must have gained valuable experience and knowledge about the sport. Other participants might think that getting the chance to practice with Skylar would provide them with the opportunity to learn from a knowledgeable peer. 3. Creating a positive and supportive environment: By choosing to practice with Skylar, others are fostering a healthy atmosphere that encourages growth and development in the sport. This camaraderie can lead to elevated morale among the group, further motivating them to work harder and strive for success together. On the other hand, the other two options seem less likely based on the context: (i). tell Skylar that they are arrogant: This option assumes that Skylar's success in the sport has led to a perceived arrogance in their behavior. However, there is no mention of arrogance in the provided context, and the assumption might stem from negative emotions like jealousy or insecurity. While some may feel this way, it is not the most probable option for the majority of others. (iii). be interested in sports: Although Skylar's success might pique others' curiosity or generate interest in sports in general, it does not address a direct connection or interaction with Skylar. This option doesn't reflect the immediate impact of Skylar's achievements on the people around them. In conclusion, based on the information provided, it seems most likely that others would want to ask Skylar to practice with them, seeing the potential benefits for their own improvement and the creation of a positive, supportive environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When NASA astronaut Scott Kelly completes his yearlong mission on the International Space Station next year, he'll come back just a little bit younger than his twin, Mark, than he was before. This is because time travels more slowly in space, a phenomenon first described by Albert Einstein's 1915 theory of general relativity. This December, universities and academies around the world are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the theory's publication. Even 60 years after his death, Einstein is still the most important scientist of the modern era. Looking back as far as 2,400 years ago, only Newton, Galileo and Aristotle were his equals. Born in the era of horse-drawn carriages, his ideas started a technological revolution that brought about more change in one century than in the 2,000 years before. In 1905, Einstein published four important scientific papers. These completely changed people's ideas about space, time, light and matter. In one of these papers Einstein. introduced his theory of special relativity. Two groundbreaking parts of the theory were about the relationship between mass and energy and the speed of light. Einstein was able to show that mass and energy were connected through the formula E=MC2. The theory also says that no object can travel faster than the speed of light. About 10 years later came his theory of general relativity, the theory that modern physics is really based on. In Einstein's mathematics, space has three dimensions, and the fourth dimension is time. Space and time are part of one continuum, called space-time. The presence of mass changes space-time, which explains where gravity comes from. Computers, satellites, telecommunication, lasers, television and nuclear power, many of the biggest developments in the modern world, can be linked to Einstein's work. \\"We are a different people than we were a century ago,\\" said astrophysicist Michael Shara of the American Museum of Natural. History, \\"completely different, because of Einstein.\\" However, there's more to him beyond the image of a science mastermind. Einstein, as a person, has also become a grandfatherly icon in our culture. He liked playing Mozart on his Violin and keeping fit by hiking and walking. Power was not his goal. In 1952, the young nation of Israel asked Einstein to be its president, but he refused. And, yes, he was eccentric. With hair like that, how could he not be? 1. Scott Kelly is what? 2.

U.S. Manufacturers Find the Right Shore in Mexico Mexicoâs rise makes a compelling case for the right-shoring strategy for U.S. manufacturers. By Derrick Johnson | UPS More and more these days, sophisticated U.S. imports â often from the aerospace, automotive, and high-tech industries â share a common designation: Made in Mexico. This trend reflects growing confidence among U.S. manufacturers that Mexico offers far more than affordable labor just across the southern border. The country has modern, industry-specific manufacturing hubs staffed by skilled workers. U.S. companies and their customers can gain these benefits without having to wait for goods shipped across thousands of miles of ocean or paying for higher-priced air shipping. Mexico has long been an important location for production and end delivery of goods, especially for companies that want to put manufacturing closer to U.S. demand. Mexico could be one of the primary incubators for innovation in the world. But the countryâs participation in many free trade agreements and its recent emergence as a world-class manufacturing center present an excellent opportunity for U.S. companies to balance other factors like costs or local resources to determine the proximity of sourced materials to production, warehousing, and distribution. In this case, U.S. companies establish manufacturing operations in Mexico to boost the benefits derived from just-in-time production practices while also taking advantage of Mexican skills and infrastructure. Over the last few decades, Mexico has established itself as a country where companies can build supply chains nimble enough to meet the demands of 21st-century manufacturing. Manufacturers need speed, efficiency, and the ability to ramp up and contract production depending on the demands of the day. They also face more pressure than ever before to reduce transit times. This often requires shorter supply chains. For U.S. companies that sell goods domestically, nearby Mexico is a logical choice to locate crucial supply chain links. Thatâs why weâre witnessing dramatic growth in a number of industries in regions throughout Mexico. Take the aerospace industry, for example. Mexico has several aerospace manufacturing hubs that are known for industry expertise. Of Mexicoâs 31 states, 16 have factories that specialize in aerospace, according to the Offshore Group. Between 2008 and 2013, as many as 36 aerospace factories were established in Chihuahua City. The state of Chihuahua has universities and technical schools that graduate thousands of engineers and technicians each year. These graduates enter the workforce ready to support the local manufacturing industries, including aerospace. U.S. automakers Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler also are concentrating some manufacturing operations in Mexican cities, including Ramos Arizpe, Toluca, Hermosillo, and Chihuahua. The companies gain the benefits of relatively low business costs, skilled workforces, and free trade agreements, which enable easier exporting to foreign markets. Meanwhile, the city of Guadalajara has become known as the Latin Silicon Valley. More than 600 high-tech companies have facilities there, and the city is now the top producer of software, electronics, and digital components in Mexico. Manufacturing hubs like these compete directly with rival hubs in China, which, for a long time, has been the offshore manufacturing destination of choice for companies around the world. But, as Chinese labor and transportation costs rise, U.S. companies see more value in locating manufacturing operations in Mexico where they can more easily supply U.S. markets. Mexicoâs improving transportation infrastructure is another important factor that companies consider when they decide to put operations in the country. They also take a close look at intellectual property protection, which is stronger in Mexico than in other parts of the world. This is especially important for industries like aerospace and high-tech, which develop cutting-edge products. Finally, concerns about setting up operations in Mexico are gradually dissipating as governments work to secure supply chains and improve personal safety for the people who live and work there. Mexicoâs economy is one of the most trade-integrated in the developing world, and trade between North American nations is on the rise. U.S. goods traded with Mexico in 2013 amounted to 506.6 billion, a gain of 2.8 percent from 2012, according to the U.S. Mission to Mexico. In the 20 years since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, exports from the United States to Mexico have increased by 336 percent while Mexicoâs exports to the United States have increased by 465 percent. Thatâs why UPS is so bullish on Mexico and has devoted so many resources to the region of late. For example, UPS CrossBorder Connect service bundles the necessary transportation components north and south of the U.S.-Mexico border with the companyâs leading brokerage capabilities. This provides seamless integration and supply chain efficiencies and helps companies balance the need for speed with cost concerns. UPS launched the service in 2012 in direct response to the resurgence of Mexico as a manufacturing base. We see immense opportunity in the U.S.-Mexico trade lane in the years ahead. When it comes to fostering economic growth, Mexico is a modern-day success story. But the best part of the story is yet to be told. In 20 years, Mexico could be one of the primary incubators for innovation in the world. In large part, I see that happening through expanded business ties with the United States. You may not know that Mexico is already the leading trade partner for 32 U.S. states. But reading the tea leaves, even better times are on the horizon â for both countries.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: After the publication of the L'Orfeo score in 1609, the same publisher (Ricciardo Amadino of Venice) brought it out again in 1615. Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first \\"modern\\" edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra. In the 21st century editions continue to be produced, often for use in conjunction with a... answer the following question: What is the full name of the person, who using a German text, included some period instrumentation?

Summarize the following: As a loner, it can sometimes be hard to get out of the house as you may wonder what you can do by yourself without feeling weird. However, if you think about it you will find that there are lots of things you can go do alone to have some fun. Going to the movies is a great thing to do alone. Find a movie you've been wanting to see, pick up some popcorn, and enjoy the film. Going to the movies with people is all well and good, but when you think about it, it seems a bit silly since you don't talk to each other the whole time the movie is showing anyways. Try out different coffee shops. Coffee shops have become very popular in the past few years, so there are more and more popping up every day. Take a book or, if you like drawing, a sketchpad. Order a nice coffee or tea, and just enjoy a few hours out of the house. Try out a restaurant you've been interested in. If there is a restaurant you're interested in, there is no reason you should feel embarrassed to go alone. If you're worried that people will stare at you, try to go during an off-peak time. Go for a walk or a run. Another great thing to do alone is just to go out and enjoy nature. Go for a walk or jog in a nearby park and you'll be doing something good for you and your health. One part of going out in public that can make a loner feel nervous is the possibility that someone will try to chat casually with you. If you want to avoid this, put on a pair of headphones or have a book to read while you are waiting around or riding public transport. This will discourage people from engaging in idle chat. This doesn't guarantee that no one will talk to you. Some especially outgoing people are hard to deter. If someone talks to you and you aren't interested in the conversation, keep your answers short and don't ask questions that will encourage the conversation. If you are not used to going out by yourself to do things, you might feel as though everyone is staring at you, which will distract you from enjoying what you are doing. Try to remember that it is unlikely that anyone is truly interested in what you are doing or why you are doing it. As you spend more and more time outside the house by yourself, you'll come to realize that most people are just trying to get on with their day. Although it will take some practice, when you go out to do something, focus on how you're feeling about what you're doing instead of on what you think everyone around you is feeling. If you aren't able to focus on yourself you may find the experience of going out alone just as draining as going with other people. Depending on your work or school setting it may be very easy for you to go days or weeks without talking to anyone. For example, if you work from home you may not have to talk to anyone at all. While this may be comfortable for you, there is evidence that socializing is good for everyone (even loners) from time to time. It doesn't have to be a huge conversation. You can simply chat with someone in your class or at a coffee shop for a few minutes. For example, you can bring up how tough that last test was with a classmate, or you can ask the barista about her favorite beverage to make. Summary:","completion":"Being a loner doesn't have to stop you from enjoying various activities by yourself. Going to the movies, exploring new coffee shops, and dining alone at restaurants are just a few ways to spend time outside the house. To avoid unwanted conversations, use headphones or carry a book as a deterrent. Remember, most people are focused on their own activities, so try to focus on enjoying your own experience instead of worrying about what others might think. Although socialization might not be a preference for loners, engaging in small conversations occasionally can be beneficial. By trying out these activities, loners can step out of their comfort zones and find enjoyment in doing things independently."},{"prompt":"Q: Title: This watch delivers what was promised Review: This is at least my 4th CITIZEN watch, the first, having lasted manyyears, and second, smashed from a car accident after 8 years, the third still working fine and now, this one with the moon phase, the months,the days, etc.This watch delivers what was promised.

Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process is the excretion of the waste products. Step-by-step explanation: 1. Fluid and waste enter the kidneys via the renal arteries, which carry blood from the main blood supply (aorta) to the kidneys. 2. The kidneys process the fluid and waste through a series of filtration and reabsorption mechanisms. This occurs in the nephrons, the functional units of the kidneys. 3. During the initial filtration step, waste and fluid pass through a barrier that prevents larger molecules, such as proteins and blood cells, from passing through. This prevents essential components of the blood from being lost. 4. As the fluid moves through the nephrons, essential ions, glucose, and water are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream to maintain proper electrolyte balance and hydration levels. 5. Some bad waste products are actively removed from the bloodstream and added to the filtrate during the processing steps in the nephron. 6. The processed fluid, now containing the waste products and excess ions, becomes urine. 7. The last step of the process is transporting the urine out of the kidneys through the ureters, storing it temporarily in the bladder, and eventually excreting it from the body through the urethra during urination. This step ensures that the waste products and excess fluid are effectively eliminated from the body, maintaining proper fluid balance and overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What structural element of a building protrudes from the plane of a sloping roof surface, creating usable space in the roof by adding headroom and usually enabling addition of windows?","completion":"A dormer is a structural element of a building that protrudes from the plane of a sloping roof surface, creating usable space in the roof by adding headroom and often enabling the addition of windows. Dormers are commonly used to increase the available floor space and provide natural light and ventilation to an attic or loft area. Dormers come in various shapes and styles, each serving a specific function and aesthetic purpose. The most common types include: 1. Gable dormer: Also called a dog-house dormer, it has a gable roof that slopes in the same direction as the main roof. This is the most straightforward and affordable dormer, characterized by its triangular shape, which provides additional headroom and space in the attic. 2. Shed dormer: This dormer has a single, sloping flat roof that turns upward at a shallower angle than the main roof. Shed dormers are usually wider than gable dormers, giving them more usable space, making them ideal for creating larger rooms or adding more windows in the attic area. 3. Hip dormer: A hip dormer has a roof that slopes downward on all three sides, creating a more complex design. The roof merges seamlessly with the main roof, making it visually attractive and providing substantial additional space. 4. Eyebrow dormer: This type of dormer has a curved roof that resembles an eyebrow, with no vertical sides. The design is aesthetically pleasing and often used for its architectural appeal, but it provides less usable space than other dormer types. 5. Flat roof dormer: As its name suggests, a flat roof dormer has a single flat roof. While it might not be as visually appealing as other dormers, it provides a significant amount of usable space and additional light. 6. Arched or segmental dormer: A dormer with an arched or curved roof, providing an elegant design to the building's exterior and a subtle increase in usable space. Dormers can be constructed in various ways, depending on the construction materials and architectural style. The most common construction materials include wood, steel, and masonry. The choice of material for the dormer may depend on the existing roofing materials, the overall architectural style of the building, and the desired longevity and ease of maintenance. In addition to providing usable space, dormers offer several other benefits: 1. Enhanced architectural style: Dormers can add visual interest and personality to a building, enhancing its curb appeal. 2. Energy efficiency: Windows added to a dormer can improve natural lighting and ventilation, reducing the need for artificial heating and cooling systems. 3. Increased property value: Improving the usable floor space of a building and its aesthetic appeal through dormers can potentially increase its property value. In summary, a dormer is a structural element of a building that protrudes from the plane of a sloping roof surface to create additional headroom, usable space, and natural light in the attic area. The various types of dormers have different forms and functions, but they all serve to enhance the architectural style and provide practical living solutions within a building."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I heard that Skylar, walking along the path, looked down and saw the ring and made sure to return it. And I was wondering How would you describe Skylar? Available options: - Like a good girl; - thoughtful; - absent minded; Answer:","completion":"Skylar can be described as a combination of all the available options, demonstrating qualities of being a good girl, thoughtful, and absent-minded at the same time. Here's a more detailed explanation: 1. Like a good girl: In the given situation, Skylar displays a strong sense of responsibility and conscientiousness. Upon finding the ring, she goes out of her way to ensure its safe return to its rightful owner. This act showcases her as a good girl who values integrity, trustworthiness, and empathy for others. She understands that a lost item could be of great value and emotional significance to someone, and her actions exhibit a sense of moral uprightness. 2. Thoughtful: The incident also highlights Skylar's thoughtfulness towards others, as she takes the time to consider a person's potential distress upon losing something valuable. Her empathetic nature is well-reflected in her initial impulse to find the owner, rather than simply ignoring the lost item and moving on. In doing so, Skylar demonstrates that she is focused on the well-being of others, not just driven by selfish motives. She is mindful of the potential consequences of her actions and thinks through her decision, even if it means going out of her way. 3. Absent-minded: Although Skylar is diligent in returning the ring, the very fact that she is walking along a path and suddenly notices the ring suggests that she might have previously been lost in her thoughts, hence the absent-minded aspect. While she may have a kind heart and a caring nature, her mind could sometimes wander or become preoccupied with things that are not immediately relevant to her surroundings. This aspect of her character adds a touch of realism to her personality, as it shows that she is not perfect, but rather a well-rounded individual with both strengths and weaknesses. In conclusion, Skylar's character can best be described as a blend of being a good girl, thoughtful, and absent-minded. Her actions in returning the lost ring demonstrate her strong sense of responsibility, empathy, and thoughtfulness towards others. At the same time, her absent-minded tendencies remind us that even the most admirable people have imperfections that make them relatable and human."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the first names of the people who discover that their creation is aging at a vastly accelerated rate?, using the article: Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren., what would be the answer ?

Sentence: \\"He hurt himself with it when he tried to open it.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically? Pick from: (a). unacceptable (b). acceptable","completion":"A linguist would likely rate the given sentence \\"He hurt himself with it when he tried to open it\\" as (b). acceptable. While the sentence could be made clearer by specifying what \\"it\\" refers to, the sentence structure, grammar, and syntax are all used correctly in this case. First, let us analyze the sentence structure. The sentence combines two independent clauses using the conjunction \\"when.\\" This creates a complex sentence, which is a typical and acceptable structure in English. Second, the grammar and tense used in the sentence are consistent. The sentence is in the past tense, as evidenced by the verbs \\"hurt\\" and \\"tried.\\" The subject \\"he\\" is followed by the verb \\"hurt,\\" and the object \\"himself\\" aligns with the reflexive nature of the action. The pronoun \\"it\\" is used as the object of the preposition \\"with\\" and as the direct object of the verb \\"tried,\\" creating a parallel construction. However, one criticism that some linguists may raise is that the use of the pronoun \\"it\\" can result in ambiguity. A clearer sentence would replace \\"it\\" with the specific object being referred to in the context. For example, \\"He hurt himself with the knife when he tried to open the package\\" would eliminate any confusion or ambiguity. Nonetheless, even with the ambiguity, the sentence still adheres to the rules of English grammar, syntax, and structure.

Question 2: Who was awarded the economic sciences Nobel Prize in 2011? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Question 1: Why hasn't Dr. Vera Rubin been awarded a Nobel Prize for Physics? Dr. Vera Rubin was an American astronomer who made significant contributions to the study of dark matter, particularly through her pioneering work on galactic rotation curves. Her research provided some of the first compelling evidence for the existence of dark matter, a mysterious and elusive substance that makes up a significant portion of the universe. Despite her exceptional achievements, Dr. Rubin was never awarded a Nobel Prize for Physics. There could be several reasons for this: 1. Scientific recognition: The Nobel Prize is awarded to researchers whose work has had substantial impact in their field. Although Dr. Rubin's work was groundbreaking, the existence of dark matter is still an open question in physics. As astrophysics continues to advance, her contributions may receive more attention, but she may not have been considered yet for a Nobel Prize due to the ongoing debate and lack of definitive proof regarding dark matter. 2. Gender bias: Unfortunately, gender bias may have played a role in Dr. Rubin not being awarded a Nobel Prize. Throughout the history of the Nobel Prizes, few women have been awarded the prestigious physics prize. It's possible that the committee didn't give Rubin's work the same consideration as they might have with male scientists working on similar topics. 3. Timing and the Nobel Prize regulations: Vera Rubin passed away in 2016, and Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously. Her work was beginning to gain wider recognition in the years leading up to her death, but the prize was not awarded to her during her lifetime. This is due to the fact that there is limited time to recognize any deserving scientist before they pass away, and in many cases, scientific achievements get recognized only after a longer period of time. Question 2: Who was awarded the economic sciences Nobel Prize in 2011? The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2011 was awarded jointly to Thomas J. Sargent and Christopher A. Sims \\"for their empirical research on cause and effect in the macroeconomy.\\" They were recognized for their work in macroeconomics, specifically for their development of methods to analyze the impact of policy changes on the economy. In response to the last part of your question: No, the answer to these two questions is not the same. These questions discuss two different scientific fields (Physics and Economic Sciences) and the reasons behind not awarding a Nobel Prize to Dr. Vera Rubin and the recipients of the 2011 Economic Sciences Nobel Prize are not related. The absence of Nobel Prize recognition for Dr. Rubin can be attributed to various factors, including the ongoing debate around dark matter, gender bias, and rules pertaining to posthumous awards, while the 2011 economic sciences Nobel Prize was awarded to two male economists, Thomas J. Sargent and Christopher A. Sims, for their contributions to macroeconomic research."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

He noted that site as site A. To compare site A with a site with no technofossils he located another site. He noted that site as site B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would site A see less or more litter and debris depostied than site B? A:","completion":"Site A, where Mike discovered ample evidence of technofossils, would likely see more litter and debris deposited than site B, which is characterized by the absence of technofossils. The presence of technofossils indicates that the location was or still is a place where human activities involving technology have taken place, leaving behind technogenic materials and artifacts. Technofossils are essentially non-organic materials or remnants created by human activities and technological impact on the environment. They include various types of plastics, metals, electronic components, concrete structures, ceramics, and industrial waste, among other things. In such locations, one can expect to find a larger concentration of litter and debris – especially if those human activities were recent or still ongoing – as these materials have a slow rate of decomposition and persist for extended periods in the environment. In contrast, Site B, which has no technofossils, would presumably have less litter and debris, particularly from human-created sources. The absence of technofossils implies that Site B may either have been relatively unaffected by human activities or that such activities may have occurred in the distant past or at a much smaller scale.

Review: I wonder if the reader from Austin, Texas, read the same book as I did! I could find no trace of any personal attacks (nor personal glorifications, for that matter) in this highly original, provocative and exceptionally well-argued book. Interdisciplinary collaborations on complex themes are notoriously difficult to pull off, but this team has succeeded admirably. The philosophical analysis of the significance of the bonobo ape research for our currently dominant ways of thinking about language, communication and animal capacities is strikingly original. Certainly, these authors do not hold back from exploring the wider significance of their proposed interpretations, but there is a wealth of well-documented and rigorous argument here to support their contentions, and not a shred of evidence of -animus- against those whose views they dispute. A serious and significant book for everyone interested in animal cognition. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review is largely positive. This is evidenced by the use of a range of approving and affirmative phrases and language throughout the text that underline the reviewer's favorable perspective on the product, in this case, a book. The reviewer recognizes the book as not only being original and provocative but also exceptionally well-argued. The use of adjectives such as \\"exceptional\\" and \\"provocative\\" demonstrate positivity clearly, indicating that the reviewer appreciates the stimulating and high-quality nature of the book. Moreover, the praise for the successful execution of the interdisciplinary collaborations, a difficult task according to the reviewer, adds strongly to the overall positive tone of the review. The reviewer's statement of the philosophical analysis as being \\"strikingly original\\" not only confirms the value they placed on originality but reinforces their overall positive perception of the book. The phrase \\"these authors do not hold back from exploring the wider significance of their proposed interpretations\\" suggests the reviewer's admiration of the authors' daring and their thoroughness in their exploration of various themes. The mention of \\"a wealth of well-documented and rigorous arguments\\" shows how they highly commend the authors' comprehensive research and logical reasoning in the book. The reviewer's declaration of the book as a \\"serious and significant book for everyone interested in animal cognition,\\" further emphasizes the reviewer’s belief in the value of the book beyond simple personal interest.

Available options: A). yes; B). it is not possible to tell; C). no;","completion":"A). yes. The premise you provided states, \\"Tens of millions of humans, as we know, willingly partake of marijuana,\\" which directly supports the hypothesis that \\"millions of people take the marijuana drug.\\" The main argument in the premise focuses on the differences between rat and human behavior and how the two rat studies should not be used as definitive evidence of marijuana being addictive in the same way as harder drugs or priming humans for addiction to harder drugs. However, regardless of the argument's focus, the premise acknowledges that tens of millions of humans willingly use marijuana. This statement supports the hypothesis that millions of people consume marijuana; in fact, it provides an estimate that exceeds the minimum criteria of the hypothesis (since tens of millions of users translate to at least 20 million people). While the premise's main argument debates the usefulness of rat studies in understanding marijuana's potential consequences for human users, it clearly establishes the widespread usage of this drug amongst humans.

Answer a question about this article: Beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science, and finally to metaphysics.

Given the context: How would you describe Jesse? Select from the following. 1). thoughtful 2). protective 3). thankful The answer is:","completion":"Jesse can be described as thoughtful. While all three characteristics can apply to different contexts, in this specific scenario, Jesse's action of inviting their friend to spend Thanksgiving with them shows a genuine consideration for their friend's feelings and situation. Jesse demonstrated understanding and empathy, recognizing that their friend might be lonely or isolated during the holiday season due to their family being far away. By extending the invitation, Jesse made an effort to provide warmth, companionship, and support for their friend during a time that typically emphasizes family and togetherness. Being thoughtful means having the ability to think about the needs, feelings, or interests of others and being mindful of their well-being. It is the quality of showing care and consideration for others, sometimes even putting someone else's needs before your own. In Jesse's case, they took into account the feelings of their friend, who might not have had the opportunity to be with their family, and made arrangements to ensure that their friend had a pleasant Thanksgiving celebration. While protective and thankful are also positive attributes, they do not necessarily apply directly to this context. Protective refers to defending or shielding someone from harm or danger, which doesn't seem to be the case here. Thankful refers to expressing gratitude or appreciation, which could be a sentiment Jesse feels, but does not directly relate to their actions in this scenario.

After reading the above, is \\"Bad LSD trip\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Which event drives Larry to destroy the cult?\\"?","completion":"No, \\"Bad LSD trip\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"Which event drives Larry to destroy the cult?\\". Instead, the crucial event that leads Larry to take on the mission of destroying Dr. Barnett's cult is when Patricia attempts suicide after Dr. Barnett advises her to have an abortion, because she realizes she is pregnant. A series of events contribute to Larry's decision to act against Dr. Barnett's cult.

After Patricia discovers her pregnancy and is advised by Dr. Barnett to have an abortion, she attempts suicide. Larry manages to save her life, and this event serves as the catalyst for Larry to focus on destroying the cult led by Dr. Barnett.

What's the healthcare system like in Japan compared to the U.S.? How does the healthcare system work in Japan? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The healthcare systems in Japan and the United States have some similarities as well as significant differences in terms of access to care, financing, and overall organization. Before I dive into the comparison, let me clarify that the two questions you asked are not the same but are related. The first question asks for a comparison between the healthcare systems of Japan and the U.S., while the second question focuses only on Japan's healthcare system. Now, let me compare the healthcare systems in Japan and the United States, followed by an explanation of how the healthcare system works in Japan. 1. Universal health coverage: Japan has a universal health coverage system, meaning that all Japanese residents have access to healthcare services, regardless of their income, employment, or pre-existing conditions. This is achieved through a combination of compulsory health insurance (either through employer-based or community-based pools) and a government subsidy program. In contrast, the U.S. has a mixed healthcare system with private insurance, employer-sponsored coverage, and government programs like Medicaid and Medicare. However, some U.S. residents remain uninsured or underinsured. 2. Financing: Japan's healthcare system is primarily financed by premiums paid by individuals and employers, as well as by taxes. The government plays a major role in determining the fees for medical services and sets the premium contribution rates based on income. In the U.S., healthcare financing comes from various sources, including private insurance premiums, government spending (Medicaid and Medicare), and out-of-pocket expenses from patients. 3. Cost containment: Japan has been successful in controlling healthcare costs through strict government regulations on medical fees and drug prices, and by encouraging competition among providers. This has led to lower per capita healthcare spending compared to the U.S. The U.S. healthcare system is characterized by high costs, partly due to administrative expenses, high drug prices, and the high use of expensive procedures and technology. 4. Quality of care: Both Japan and the U.S. are known for having high-quality healthcare, but there are differences in how care is delivered and accessed. Japan has a high doctor-to-population ratio, allowing for easier access to primary care. However, the country faces challenges in terms of long waiting times for some specialized services and an aging population. The U.S. has top-notch medical facilities and cutting-edge technology, but access to care can be limited due to insurance status or high out-of-pocket costs. Now, let's further examine how the healthcare system works in Japan: 1. Health insurance: Japanese residents must enroll in one of the two types of compulsory health insurance: Employees' Health Insurance for those who work in medium-large companies and their dependents or National Health Insurance for the self-employed, retirees, or those who work in small businesses. Premiums for health insurance are based on income and set by the government, with employers and employees sharing the cost for the Employees' Health Insurance. The government also provides subsidies to the National Health Insurance to reduce the financial burden on those with lower incomes. 2. Access to care: All Japanese residents, regardless of their insurance type, have access to healthcare services, including physician visits, hospitalization, prescription medications, dental care, and maternity care. Residents are free to choose their healthcare providers and can receive care at any medical facilities. 3. Copayments and out-of-pocket costs: Patients in Japan are required to pay a percentage of the healthcare costs as copayments, usually set at 10-30% for most services, depending on their age and income. The Japanese government imposes a cap on total out-of-pocket expenses, thus limiting the financial burden of healthcare on individuals and families. 4. Healthcare providers: Japan's healthcare system relies on a combination of private and public healthcare providers, with approximately 80% of hospitals being privately owned. Hospitals and clinics need to be registered with one of the health insurance systems to receive reimbursements for services provided. In summary, the Japanese healthcare system is designed to provide universal access to healthcare services, with government intervention to regulate costs and ensure affordability. The U.S. healthcare system, on the other hand, has a less centralized approach, with a mix of public and private insurance providers, leading to higher costs and varying levels of coverage. While both systems have their pros and cons, they highlight the different strategies countries employ to provide healthcare to their populations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Many people have started taking vitamin C pills as a precautionary way. But a research has shown that vitamin C pills do not provide as much protection as they think. They are even not as good as other ways, like often washing your hands. Some German scientists have given people information and a test on the subject helping to stop incorrect ways. Whether it is caused by cold or flu , a runny nose and sore throat are signs of catching a cold. Many people overestimate the advantages of vitamin C and other pills. For years it was believed that taking vitamin C pills not only provided protection against colds but also against cancers, helping people to live longer. But the result of the research showed disagreement on these beliefs . The result has now come out on the website wwww.informedhealthonline.org. \\"Some pills may not help people live longer. Some pills may even lead to earlier death,\\" says Professor Peter Sawicki. Scientists also say that the best way to get vitamins is through food instead of having vitamin pills. That is to say, we disagree with the way of taking vitamin C pills. There are many simple but useful ways to lower the risk of catching a cold. These include often washing your hands with normal soap and water and not touching your face with your hands.

The space marines killed the aliens because they were ordered to.","completion":"In the sentence, \\"The space marines killed the aliens because they were ordered to,\\" the pronoun \\"they\\" refers to the space marines. The sentence implies that the space marines carried out the act of killing the aliens due to receiving orders from a higher authority. To understand who \\"they\\" refers to, we should examine the context and structure of the sentence. The sentence consists of two clauses, which can be broken down as follows: 1. \\"The space marines killed the aliens\\" - This is the main clause, and it clearly mentions the two subjects: space marines and aliens. The space marines, in this case, are the doers of the action (killing), while the aliens are the receivers of this action. 2. \\"because they were ordered to\\" - This is a subordinate clause, providing a reason for the action taken in the main clause. The word \\"because\\" is a subordinating conjunction, connecting this clause to the main one by explaining the motivation behind the killing of the aliens. Now, let's analyze the pronoun \\"they\\" in the second clause. Pronouns generally refer to the closest preceding noun or noun phrase that agrees with the pronoun in terms of number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter). In this sentence, the pronoun \\"they\\" is plural, so it cannot refer to a singular noun. The two plural nouns in the sentence are \\"space marines\\" and \\"aliens.\\" Given that the space marines (the doers of the action) are the ones following orders, it makes logical sense for the pronoun \\"they\\" to be referring to the space marines rather than the aliens. Consequently, it is the space marines who were ordered to kill the aliens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The Van de Graaff Generator Van de Graaff generators (or Van de Graaffs) are not only spectacular devices used to demonstrate high voltage due to static electricity—they are also used for serious research. The first was built by Robert Van de Graaff in 1931 (based on original suggestions by Lord Kelvin) for use in nuclear physics research. Figure 18.38 shows a schematic of a large research version. Van de Graaffs utilize both smooth and pointed surfaces, and conductors and insulators to generate large static charges and, hence, large voltages. A very large excess charge can be deposited on the sphere, because it moves quickly to the outer surface. Practical limits arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually ionize surrounding materials, creating free charges that neutralize excess charge or allow it to escape. Nevertheless, voltages of 15 million volts are well within practical limits.

Question: Information: - Enrico Fermi (29 September 1901 28 November 1954) was an Italian physicist, who created the world's first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1. He has been called the \\"architect of the nuclear age\\" and the \\"architect of the atomic bomb\\". He was one of the few physicists to excel both theoretically and experimentally. Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power, and was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and the discovery of transuranic elements. He made significant contributions to the development of quantum theory, nuclear and particle physics, and statistical mechanics. - Induced radioactivity occurs when a previously stable material has been made radioactive by exposure to specific radiation. Most radioactivity does not induce other material to become radioactive. This Induced radioactivity was discovered by Irène Curie and F. Joliot in 1934 and received the Nobel Prize in 1935 for this discovery. This is also known as man-made radioactivity. The phenomenon by which even light elements are made radioactive by artificial or induced methods is called artificial radioactivity. - Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1), when it achieved criticality, became the world's first artificial nuclear reactor. Its construction was part of the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to create atomic bombs during World War II. It was built by the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, under the west viewing stands of the original Stagg Field. The first human-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was initiated in CP-1 on 2 December 1942, under the supervision of Enrico Fermi, who described the apparatus as \\"a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers\\". - A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English. - Alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout Europe, Egypt and Asia. It aimed to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects. Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of \\"base metals\\" (e.g., lead) into \\"noble\\" ones (particularly gold); the creation of an elixir of immortality; the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease; and the development of an alkahest, a universal solvent. The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and, in the Hellenistic and western tradition, the achievement of gnosis. In Europe, the creation of a philosopher's stone was variously connected with all of these projects. - Oscar D'Agostino ( 29 August 1901 -- 16 March 1975 ) was an Italian chemist and one of the so - called Via Panisperna boys , the group of young scientists led by Enrico Fermi : all of them were physicists , except for D'Agostino , who was a chemist . In 1934 he contributed to Fermi 's experiment ( that gave Fermi the possibility to win the Nobel Prize in 1938 ) to showing the properties of slow neutrons . That led the way to the discovery of nuclear fission , and later on to the construction of the first atomic bomb . - The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. - The Via Panisperna boys (Italian: \\"I ragazzi di Via Panisperna\\") were a group of young scientists led by Enrico Fermi. In Rome in 1934, they made the famous discovery of slow neutrons which later made possible the nuclear reactor, and then the construction of the first atomic bomb. - Pharmacists, also known as chemists (Commonwealth English) or druggists (North American and, archaically, Commonwealth English), are healthcare professionals who practice in pharmacy, the field of health sciences focusing on safe and effective medication use. A pharmacist is a member of the health care team directly involved with patient care. Pharmacists undergo university-level education to understand the biochemical mechanisms and actions of drugs, drug uses, therapeutic roles, side effects, potential drug interactions, and monitoring parameters. This is mated to anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. Pharmacists interpret and communicate this specialized knowledge to patients, physicians, and other health care providers.

Question: How might a bird who has \\"got the moves\\" might benefit? Context: Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \\"dances\\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays. A:","completion":"A bird who has \\"got the moves\\" might benefit by having a higher chance of breeding success.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is a blight on trees happens, how will it affect there may be more owlets. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a blight on trees may have both direct and indirect effects on the process and the possibility of more owlets. Direct effects: 1. Destruction of nesting sites: Since owls typically nest in trees, a blight on trees would lead to loss or damage of nesting sites. This could make it challenging for the owls to find suitable locations to lay their eggs and raise their owlets. 2. Decreased food availability: A blight on trees might also impact the availability of prey (e.g., rodents, small mammals, and insects) that the owls hunt, as these animals depend on the trees for food and shelter. Indirect effects: 1. Increased predation risk: Loss of tree cover may expose the owls to a higher risk of predation from other animals, as they would be more visible and vulnerable without the protection of the trees. 2. Increased competition for resources: The destruction of trees could lead to increased competition among owls (and other species) for the limited available resources, like nesting sites and food. 3. Decreased overall fitness of the owl population: If the perturbation is widespread and long-lasting, the overall health and well-being of the owl population could be affected, leading to fewer successful owl nests and fewer owlets being born. Overall, a blight on trees is likely to have a negative impact on the ability of owls to reproduce and successfully raise their offspring, ultimately resulting in a decline in the number of owlets."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: A text is given in English.

This uncertainty leads him to acknowledge that he has no idea about what to do or suggest in the current situation. Among the provided answer options: 1. He has a good idea: This option is not accurate, as the man clearly states that he does have no idea when he says \\"I have no idea\\". Thus, he does not provide a suggestion or express confidence in a particular course of action. 2. He does not know what to do: This is the correct interpretation of the man's response. His phrase \\"I have no idea\\" indicates that he is uncertain about what steps to take next or what direction they should follow in their situation. This demonstrates a lack of knowledge or confidence in suggesting a course of action. 3. He does not know what to say: While this option might seem plausible given the nature of the conversation, it is not the most accurate interpretation of the man's response. He is not at a loss for words, but rather does not have a suggestion or proposal for the next step. His response expresses his uncertainty about what to do, not necessarily what to say in the conversation. In conclusion, the most accurate interpretation of the man's response is that he doesn't know what to do, as indicated by his statement, \\"Sony.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which plant would not see increase in growth, plant C or plant D? Hint: Gibberellins are hormones that cause the plant to grow. When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants. Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure below ). Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds. Gibberellins signal that it’s time for a seed to germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open. Answer:","completion":"Plant D would not see an increase in growth. This is because gibberellins were applied to plant C, which would stimulate its growth, but plant D did not receive any gibberellins. As a result, plant D's growth remains unaffected by the hormone application, whereas plant C is likely to experience increased growth due to the presence of gibberellins."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Trujillo incorporated elements of native art and hieratic figures in a very contemporary style in his canvases . Trujillo has incorporated in his canvases elements of contemporary art and local figures in a very hieratic style .","completion":"While both sentences describe Trujillo's incorporation of various elements in his artwork, they are not exactly the same in meaning. The key differences lie in the order and emphasis of certain components. Let's break down each sentence to better understand the distinctions. 1. Trujillo incorporated elements of native art and hieratic figures in a very contemporary style in his canvases. In this sentence, the primary focus is on the incorporation of two different aspects: native art and hieratic figures. Native art can refer to the traditional art forms, techniques, and symbolism from a specific cultural or regional background. On the other hand, hieratic figures suggest a more formal or stylized representation of subjects, often related to religion or sacred themes. The sentence also emphasizes that these elements are combined in a \\"very contemporary style.\\" This implies that, although the content might be rooted in traditional or sacred motifs, the execution showcases a modern and fresh approach. The style could potentially involve innovative techniques, materials, or perspectives that reflect a contemporary context or the artist's unique vision. 2. Trujillo has incorporated in his canvases elements of contemporary art and local figures in a very hieratic style. The second sentence shifts its emphasis from the direct combination of native art and hieratic figures to a more encompassing focus on contemporary art. This suggests that Trujillo's primary intention is to merge elements of current artistic practices, techniques, and trends with his work. However, the sentence also mentions that Trujillo includes \\"local figures\\" in his art, which might be a way of addressing traditional or regional subject matter. Although this aspect is similar to the first sentence, the second one narrows it down to figures specifically, while the first sentence implies a broader connection to native art as a whole. Instead of incorporating a contemporary style, this sentence highlights that Trujillo merges these elements \\"in a very hieratic style.\\" This suggests that the artist's main approach or aesthetic leans more towards a formal, stylized manner, possibly with a strong connection to religious or sacred themes. In summary, both sentences convey that Trujillo integrates various artistic elements in his work. The first sentence highlights the combination of native art and hieratic figures while emphasizing the contemporary style. The second sentence focuses on a broader incorporation of contemporary art elements and local figures, with a greater emphasis on the hieratic style. While there are similarities in the subject matter, the ordering and focus on different components lead to a subtle difference in meaning between the two sentences."},{"prompt":"Q:Information: - Gorakhpur division is an administrative geographical unit of Uttar Pradesh state in northern India.

Article: Children look for plastic bottles at the polluted Bagmati River in Kathmandu March 22, 2013. REUTERS/Navesh Chitrakar LONDON (Reuters) - A quarter of all global deaths of children under five are due to unhealthy or polluted environments including dirty water and air, second-hand smoke and a lack or adequate hygiene, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday. Such unsanitary and polluted environments can lead to fatal cases of diarrhea, malaria and pneumonia, the WHO said in a report, and kill 1.7 million children a year. “A polluted environment is a deadly one -– particularly for young children,” WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said in a statement. “Their developing organs and immune systems, and smaller bodies and airways, make them especially vulnerable to dirty air and water.” In the report — “Inheriting a sustainable world: Atlas on children’s health and the environment” — the WHO said harmful exposure can start in the womb, and then continue if infants and toddlers are exposed to indoor and outdoor air pollution and second-hand smoke. This increases their childhood risk of pneumonia as well as their lifelong risk of chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma. Air pollution also increases the lifelong risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer, the report said. The report also noted that in households without access to safe water and sanitation, or that are polluted with smoke from unclean fuels such as coal or dung for cooking and heating, children are at higher risk of diarrhea and pneumonia. Children are also exposed to harmful chemicals through food, water, air and products around them, it said. Maria Neira, a WHO expert on public health, said this was a heavy toll, both in terms of deaths and long-term illness and disease rates. She urged governments to do more to make all places safe for children. “Investing in the removal of environmental risks to health, such as improving water quality or using cleaner fuels, will result in massive health benefits,” she said. ||||| (CNN) Each year, environmental pollutants cost an estimated 1.7 million lives among children under 5, according to World Health Organization reports released Monday. The causes include unsafe water, lack of sanitation, poor hygiene practices and indoor and outdoor pollution, as well as injuries. The new numbers equate to these pollutants being the cause of one in four deaths of children 1 month to 5 years old. One new report highlights that the most common causes of child death are preventable through interventions already available to the communities most affected. These causes are diarrhea, malaria and pneumonia, which can be prevented using insecticide-treated bed nets, clean cooking fuels and improved access to clean water. \\"A polluted environment is a deadly one -- particularly for young children,\\" Dr. Margaret Chan, the WHO director-general, said in a statement. \\"Their developing organs and immune systems, and smaller bodies and airways, make them especially vulnerable to dirty air and water.\\" Infants exposed to indoor or outdoor air pollution, including secondhand smoke, have an increased risk of pneumonia during childhood as well as an increased risk of chronic respiratory diseases -- such as asthma -- for the rest of their lives, one report states. The global body also highlighted the increased risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer from exposure to air pollution. More than 90% of the world's population is thought to breathe air that violates quality guidelines set by the WHO. The reports further list ways in which these risk factors can be removed to prevent disease and death. \\"Investing in the removal of environmental risks to health, such as improving water quality or using cleaner fuels, will result in massive health benefits,\\" said Dr. Maria Neira, director of the WHO's Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. \\"A polluted environment results in a heavy toll on the health of our children.\\" Top environmental causes of death among children under 5 1. Respiratory infections 570,000 deaths in children under 5 linked to indoor and outdoor air pollution and secondhand smoke 2. Diarrhea 361,000 deaths in children under 5 linked to poor access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene 3. Death in first month of life 270,000 deaths in children under 1 month could be prevented by access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene in health facilities, and by reducing air pollution 4. Malaria 200,000 deaths in children under 5 could be prevented by environmental improvements, including reducing mosquito breeding sites or covering drinking water storage 5. Unintentional injuries 200,000 deaths among children under 5 linked to their environments, including poisonings, falls and drowning The growth of electronic and electrical waste is also a concern, according to the report. If not disposed of correctly, waste can expose children to toxins that can harm intelligence and cause attention deficits, lung damage and cancer. Also among the fears: an increasing risk of climate change, due to rising temperatures and carbon dioxide levels, boosting pollen growth and possibly asthma. An estimated 44% of asthma cases among children worldwide are thought to be related to environmental exposures, the reports say. In addition to highlighting the burden borne by young children, the new reports suggest ways in which risk factors -- and therefore death rates -- can be reduced. These include reducing air pollution, improving access to clean water and sanitation, protecting pregnant women from secondhand smoke and building safer environments in order to reduce accidents and injuries. \\"Both indoor and outdoor air pollution have an important effect on the health and development of children, and not just in the stereotypical 'polluted cities' context but also for very poor rural families who cook indoors,\\" said Joy Lawn, professor of maternal reproductive and child health epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \\"Clean water is taken for granted by families in high-income countries, and yet those children in the hottest climates, facing the greatest risks of infectious diseases, are the very ones with least access to clean water.\\" But Lawn added that pollution is not the only risk factor when it comes to child mortality. \\"We also need to be careful in attributing these deaths just to dirty water or pollution,\\" she said. \\"To prevent deaths from pneumonia, we also need vaccines and antibiotics; from malaria, we also need bed nets and anti-malarials. It Is not just about pollution.\\" Other potential solutions mentioned in the reports are removing mold and pests from housing, removing lead paint, ensuring sanitation and good nutrition at schools and using better urban planning to create more green spaces in cities. Safe management of industrial waste by industries is also highlighted, along with stopping the use of hazardous pesticides and child labor in agriculture. The report \\"highlights the scale of the problem of how environmental pollution affects the health of children across the globe,\\" said John Holloway, professor of allergy and respiratory genetics at the University of Southampton. Holloway recently authored a report on the lifelong impact of air pollution. \\"We must also remember that it is not just the acute effects of pollution on children's health mentioned in the report that we need to be concerned about, it is also the potential long-term effects of exposure to pollutants in early life that can have lifelong effects on health and well-being,\\" he said. Holloway also stressed that this is not a concern solely for developing countries. \\"Exposures such as air pollution and secondhand tobacco smoke affects the health of children in developed countries such as the UK as well,\\" he said. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. But, like the WHO, he also stressed that things can be done to help solve the problem and said authorities and individuals should act now -- as well as think long-term -- to protect the health of future generations. \\"We all have a responsibility for reducing environmental pollution,\\" he said. \\"This is going to require changes in society such as better monitoring of pollution and taking into account the true long-term economic cost of pollution when assessing the cost of measures to reduce environmental pollution.\\" ||||| The cost of a polluted environment: 1.7 million child deaths a year, says WHO 6 March 2017 | GENEVA - More than 1 in 4 deaths of children under 5 years of age are attributable to unhealthy environments. Every year, environmental risks – such as indoor and outdoor air pollution, second-hand smoke, unsafe water, lack of sanitation, and inadequate hygiene – take the lives of 1.7 million children under 5 years, say two new WHO reports. The first report, Inheriting a Sustainable World: Atlas on Children’s Health and the Environment reveals that a large portion of the most common causes of death among children aged 1 month to 5 years – diarrhoea, malaria and pneumonia – are preventable by interventions known to reduce environmental risks, such as access to safe water and clean cooking fuels. \\"A polluted environment is a deadly one – particularly for young children,\\" says Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. \\"Their developing organs and immune systems, and smaller bodies and airways, make them especially vulnerable to dirty air and water.\\" Harmful exposures can start in the mother’s womb and increase the risk of premature birth. Additionally, when infants and pre-schoolers are exposed to indoor and outdoor air pollution and second-hand smoke they have an increased risk of pneumonia in childhood, and a lifelong increased risk of chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma. Exposure to air pollution may also increase their lifelong risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer. Top 5 causes of death in children under 5 years linked to the environment A companion report, Don't pollute my future! The impact of the environment on children's health, provides a comprehensive overview of the environment’s impact on children’s health, illustrating the scale of the challenge. Every year: 570 000 children under 5 years die from respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution, and second-hand smoke. 361 000 children under 5 years die due to diarrhoea, as a result of poor access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene. 270 000 children die during their first month of life from conditions, including prematurity, which could be prevented through access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene in health facilities as well as reducing air pollution. 200 000 deaths of children under 5 years from malaria could be prevented through environmental actions, such as reducing breeding sites of mosquitoes or covering drinking-water storage. 200 000 children under 5 years die from unintentional injuries attributable to the environment, such as poisoning, falls, and drowning. Ongoing and emerging environmental threats to children’s health \\"A polluted environment results in a heavy toll on the health of our children,\\" says Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director, Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. \\"Investing in the removal of environmental risks to health, such as improving water quality or using cleaner fuels, will result in massive health benefits.\\" For example, emerging environmental hazards, such as electronic and electrical waste (such as old mobile phones) that is improperly recycled, expose children to toxins which can lead to reduced intelligence, attention deficits, lung damage, and cancer. The generation of electronic and electrical waste is forecasted to increase by 19% between 2014 and 2018, to 50 million metric tonnes by 2018. With climate change, temperatures and levels of carbon dioxide are rising, favouring pollen growth which is associated with increased rates of asthma in children. Worldwide, 11–14% of children aged 5 years and older currently report asthma symptoms and an estimated 44% of these are related to environmental exposures. Air pollution, second-hand tobacco smoke, and indoor mould and dampness make asthma more severe in children. In households without access to basic services, such as safe water and sanitation, or that are smoky due to the use of unclean fuels, such as coal or dung for cooking and heating, children are at an increased risk of diarrhoea and pneumonia. Children are also exposed to harmful chemicals through food, water, air and products around them. Chemicals, such as fluoride, lead and mercury pesticides, persistent organic pollutants, and others in manufactured goods, eventually find their way into the food chain. And, while leaded petrol has been phased out almost entirely in all countries, lead is still widespread in paints, affecting brain development. Making all places safe for children Reducing air pollution inside and outside households, improving safe water and sanitation and improving hygiene (including in health facilities where women give birth), protecting pregnant women from second-hand tobacco smoke, and building safer environments, can prevent children’s deaths and diseases. For example, multiple government sectors can work together to improve the following: Housing: Ensure clean fuel for heating and cooking, no mould or pests, and remove unsafe building materials and lead paint. Schools: Provide safe sanitation and hygiene, free of noise, pollution, and promote good nutrition. Health facilities: Ensure safe water, sanitation and hygiene, and reliable electricity. Urban planning: Create more green spaces, safe walking and cycling paths. Transport: Reduce emissions and increase public transport. Agriculture: Reduce the use of hazardous pesticides and no child labour. Industry: Manage hazardous waste and reduce the use of harmful chemicals. Health sector: Monitor health outcomes and educate about environmental health effects and prevention. Under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) countries are working on a set of targets to guide interventions for children’s environmental health, as well as to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under five by 2030. In addition to SDG 3, which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all, other SDGs work to improve water, sanitation and hygiene, transition to clean energy to reduce air pollution, and reverse climate change – all of which will have an impact on children’s health.

One day Monica shared a needle with a drug addict at a party. She later found out that she'd been infected with HIV. Jill was scared and helped her as much as she could. But I can use this background: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981.

If you're having trouble sleeping pop this in and I guarantee you'll be out in fifteen minutes. Robert Lowery was a pretty good actor in the 40s-- but he's phoning it in here. In an interview, Johnny \\"Duncan\\" Robin said that in one scene he and Batman had to run from the car to the house and that Lowery was doubled over out of camera range because his girdle was too tight! Duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy wonder-- in fact he's more like a guy in his thirties waiting for Lowery to kick off so he can wear the big cape. Driving a Batmobile that looks like it rolled off Honest Al's Used Car lot at below sticker price-- the Dynamic Duo don't put a lot of effort into hiding the fact that it's Bruce Wayne's car they're driving-- in fact it's noted by several characters throughout the serial. The acting is wooden-- the sets are cheap-- the dialogue is horrendous and if there was even a script they were following I'm sure it read along the lines of \\"Batman says something here\\" because it certainly seems like they're making it up as it goes along. Batman's Utility belt is made out of thin fabric with no apparent pouches to hold his gadgets-- in one scene when Batman needs a full size blow torch the producers just tuck one in as the scene starts-- never to be seen again. His cowl is so bad he can't even see out of it and his ears look more like flopsy mopsy the disgruntled easter rabbit than they do anything batlike. In one scene (I am not making this up), Batman substitutes counterfiet radioactive money that will burst into flames the second it is exposed to air as a payoff to some hoods. It's radioactive so he can trace it-- the reason it's so highly flammable isn't explained. Well, unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse-- we know it's a cardboard warehouse because Batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that look to weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out-- and soon the whole place burns to the ground. Thanks Batman! In another scene after the Batmobile is disabled, Batman flags down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car-- leaving the man to fend for himself and telling him not to worry because if Batman smashes up the car the police will surely buy him another one! Yes, you guessed it, said car careens off a cliff within a few short seconds. Not that it matters much to the motorist who has probably died from exposure trying to hoof his way back to Gotham City. There is a tired subplot with Lois Lane clone Vicki Vale who is convinced Bruce Wayne is Batman-- she must have noticed the Batmobile parked outside of Bruce's house-- or maybe she saw Batman and Robin running up the walk in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood. Everything about this serial is bad-- and all but the youngest in the audience will want to hurl toast at the screen.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is no blood in the body happens, how will it affect a GREATER greenhouse effect. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"I understand that you are asking about the potential effects of a hypothetical scenario in which there is no blood in the human body and its connection to the greenhouse effect. To ensure clarity, I will first briefly explain the greenhouse effect process and how it is related to global warming. Then, I will address the perturbation hypothesis and its lack of direct or indirect effects on the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface. When the Sun's energy reaches the Earth's atmosphere, some of it is reflected back to space and the rest is absorbed and re-radiated by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, and nitrous oxide. This trapped heat raises the Earth's average temperature, creating a warm environment suitable for life as we know it. Global warming, on the other hand, is the increase in Earth's average temperature due to human activities releasing excess greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. This intensifies the greenhouse effect, causing the planet to warm at a faster rate, which can lead to various environmental issues and impacts on human society. Regarding the perturbation hypothesis, you propose a situation where there is no blood in the human body. It is important to note that such a hypothetical scenario is scientifically implausible, as blood is necessary for the proper functioning and survival of the human body. Blood serves many vital functions, such as transporting oxygen, nutrients, and waste, maintaining body temperature, and supporting the immune system. Analyzing the connection between this hypothesis and the greenhouse effect, there is no direct or indirect link. The absence of blood in the human body would not have any impact on the greenhouse effect or global warming. The factors influencing the greenhouse effect are primarily related to the composition of Earth's atmosphere, human activities, and the planet's ecosystem processes. The proposed perturbation does not fall within the sphere of these elements and thus would not have any effect on the greenhouse effect or global warming."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Recently unable to get over his fiancée's tragic and unexplained death, Michael moves to a small town called Hemlock in search of new beginnings. He quickly learns that Hemlock is unfamiliar with peace - it has a dark history of young men disappearing, their drained bodies, weeks later, found in the woods. During a local event, he meets Elaine (early-30s). They form an intense chemistry, and he's introduced to her friends - Isabella, Blair, and Fiona. Beautiful and mysterious, these women are the talk of the town. There are rumors about their true identities - witches? Immortal beings? Act II: Michael is convinced Elaine is innocent and doesn't belong in this group. As the two grow closer, she alludes to dark secrets she and her friends share but reveals no information. Investigating further, Michael connects more clues that place the women at the center of the disappearances. One night, he follows them into the woods. They chant by a fire, their eyes silvery, unveiling themselves as vampires. Just when their power seems to manifest, Fiona reveals she is pregnant. This fact challenges the group's beliefs, creating tension and raising doubts on whether they should continue feeding on human blood.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Plants start growing on or near the rocks - The roots of the growing plants start to break up the rock - The plant acids dissolve the rock - The rock is broken down into smaller pieces - Erosion begins. Question: suppose the rock has pockets of soil in its cracks happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER erosion of rocks. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"The presence of soil pockets within the cracks of the rocks can indeed lead to less or slower erosion of these rocks. The primary reason behind this phenomenon is that the soil possesses specific properties that can help protect the rock and slow down the process of erosion, which is generally caused by physical, chemical, and biological factors. 1. Physical Protection: Soil can serve as a protective layer on the rock's surface, shielding it from direct wear and tear caused by natural elements such as rain, wind, and temperature fluctuations. In the case of rocks with soil-filled cracks, the soil can also provide reinforcement to the rock's structure, preventing further cracking and disintegration. 2. Water Retention: Soil has the ability to retain moisture, which can be beneficial in the erosion prevention process. By holding water, the soil can help maintain a damp environment, which is less conducive to the erosive forces of wind and water. This damp environment also promotes the growth of plants and their roots, which can keep the soil intact and further slow down erosion. 3. Chemical Protection: Soil often contains various minerals and organic matter, which can help buffer the rock from the effects of plant acids and other chemicals that contribute to erosion. The presence of these buffering agents can neutralize potential chemical reactions between the rock and its surroundings, slowing down the rock's breakdown. 4. Biological Protection: The presence of soil encourages the growth of plants, fungi, and microorganisms. These organisms can release certain compounds, such as humus, which can enhance the soil's structure and decrease the overall rate of erosion. Furthermore, plant roots and fungal mycelium can bind soil particles together, creating a stable and resilient network that can protect the rock's surface. However, it's important to note that these protective effects of soil are not absolute, and erosion can still occur over time. The rate of erosion in these instances would likely be slower compared to rocks without soil-filled cracks. In relation to the second effect mentioned, which is the \\"roots of growing plants starting to break up the rock,\\" the presence of soil can have a lesser effect on this process. As the soil provides support and protection to the rock, it will make it harder for plant roots to penetrate the rock and cause it to break up. Consequently, the overall rate of erosion would be slower due to the soil's presence, contributing less to the rock-breaking effect of plant roots."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the full professional name of the person who sand lead vocals in his bands cover of \\"Act Naturally\\"? is inside the article: Sir Richard Starkey (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. He has featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows.

Families in Lancashire spend the night in temporary accommodation after they were evacuated from homes when River Darwen became one of several rivers to burst their banks. Further rain forecast to hit Britain today and tomorrow morning before sunshine breaks through the clouds. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Unprecedented Rainfall Drenches Northern UK: Flood Warnings, Evacuations, and What Lies Ahead Introduction Torrential rain lashed parts of the United Kingdom overnight, with Cumbria being drenched in four inches of rain and swamped by flooding. Other regions, including south-west Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Lancashire, faced unusually heavy precipitation that led to widespread chaos, displacement, and flood warnings. As weather forecasts predict further rain today and tomorrow, this article sheds light on the current situation, the actions taken by authorities, and the likely weather prospects. Unprecedented Rainfall In what can only be described as an extraordinary deluge, Cumbria received four inches of rain overnight – more than half the average for the entire month. Neighbouring regions like south-west Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Lancashire also experienced intense rainfall, causing rivers to breach their banks and inundating low-lying areas. Flood Warnings and Evacuations The Environment Agency has issued more than 140 flood warnings and alerts across the northern regions of the UK, as river levels continue to rise and threaten communities. In Lancashire, families had to spend the night in temporary accommodation provided by local authorities after they were evacuated from their homes. This precautionary measure became necessary as the River Darwen, among several others, overflowed its banks. Response from Emergency Services and Authorities The emergency services and local authorities have tirelessly supported those affected in the face of this natural calamity. Swift evacuation procedures were conducted, ensuring the safety of residents, and temporary accommodations were set up to house the displaced families. Emergency crews have also been deployed for rescue and relief operations, while damage assessment and repair works are expected to commence as soon as the situation stabilizes. Weather Outlook With weather forecasts predicting further rainfall in the coming hours, the situation remains precarious. However, there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon, as meteorologists anticipate sunshine to break through the clouds by tomorrow morning. While it remains to be seen how the situation will unfold, authorities are urging residents to stay alert, monitor weather updates, and follow official instructions to safeguard themselves and their properties. Conclusion As northern parts of the UK reel under the impact of unprecedented rainfall and flooding, the immediate focus of authorities and communities remains on ensuring safety, providing shelter, and planning for recovery. The current disaster serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictable and destructive nature of weather events and reinforces the need for timely investments in infrastructure, flood prevention measures, and robust emergency response mechanisms."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They might steal someone else's idea for a science project, or copy a book report from the Internet and hand it in as if it's his or her work. Cheating can happen in a lot of different ways. When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who study for the test or who are the true winners of a game. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even though there seems to be a \\"good reason\\" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea. A kid who thinks cheating is the only way to pass a test need to talk with the teacher or another grown-up.

B) Kids cheat because they enjoy deceiving others; the consequences include becoming popular among their peers and never facing any negative repercussions. C) Kids cheat because they want to challenge themselves academically; the consequences include improved critical thinking skills and increased academic performance.

The Netherlands provided William Bruce with many of his influences. He was in the Low Countries at a time when Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the Amsterdam City Hall (1648–65), the work of Jacob van Campen, and Maastricht's City Hall (1659–64), by Pieter Post. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with family ties to the House of Orange, and it seems likely that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.Bruce was certainly familiar with northern France, and in 1663 he made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale, although his itinerary is unknown. Whether by visit or through studying engravings, he knew several notable French houses including Vaux-le-Vicomte, Blérancourt, and the Chateau de Balleroy, the last the work of French architect François Mansart. These modern French designs, incorporating features then unknown in Scotland, such as the double-pile of major rooms in two enfilades, ranged back-to-back, were also influential on Bruce's designs.English influence is also visible in his work. His country houses took the compact Anglo-Dutch type as their model, as introduced into England by Hugh May and Sir Roger Pratt, but with Continental detailing, such as the rustication on the facade at Mertoun. Roger Pratt's Coleshill House of 1660 is often cited as a model for Bruce's Kinross House. Konrad Ottenheym concludes that Bruce employed an \\"international style\\", which was fashionable in France, Holland, and England, and that he was pivotal in disseminating this style in Scotland.

It does not explicitly mention any specific offerings that employers may benefit from the public or private businesses. Step 4: Identify key characteristics of the public and private sector To see if the statement relates to potential offerings, we can consider the following key characteristics of public and private sector employers: 1. Financial incentives: Public and private sector employers often have larger budgets and can offer competitive salaries, bonuses, and other financial benefits. 2. Career growth: These employers provide greater opportunities for career advancement and better job security. 3. Access to resources: Public and private sectors often have access to extensive resources, such as advanced technologies, well-funded projects, and skilled staff.

Since was only a toddler when this show originally aired I just recently picked up the DVD set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed. This show was a 70s version of the poplular 90's TV series \\"X-Files\\"- but with a bit more of a comedic/light hearted approach. But don't get me wrong, some of these episodes have full on horror themes, many in which have some pretty greuesome plots (left to the imagination of course- this was the early 70s television). Some of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting, but that is the charm and attraction to this series. Whether you like mystery crime dramas, comedies, or sci-fi/horror themes, this series brought all that together. Each episode clocked in at around 50 minutes or so (1 hour with commercials) and that 50 minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more. A great classic show that is underrated in my book!

IA-32 is the first incarnation of x86 that supports 32-bit computing; as a result, the \\"IA-32\\" term may be used as a metonym to refer to all x86 versions that support 32-bit computing. - Opteron is AMD's x86 server and workstation processor line, and was the first processor which supported the AMD64 instruction set architecture (known generically as x86-64). It was released on April 22, 2003 with the \\"SledgeHammer\\" core (K8) and was intended to compete in the server and workstation markets, particularly in the same segment as the Intel Xeon processor. Processors based on the AMD K10 microarchitecture (codenamed \\"Barcelona\\") were announced on September 10, 2007 featuring a new quad-core configuration. The most-recently released Opteron CPUs are the Piledriver-based Opteron 4300 and 6300 series processors, codenamed \\"Seoul\\" and \\"Abu Dhabi\\" respectively. In January 2016, the first ARMv8-A based Opteron SoC was released. - Athlon is the brand name applied to a series of x86-compatible microprocessors designed and manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). The original Athlon (now called \\"Athlon Classic\\") was the first seventh-generation x86 processor. The original Athlon was the first desktop processor to reach speeds of one gigahertz (GHz). AMD has continued using the \\"Athlon\\" name with the Athlon 64, an eighth-generation processor featuring x86-64 (later renamed AMD64) architecture, and the Athlon II. AMD also uses the \\"Athlon\\" name for some of its series of APUs targeting the Socket AM1 desktop SoC architecture. - The Athlon 64 X2 is the first dual - core desktop CPU designed by AMD . It was designed from scratch as native dual - core by using an already multi-CPU enabled Athlon 64 , joining it with another functional core on one die , and connecting both via a shared dual - channel memory controller / north bridge and additional control logic . The initial versions are based on the E-stepping model of the Athlon 64 and , depending on the model , have either 512 or 1024 KB of L2 Cache per core . The Athlon 64 X2 is capable of decoding SSE3 instructions ( except those few specific to Intel 's architecture ) . In June 2007 , AMD released low - voltage variants of their low - end 65 nm Athlon 64 X2 , named \`\` Athlon X2 '' . The Athlon X2 processors feature reduced TDP of 45 W. The name was also used for K10 based budget CPUs with two cores deactivated . - Pentium is a brand used for a series of x86-compatible microprocessors produced by Intel since 1993. In its current form, Pentium processors are considered entry-level products that Intel rates as \\"two stars\\", meaning that they are above the low-end Atom and Celeron series but below the faster Core i3, i5 and i7 lines as well as the high-end Xeon processors. - x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. - Intel Corporation (also known as Intel, stylized as intel) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California (colloquially referred to as \\"Silicon Valley\\") that was founded by Gordon Moore (of Moore's law fame) and Robert Noyce. It is the world's largest and highest valued semiconductor chip makers based on revenue, and is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors: the processors found in most personal computers (PCs). Intel supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple, Lenovo (formerly IBM), HP, and Dell. Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing. - 3DNow! is an extension to the x86 instruction set developed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). It adds single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions to the base x86 instruction set, enabling it to perform vector processing, which improves the performance of many graphic-intensive applications. The first microprocessor to implement 3DNow was the AMD K6-2, which was introduced in 1998. When the application was appropriate this raised the speed by about 2-4 times. - Pentium 4 was a line of single-core central processing units (CPUs) for desktops, laptops and entry-level servers introduced by Intel on November 20, 2000 and shipped through August 8, 2008. They had a seventh-generation x86 (32-bit) microarchitecture, called NetBurst, which was the company's first all-new design since the introduction of the P6 microarchitecture of the Pentium Pro CPUs in 1995. NetBurst differed from P6 (Pentium III, II, etc.) by featuring a very deep instruction pipeline to achieve very high clock speeds. Intel claimed that NetBurst would allow clock speeds of up to 10 GHz in future chips; however, severe problems with heat dissipation (especially with the Prescott Pentium 4) limited CPU clock speeds to a much lower 3.8 GHz. - The Athlon 64 is an eighth-generation, AMD64-architecture microprocessor produced by AMD, released on September 23, 2003. It is the third processor to bear the name \\"Athlon\\", and the immediate successor to the Athlon XP. The second processor (after the Opteron) to implement AMD64 architecture and the first 64-bit processor targeted at the average consumer, it was AMD's primary consumer microprocessor, and competes primarily with Intel's Pentium 4, especially the \\"Prescott\\" and \\"Cedar Mill\\" core revisions. It is AMD's first K8, eighth-generation processor core for desktop and mobile computers. Despite being natively 64-bit, the AMD64 architecture is backward-compatible with 32-bit x86 instructions. Athlon 64s have been produced for Socket 754, Socket 939, Socket 940 and Socket AM2. The line was succeeded by the dual-core Athlon 64 X2 and Athlon X2 lines. - SSE3, Streaming SIMD Extensions 3, also known by its Intel code name Prescott New Instructions (PNI), is the third iteration of the SSE instruction set for the IA-32 (x86) architecture. Intel introduced SSE3 in early 2004 with the Prescott revision of their Pentium 4 CPU. In April 2005, AMD introduced a subset of SSE3 in revision E (Venice and San Diego) of their Athlon 64 CPUs. The earlier SIMD instruction sets on the x86 platform, from oldest to newest, are MMX, 3DNow! (developed by AMD), SSE and SSE2. - SSE2 (Streaming SIMD Extensions 2), is one of the Intel SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) processor supplementary instruction sets first introduced by Intel with the initial version of the Pentium 4 in 2001. It extends the earlier SSE instruction set, and is intended to fully replace MMX. Intel extended SSE2 to create SSE3 in 2004. SSE2 added 144 new instructions to SSE, which has 70 instructions. Competing chip-maker AMD added support for SSE2 with the introduction of their Opteron and Athlon 64 ranges of AMD64 64-bit CPUs in 2003.

Is this movie review sentence negative or positive? Options: (1). negative (2). positive The answer is:","completion":"(1). negative The movie review sentence provided expresses disappointment when comparing the movie to other recent war films or even other works by the same director, John Woo. The word \\"disappointing\\" is used as the key marker for determining the tone of the review. The term implies that the reviewer had certain expectations that were not met by the movie, thus resulting in a negative overall impression. The review also compares the movie unfavorably to other projects from John Woo, a well-known film director known for his unique action and combat sequences. By stating that the movie is disappointing even when compared to Woo's other works, the reviewer seems to suggest that the film fails to uphold the quality or excitement that audiences have come to expect from the director. Furthermore, the use of \\"or any other John Woo flick for that matter\\" demonstrates that the reviewer's disappointment is not only rooted in the comparison to recent war movies but also in the broader context of the director's filmography. This comparison deepens the negativity of the review, as it indicates that the movie underperforms on multiple levels. Overall, the answer is negative since the reviewer does not express any satisfaction or enjoyment from the movie. The unmet expectations, the unfavorable comparison to other films in the war genre, and the poor representation of John Woo's signature style contribute to the negative tone of this movie review sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you've provided suggests that an increase in population leads to less petrol consumption. Let's analyze whether this change has any direct or indirect effect on the processes mentioned earlier. 1. People breathe and expel carbon dioxide: An increase in population will lead to more people breathing and expelling carbon dioxide. This directly increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 2. Engines produce carbon dioxide: If the supposition of less petrol consumption holds true, it could mean that people are using more fuel-efficient vehicles, public transportation, or alternative modes of transport that do not rely on petrol. In this case, there might be a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions from engines, resulting in a lesser contribution to greenhouse gases. 3. Living things produce waste: An increase in population leads to an increase in waste production, which introduces more waste decomposing and increasing methane emissions as a result. 4. Waste decomposes: More population generates more waste, and therefore, a greater amount of waste decomposes, releasing methane as a byproduct. 5. Decomposition produces methane: As mentioned earlier, the increase in waste decomposition results in increased methane production. 6. Water evaporates: The increase in population itself does not directly affect water evaporation. However, increased human activities, such as agriculture and industrial processes, may indirectly affect the water cycle and the rate of evaporation. 7. Water vapor joins the atmosphere: Indirectly, an increase in population might cause changes in the water evaporation rate, leading to more water vapor joining the atmosphere. 8. Carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane are greenhouse gases: As discussed above, the direct and indirect effects of a population increase lead to higher levels of carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Despite the supposed decrease in petrol consumption, the processes involving waste decomposition and respiration will still contribute to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis that suggests a decrease in petrol consumption due to an increase in population would potentially have indirect effects on the process of greenhouse gas emissions. This is because the increase in population, even with a decrease in petrol consumption, will still contribute to higher carbon dioxide and methane emissions levels through other processes such as respiration, waste decomposition, and activities that affect the water cycle."},{"prompt":"Wade county was situated to the east of Gray county.

On the radio frantic calls come from Earth asking them to report immediately. Finally the pressure eases and the commander of the flight Laird Grainger (Sonny Tufts) begins checking on the crew. Helen Salinger (Marie Windsor) the only female crew member and navigator is the first to respond as she shakes off the effects of the launch.Grainger wants an immediate situation report from everyone. Helen confirms they are on course, which Grainger reports to White Sands control. He then hands off to the co pilot Kip Reissner (Victor Jory) Helen then offers a few words before allowing before letting Doug Smith (William Phipps) the ships radio operator speak. Finally Walt Walters (Douglas Fowley) the ships engineer sends a message home.The ship is hit by something which Grainger believes to be a meteor thats now lodged itself in the rocket tubes. They decide to maneuver the ship wildly to dislodge the meteor. This succeeds but there appears to be damage to the ships engines. Kip volunteers to go and check the engines and donning protective equipment he enters the chamber. Kip finds a dangerous leak and begins repairs.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what does changes in the structure of the Y chromosome do?\\" is \\"male infertility\\", given that changes in the structure of the Y chromosome are implicated in male infertility? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, it appears that the statement \\"Changes in the structure of the Y chromosome are implicated in male infertility,\\" is accurate. In order to provide a more detailed answer, it is essential to understand the role of the Y chromosome and how structural changes can impact male fertility. The Y chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes in humans and is responsible for determining male sex. It carries genes vital to the development of male reproductive systems, including the spermatogenesis (sperm production) process. The Y chromosome contains the SRY gene, which triggers the development of testes. Also, it has various regions with genes related to other aspects of sperm production and function, such as AZF regions. Changes in the structure of the Y chromosome can lead to male infertility by disrupting the normal functioning of these genes or even causing gene deletions. The structural changes can include: 1. Y chromosome deletions: Deletion of specific regions in the Y chromosome, such as Azoospermia Factor (AZF) region deletions, can result in the loss or disruption of genes essential for sperm production. These deletions can lead to impaired spermatogenesis and result in low sperm count (oligospermia) or no sperm production (azoospermia). 2. Y chromosome inversions: An inversion is a type of chromosome rearrangement where a segment of the chromosome is flipped in orientation. If such rearrangements occur in the Y chromosome, they could disrupt functioning genes and hinder the proper development of male reproductive organs and sperm production, leading to infertility. 3. Y chromosome translocations: Translocation is a rearrangement between non-homologous chromosomes, and it can cause disruptions in gene function. If a translocation occurs involving the Y chromosome, it could result in infertility if the affected genes are essential for sperm production or other aspects of male reproduction. In summary, the answer to the question \\"What does changes in the structure of the Y chromosome do?\\" would be \\"Changes in the structure of the Y chromosome can lead to male infertility, as they can disrupt the normal functioning of genes and regions responsible for sperm production and male reproductive development.\\" Given the complexities of the Y chromosome and its importance to male fertility, further study and understanding of its structure and function can lead to better diagnostic tools and treatment options for male infertility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","completion":"The process of normalizing Armenian-Turkish relations has been considered from various perspectives. The normalization of Armenian-Turkish relations is a complex and multifaceted issue that has been approached and analyzed from numerous viewpoints by both scholars and policymakers. At the core of this issue is the historical tension that has existed between Armenia and Turkey, which has significantly impacted their diplomatic relations, trade, and cultural exchange over the years. Several factors have contributed to the strained relationship between the two countries, the most prominent of which is the recognition of the Armenian Genocide that occurred during the Ottoman Empire era in 1915. This contentious topic has been the subject of debate and negotiation for decades, as Armenian officials and the international community have called for Turkey to acknowledge and take responsibility for the atrocities committed during this period. While Turkey has taken steps toward expressing condolences and admitting past wrongdoings, the official recognition of the Armenian Genocide remains a significant obstacle in the normalization process. Additionally, the conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Armenia and Azerbaijan, a close ally of Turkey, has further complicated the normalization of relations. Turkey has been supportive of Azerbaijan, imposing economic sanctions on Armenia and closing their borders since the early 1990s. The unresolved nature of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has hindered the development of diplomatic relations and economic cooperation, which is essential for stability in the South Caucasus region. Various political approaches and initiatives have been proposed and attempted to facilitate the normalization process, such as the \\"football diplomacy\\" initiated by Turkish President Abdullah Gul in 2008 when he attended a soccer match in Armenia. These efforts, however, have yet to produce a tangible and lasting impact on the overall relations between the two countries. Despite the challenges, ongoing dialogue and communication remain crucial in the pursuit of normalizing Armenian-Turkish relations. Several avenues for cooperation can be explored and developed, including cultural and educational exchanges, increased trade relations, and regional collaboration in areas such as energy and infrastructure projects. These efforts can contribute to fostering mutual trust and understanding, which is essential for overcoming historical grievances and establishing stable and peaceful relations between Armenia and Turkey. In conclusion, the normalization of Armenian-Turkish relations is an intricate issue with deep historical roots and various interconnected factors that have hindered the process. A comprehensive and inclusive approach, addressing both the historical grievances and contemporary challenges, is essential in order to build a foundation for meaningful dialogue and cooperation between the two countries. The potential for mutually beneficial relations exists; however, overcoming the existing obstacles will require commitment, understanding, and goodwill from both sides."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - photosynthesis - sexually - asexually - with spores A: A:","completion":"Fungus-like protists, such as slime molds, have an intriguing and diverse method of reproduction. Unlike plants, they do not reproduce via photosynthesis. Instead, they employ a combination of sexual and asexual reproductive mechanisms and produce spores during certain phases in their life cycle. Slime molds can be classified into two main groups: Plasmodial slime molds (Myxomycetes) and Cellular slime molds (Acrasiomycetes and Dictyosteliomycetes). Both types of slime molds exhibit a complex life cycle with distinct stages, involving asexual and sexual phases. 1. Plasmodial slime molds (Myxomycetes): In these slime molds, the vegetative phase is a single, large, multinucleated cell called a plasmodium. The plasmodium feeds on organic matter like fungi and bacteria through the process of phagocytosis. Asexual reproduction: Under favorable conditions, the plasmodium can undergo a form of asexual reproduction called fragmentation. In this process, the plasmodium breaks into smaller pieces, with each fragment having the potential to develop into a new plasmodium. Sexual reproduction: In response to unfavorable environmental conditions, such as food scarcity, the plasmodium undergoes a transformation into a sporangium - a fruiting body that produces spores. This structure forms through a series of nuclear divisions and cytoplasmic partitioning. The spores, which are formed through meiosis, are released into the environment and can germinate into new myxamoebae or flagellated cells under suitable conditions. These cells can fuse with others (in a process called plasmogamy), leading to the formation of a zygote and then a new plasmodium. 2. Cellular slime molds (Acrasiomycetes and Dictyosteliomycetes): In contrast to plasmodial slime molds, cellular slime molds exist as individual, single-celled amoeboid organisms called myxamoebae during the vegetative phase. Asexual reproduction: Asexual reproduction in cellular slime molds is not common. However, some species can reproduce by binary fission, in which a single cell divides into two daughter cells. Sexual reproduction: When environmental conditions become unfavorable, the cellular slime mold can initiate its sexual life cycle. Each myxamoeba releases a chemical signal that triggers aggregation of several other myxamoebae, which then form a multicellular structure called a pseudoplasmodium or slug. This slug is capable of migration in search of better conditions. After migrating, the slug differentiates into a fruiting body called a sorocarp, which has a stalk and a mass of spores at the top called a sorus. These spores are produced sexually through meiosis. Upon finding a suitable environment, the spores germinate to release haploid myxamoebae or flagellated cells. These haploid cells can fuse with others to produce a diploid zygote and initiate the life cycle anew. In summary, fungus-like protists such as slime molds reproduce both sexually and asexually, with spores playing a significant role in the process. Their reproductive methods are diverse and intricately linked to their unique life cycles and environmental conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Donald was much thinner than William was because OPT: + Donald liked eating cake way too much. + William liked eating cake way too much.","completion":"Donald was much thinner than William was because he maintained a strict diet and consistently engaged in regular exercise routines. Even though Donald liked eating cake way too much, he cleverly managed to control his portion sizes and usually chose healthier dessert alternatives that satisfied his sweet tooth without jeopardizing his waistline. On the other hand, William liked eating cake way too much and, unlike Donald, did not balance his indulgences with appropriate physical activity and healthy eating habits. Donald's commitment to a balanced lifestyle enabled him to achieve his desired weight and maintain it in the long run. He was disciplined in both his diet and exercise regime, often switching up his workouts to include a mix of cardio, strength training, and flexibility exercises to ensure he was not only thin but also fit and healthy. He was mindful of his nutrition, focusing on the consumption of whole foods like lean proteins, grains, fruits, and vegetables to provide his body with the essential nutrients it required. While Donald enjoyed the occasional slice of cake, he ensured that these indulgences were rare and did not impact his overall progress. He recognized the importance of moderation and practiced various strategies to resist the temptation to overindulge in sugary treats. For instance, he would often satisfy his sweet cravings with healthier alternatives such as fruit salad or yogurt topped with berries and granola. By finding ways to enjoy food without guilt, he was able to prevent unhealthy binge-eating episodes and maintain a stable weight. In contrast, William struggled with portion control and keeping his cake consumption in check. He frequently chose to indulge in large servings of cake and other high-calorie desserts, often neglecting to balance his diet with regular exercise and healthier meal choices. This led to a gradual weight gain, causing him to become noticeably heavier than Donald. William's lack of awareness and self-control around food prevented him from achieving the same level of fitness and health as his thinner counterpart. In addition to the difference in their eating habits, Donald's commitment to a healthy lifestyle also gave him a psychological edge. He had higher self-esteem and a better sense of self-confidence, which motivated him to continue pursuing his goals and maintain his thinner physique. Meanwhile, William struggled with feelings of guilt and low self-worth as a result of his constant battles with food and his inability to maintain a healthier weight. In conclusion, Donald was much thinner than William was because of his dedication to a well-balanced lifestyle, incorporating regular exercise, healthy eating habits, and proper mindfulness regarding nutrition. Even though both Donald and William liked eating cake way too much, it was Donald's ability to manage his sweet indulgences while maintaining a healthy lifestyle that ultimately set him apart from his heavier friend."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. One of the key aspects of your alien characters should be how they look. To make your aliens seem convincing and interesting, you should try to be as detailed about their physical characteristics as you can. Because you are writing fiction, you have the ability to create as many strange and interesting details about your alien characters as you like. Avoid using familiar images or descriptions of aliens and use your imagination. Think about how the aliens walk and move their bodies. You should also think about how their bodies are proportioned. They do not necessarily need to walk on two legs and have limbs like humans. They may have physical characteristics that have evolved due to their world or environment. For example, maybe your aliens have antennas on their heads because they can feel shifts in the wind in their world, allowing them to hunt for food more effectively. You should also think about whether there are different genders in the alien world and how the bodies of different genders appear. You do not have to be limited by male or female genders. Maybe the alien race has a third gender that is asexual or a combination of male and female genders. Avoid creating the alien characters in the shadow of humans and get creative with language, thinking beyond English or other languages found on Earth. You may decide to create an alien language that may then be translated with the help of a computerized device or an implant in the human brain. Your alien race may also communicate in other ways besides language or words. Maybe they use their antennas to send messages to each other or have the ability to communicate through telepathy. Perhaps they use a system of body movements to communicate. The humans in your story may also be key characters in the narrative, so you should create humans that are just as interesting as the aliens. Your main character may be a human with a special ability or a unique characteristic. Creating nuanced humans in your story will make it that much stronger. For example, maybe your main character is a human who has been gifted with the ability to read minds. This human is then able to access the conversations of the alien overlords, who have enslaved the human race. This ability could allow the human to save the humans from the aliens and become the hero of the story. Once you have sketched out your characters, you should identify the central conflict. Doing this will give the story an end goal and frame the narrative for the reader. It will also allow you to use your characters to build tension in the story. The central conflict may be between your alien characters or between an alien character and a human character. For example, maybe the central conflict of your story is that aliens have taken over the human world because their planet is no longer habitable. This alien invasion may then result in a human hero who tries to fight the aliens with a special ability and help from other humans in his community. Or, maybe the central conflict is that humans have enslaved aliens who have crash landed on their planet. The humans may then try to hide the aliens and experiment on them. This may then result in one alien who tries to oppose his human captors.

To do so, they compiled data on 136 coastal cities with more than 1 million residents, looking at the elevation of the cities, the population distribution and the types of flood protection they had, such as levees or storm-surge barriers. They then combined that data with forecasts of sea level rise, ground sinking due to groundwater depletion, as well as population growth projections and economic forecasts of gross domestic product (GDP). From there, they used the depth of water flooding a city to estimate the cost of the damage.

Almost all cities facing the worst damage are in Asia and North America, the study showed. Three American cities — New York, New Orleans and Miami — are at particularly high risk of damage, according to the study, published today (Aug. 18) in the journal Nature Climate Change. \\"If we did nothing about the risk, the flood damages in coastal cities would grow to huge amounts. So that's really not an option,\\" said study co-author Robert Nicholls, a coastal engineering professor at the University of Southampton in England. Damaging storms Climate change models generally predict that storms will grow more frequent and fierce over the next several decades. We may already be seeing its impact: Many scientists believe that climate change worsened the toll of Hurricane Sandy. [How Weird!: 7 Rare Weather Events] After Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast in 2005, Nicholls and his colleagues realized that scientists had little idea which cities around the world were most vulnerable to flooding. So the team compiled data on 136 coastal cities with more than 1 million residents, looking at the elevation of the cities, the population distribution and the types of flood protection they had, such as levees or storm-surge barriers. They then combined that data with forecasts of sea level rise, ground sinking due to groundwater depletion, as well as population growth projections and economic forecasts of gross domestic product (GDP). From there, they used the depth of water flooding a city to estimate the cost of the damage. Two vulnerable continents The researchers found that in both their best- and worst-case projections of sea level rise, the yearly global cost reached higher than 1 trillion. The most vulnerable city was Guangzhou, China, followed by Mumbai and Kolkata in India, Guayaquil, Ecuador and Shenzen, China. Almost all cities at the highest risk of flooding damage were in North America or Asia. [See The 20 Cities Most Vulnerable to Flooding] If cities take steps to prevent damage — by increasing the height of levees, erecting storm surge barriers, making buildings flood-resistant or converting flood-prone, low-lying areas to parks or football fields — the cost of the damage could be brought down to about 50 billion annually. It would be cheaper and more sensible to make these changes before Katrina-like storm surges become the norm, Nicholls said. \\"The bottom line is it shows that flood risk is rising today — it's happening\\" Nicholls told LiveScience. \\"All these cities need to be preparing for that.\\" Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter and Google+.

They looked at 136 big cities near the coast and checked how high their land is, how many people live there, and what kind of protection they have against floods. They guessed how bad flooding could be by looking at how deep the water might get in the cities. They found out that the cost of damage from floods could be more than 1 trillion every year. The city in the most danger is Guangzhou in China, followed by Mumbai and Kolkata in India, Guayaquil in Ecuador, and Shenzen in China. Most of the cities that could be badly flooded are in North America or Asia. If cities do things to protect themselves from floods, like building higher walls or making buildings safe from floods, then the cost of damage could be much lower.

As a result, Cynthia's experience and relentless dedication gave her an undeniable edge in the competition. As the two fighters circled each other in the ring, Rachel's natural athleticism and quick reflexes kept her out of reach from Cynthia's powerful blows. Step by step, Rachel was able to dodge and counteract many of the moves Cynthia made. Both opponents showed off their unique skills and strength, keeping the crowd on the edge of their seats. But despite Rachel's impressive performance, Cynthia began to gain the upper hand. Her months of rigorous training started to pay off as she executed precise, well-timed combinations that chipped away at Rachel's defense. Cynthia's relentless focus on improving her skills had given her a deeper understanding of her opponent's weaknesses and her own strengths. Noticing that Rachel was starting to tire, Cynthia capitalized on the opportunity to launch a series of aggressive attacks. Rachel fought valiantly to deflect the blows, but her energy was waning, and it was clear she could not keep up the pace. Finally, in a decisive moment, Cynthia managed to land a powerful strike that knocked Rachel off balance. Seizing the opportunity for a finishing move, Cynthia sent a swift kick towards Rachel's side, causing her to crumple to the ground. As the referee counted to ten, it was clear Rachel would not be able to recover in time. The crowd erupted in cheers as Cynthia was declared the winner of the match. Despite her defeat, Rachel displayed sportsmanship and grace, congratulating her opponent on a well-fought victory. Cynthia's win served as a humbling reminder of the power of dedication and hard work. The process had tested her physical and mental endurance, but ultimately she came out on top. And even though Rachel had not been as prepared, the fight had proven her potential as a formidable contender. With newfound motivation, Rachel vowed to return to the ring stronger and more dedicated than ever before, setting the stage for a thrilling rematch in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, we tell about the most popular places to visit in the country, and hear about what makes them so appealing. Each of the 50 states in America has interesting things to offer visitors, but some are more popular than others. Washington, D.C. is famous for its historical places, like the White House and the Lincoln Memorial. Visitors to Los Angeles, California can see the Hollywood Walk of Fame or shop the stores on Rodeo Drive where they may see a star or two. The Grand Canyon in Arizona appeals to hikers, climbers and nature lovers, as does Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. Trip Advisor is a website where people can write reviews about their travel experiences. There are also ratings for hotels, restaurants, and places people have visited around the world. Every year, Trip Advisor makes a list of the top 25 cities to visit in the United States. The results are based on the opinions of visitors to the website. America's major cities are still the most popular destinations for visitors.

The scientist who discovered them was given the right to name them, and he chose the names Enterprise and Vader. As said before, these stars are very similar, but the main difference is that Vader is a red giant, and Enterprise is not. Scientists are very eager to study these two newly discovered stars and see if they can learn anything new from them. and a hint : A red giant star is a star with a mass like the Sun that is in the last phase of its life, when Hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel. With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star. After a few more million years, the star evolves into a white dwarf-planetary nebula system. Please answer this question : Does Enterprise have more or less fusion reactions in the shell around its core than Vader does?

While both hypotheses are presented as potential explanations for unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and related events, they are based on distinct concepts and assume different origins of these phenomena. The Interdimensional Hypothesis (IDH or IH) posits that UFOs and related phenomena originate from other realities or dimensions, existing separately but parallel to our own. This idea, advanced by Ufologists such as Jacques Vallée, implies that the observed events are interactions between our reality and these neighboring dimensions. According to this hypothesis, beings or entities from these other realms may possess technology or powers that allow them to cross over into our reality, giving rise to the various sightings and mysteries surrounding UFOs. On the other hand, the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis (ETH) proposes that UFOs are spacecraft or technology created by intelligent alien beings from other planets within our own physical universe. This viewpoint assumes that these extraterrestrial beings visit or interact with Earth, either for exploration, scientific study, or other unknown purposes. The ETH often includes the possibility of direct contact between humans and aliens, abduction experiences, and other related events. In summary, while both the interdimensional and extraterrestrial hypotheses attempt to explain the enigmatic nature of UFOs and their related incidents, they are based on fundamentally different assumptions about the origins of these phenomena.

Review: I bought these strings for a 30\\" short scale bass, and had 3 problems.1) The E string was too long for my bass, and had to be shortened at the bridge end.2)The strings were too large for the nut on the guitar, and I had to have a new one made.3)The E string is too floppy for this scale. Really floppy. This same gauge might be ok on a 34\\" scale, but not for a 30\\" scale.The A,D, and G strings worked ok lengthwise. They weren't too floppy either.If you have a short scale bass, pass on these. Is this product review negative? Answer:","completion":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer faced multiple issues with the guitar strings, which led to an overall unsatisfactory experience. The three problems mentioned by the reviewer include: 1) The E string being too long for their 30\\" short scale bass, requiring them to shorten it at the bridge end. This indicates that the strings were not a perfect fit for their bass, causing inconvenience and potentially damaging the instrument. 2) The strings being too large for the nut on the guitar, necessitating the creation of a new one. This adds an additional cost and more effort for the user, which reflects poorly on the product's compatibility with their specific guitar model. 3) The E string being too floppy on the 30\\" scale, which may compromise the sound and feel of the bass when played. The reviewer suggests that this gauge might be suitable for a 34\\" scale but not for their 30\\" scale. This brings into question the versatility of these strings and whether they are appropriate for all bass guitar types. In the review, the A, D, and G strings seemed to work acceptably lengthwise and were not too floppy. However, the numerous issues with the E string and the need to modify the guitar to accommodate the strings make this a predominantly negative review. The reviewer's recommendation for other short-scale bass owners to pass on these strings further emphasizes the negative nature of the review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The group consists of Bono (lead vocals and guitar), the Edge (guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in post-punk, U2's sound grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music, yet has maintained an anthemic sound. Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns. - Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information. It was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\". Now this theory has found applications in many other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography, neurobiology, the evolution and function of molecular codes, model selection in ecology, thermal physics, quantum computing, linguistics, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection. - Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa (DATA) was a multinational non-government organization founded in January 2002 in London by U2's Bono along with Bobby Shriver and activists from the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign. - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. - Paul David Hewson (born 10 May 1960), known by his stage name Bono, is an Irish singer-songwriter, musician, venture capitalist, businessman, and philanthropist. He is best known as the lead vocalist of rock band U2. Bono was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland, and attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School where he met his future wife, Alison Stewart, and the future members of U2. Bono writes almost all U2 lyrics, frequently using religious, social, and political themes. During U2's early years, his lyrics contributed to their rebellious and spiritual tone. As the band matured, his lyrics became inspired more by personal experiences shared with the other members. - Jubilee 2000 was an international coalition movement in over 40 countries that called for cancellation of third world debt by the year 2000.

Article: Clint Eastwood's potent new film is based on a true story about a newly elected black president struggling to unite citizens divided by racism. The name Obama never comes up — it couldn't, since the time is 1995 and the place is South Africa. The president is Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman), who was voted into office the year before, in the country's first free election. The challenge facing Mandela is to find a way to make peace with the apartheid forces that put him in jail for three decades. Mandela figures that battle should take place on, of all things, the rugby field. Peter Travers reviews Invictus in his weekly video podcast, \\"At the Movies with Peter Travers\\" For the blacks in South Africa, rugby was a symbol of the Afrikaners, the white forces behind apartheid. Mandela believed that if he could harness the power of the Springboks, the South African team captained by François Pienaar (Matt Damon), and host the 1995 rugby World Cup games, he could cross a racial and cultural divide. The source material for Invictus (Latin for \\"unconquered\\") is John Carlin's book Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation. That's pushing it, since the factors that have separated powerful whites and resentful blacks for centuries in South Africa can hardly be reconciled by one game. But there's little doubt that the game pitting the Springboks against New Zealand's team was a major start in the healing process. Get more news, reviews and interviews from Peter Travers on The Travers Take Eastwood, shooting on location in Johannesburg and Cape Town and enlisting Chester Williams (the single black player on the Springboks) to coach Damon, wisely lets action define character. The rugby action electrifies the movie. Damon may be shorter than Pienaar's six-foot-four Afrikaner god, but he brings athletic grace to the role, and a sense of burning conscience. Freeman seems born to play Mandela, and he never delivers a false note, even when Anthony Peckham's script nudges him into sainthood. Freeman lets us see the wily politician percolating underneath Mandela's calm surface. Eastwood's modest approach to these momentous events shames the usual Hollywood showboating. In a rare achievement, he's made a film that truly is good for the soul. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Whether he's appearing in \\"The Informant!,\\" a Sarah Silverman Web parody or in Clint Eastwood's stirring post-apartheid drama, \\"Invictus,\\" he has been consistently spot-on and almost breathtakingly self-effacing. He has become that most unlikely Hollywood rarity: a character actor with a matinee-idol face. In \\"Invictus,\\" Damon plays Francois Pienaar, the captain of the South African rugby team the Springboks, which in 1995 won the World Cup. The movie tells the story of that unlikely and politically crucial victory, which as much as anything was the result of the gentle coaxing and adamantine moral suasion of the country's new president, Nelson Mandela. Morgan Freeman doesn't play Mandela as much as inhabit the man, in a performance that seems to embody the very transcendence that Mandela himself has come to stand for. Freeman captures with perfect pitch the inner workings of a man who, put in charge of a country still ravaged by the still-fresh violence and injustices of apartheid, sees an opportunity for healing in the rites and rituals of sport. His job is to forge within the black community a sense of identification with a mostly white team that for years has represented oppression. Eastwood adopts a flat, uninflected style for \\"Invictus,\\" wisely letting this remarkable story tell itself with a minimum of flourish or underlining. The result is a thoroughly absorbing, inspiring movie that, like last year's \\"Milk,\\" features one of the year's most galvanizing performances. Freeman doesn't merely impersonate Mandela as much as personify not just political genius but an almost superhuman suppleness of character. Rugby is exciting, sure, but there's nothing more thrilling than radical forgiveness in action. *** PG-13. At area theaters.

Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"Yes, this answer can be validated but with a few modifications since it doesn't fully capture the essence of the question. The question asks for what metal music is about, and the answer provided offers historical background information rather than delving into the core themes and elements of metal music. To provide a more comprehensive answer, you may consider the following inclusions: Metal music is characterized by its heavy use of distortion, extended guitar solos, dark themes, and powerful vocal performances. The genre emerged in the late 1960s, drawing inspiration from blues-rock and psychedelic rock bands. As the suggested answer mentioned, early pioneers of metal music include Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath; these groups established metal as a distinctive genre with an emphasis on heavier instrumentation and darker lyrical content. The bands mentioned attracted large audiences, but critics often dismissed their work – a trend that persisted across the genre's history. What metal music is about can be summarized by its key characteristics: 1. Heavy and aggressive sound: Metal music often features distorted guitars, powerful drumming, and fast tempos, which create an aggressive, intense atmosphere. The genre typically employs electric guitars with a heavily overdriven or distorted tone, accompanied by pounding bass and powerful, driving drum beats. 2. Dark themes: Metal music tends to explore darker themes in its lyrics, such as death, war, pain, and suffering. The genre often deals with the darker aspects of human nature and experiences, providing an outlet for fans to engage with these emotions and navigate their own struggles. 3. Powerful vocals and unique singing styles: Metal singers are known for their impressive vocal range, and the genre features various singing techniques, such as growls, screams, operatic vocals, and traditional clean singing. This diversity in styles helps to convey the emotions present in the music, further amplifying the themes and messages of the songs. 4. Iconic imagery: Metal music is also characterized by its strong visual aesthetics, which can include distinct band logos, album art, and stage performances. This imagery often leans towards dark and macabre themes, reflecting the underlying concepts in the music. 5. Subgenres and diversity: Over time, metal music has evolved and expanded, encompassing various subgenres such as thrash metal, death metal, power metal, progressive metal, and many others. This diversity allows artists to explore different themes, sounds, and styles within the larger context of the genre.

Egg white is the clear liquid (also called the albumen or the glair/glaire) contained within an egg. In chickens it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen's oviduct during the passage of the egg. It forms around fertilized or unfertilized egg yolks. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition for the growth of the embryo (when fertilized).

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. Now, I have a new situation: Two campers were in the woods over the week-end. They both had canned soup with them.

She insisted that Hepburn was the perfect girl to play the lead role in Gigi, a play based on her novel. That event marked the beginning of Hepburn's successful career. Shortly after, Hepburn was chosen to play the lead role of a young princess in the Hollywood film Roman Holiday. It was a big success and earned her an Oscar for Best Actress. She also won a Tony Award for the play Ondine.[:..] During her lifetime, Hepburn earned four more Oscar nominations. In 1989, she made her final appearance in her last film Always and played the role of an angel. Throughout her acting years, she acted in only one TV series, Gardens of the world with Audrey Hepburn.

Homer intends to take his silo to the waste management plant, but after Lenny calls to tell him that Lard Lad Donuts has been shut down and is giving away free donuts, Homer impatiently dumps the silo straight into the lake, polluting it worse than before. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated; Flanders and Bart (who bond after Homer humiliates Bart) discover the creature before the EPA captures it. Russ Cargill, head of the EPA, presents five \\"unthinkable\\" options to U.S. President Arnold Schwarzenegger to keep the town's pollution contained; the slow-witted president, doesn't bother reading number 3 before picking it; enclosing Springfield in a large glass dome. When the police discover Homer's silo in the lake, and his responsibility for sealing Springfield in the dome, an angry mob advances on the Simpsons' home to kill Homer, but the family escapes the town through a sinkhole, which then destroys their house. With the EPA on their trail, the Simpsons flee to Alaska. On the way, Homer tries to make some money at a carnival by riding a motorcycle around the inside of a metal...

Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit. Denise (formerly Edna) moves to New York City and becomes a songwriter in the Brill Building. At a party, she meets the arrogant songwriter Howard Caszatt, and despite an awkward initial meeting they become romantically involved. She also reunites with Doris. Denise offers to and writes a song specifically for Doris and her two girlfriends, persuading Milner to audition and hire the group. In 1965, Howard and Denise begin writing together; they pen a song called \\"Unwanted Number,\\" based on a young girl's unwanted pregnancy. Although it is banned, it attracts the attention of prominent and influential disc jockey John Murray who, despite the negative attention of the song, credits Denise with sparking the craze for girl groups., what would be the answer ?

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home. She is in the most active of the four levels available, but should the need arise, she can move on to assisted living facilities within the same complex. Question: \\"Julia Child is known for her throaty laugh which Europeans and Americans alike heard on her \\"French Chef\\" television series.

The president... (Associated Press) Obama's three-day tour of Iowa by bus made the unscheduled stop Monday at the state fairgrounds in Des Moines just a few hours after the Republican vice presidential candidate, Paul Ryan, appeared at the fair. Obama spent an hour walking along a stretch of the fairgrounds, greeting throngs of parents and their children, crouching at one point to meet 9-month-old Cole Nelson, who was resting in the arms of his mother, Deborah. When the child swept his hand across the president's nose, Obama said: \\"What do you think? That's a pretty big nose.\\" The president resisted the temptation of cinnamon rolls at one stand, telling people he was \\"saving my space for pork chop on a stick.\\" His stroll brought him to a quick photo-op with the Iowa State Fair queen, 17-year-old Abrah Meyer of Readlyn, Iowa, who wore a tiara, a sash and a royal purple dress. Obama wrapped up his state fair visit with a swing by the Bud Tent, where a large crowd chanted, \\"Four more years.\\" He told them with a smile, \\"Everyone who's over 21, you gotta buy a beer,\\" prompting someone in the crowd to yell, \\"Is it on you?\\" The president looked into his wallet as some people in the crowd started chanting, \\"Four more beers!\\" Obama told them, \\"I'll tell you what, except for the Romney sign, I'll buy beers for ten people.\\" He walked over to the crowd, but it wasn't clear whether he bought the beers or not, any transaction occurring out of the sight of reporters. But it was clear that Obama ended up with a plate with two pork chops, handed to him by Greg Lear, the president-elect of the Iowa Pork Producers. Taking a beer in a plastic cup, the president thanked the bartender and ate a quick dinner with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, the state's former governor. \\"It's going to go well with my pork chop,\\" Obama said. ||||| DES MOINES, Iowa - Paul Ryan received a rowdy reception at his appearance at the Iowa State Fair today with some protesters trying to storm the stage as the newly minted vice presidential candidate spoke. But Ryan soldiered on in his speech, even telling ABC News his Wisconsin background prepped him for the hecklers. \\"Nah. We're used to it. I come from Wisconsin,\\" Ryan said of the hecklers as he weaved through the fair. Surrounded by hay bales lining the stage, Ryan spoke at the soapbox, an Iowa state fair staple, where Ryan's running mate, Mitt Romney, was heckled last year after making a comment that has stuck with him throughout this campaign. \\"Corporations are people, my friend,\\" Romney said last year on the same stage, as protesters shouted him down. Ryan's stop at the fair was his first solo trip as Romney's running mate, and he was greeted by a crush of supporters, media and protesters. As he made his way to the famous Iowa Fair soapbox, he was surrounded by cameras, reporters and those trying to get a look at the GOP ticket's No. 2 man. He shook hands and introduced himself to voters with a casual statement: \\"Hi, I'm Paul.\\" Ryan's first foray into Iowa came on the same day when President Obama began his bus tour through the Hawkeye state. \\"I heard that President Obama is starting his bus tour today and I heard he wasn't going to come to the Iowa State Fair,\\" Paul said. \\"Are you going to cut Medicare?\\" a woman shouted. \\"It's funny because Iowans and Wisconsinites, we like to be respectful of one another and peaceful with one another and listen to one another. These ladies must not be from Iowa or Wisconsin,\\" Paul said, referring to the protesters. And that's when things got much rowdier. A female protester began to climb on the small stage. She was able to get up before being dragged off by Ryan's Secret Service detail. Ryan, dressed in a red checked shirt and jeans, continued with his pitch to the rest of the crowd, many holding Romney signs or even standing in front of protesters. \\"My guess is the reason that President Obama isn't making it here from Council Bluffs is he only knows left turns, but as you see the president come through on his bus tour you may ask him the same question I get asked all over America and that is where are the jobs Mr. President.\\" An older male protester with a white beard was also heckling Ryan, telling him to, \\"End the wars\\" and \\"Stop the wars on the common good.\\" Ryan also tried to identify with the voters in this battleground state. \\"I feel such kindred spirits here,\\" the Wisconsin congressman, 42, said. \\"We are united as upper midwesterners, but, you know what it is? At the end of the day, we are Americans.\\" Ryan was joined at the fair by RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, as well as Romney friend and confidante Bob White. Get more pure politics at ABCNews.com/Politics and a lighter take on the news at OTUSNews.com. As Ryan walked out the state fair along Grand Avenue, a protester on the side yelled at him, calling him a \\"f-ing disgrace.\\" But it wasn't just protests that met Ryan. Supporters reached out their hands to touch Ryan and shouted words of encouragement to the vice presidential candidate. \\"I think he's conservative. He's right on the money,\\" one woman told ABC News. \\"He's correct on the money, and we need to cut back, stop spending money that we don't have.\\" \\"Did you see his blue eyes?\\" one woman shouted at another after Ryan passed her. And many people at the fair still didn't know quite who Ryan was two only days after he joined the Republican ticket. \\"He's cute right?\\" one man jokingly said to his friend \\"I guess so,\\" another woman said. While he participated in the typical campaign fare of shaking hands and stopping to talk to babies, the health conscious Ryan stayed away from one of the fairs staples: fried food. He stopped to talk to voters at a few stands, but didn't sample any of the tasty fried treats. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"This news article is about President Barack Obama and Paul Ryan visiting the Iowa State Fair on the same day.

By offering guidance and support, people can help children develop essential life skills, cope with challenges, and stay focused on their education. 6. Collaborate with businesses: Partnering with local businesses can result in sponsorships, donations, or joint fundraising efforts. Together, they can help generate more significant resources to support children in need. 7. Raise awareness: Those who want to make a difference can use social media and other platforms to share inspiring stories, spread information, and engage others in the cause. By raising awareness, they can potentially inspire more people to join the movement and contribute to a positive change. Remember, every effort counts.

Given the question: Information: - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body. This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months. While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule. It also affects the underlying bone and cartilage. The diagnosis is made mostly on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms. X-rays and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms. Other diseases that may present similarly include systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia among others. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. A group of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence. RA affects between 0.5 and 1% of adults in the developed... - Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints. Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness. Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints. In some types other organs are also affected. Onset can be gradual or sudden. There are over 100 types of arthritis. The most common forms are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and affects the fingers, knees, and hips. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that often affects the hands and feet. Other types include gout, lupus, fibromyalgia, and septic arthritis. They are all types of rheumatic disease. Treatment may include resting the joint and alternating between applying ice and heat. Weight loss and exercise may also be useful. Pain medications such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used. In some a joint replacement may be useful. Osteoarthritis affects more than 3.8% of people while rheumatoid arthritis affects about 0.24% of people. Gout affects about 1 to 2% of the Western population at some point in their lives. In Australia about 15% of people are affected, while in the United States more than 20% of have a type of arthritis. Overall the disease becomes more common with age. Arthritis is a common reason that people miss work and can result in a decreased quality of life. The term is from Greek \\"arthro-\\" meaning joint and \\"-itis\\" meaning inflammation. - Palindromic rheumatism ( PR ) consists of sudden and rapidly developing attacks of arthritis . There is acute pain , redness , swelling , and disability of one ( usually ) or multiple joints . The interval between recurrent attacks is extremely variable and how long the attack lasts is also variable . There is no joint damage after attacks . - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a medical condition characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include feeling tired to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory. Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present. The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors with half the risk attributed to each. The condition runs in families and many genes are believed to be involved. Environmental factors may include psychological stress, trauma, and certain infections. The pain appears to result from processes in the central nervous system and the condition is referred to as a \\"central sensitization syndrome\\". Fibromyalgia is recognized as a disorder by the US National Institutes of Health and the American College of Rheumatology. There is no specific diagnostic test. Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes and verifying that a set number of symptoms are present. The treatment of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage. Fibromyalgia is estimated to affect 28% of the population. Females are affected about twice as often as males. Rates appear... - Septic arthritis, also known as infectious arthritis or joint infection, is the purulent invasion of a joint by an infectious agent which produces arthritis. People with artificial joints are more at risk than the general population but have slightly different symptoms, are infected with different organisms and require different treatment. Septic arthritis is considered a medical emergency. If untreated, it may destroy the joint in a period of days. The infection may also spread to other parts of the body. - Replacement arthroplasty (from Greek \\"arthron\\", joint, limb, articulate, + \\"plassein\\", to form, mould, forge, feign, make an image of), or joint replacement surgery, is a procedure of orthopedic surgery in which an arthritic or dysfunctional joint surface is replaced with an orthopedic prosthesis. Joint replacement is considered as a treatment when severe joint pain or dysfunction is not alleviated by less-invasive therapies. During the latter half of the 20th century, rheumasurgery developed as a subspecialty focused on these and a few other procedures in patients with rheumatic diseases. - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Initially, symptoms may occur only following exercise, but over time may become constant. Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and when the back is affected weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are those near the ends of the fingers, at the base of the thumb, neck, lower back, knee, and hips. Joints on one side of the body are often more affected than those on the other. Usually the symptoms come on over years. It can affect work and normal daily activities. Unlike other types of arthritis, only the joints are typically affected. Causes include previous joint injury, abnormal joint or limb development, and inherited factors. Risk is greater in those who are overweight, have one leg of a different length, and have jobs that result in high levels of joint stress. Osteoarthritis is believed to be caused by mechanical stress on the joint and low grade inflammatory processes. It develops as cartilage is lost and the underlying bone becomes affected. As pain may make it difficult to exercise, muscle loss may occur. Diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms, with medical imaging and other tests occasionally used to either support or rule out other problems. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, which is primarily an inflammatory condition, in osteoarthritis, the joints do not typically become hot or red. Treatment includes exercise, efforts to decrease joint stress, support groups, and pain medications. Efforts to decrease joint stress include resting and the use of a cane. Weight loss may help in those who are overweight. Pain medications may include paracetamol (acetaminophen) as well as NSAIDs such as naproxen or ibuprofen. Long-term opioid use is generally discouraged due to lack of information on benefits as well as risks of addiction and other side effects. If...

Isolate the variable (h): To isolate h, we need to get rid of the -4 coefficient that is multiplied by h. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by -4.

Geologically, Portland is separated into two areas; the steeply sloping land at its north end called Underhill, and the larger, gently sloping land to the south, called Tophill. Portland stone lies under Tophill; the strata decline at a shallow angle of around 1.5 degrees, from a height of 151 metres (495 ft) near the Verne in the north, to just above sea level at Portland Bill. The geology of Underhill is different to Tophill; Underhill lies on a steep escarpment composed of Portland Sand, lying above a thicker layer of Kimmeridge Clay, which extends to Chesil Beach and Portland Harbour. This Kimmeridge Clay has resulted in a series of landslides, forming West Weares and East Weares.2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi) underneath south Dorset lies a layer of Triassic rock salt, and Portland is one of four locations in the United Kingdom where the salt is thick enough to create stable cavities. Portland Gas applied to excavate 14 caverns to store 1,000,000,000 cubic metres (3.5×1010 cu ft) of natural gas, which is one percent of the UK's total annual demand. It was proposed that the caverns should be connected to the National gas grid at Mappowder via a 37-kilometre (23 mi) pipeline. Plans had it that the surface facilities should be complete to store the first gas in 2011, and the entire cavern space available for storage in winter 2013.

Read this: The neopositivists subscribed to a notion of philosophy as the conceptual clarification of the methods, insights and discoveries of the sciences. They saw in the logical symbolism elaborated by Frege (1848–1925) and Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) a powerful instrument that could rationally reconstruct all scientific discourse into an ideal, logically perfect, language that would be free of the ambiguities and deformations of natural language. This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein's idea that all logical truths are mere linguistic tautologies, they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the analytic (a priori) and the synthetic (a posteriori). On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the so-called verification principle. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning. As a result, most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered pseudoproblems.

Employment experts have given warnings over workers' conditions. The Panorama programme Amazon: The Truth Behind The Click is due to be shown tonight at 8.30pm on BBC1.","completion":"Title: Behind the Scenes: Investigating the Challenges of Amazon Warehouse Workers In the recent years, Amazon has become a revolutionary retail giant, dominating market shares with speedy delivery services and catering to every customer need. While the efficiency of this retail behemoth has been the subject of consumer praise, its not-so-shiny part has been the subject of discussion among former employees who've claimed the company maintains an oppressive work environment to fuel its productivity. Adam Littler, a 23-year-old former Amazon employee, has revealed the unimaginable pressure employees face while working for Amazon behind the sterling image. In an interview with BBC, he has referred to the working conditions as \\"unbelievable,\\" citing the primary concerns as constant surveillance, restricted toilet breaks, and abysmal fulfillment quotas within the warehouses. Amazon staff has alleged that they are being constantly monitored with GPS as they navigate through vast warehouse spaces, putting immense pressure on them to meet strict performance targets. This tracking system, according to Littler and other employees, leaves no room for error and compels them to work at an almost unreasonable speed. Although Amazon has consistently denied the use of GPS to monitor their workers, this claim persists among former and current employees. Another alarming issue raised by the workers is the timing of their toilet breaks. Employees have asserted that they get regulated breaks with predefined timings, which has led to a widespread feeling of disrespect and invasion of privacy among the workforce. The inability to take a few minutes off when needed can have serious health implications, add to stress levels, and promote an unhealthy work culture that lacks basic human consideration. Employment experts have expressed their concerns about the working conditions within Amazon warehouses. They have stated that the constant pressure to perform, surveillance, and lack of essential breaks can lead to diminished mental and physical well-being of the workforce. These working conditions have placed Amazon under scrutiny for potentially violating labor laws and human rights standards. The Panorama programme, Amazon: The Truth Behind The Click, is an investigative documentary that delves into the controversial claims of employees and provides an inside look at the reality of working conditions at Amazon warehouses. The program offers a platform for employees and experts to share their experiences and thoughts about the systemic issues faced by the company's workforce. It is scheduled to be aired tonight at 8.30 pm on BBC1. As one of the world's leading retail giants, Amazon is looked up to as an epitome of excellence and efficiency. However, it is crucial that the company undergoes some introspection regarding the well-being of employees, as those workers are the backbone of its unparalleled success. Businesses like Amazon have the responsibility to treat their workforce with the care, respect, and dignity they deserve, for ultimately, a happy and healthy workforce leads to a prosperous company."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite all of the other comments written here, I really prefer the Bette Davis version, even though the Novak version has a more coherent story line.

And it is those raw emotions that constitute *part* of what the poor doctor falls in love with. He has emotions of despair, of failure, of \\"otherness\\" - strong emotions that he represses. Davis' Mildred, on the other hand, displays her emotions immediately and without censure. She has no feelings of despair, or of failure, or of \\"otherness\\"; rather, she is merely surviving as a poor Cockney woman in the Victorian era. Novak's portrayal was a more vulnerable Mildred than was Davis', almost through the the whole movie. Davis' Mildred was **never** vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance.

In each sentence, \\"touch\\" is utilized in a different context, carrying a distinct meaning in each one. In order to comprehend the dissimilarities, let's examine each sentence and clarify the meaning of \\"touch.\\" 1. The two buildings touch. In this sentence, the word \\"touch\\" refers to the physical contact between two objects or surfaces, in this case, two buildings. When one building is in direct contact with the neighboring building, it can be said that they touch each other. In this context, the word \\"touch\\" bears a literal, spatial meaning, and denotes the connection made through direct contact. 2. Are you all right? You've hardly touched your lunch. In this sentence, the word \\"touch\\" is employed metaphorically. It's not uncommon for people to use \\"touch\\" to indicate that someone has barely interacted with or consumed something — in this instance, their lunch. When someone says that a person has \\"hardly touched\\" their food, they mean that the individual in question has barely eaten or consumed any of it, often implying that there may be an underlying issue or dissatisfaction causing the lack of appetite.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Q My daughter is a junior in high school and has been on an individualized education program since fourth grade. She plans to go to college and intends to finish with a master's degree. Her performance is fairly good, but test scores are very low. She has held many leadership and volunteer positions. We have been advised to have her write an essay about how her learning disability is a barrier that she has overcome. Will that help or hurt her chances for admission? --Deborah AFirst let me answer the question on low standardized test scores (ACT/ SAT). There are hundreds of colleges that are \\"test optional\\" which means students can choose not to release their test scores in the application process. Admission decisions at these colleges for students who do not submit their test scores are made based on other factors. A list of test optional colleges can be found atfairtest.org. It is important, however, to make sure that the college is the right fit academically regardless of the test optional policy. You also asked if your daughter should write about her disability and if this would hurt her chances of being admitted. Please know that colleges do not deny admission based on disability. \\"Disclosing\\" a learning disability in a personal statement within the college application can certainly help. By writing a personal statement, students can potentially demonstrate, for example, their understanding of the challenge they face. They might also demonstrate an improved grade trend in that subject area, and show interest in more complex courses in spite of this disability. More importantly, a student disclosure can show self-confidence, motivation and an understanding of the disability. --Ms. Kravis Question: What is Ms. Kravis' attitude toward one's declaring his/ her learning disability?

Answer the following question: This article: In the years following the Ancestral Puebloan's departure from Chaco Canyon, several migrations to the region occurred. During the 15th century, Navajo people emigrated to the area from northwestern Canada, and in the 18th century Spanish explorers and settlers came from the south. The Spanish investigated parts of the San Juan Basin, but there is no record of them ever finding Chaco Canyon. When cartographer Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco drew a map in 1774 of Spanish land holdings in the region, he labeled Chaco Canyon with the word Chaca, but it is unlikely he ever visited the area. In 1823 the governor of New Mexico, José Antonio Vizcarra, discovered ancient ruins in the canyon during a military campaign against the Navajo. Vizcarra's account is the first historical record of the Chacoan great houses that were \\"of such antiquity that their inhabitants were not known to Europeans\\". In 1844, Josiah Gregg made the first published reference to Chaco Canyon in his popular book, Commerce of the Prairies. The United States started exploring the region following the Mexican–American War of 1846–48 and the acquisition of the New Mexico Territory. During a military campaign against the Navajo in 1849, Lieutenant James Simpson of the United States Army Corps of Engineers became interested in the canyon's ruins. A group led by the governor of Jemez Pueblo, Francisco Hosta, explored the canyon; its members included Simpson and the brothers Richard and Edward Kern, who were respectively an artist and a cartographer. Simpson was impressed by Chetro Ketl's masonry, which he described as \\"a combination of science and art which can only be referred to a higher stage of civilization and refinement than is discoverable in the works of Mexicans or Pueblos of the present day.\\" Simpson and company documented their findings, noting the location and style of the great houses, taking measurements, and sketching the canyon's major ruins.

Available options: A. yes B. it is not possible to tell C. no","completion":"To determine if the hypothesis \\"National lines are divided among critics.\\" is true based on the premise \\"Critics also divide along national lines\\", let's analyze the statements step by step. Step 1: Understand the premise The premise says that there is a division among critics that is based on national lines. This indicates that critics associate themselves with their respective nations. It is worth noting that the premise implies that national lines are not the only source of division among critics. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis states \\"National lines are divided among critics.\\" This is essentially reversing the way the division is presented, suggesting that the existence of national lines leads to the division of critics. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis Both the premise and the hypothesis reference the division among critics and national lines. But while the premise emphasizes the division of critics based on national lines, the hypothesis puts the emphasis on the national lines dividing critics. Step 4: Evaluate the available options A. yes B. it is not possible to tell C. no Step 5: Choose the best option The hypothesis is essentially rephrasing the premise but maintains the same meaning, suggesting that the division among critics occurs based on national lines.

Hint: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste.
