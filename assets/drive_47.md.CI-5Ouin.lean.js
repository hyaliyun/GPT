Article: It is obvious that television brings us not only advantages but also disadvantages . At first, television is both a convenient channel of amusement, and a ly cheap one. If we have a TV set in the family, we are not necessary to go to the cinema or theatre to enjoy programme with expensive tickets. All that they have to do is press a button with a finger, and they can watch all the programmes they like, such as TV talk shows , movies, opera and so on. But some people think of it as a danger. When we watch TV, we don't need to do anything . We do not even have to leave our sofa because we have a remote control in our hand. We don't need to make any judgment or statement about it. We are totally passive and don't use our head to think hard about some matters. As we all know, television keeps us informed about world events--including all the events in society, science and politics .We can get a good idea of the most remote countries and the strangest customs in their country. Of course the radio performs this service too, but the effect of the programme is not better than on the television. Everything we enjoy on the television is much more vivid and realistic. However, in turn there is a great danger. Usually we cannot resist the television screen, because it has a great harm for us. We have been so accustomed to enjoying the screen, so dependent on its pictures. But when our TV sets are out of order, we are surprised to find that we have much more time to do things. And at this time we actually begin to have a talk to each other again. It is really worth thinking. Of course the arguments about the advantages and disadvantages of television are on the go.We can not simply say television itself is good or bad.

Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\"? is inside the article: The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro.

Summarize this article: WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday backed away from his endorsement of a bipartisan Senate proposal to stabilize health insurance markets, throwing the legislative effort into doubt even as the chief architect of the deal predicted that it would become law before the end of the year. The latest actions by the White House confused Republicans on Capitol Hill and irked Democrats — but in the end, their effect was not clear. The effort to calm roiled insurance markets appears destined for a showdown in December, when supporters of the compromise, drafted by Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, will have the most leverage. The mixed signals began Tuesday, when Mr. Trump appeared to give his blessing to the deal to restore subsidies to health insurers that he said days before he would cut off. Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray agreed on legislation that would continue federal payments to insurance companies through 2019 to reimburse them for discounts that they are required to provide to millions of low-income people who have coverage under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. On Wednesday, the White House sent a different message. ||||| President Trump became the subject of an unusual public lobbying campaign over the fate of the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday as Senate Democrats and a key Republican sought to salvage a bipartisan health deal while conservatives pressured the president to disavow the agreement. In a morning tweet, Trump appeared to distance himself from the compromise, which would authorize payments to insurers that help offset millions of lower-income Americans' health costs in exchange for granting states greater flexibility to regulate coverage. But the president later told reporters that he was not closing the door on a deal altogether, and proponents of the plan authored by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) sought to keep him on board. The convoluted campaign, in which Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) insisted that a deal remained in reach even as he blasted the president's \\"zigging and zagging,\\" underscored the unpredictable nature of dealmaking in Trump's Washington. With constantly shifting alliances, the city's key political players are jockeying to win the president's support one issue at a time. For Senate Democrats, trying to sway Trump to back the plan carries both potential risks and rewards. Working with a president despised by their base and prone to changing his mind could drag them into a political quagmire with unpredictable outcomes. For conservatives who are pressing for a different deal or oppose the idea of propping up the Affordable Care Act, the moment presents a test of how much influence they have with the president, who has suggested a greater willingness to hash out deals with Democrats and become more and more frustrated with his own party. [Another last-ditch effort to tackle Obamacare stalls within hours of its release] For both sides, the president's conflicting signals have created a chaotic situation where even some of Trump's aides have found themselves scrambling to keep up with the latest developments. He began the morning by warning that the new agreement might be tantamount to an insurance giveaway. \\"I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co's who have made a fortune w/ O'Care,\\" Trump wrote on Twitter. But shortly afterward, Alexander — who chairs the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and was encouraged by the president to pursue a deal — said in an interview that Trump expressed an openness to preserving it in a phone call Wednesday morning. \\"He told me that he wanted to encourage me but that he will review it, as I would expect a president to do,\\" Alexander said. \\"He may want to add something to it. It may come up as part of the end-of-the-year negotiations. We'll see.\\" Speaking later to reporters in the Cabinet Room, Trump praised Alexander's efforts, saying, \\"If something can happen, that's fine, but I won't do anything to enrich the insurance companies. Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) attend a hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, the morning after they reached a deal to resume federal payments to health insurers that President Trump had halted. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP) \\"They've been enriched by Obamacare like nothing anybody's ever seen before,\\" the president added. Although Trump has repeatedly described cost-sharing payments as a \\"bailout\\" to insurers, the money directly covers the discounts that low-income Americans on Affordable Care Act plans receive for deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. This group includes about 7 million Americans earning up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level. Insurers are obligated to provide the discounts, which totaled about 7 billion this year and are estimated to reach 10 billion next year, even if the federal payments are cut off. According to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, Trump's decision last week to end the subsidies will cost insurance carriers more than 1 billion this year. Facing the prospect for months that the Trump administration would cut off the payments, most insurers have opted to factor this shortfall into their 2018 premium rates for their customers. The cutoff in cost-sharing payments has translated into premium increases of 12 percent to 20 percent, according to several analyses. Alexander suggested that he may tweak the language of the proposal to address Trump's concerns that insurers would benefit from the cost-sharing reduction payments. He added that during their Wednesday call, he told Trump that he was about to tell reporters, \\"They're underestimating your leadership on health care, because what you've done is you've created a bipartisan option for the Senate and for the country.\\" Alexander said that the compromise already has language to ensure that the subsidy \\"benefits go to consumers, not to insurance companies,\\" but he was open to making it stronger. Schumer, for his part, alternated between attacking Trump's inconsistent policy positions and arguing for why the president and the deal's proponents agreed on a short-term health-care fix. Trump ended the cost-sharing reduction payments, known as CSRs, last week, arguing that they were illegal because they were not explicitly authorized under the Affordable Care Act. He left it to Congress to decide whether to fund them. [Senators strike deal to save Obamacare payments as insurers push to raise rates] Schumer, who discussed the prospect of a bipartisan deal with Trump less than two weeks ago when the president called him in the Senate gym, said in a floor speech that the allegations of an insurance bailout show that \\"the president doesn't know what he's talking about.\\" \\"It helps people who are sick and need health care. It keeps their premiums low,\\" Schumer said of the funding, adding that there is language in the agreement that bars insurers from pocketing the money. During the negotiations, Democrats had proposed delaying the open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act plans, which is set to begin Nov. 1, for a month after the bill's enactment to ensure that firms could lower their 2018 premium rates to reflect the fact that the government would keep funding the subsidies. White House Domestic Policy Council Director Andrew Bremberg opposed that provision, Schumer said, but he added that Democrats are willing to insert stronger language to guarantee that insurers pass on the payments to their customers. \\"We're all of the same mind,\\" Schumer said of Trump, Senate Democrats and Alexander. \\"And we can do that.\\" In a brief interview Wednesday afternoon, Murray brushed aside the president's hostile rhetoric. \\"This is not about the president. This is about just doing the right thing so the American people's rates don't go up, and that's where we're focused,\\" she said. Asked whether she was willing to alter the terms of the agreement, Murray replied: \\"No. We have a deal; we're moving it forward.\\" Some Democrats said they have no reservations about trying to solve a problem that, in their view, was created by Trump and for which his party will be blamed if Congress takes no action. \\"We know doing this will be good for the country,\\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). \\"I hope that people here aren't that cynical, that, 'Why would you do it just because it's good for the country?' \\" But conservatives were already mobilizing to block the measure, which would authorize CSR payments for two years. The framework would also allow insurers to offer catastrophic insurance plans to consumers 30 and older on Affordable Care Act exchanges while maintaining a single risk pool. It would shorten the period for federal review of state waiver applications; expedite reviews for states in emergency circumstances and those with waiver proposals that have already been approved for other states; and allow governors to approve state waiver applications rather than require state legislative approval. Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser, whose political action committee backs antiabortion candidates, described the proposal Wednesday as \\"an inadequate, shortsighted approach which fails to address the abortion funding problems created by the health-care overhaul.\\" \\"Right now nearly 900 health-care plans subsidized by taxpayer dollars cover abortion, forcing taxpayers to be complicit in the destruction of human life,\\" she said. \\"In no way does the Alexander-Murray bill fulfill Republicans' campaign promise to repeal and replace the ACA.\\" A handful of Senate Republicans have expressed support for the plan, including Mike Rounds (S.D.), John McCain (Ariz.) and Bill Cassidy (La.). But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) has not committed to bringing it up for a floor vote, and some GOP senators questioned Wednesday why they should keep funding the subsidies. \\"Well, I don't want to just vote to put paint on rotten wood,\\" Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) told reporters. \\"I just want to understand what the benefits are. I understand the money going out the door.\\" Several key House Republicans said they don't see how the bill would win passage in their chamber. Many senior White House officials oppose the bill, according to administration officials and Republicans who have been briefed on the matter. At times, Trump's aides have been sidelined as he has conferred with Alexander, according to one Republican, fueling confusion about the state of negotiations. The bipartisan plan does enjoy support among patient rights groups, although they have raised concerns about whether the flexibility it offered could raise health-care costs. On Wednesday, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network endorsed it. \\"This deal offers important, immediate action to stabilize the individual insurance market,\\" said the group's president, Chris Hansen. \\"Restoring 106 million per year in outreach and education programming would help to reduce public confusion over the law and ensure more people who need health coverage get it.\\" Even as elected officials and interest groups debated in Washington how to handle cost-sharing payments, attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction that would require the administration to continue making the payments to insurers. The attorneys general argued that the court order was needed \\"to prevent immediate and irreparable harm to the Plaintiff states and the millions of Americans who benefit from affordable health coverage under the ACA.\\" While Schumer made no predictions as to whether the bipartisan agreement would actually make it to Trump's desk, he held out hope that the president could serve as an ally in the end. \\"This president keeps zigging and zagging,\\" Schumer said on the floor. \\"Our only hope is maybe tomorrow, he'll be for this bill.\\" John Wagner, Jordan Frasier and Paul Kane contributed to this report.

Lamar Alexander tweeted that he would work with President Donald Trump on improving the bill to \\"make it even stronger\\" and ensure that it benefits consumers, not insurance companies. | John Shinkle/POLITICO Obamacare fix could end up in year-end package Republican sources say it's only a matter of time before Congress must find some way of addressing the reeling insurance markets. A bipartisan deal to shore up Obamacare collapsed Wednesday after President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan called the Senate proposal a bailout for insurance companies. But GOP sources on both sides of the Capitol say this is not the end of the debate. Story Continued Below GOP lawmakers acknowledged they’ll eventually have to contend with shaky insurance markets and an estimated 1 billion hole Trump carved into the health care law last week when he eliminated remaining payments due this year. The money to fund a key insurance subsidy program could be resurrected as part of a year-end spending agreement. Even if the deal struck by Sens. Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray goes nowhere, Republican sources say it's only a matter of time before Congress must find some way of addressing the reeling insurance markets — a vote the GOP sources know will infuriate lawmakers and their base. Put simply, the fight over Obamacare is nowhere near an end. Alexander plans to introduce the bill Thursday along with a “significant” number of Republican and Democratic cosponsors. He predicted Wednesday that “by the end of the year chances are very good this agreement or something like it is law.” POLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning — in your inbox.

The most likely scenario is to push the matter off and fold a yet-to-be-determined solution into a year-end package they hope will include some GOP concessions as well as Democratic perks. Such a strategy, they argue, would be less painful than voting on a stand-alone bill that conservatives view as a \\"bailout\\" for insurance companies — and a vote to \\"prop up\\" a law they've tried to dismantle for years. \\"We do know there's a problem with the high premiums and high deductibles because of the failures of Obamacare,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). \\"And until we can come up with a long-term solution, I think stabilizing the marketplace and keeping premiums affordable is not a bad idea.” Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted that he was \\"supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co’s who have made a fortune w/ O’care.\\" Ryan later suggested the House wouldn't take up the bill as written. \\"The speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare,\\" Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said. Alexander on Wednesday lobbied his GOP colleagues to get on board, arguing that funding the cost-sharing program doesn't amount to a bailout because it has to go directly to cover consumers’ out-of-pocket health costs. He also indicated that he’s open to changing the bill to address Trump’s concerns. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) is also working on a bill that would fund the cost-sharing payments and make concessions for conservatives. The Alexander-Murray deal would provide two years of funding for Obamacare's cost-sharing subsidies. It would also give states more flexibility to oversee their insurance markets, expand the availability of low-cost health plans and restore some of the funding for enrollment outreach efforts the Trump administration slashed this summer. But Alexander’s effort largely fell on deaf ears. “I want to get to the long-term solution as quickly as possible. I’m just not a fan of bailing out insurance companies,” said Steve Daines (R-Mont.). Trump’s opposition sealed the bill’s fate, at least in the short term. It would be all but impossible for Republicans lawmakers to support the deal — let alone bring it up for a vote in the House or Senate — without the president's endorsement. Republicans, still smarting from their failure to fulfill their years-long promise to repeal Obamacare, would have an extremely hard time voting for anything perceived as supporting the law without political cover from the president. Before coming out against the proposal Wednesday, Trump spent Tuesday sending mixed signals on whether he would support the bipartisan effort. Early Tuesday, he suggested the White House was involved in crafting the legislation and praised the work by lawmakers. By the evening, he commended the work but trashed the idea of a bailout, echoing comments made by conservatives who oppose the deal. Republicans were reluctant to weigh in on the deal after details of the bill were released Tuesday. But GOP sources, especially in the House, privately began dismissing the accord, saying the concessions wouldn’t be enough for most Republicans in the House. Asked about a vote on the agreement Tuesday, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Republicans had not yet discussed a way forward. Ryan soon came out in a statement encouraging the Senate to pursue repeal — not an Obamacare \\"fix.\\" Some Republicans want a bigger concession from Democrats in exchange for continuing the payments. In an interview with POLITICO just hours after Trump ended the subsidies last week, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said the White House would never back a stand-alone Alexander-Murray-type deal but could accept the measure if they got a border wall or something else for Trump. White House legislative liaison Marc Short and GOP sources echoed that sentiment, suggesting that Republicans might instead secure a repeal of the individual and employer mandates under Obamacare. Democrats are highly unlikely to back any kind of mandate repeal because they would view that as undermining the law. Murray told POLITICO that she views the bill's current language as final. \\"We negotiated,\\" she said. The Obamacare payments are estimated at about 7 billion this year and help insurers cover out-of-pocket costs for low-income customers. Insurance commissioners say about 6 billion of the money had been released before Trump's cutoff. A federal court last year ruled that the subsidies were illegally appropriated, but the Obama and Trump administrations had continued to pay them out while the litigation is under appeal. Many insurers, fearing the payments would be cut off, raised rates for 2018 health plans higher than they otherwise would have. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday blasted Trump for flip-flopping. He said Trump probably did not know what was in the Obamacare deal and said his only hope was that Trump would quickly reverse course to support it.

WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump, after a tactical retreat this week on immigration policy, demonstrated Friday that there is no strategic shift to his overall tough approach to those attempting to illegally enter the country, and vowing to \\"end the immigration crisis, once and for all.\\" U.S. immigration laws, Trump declared, are \\"the weakest in the history of the world.\\" Trump made the remarks in an auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House, where he presided over an event with so-called \\"Angel Families,\\" those who have had relatives killed by people who entered the country illegally. \\"Your loss will not have been in vain,\\" the president told the families, who held large photos of their slain relatives. \\"We will secure our borders … the word will get out. Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country.\\" Trump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \\"zero tolerence\\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children.

Expand this summary.","completion":"A Japanese company, Akagi Nyugyo, recently made headlines when it released a 60-second video featuring its executives and employees executing a group bow of apology. The video, which has received more than 1 million views on YouTube, was created to apologize for raising the price of their popular frozen snack, Garigari-kun bars, by 9 cents, bringing the cost up to 70 yen. This is the first price hike for the ubiquitous brand since 1991. The company stated, \\"We held on for 25 years, but...\\" as they explained the decision to increase the price. Not only did the company feel it necessary to create a heartfelt video apology for raising prices, but the commercial also features a catchy song about rising costs to emphasize the sincerity of their apology. In Japan, public apologies like this are both expected and scrutinized, demonstrating a stark cultural difference in comparison to other countries where apologies can sometimes be seen as an admission of guilt. While the company may not have anticipated the viral response to their video, it highlights the extreme commitment to customer satisfaction held by Japanese businesses. Akagi Nyugyo was likely focused on maintaining its image as a customer-centric company, even if it meant creating a public apology for a relatively minor price increase. This type of corporate behavior is deeply rooted in Japanese culture, where businesses often go to great lengths to show gratitude and remorse when they believe they have inconvenienced their customers. The video serves as a powerful example of just how seriously companies in Japan take their responsibility to their consumers. Other global brands have also faced similar situations in Japan, such as McDonald's, which had to issue an apology when their mozzarella sticks were found to be missing one vital ingredient. This kind of behavior has gained international attention and is seen as indicative of the high standards that Japanese consumers expect from companies operating in their country. It remains to be seen if this kind of public apology will become more commonplace in other countries, as businesses increasingly strive to establish positive relationships with their customers. However, one thing is certain: Akagi Nyugyo's unique and heartfelt apology certainly got the attention of millions of people worldwide, demonstrating the power of sincere corporate communication in today's connected world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He rode his bike super duper fast and won lots of races. People loved him, and he became very popular. Companies saw how much everyone liked Lance, and they wanted him to wear their special clothes and shoes while he was riding his bike. One of these companies was called Nike. Nike is a place where they make all sorts of clothes and shoes for sports. They made a deal with Lance, saying \\"Please wear our stuff and tell everyone how great it is!\\" And so, Lance did that for a long time. Then one day, Lance told the world that he had not been telling the truth. You see, there were rules about how fast you could ride a bicycle without help, and Lance had been breaking those rules. He was using some things that made him go faster even when he was not supposed to. People got very upset with Lance because they felt cheated, and they did not want him to wear their shoes or clothes anymore. Lance became sad but knew he made mistakes and needed to make them right. He wanted to show everyone that he was sorry. So, he decided to stop wearing Nike and start wearing shoes and clothes from another company called ASICS. ASICS is also a place that makes clothes and shoes for sports, just like Nike. They have lots of comfortable things to wear for riding bikes and doing other fun activities. Lance wanted to make a fresh start with ASICS and show everyone that he was not the same person who broke the rules. In this new chapter of his life, Lance began telling everyone, \\"I am not a Nike guy anymore, I am an ASICS man now!\\" He hoped that by changing what he wore and making better choices, people would see that he was truly sorry for what he had done. Now, Lance continues to ride his bike, wearing his ASICS shoes and clothes, and trying to be a better person every day. He learns from his mistakes and tries to help other people, so they do not make the same mistakes he did.

Since 1983, scientists have been able to change plants more quickly by changing their genetic material.

When they are fired from their latest gig (their music is deemed too old-fashioned and not with the times), Daniel goes to pawn his guitar in order to buy groceries. Jan wanders off on her own and encounters a shifty reptilian character in a white suit who introduces himself as \\"B.L. Zebubb\\", a record producer. He and his weasel assistant, Weez Weezel, offer her fame and fortune in exchange for signing a contract in blood. Jan does not read the fine print and trusts B.L., signing herself over to his record production company. Little does she suspect that B.L. is none other than the Devil himself, and at the height of her fame he will return to collect her soul. To assist her, Weez conjures three band members from thin air, a rabbit (Rabbit Delight), a beaver (Boom Boom Beaver), and a praying mantis (Pray Mantis). As \\"Funky Jan\\", Jan is soon the most popular rock star on the planet while the oblivious Daniel is left out in the cold. But when B.L. comes for her soul and she realizes what she has done, a distraught Jan goes to Daniel for help. A trial is held in the woods at night over Jan's soul, with Weez as the judge and Daniel acting as Jan's attorney. As an additional stipend, the Devil states that should Daniel lose the trial, his soul as well as Jan's will be taken as payment. At first, the trial seems hopeless, considering Daniel has no education as a lawyer and cannot present even the beginnings of a reasonable argument to release Jan. Having nothing else to offer, Daniel begins to sing a heartfelt song. Jan joins in, as do her three heretofore unhelpful band members. The other animals watching the trial begin to sing and clap along to the tune and so do the jury of lost souls. An enraged Devil attempts to summon forth demons to stop the heroes, but the spirits he conjures also fall prey to the sway of Daniel's music.

Generate a question that has the following answer: Frank Costello for the following movie plot: In voiceover, Irish-American mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) explains that he doesn't want to be the product of his environment, he wants his environment to be a product of him. Grainy historical film depicts violent riots in Boston during earlier generations. Costello, proudly Irish, unapologetically racist, explains that what annoys him about African Americans is their refusal to realize that they won't be given anything. Costello's belief is you have to do whatever possible to take what you want.Costello is in a small convenience store and collects protection money from the shop owner, who is visibly unnerved by Costello. Costello warns him to have more money next time. Costello asks the shop owner's young teenage daughter behind the counter if she's got her period yet. His attitude is nonchalant and all the more threatening for it. The daughter is both affronted and compelled by the powerful Costello and answers his rhetorical question. The shop owner doesn't show any emotion.A small boy, a young Colin Sullivan (Conor Donovan), is at the counter and witnesses Costello's interaction with the shop owner. Costello notices him and asks him if he's the son of a man Costello knows. He tells the store owner to give the boy two full bags of groceries and then presses some coins into the boy's hand. He tells the boy to remember he can get more money from Costello when he gets older.As Sullivan grows, Costello grooms him and steers him into a job as a police officer, where he can keep Costello informed. Sullivan completes the Police Academy and is immediately transferred to the State Police force. He is accepted into the Special Investigations Unit led by Ellerby (Alec Baldwin) which focuses on organized crime. The primary target of the unit is Costello.

While it is commonly known for its consistency lying between a pudding and a soup, the very heart of Binignit is found in its primary component -- bananas, a ubiquitous fruit in tropical regions that brings a distinctive combination of sweetness and texture to the dish. The bananas are well-complemented by the inclusion of another ingredient which is Sago – tiny, translucent and gelatinous pearls derived from the pith of a variety of tropical palm plants. Sago pairs wonderfully with the bananas, matching its sweet tones while additionally providing a delightful contrast of textures that make the Binignit an experiential treat to eat, both tantalizing to the palate with its abundant flavors and satisfying to the senses with its playful mélange of consistencies.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Who searches the plane wreckage?, using the article: In the South Seas, a volcano explodes, eventually causing North Pole icebergs to shift. Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis. He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop. Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis.

Process: - Living organisms in the sea die - The matter forms on the sea floor - Layers of sediment form above the matter compressing it - After many years the matter is compressed and heated - The result is that crude oil forms. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are more animals in the sea happens, how will it affect LESS oil. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The given process describes how crude oil forms mainly from microscopic aquatic life forms, such as plankton and algae, rather than larger sea animals. The primary step in this natural conversion involves the gradual application of heat and pressure over millions of years after these life forms die and accumulate on the seafloor, followed by layers of sediment. Regarding the perturbation hypothesis, if there were more large animals in the sea, it likely wouldn't directly result in less oil formation. Although more large animals could perhaps mean more organic matter on the seafloor when they die, remember that crude oil mainly originates from smaller, microscopic organisms due to their abundant population and rapid lifecycle. The carbon cycle plays a significant role here, as many of the larger animals consume smaller ones, turning the carbon back in CO2, which gets released back into the atmosphere, rather than settling to the seabed. One potential indirect impact of more sea animals could be changes in the ecosystems that might affect the population of these smaller, oil-producing organisms. If an increase of a certain animal species leads to a change in the food chain that decreases the population of plankton and algae, this could theoretically lead to less crude oil forming in the future. However, it's important to note that the oil we are currently extracting was formed millions of years ago, and any changes in todays' marine ecosystem dynamics wouldn't be noticeable on oil reserves for millions of years more. In other words, while the hypothesis certainly might have indirect effects, any potential impact would be complex and depend on many factors, including the specific dynamics of the altered ecosystems and their impact on microscopic sea flora and fauna. Hence, the overall effect on the formation of crude oil would be challenging to predict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Chinese imperial tombs are typically approached by a \\"spirit road\\", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals. A tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of Bixi in the form of a tortoise, is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of \\"lions\\" and \\"chimeras\\"; in later periods they are much more varied. A looted tomb with fine paintings is the Empress Dowager Wenming tomb of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century Tang dynasty Qianling Mausoleum group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.The complex of Goguryeo Tombs, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern Korea, are especially rich in paintings. Only one of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties has been excavated, in 1956, with such disastrous results for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of Jiaxiang County, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones. The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period. A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing. After the introduction of Buddhism, carved \\"funerary couches\\" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious. During the Han Dynasty, miniature ceramic models of buildings were often made to accompany the deceased in the graves; to them is owed much of what is known of ancient Chinese architecture.

Answer:","completion":"In later periods, the guardian figures in Chinese imperial tombs became much more varied as compared to the Han dynasty, where they were mainly represented by lions and chimeras. This increase in variety and diversity of guardian figures can be attributed to several factors, including the influence of different dynasties, cultural changes, artistic developments, and the introduction of new religious beliefs. 1. Influence of different dynasties: As different dynasties ruled China over the centuries, they brought with them their own customs, beliefs, and artistic preferences. This led to variations in the types of guardian figures used in imperial tombs. For instance, the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE) saw an increased use of human and animal guardian figures that were not only powerful and mythical, but also depicted daily life, such as servants, guards, and horses. 2. Cultural changes: Over the course of Chinese history, its society evolved and became increasingly sophisticated. This cultural evolution was reflected in the art and architecture, including the guardian figures in imperial tombs. As a result, the types of guardian figures diversified to include more human-like characters, celestial beings, and mythological creatures that symbolized protection, power, and wealth. 3. Artistic developments: As Chinese artists developed new techniques and styles, the depiction of guardian figures in imperial tombs grew more intricate and refined. Artists began to portray guardian figures with greater realism and attention to detail, giving rise to more varied and unique representations of these protective entities. 4. Introduction of new religious beliefs: As new religious beliefs, such as Buddhism, were introduced to China, they began to influence the art and architecture in imperial tombs. Buddhist concepts, such as spiritual liberation and the afterlife, influenced the design of guardian figures, leading to the inclusion of Buddhist deities and more religiously-themed representations. In conclusion, the guardian figures in Chinese imperial tombs became much more varied in later periods due to the influence of different dynasties, cultural changes, artistic developments, and the introduction of new religious beliefs. These factors contributed to making the guardian figures a more diverse and sophisticated means of embodying the power, protection, and prosperity required for the deceased in the afterlife."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Prune the Meidiland rose during the late winter after all of the foliage has fallen from the plant but before the spring temperatures begin to rise and new growth forms. Prune your plant in January if you live in a warmer region. In warmer regions where it does not get cold enough for roses to shed their leaves, pruning should be done in January and all of the leaves and flowers should be pruned off. This will allow the shrub to have a brief rest before producing new foliage and flowers in late winter or spring. Use bypass or hand pruners that are sharp. Dull pruners will crush the stems and damage the growth buds. Always wash your pruning shears before and after you prune plants to control the spread of any plant diseases that may be in your garden. Remove all dead growth and debris from around the plant to make the pruning process a bit easier. Rake the area around the plant and remove any trash, leaves or other items. Place this debris in a composter, or in a bag in the trash if you are concerned that the debris might have a plant disease or fungus of some kind. Remove any black or dark brown stems because these colors indicate that this growth has died. Dead growth should be cut back in order to help the plant produce healthy, new growth. If no healthy buds remain on a particular stalk, cut the stalk to the ground to encourage the plant to produce new stalks. When cutting make vertical, angled cuts directly above the first healthy bud. Diseased parts of the plant should be removed as soon as you spot the disease. Check your roses through their growing season to make sure that your plants have not developed any diseases. Trim these branches off entirely or back to where the center of the stem tissue is a healthy white. Remove diseased parts of the plant from your yard. These cuttings will have to be burned or thrown away. You cannot place these cuttings in the compost bin, as the plant disease could still spread from within the compost bin. Once you have removed any dead, damaged, or diseased growth, cut your plant back to height that you would like it to be. The height of white Meidiland roses can be reduced by four to eight inches, if a shorter height is preferred, but it is not necessary. Simply trim each branch back to the desired height. Prune off any branches that are growing at odd angles and branches that are growing across other branches. If a branch is growing across another branch, it could rub against the other branch, causing injury and opening up the shrub to disease. White Meidilands that are more than a few years old should have up to one-third of the oldest, thickest, woodiest branches removed completely. This will open up the center of the shrub to better air circulation and sunlight exposure. It will also keep the shrub “younger” since the leftover branches will be less than a few years old. Summary:","completion":"1. Choose the right time: Prune during late winter when the foliage has fallen but before spring temperatures rise and new growth forms. January is ideal for warmer regions. 2. Prepare the tools: Use bypass or hand pruners that are sharp and always wash your pruning shears before and after using. 3. Clean the area: Remove dead growth and debris from around the plant to simplify the pruning process. 4. Remove dead growth: Cut back black or dark brown stems as they indicate dead growth. If no healthy buds remain on a stalk, cut the stalk to the ground. 5. Make the cuts: Make vertical, angled cuts directly above the first healthy bud. 6. Monitor for diseases: Check your roses throughout the growing season and remove diseased parts immediately. Dispose of these cuttings in a responsible manner. 7. Adjust the height: Cut the plant back to your desired height, reducing by four to eight inches if necessary. 8. Prune odd branches: Remove branches growing at strange angles or crossing over others. 9. Remove old branches: For roses more than a few years old, remove up to one-third of the oldest, thickest branches to encourage air circulation and sunlight exposure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Jerome John Garcia (August 1, 1942 - August 9, 1995) was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist, best known for his work as the lead guitarist and as a vocalist with the band Grateful Dead, which came to prominence during the counterculture era in the 1960s. Although he disavowed the role, Garcia was viewed by many as the leader or \\"spokesman\\" of the group. One of its founders, Garcia performed with the Grateful Dead for their entire thirty-year career (1965-1995). Garcia also founded and participated in a variety of side projects, including the Saunders-Garcia Band (with longtime friend Merl Saunders), the Jerry Garcia Band, Old and in the Way, the Garcia/Grisman acoustic duo, Legion of Mary, and the New Riders of the Purple Sage (which Garcia co-founded with John Dawson and David Nelson). Jerry Garcia's ancestors on his father's side were from Galicia in northwest Spain. His mother's ancestors were Irish and Swedish. He was born in the Excelsior District of San Francisco, California, on August 1, 1942, to Jose Ramon \\"Joe\\" Garcia and Ruth Marie \\"Bobbie\\" (nee Clifford) Garcia, who was herself born in San Francisco. His parents named him after composer Jerome Kern. Jerome John was their second child, preceded by Clifford Ramon \\"Tiff\\", who was born in 1937. Shortly before Clifford's birth, their father and a partner leased a building in downtown San Francisco and turned it into a bar, partly in response to Jose being blackballed from a musicians' union for moonlighting. Garcia was influenced by music at an early age, taking piano lessons for much of his childhood. His father was a retired professional musician and his mother enjoyed playing the piano. His father's extended family--who had emigrated from Spain in 1919--would often sing during reunions. Garcia experienced several tragedies during his youth. At age four, while the family was vacationing in the Santa Cruz Mountains, two-thirds of Garcia's right middle finger was accidentally cut off. Garcia and his brother Tiff were chopping wood. Jerry steadied a piece of wood with his finger, but Tiff miscalculated and the axe severed most of Jerry's middle finger. After his mother wrapped his hand in a towel, Garcia's father drove him over 30 miles to the nearest hospital. A few weeks later, Garcia -- who had not looked at his finger since the accident -- was surprised to discover most of it missing when the bandage he was wearing came off during a bath. Garcia later confided that he often used it to his advantage in his youth, showing it off to other children in his neighborhood. Less than a year after he lost most of his finger, his father died. Vacationing with his family near Arcata in Northern California in 1947, Garcia's father went fly fishing in the Trinity River, part of the Six Rivers National Forest. Not long after entering the river, Garcia's father slipped on a rock, lost his balance and was swept away by the river's rapids. He drowned before other fishermen could reach him. Although Garcia claimed he saw his father fall into the river, Dennis McNally, author of the book A Long Strange Trip: The Inside Story of the Grateful Dead, argues Garcia formed the memory after hearing others repeat the story. Blair Jackson, who wrote Garcia: An American Life, lends weight to McNally's claim. Jackson's evidence was that a local newspaper article describing Jose's death failed to mention Garcia was present when he died. Where else are his ancestors from","completion":"Jerry Garcia's ancestors have diverse origins. On his father's side, they were from Galicia in northwest Spain. On his mother's side, his ancestors were of Irish and Swedish descent.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What is the rocket that malfunctions carrying? Wasps Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Sting of Fury\\" Genre: Science Fiction, Action, Adventure Plot: In the not-so-distant future, the global economy heavily relies on space exploration, including asteroid mining, scientific research, and commercial space travel. Amidst these advances in space, a leading biotechnology company, BioGenix, had designed a genetically modified breed of wasps. These wasps play a vital role in solving a global pollination crisis which has caused agricultural hardships worldwide. BioGenix's genetically modified wasps have successfully tailored the pollination of various crop types which have significantly increased food production in controlled environments. As the next phase of this top-secret project, BioGenix plans to spread these species over wider regions to benefit global agriculture. To achieve this vision, BioGenix collaborates with AstroTech, a renowned aerospace engineering company, to create a specialized rocket known as Pollinator One. Pollinator One is designed to carry the wasps within small capsules for a high-altitude orbital release over the Earth. The plan ensures the wasps will propagate and carry out the pollination task, gradually restoring the ecosphere. Dr. Angela Reyes, an essential character of the story, is a brilliant scientist who specializes in entomology and genetics, and is the creator of the genetically modified wasps. Major Mike Stevens serves as the chief astronaut in the mission, overseeing the release of the rocket and ensuring its success. As the launch day arrives, excitement builds up as the world watches Pollinator One blasted off into space, carrying the potential solution to a looming global famine. However, halfway into the mission, a malfunction occurs in the rocket and it loses contact with mission control. At this point, Pollinator One appears to be on a crash course back to Earth. The malfunction's cause is traced back to corporate sabotage by a group of eco-terrorists who believe the genetically modified wasps could decimate the global ecosystem instead of saving it. Major Mike Stevens, a former Air Force pilot, is recruited on a daring rescue mission on-board a prototype space shuttle to intercept and fix Pollinator One. During the dangerous rescue mission, Mike experiences shocking revelations as he comes face-to-face with the mutated wasps that have become increasingly aggressive and threatening due to cosmic radiation exposure. The malfunction caused the early release of the wasps within the rocket, and they have begun wreaking havoc on both Pollinator One's systems and the rescue team. As the wasps multiply and evolve in unexpected ways, Angela is tasked with finding an antidote and a new means to control them before they cause an outbreak situation on Earth. On the other hand, Mike has to not only navigate through an infested Pollinator One but also battle the eco-terrorists who wish to destroy the rocket and stop BioGenix's plan. As the film reaches its climax, Angela manages to engineer a biological substance that can drive the mutated wasps to reestablish their designated pollination behavior while neutralizing their aggressive tendencies. Meanwhile, Mike and his team manage to re-stabilize Pollinator One within the earth's atmosphere along with the eco-terrorists' involvement being exposed. In the end, the wasps are safely deployed to designated pollination zones, leading humanity toward a healthier and harmonious future. As the credits roll, Angela and Mike celebrate their victory against all odds, shifting the narrative of the film towards their newfound camaraderie and setting the stage for potential sequels."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: Shadow Chancellor George Osborne Photo: Paul Grover Alistair Darling reminds me of one of those kidnapped Colombian judges in sweat-drenched polyester shirts, who are forced to record messages of support for their captors, but try desperately to signal to the camera that they are doing so under duress. With every blink, every hesitant reply, every furrowing of his brow, even his hint in yesterday's Daily Telegraph that the hugely expensive ID card scheme may be scrapped, the wretched Chancellor seems to be saying: I know, I know, I want to bring down the public debt, too. But my captor, Gordo el Furioso – he will not let me! Last week's pre-Budget report ought to have been a detailed technical manual, an emergency route map to save Britain, last of the big G20 nations still to be sunk in recession, from debt catastrophe. This year, we are on track for a £178 billion budget deficit, even as the economy shrinks by 4.75 per cent. Credit agencies, the Bank of England, the OECD and the IMF all warn that this is not sustainable: that Britain's public sector borrowing (about 12.6 per cent of GDP this year) is eating into what remains of its credibility in the global markets like a vicious rust. Instead of a technical document, however, the Government delivered a series of political scare slogans clumsily knitted together with a few statistics. The purpose of this PBR, pure and simple, was to sow fear about the Conservative Party's plans and the fiscal tightening that (let us hope) would follow a Tory victory. \\"In 1997, our public services were in crisis,\\" Mr Darling reminded the Commons on Wednesday. \\"The Conservative Party seems quite incapable of realising… that we must secure long-term sustainable growth in this country,\\" he continued – adding that Tory plans would slow down demand too quickly and wreck the recovery. In other words: Vote Tory for a Miserable, Indigent, Hopeless Life. The Brown regime long since ceased to conduct itself as a serious government: it is now a clunking electoral machine whose sole objective is to limit the scale of the Conservative majority next May or (if you believe the bookies) March. Most of the measures announced by the Government last week will never be enacted by Labour ministers: the promise to \\"protect front-line services\\" was pure political sweetener to stir into the Labour core vote's tea, and it is a safe assumption that Brown and Darling will be long gone when the proposed one per cent increase in National Insurance falls due in April 2011. Within hours of the PBR's publication, the Institute for Fiscal Studies had found a £36 billion black hole in its pages. How would Labour pay for that? Mr Darling would have liked to have been able to answer that question, and evidently favoured a substantial VAT rise to make his final PBR a more plausible piece of work, and one that posterity might view with favour. The Treasury mandarins were understandably desperate for a plan that would hasten deficit reduction. But the PM was having none of it. As I wrote last month, Gordon's best legacy to the Labour Party could yet be a modest defeat. And his clear objective in this PBR was not fiscal stringency, but the consolidation of the crude notion that Labour are the good guys who still spend lots of money on nice things, and the Cameron Conservatives are the wicked, greedy Etonians who will force wee children up chimneys, re-open the workhouses and shoot Santa Claus on the grouse moors. That juvenile \\"dividing line\\" is scarcely the basis for a winning electoral coalition: but – Labour strategists calculate – it might narrow Cameron's Commons majority rather significantly. And the scale of that majority is of the utmost importance not only to the shape of the party-political landscape after the election, but the prospects of the nation as a whole, and of its economic recovery specifically. Although last week's PBR naturally shone the spotlight of scrutiny upon the hostage Mr Darling, it was a reminder that, very soon, it will be Chancellor Osborne making major budgetary announcements to the Commons. He and David Cameron, both special advisers to the Major Government, remember all too well what it was like governing with a small majority, and then with no majority at all. They know that, to stand a chance of conquering Britain's structural deficit, they need a robust electoral mandate. Osborne also knows that this job, so to speak, will be The Job. Of course, any Chancellor of the Exchequer has a shot at becoming Prime Minister – but of the 21 occupants of No 11 since the war, only four have done so (Macmillan, Callaghan, Major and Brown). Mr Osborne may buck the trend, but to stand a chance he must first be an outstanding Chancellor. So he and his team – more than any other on the Tory side – are preparing to hit the ground running, with an emergency budget within 50 days of the election and an autumn spending statement. Fiscal rules having proved pretty worthless in the Brown years, Osborne will subject himself to the discipline of an Office for Budget Responsibility: a fiscal watchdog that should, if it is genuinely independent, and is allowed to bite as well as bark, transform the terms of trade. Though he is often accused of being too political by temperament, and insufficiently immersed in technicalities of economic policy, it is precisely the political arts that Osborne will need to end this public debt crisis. Which colleagues does he choose to disappoint first? In what order does he fight the big battles? How does he bring public opinion with him as he cuts into the flab of the state – and when, and in what circumstances, does he accept that he must take action irrespective of public hostility? This is why one of the Shadow Chancellor's shrewdest proposals is the introduction of a \\"Star Chamber\\" system, to involve more Cabinet colleagues in spending decisions and to give stronger institutional form to collective responsibility for fiscal policy. To be honest, he will need this, and much more. If it does half of what Cameron and Osborne say it will, the next government will be racked by controversy over spending cuts, tax increases, and our old friend, \\"the language of priorities\\". And that's only half of it. \\"To really get to grips with this,\\" one senior Cameroon told me yesterday, \\"we have to reinvent the relationship between the citizen and the state.\\" That's exactly right. If the Cameron-Osborne revolution is to be real, it must be about more than the politics of cuts; it must be about weaning an entire country off the malfunctioning, bloated post-war state. That is as big a change in the way we live as was achieved in the Thatcher era. Last week's PBR was the last gasp of the old. It is time now to see just how dramatically different the new truly is.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? cumbersome","completion":"The phrase \\"cumbersome\\" is generally considered negative. It has several definitions and connotations, all of which convey a sense of difficulty, inconvenience, or unwieldiness. When something is described as cumbersome, it could mean one or more of the following: 1. Heavy and difficult to carry or manage: When an object is cumbersome, it is usually bulky, unwieldy, and challenging to handle due to its size, shape, or weight. For example, moving a large sofa can be considered a cumbersome task because it can be difficult to maneuver and lift. 2. Slow or complicated, and therefore inefficient: In this sense, cumbersome refers to processes or tasks that are inefficient and time-consuming, often due to an overly complex or outdated system. For instance, a cumbersome administrative procedure might involve filling out multiple forms and waiting for approvals from several departments before action is taken. 3. Difficult to use or manage, often because of being complex: When a tool, device, or technology is cumbersome, it is usually hard to use, navigate, or understand because of its complexity. For example, a computer program with poorly designed user interface or complicated functions can be described as cumbersome to use. In all of these cases, the word cumbersome has a negative connotation because it describes a situation or object that is inconvenient, challenging, or problematic in some way. People generally seek ease, simplicity, and efficiency, so describing something as cumbersome is likely intended to indicate that it is not ideal or that it may require a significant amount of effort to manage or overcome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Combine facts and answer this: Saxton Temple Pope had a close relationship with a man who lived most of his life where? Answer:","completion":"Saxton Temple Pope had a close association with Ishi, a man who lived most of his life in California. Ishi, often referred to as the \\"Last Wild Indian\\" in America, lived the majority of his life in the rugged wilderness of northern California, specifically in the regions around Mount Lassen and Deer Creek. Born around 1861, Ishi was a member of the Yahi tribe, part of the larger Yana group. The Yahi tribe was nearly decimated at the end of the 19th century because of the California Gold Rush and the subsequent violence, disease, and starvation that it brought on. Ishi, who survived these devastating effects, lived in the wild until 1911, when he arrived in Oroville, California, and was subsequently taken under the protection of anthropologists at the University of California, Berkeley. His connection with Saxton Pope began when Pope was assigned as a physician to attend to him. The bond between them grew beyond their initial doctor-patient relationship. Pope took a keen interest in understanding the Yahi culture—its values, way of life, and especially, their traditional archery skills, a rich cultural asset. Thanks to his friendship with Ishi, Pope became an expert in Yahi archery techniques. He studied Ishi's methods, including how to construct bows and arrows, and to hunt using them. Their friendship and collaboration led Pope to write two books detailing his relationship with Ishi and what he learned from him about archery and Yahi culture: \\"Hunting with the Bow and Arrow\\" and \\"Yahi Archery.\\" Therefore, Ishi's life was intimately entwined with the wilderness of northern California, where he hunted, built tools, and survived until the tragic extinction of his tribe. Simultaneously, this wilderness became instrumental in facilitating the enriching bond that he developed with Saxton Pope, which went on to bridge cultural divisions and lead to vital cross-cultural exchanges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An exotic's eye area can get crusty and gooey because its flat face doesn't allow for good drainage. Take a paper towel or washcloth and wet it with warm water.","completion":"Gently dab at the area around your cat's eyes, being careful not to touch the eyes themselves, in order to remove any buildup that may have accumulated. It is important to keep your Exotic Shorthair's eyes clean to prevent eye infections and maintain their overall health. Make sure to use a fresh, clean piece of the paper towel or washcloth each time and dispose of them properly after each use. The Exotic Shorthair's tear ducts might sometimes become blocked, which can lead to excessive tearing or discharge from the eyes. If you notice that your cat's eyes are constantly watery or have yellow or green discharge, it is important to contact your veterinarian for an examination. Next, focus on cleaning your exotic shorthair cat's ears. Like any other cat, Exotic Shorthairs are prone to build-up of earwax, dirt, and debris in their ears. To clean their ears, use a cotton ball or swab moistened with a vet-approved ear cleaning solution to gently wipe away any debris. Avoid using human ear cleaning products, as these can be too harsh for your cat's delicate ears and may cause irritation. In addition to maintaining your Exotic Shorthair's eyes and ears, regular grooming is essential for keeping their fur healthy and free from tangles or mats. Despite having a short coat, this breed is prone to shedding. Make sure to brush your cat's fur at least once a week with a grooming brush specifically designed for shorthaired cats, as this can help to remove loose hair and stimulate the natural oils in their skin. Since Exotic Shorthairs are more susceptible to respiratory issues due to their flat faces, it's important to keep an eye on their breathing and consult with your veterinarian if you notice any signs of difficulty, such as heavy panting, coughing, or wheezing. Regular check-ups with your veterinarian can help to identify and address any potential health issues early on. Ensure that your Exotic Shorthair is receiving a nutritious and balanced diet. Provide them with high-quality cat food recommended by your veterinarian, as a proper diet is crucial for maintaining their overall health and well-being. Additionally, make sure fresh water is always available for your cat to drink. Your Exotic Shorthair will also appreciate a comfortable and clean living environment. It's essential to maintain a clean litter box by scooping it daily and replacing the litter entirely at least once a week. Providing your cat with plenty of toys and playtime is necessary for their mental and physical well-being, as well. This breed tends to be more active and social than other shorthair cats, so be prepared to spend quality interactive time with your feline friend. Lastly, make sure your Exotic Shorthair is up-to-date on their vaccinations and gets regular flea and tick prevention treatments. By following these guidelines and working closely with your veterinarian, you can ensure that your Exotic Shorthair cat will live a happy, healthy, and long life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: When punctuation began, it was mainly to help people read out loud. Until a few hundred years ago, not many people were taught to read, so there was a lot more reading out loud by the few people who could. To help those reading out loud in the old days, sign known as \\"points\\" were added to pages of writing. Punctuation comes from the Latin word punctus, meaning \\"point\\". These points told readers when to pause or take a breath, and what to emphasize . In Europe from the early centuries AD, these points were widely used although not everybody used the same points for the same thing. When printing was invented, printers had to be made more clearly about what to put where, so that everyone was doing the same thing. Since that point, all sorts of punctuation rules have been discovered and invented. Speech marks \\"...\\" Speech marks or quotation marks are used to show that someone is speaking. The sort we have in English today began to be widely used during the 18th century. Before that readers simply understood from the way a sentence was written that someone was speaking although sometimes spoken words were underlined. Comma , colon: period(full stop). All three of these sorts of punctuation marks were given their Greek names by Aristophanes, a librarian who lived in Byzantium in the 2nd century BC. They were marks on the page, each with a message to the reader. Comma meant a short pause. Colon meant a medium sized pause. Period meant a long pause. Exclamation mark! In the early days of punctuation, if you saw this sign, you were supposed to pause. Some people think the exclamation mark began as what the Greek word IO looked like if it was turned 90 degrees. This word means \\"Oh, gosh!\\" With the I on the top and the O under it, the sign as we know it today was developed. Question mark? In the middle age, a squiggle above a full stop was sometimes used to show the sentence was a question and that a person's voice should go up at the end. By the 17th century it had turned into what we call a question mark. The...

Here's how you can make it, step-by-step: 1. Gather materials: You'll need two pieces of fabric (about 12 inches by 12 inches each), beans or rice for the stuffing, a needle, thread, scissors, and a bowl or funnel to help pour the stuffing. 2. Cut the fabric: Use the scissors to cut the fabric into two equal-sized squares or circles. 3. Decorate (optional): If you want your bean bag to have a design, you can draw or sew on the fabric pieces now. 4.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Andy, Trevor, and Billy are childhood friends. As young adults, Billy sells drugs and Andy does deliveries for him. One night, Trevor delivers instead and gets busted by narcs. 5 years later, Trevor is released from jail and learns his girlfriend Laura is now with Billy. Trevor gets back with her and decides to rob a local mobster. Trevor wants some cash to buy Laura some gifts and Andy was told by some local mobsters that they are investing money with huge profits and he wants some cash to buy in. However, their robbery is very sloppy and the head mobster quickly figures out what happened. However, he and Andy's grandfather were good friends, so he tells Andy and Trevor that they can work off what they owe by smuggling stolen diamonds. Billy finds out what is going on and is mildly amused by it until he realizes that Trevor has gotten back together with Laura behind his back. He retaliates by convincing the mobsters that Trevor is a junkie and is stealing the diamonds that he is supposed to be delivering to supply his habit. He also convinces the diamond dealer that Trevor cannot be trusted with real diamonds and he gives him fake diamonds instead. When he delivers them to the mob, they quickly spot them as fakes and assume Trevor switched them. Billy figured by doing this, the mobsters would send a goon to kill Trevor and with him out of the picture, he could have Laura back with no blood on his hands. However, since he was the one to notify the mobsters, they tell him if he wants Trevor dead he has to do the killing himself. He finds Trevor at Laura's house having just made love and kidnaps him at gunpoint. He takes Trevor to a field to kill him.

The final image is a mix of band members and a variety of other influential people from the time. Apart from the Rolling Stones (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Bill Wyman, and Charlie Watts), here's a list of people who made an appearance on the cover: 1. The Beatles – The likenesses of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr were created in a 3-D collage and placed under the translucent portion of the album cover. They appeared as small, caricature-like faces hidden among the band members – arranged diagonally from John Lennon just above Bill Wyman's left shoulder to Ringo Starr above Charlie Watts' right shoulder, with Paul McCartney and George Harrison in the middle. This was somewhat of a tribute to the rivalry and friendship between the two bands. 2. Marianne Faithfull – An English singer, songwriter, and actress who was dating Mick Jagger at the time, Faithfull appeared as a female character wearing a gown on the album cover. 3. Collage of Famous Faces – There are several other personalities who appeared on the cover, but were either removed or went uncredited. Among them were actress Marlon Brando, author Edgar Allan Poe, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Sir Francis Bacon. This Michael Cooper-designed cover also featured other prominent figures from the time. However, due to copyright issues, contractual disagreements, and other reasons, the faces of these individuals were mostly obscured, making them difficult to recognize, or were removed from the final layout. Additionally, the cover design also contained a wealth of psychedelic images, patterns, and colors, which further added to the rich visual tapestry of the record.

Write a title for this article: RACINE, Wis. -- The last three years had unfolded in an unrelenting series of what Jeremy Bird called Big Moments, and here began the latest on a sweltering afternoon earlier this month. Another rental car, another unfamiliar highway, another string of e-mails sent from his BlackBerry while driving 70 mph. Bird took a sip from his coffee and looked over at Dan Grandone, a co-worker riding in the passenger seat. \\"I don't know about you, but I'm running on adrenaline right now,\\" Bird said. \\"I love this feeling that we're on the verge of something crucial.\\" Bird had lived at that precipice ever since joining Barack Obama's campaign as a top organizer in 2007, but rarely had he faced a challenge so daunting as the one awaiting in Racine. As deputy director of Organizing for America, a national network of Obama supporters, Bird was scheduled to speak with a group of volunteers who had been threatened at town halls, outshouted at local rallies and weakened by a general sense of post-campaign fatigue. With one 90-minute visit, Bird hoped to leave them confident, empowered and reenergized. \\"We want these people to feel like they can control almost anything that happens in government,\\" said Bird, who had traveled from his office at Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington to spend two days visiting volunteers across Wisconsin. \\"They should feel like there's no barrier between the regular people out in the states and the power players in D.C.\\" The outcome of the health-care debate weighed partially on Bird's success, and on the effectiveness of Organizing for America (OFA) in general. When Bird was named deputy director of OFA last year, he became the vanguard of much more than 13 million e-mail addresses collected from supporters during Obama's campaign. He became one of the people most responsible for validating Obama's campaign ethos: that grass-roots support can power government and shape legislation. It is a theory that now faces a defining test. Conservatives have waged an angry and effective battle against Obama's health-care legislation, and OFA has responded by asking its volunteers to visit congressional offices and flood town hall meetings in a massive show of support. This month, Obama sent an e-mail to OFA members: \\"This is the moment our movement was built for,\\" he wrote. When Bird arrived at a Racine coffee shop called Cup of Hope and sat down with 10 OFA volunteers, he spoke with similar urgency. \\"We need to flex our muscles on this, and we need to act fast,\\" he said. \\"We always said in the campaign that this was not just about one election but about a chance to make some major changes. Well, here's the chance.\\" Bird had a lifetime of experience thriving against long odds, and he relished the role. The son of conservative Baptists, Bird grew up in a Missouri trailer park before attending Harvard Divinity School. He organized underfunded schools in Boston, worked for Howard Dean's presidential campaign in 2004 and started a company that lobbied Wal-Mart -- his mother's former employer -- to improve its benefits and wages. On behalf of Obama, he had moved to five states, helping the candidate overcome racism in South Carolina and Islamophobia in Pennsylvania and Ohio. When Bird arrived in Wisconsin last week, he recognized all the familiar hallmarks of an underdog fight. Gone were the 44 field offices across the state where Obama organizers had worked during the campaign; now Bird spent his visit searching for power outlets in Wisconsin coffee shops and conducting conference calls at sidewalk cafes. Gone were the 100 paid staffers who orchestrated an Obama victory in the state; now OFA employed one person in Wisconsin, Grandone, who hoped to hire two or three assistants if the budget allowed. \\"Right now,\\" Grandone said, \\"we are kind of building this thing as we fly it.\\" Around the table in Racine, Bird listened as the volunteers rattled off evidence of OFA's growing pains. Local membership was relatively stagnant because Racine residents were exhausted after volunteering during the long presidential campaign.

A:","completion":"Title: \\"Three Scouts: The Bandits' Gamble\\" Genre: Western/Action/Adventure Plot Summary: In the late 1800s, a small, lawless town called Shadow Valley becomes the epicenter of corruption and chaos. That is until a local sheriff named Daniel Brokman, known for his unwavering sense of justice and a dark past, decides it is time to restore order. One gloomy afternoon, he spots three bandit scouts entering the outskirts of the town, igniting a series of events that could change the face of Shadow Valley forever. Plot: The movie starts with Sheriff Daniel Brokman arriving at his office to assess reports of recent criminal activity plaguing Shadow Valley. His hunches come to life as he surveys the town's edge from his window and notices three mysterious figures on horseback, surveying the land and taking notes. The next day, Daniel and his eager deputy set off to investigate these strangers and gather intelligence. While keeping tabs on the bandit scouts, Daniel uncovers that they are part of the notorious Blazing Scorpions, a violent and expanding gang of outlaws led by the cunning and ruthless outlaw, Javier \\"The Scorpion\\" Ramirez. The gang aims to seize control of Shadow Valley for its strategic location and unguarded resources – a perfect haven for their illicit activities. Daniel has an unexpected encounter with Alexandra Fortune, a determined and skillful gunslinger who seeks vengeance on The Scorpion for ruining her family's life. Alexandra reveals that these three scouts have been tasked with identifying vulnerable targets in the town for a massive heist. As the plot thickens, Daniel, Alexandra, and the deputy unite to devise a plan to stop the Blazing Scorpions, forge alliances with local merchants, and assemble Shadow Valley residents into a makeshift but spirited defense force. Tensions rise between Daniel and Alexandra as their past is unveiled, and they realize that they were once enemies. However, they must set aside their differences and reconcile before the imminent attack. The climax unfolds with an intense and suspenseful battle between the defenders of Shadow Valley and the invading Blazing Scorpions, in which the three scouts play a strategic role in directing their marauding gang's assault. Daniel and Alexandra fight bravely alongside their newly-formed militia, ultimately leading the town to victory. The townspeople, once broken and demoralized, stand united with newfound hope. The three scouts are captured alive and sent to face justice, while Daniel turns down Alexandra's offer to travel together, as he believes his place is in Shadow Valley, protecting its people. In the end, Daniel learns the importance of trusting and collaborating with others, despite their past, as the bonds they form can become the keys to overcoming adversity and finding hope in the bleakest moments. With the threat of the Blazing Scorpions thwarted for now, the town of Shadow Valley starts to rebuild, and peace begins to reemerge. \\"The Three Scouts: The Bandits' Gamble\\" is a story of redemption, loyalty, and the strength that comes from unity in the face of adversity – consequences of a seemingly simple encounter with three bandit scouts that evolved into the tale of a town fighting for its dignity and freedom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ilya Nikolayevich Bryzgalov ( ( listen); Russian: Il'ia Nikolaevich Bryzgalov; born 22 June 1980) is a Russian former professional ice hockey goaltender. He was selected in the second round of the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, 44th overall, by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He has also played for the Phoenix Coyotes, Philadelphia Flyers, Edmonton Oilers and Minnesota Wild. In 2006-07 season, Bryzgalov won the Stanley Cup with the Anaheim Ducks. Bryzgalov started his professional career in his native Russia, splitting the 1999-2000 season between Spartak Moscow of the Russian Supreme League (RSL-2) and Lada Togliatti of the Russian Superleague (RSL). Bryzgalov played two seasons with Lada Togliatti before joining the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, who had drafted him in the second round, 44th overall, in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. However, with Jean-Sebastien Giguere and Martin Gerber ahead of him in the club's depth chart, Bryzgalov spent the better part of his first four seasons in North America with the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks of the American Hockey League (AHL). He made his Mighty Ducks debut in 2001-02, playing in his first of two games during that four-season stretch. With the departure of backup Gerber, Bryzgalov took over behind Giguere in 2005-06 season. However, injuries to the Ducks starter allowed Bryzgalov to play more games than he otherwise would have and he responded to the challenge with a 13-12-1 record with a 2.51 goals against average (GAA) and .910 save percentage. In the subsequent playoffs, Bryzgalov made three starts and one relief appearance for the Ducks in their first-round series against the Calgary Flames. In Game 1, he filled-in for an injured Giguere, taking a 2-1 overtime loss. He relieved Giguere once more in Game 5 and stopped all 19 shots he faced in a 3-2 loss. He then took over the starting job for Games 6 and 7 of the series, winning 2-1 in Game 6 and recording a shutout in the decisive Game 7. Moving past the Flames, Bryzgalov then recorded 5-0 and 3-0 shutouts in the first two games of the second series against the Colorado Avalanche for three consecutive shutouts. He tied Frank McCool's 1945 playoff record for most consecutive shutouts by a rookie and passed Giguere, who had recorded consecutive shutouts in 2003 for the third-longest playoff shutout streak of all time. Despite his success in the first two rounds, Bryzgalov struggled in the semi-finals against the Edmonton Oilers and was eventually replaced by Giguere for the rest of the series as the Ducks were eliminated in five games. Bryzgalov continued to play backup to Giguere the following season and into the 2007 playoffs. Bryzgalov made comments regarding Anaheim Ducks Head Coach Randy Carlyle, saying he believed Carlyle has no confidence in him. However, he briefly took over as the starter for the first four games of the Western Conference Quarter-Finals, winning three games as Giguere took a leave of absence with personal issues. Bryzgalov came in for relief in the Western Conference finals against the Detroit Red Wings, but remained on the bench as the Ducks went on to defeat the Ottawa Senators in the Finals in five games to win the franchise's, and Bryzgalov's, first Stanley Cup.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How many games did he play in the 2005-06 season ?","completion":"In the 2005-06 season, Bryzgalov played more games than he otherwise would have due to injuries to the Ducks' starter and he responded to the challenge with a 13-12-1 record, which indicates that he played in 26 games."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: I was lucky enough to get three acne skincare packs from Aphelia Cosmetology for guest reviewers with acne to trial for me. I think that this is important because the treatment of acne is such a personalised journey that it is good to hear about the results of the skincare from a variety of people. In the third review of this series, Nalini from The Made Up Maiden has reviewed this acne set for me. Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck. Here is Nalini's review: I've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless. In my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit. As a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin. I would classify my skin as combination, the t-zone gets a little oily towards midday, while the rest of my skin is pretty much classified as 'normal'. I received the following items.

Summarize the following: Snip the corner off a bag of soil to create a narrow spout. Starting with the edges, go around the frame and pour in the soil until it just touches the underside of the hardware cloth. Give the frame an occasional shake while you work to level off the soil and help it distribute more evenly. You can also add a small amount of fertilizer to the potting soil to promote the health of new plants. Look for nitrogen-rich fertilizers and mix a light sprinkling into the fresh soil before you fill the frame. Formulate your own soil specifically for succulent plants by mixing two parts moist soil from your yard or garden with one part sand and small pebbles. Use a chopstick, screwdriver or slender wooden dowel to burrow into the soil about 1-1.5” deep. This will create a series of small holes that will make planting the seeds and cuttings much more expedient. Dig one hole for each plant you intend to grow. Make sure the holes are relatively narrow and that the soil around the opening isn’t cracked or loose. Be careful not to make the holes so deep that you reach the plywood backing. Confirm that the holes you dig are wide enough to accommodate the root bulbs of larger succulent species. Insert the cuttings through the wire screen of the hardware cloth root-side down. They should fit perfectly into the holes you just opened up. After all the cuttings are in place, pat the soil around the visible portion of the plants to anchor them. At this point, you should begin thinking about how you want your finished living picture to look. This will give you an idea of what type of planting pattern will work best. Plant leaf cuttings at an angle to the soil, with the trimmed end below the surface. You won’t hang your living picture right away. Seeds and young cuttings will need two to four weeks of constant sunlight and daily watering to begin growing. When the roots have spread and found traction in the soil, the plants will be resilient enough to mount without coming loose. For the first week or so, aim to water your plants once a day. Simply wet the top of the soil around each of the plants. As they develop, they’ll require less and less water and general maintenance. Once the roots have secured themselves in the soil, you'll be able to mount the frame with no fear of the plants coming dislodged. Attach the hook or wire hanger to the upper portion of the plywood backing and display it in a well-lit section of your living room, kitchen, patio or garden. Take the frame down whenever you need to water the plants or add new fertilizer to the soil. You can also water the plants using a spray bottle. Give them a generous misting once or twice a day, and be sure to saturate the soil as well as the foliage. Make sure the soil is adequately drained before rehanging the living picture.","completion":"Create a narrow spout on a soil bag and pour soil into a frame, occasionally shaking to level it.

A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart. Inspired by the farces of the ancient Roman playwright Plautus (251-183 BC), specifically Pseudolus, Miles Gloriosus, and Mostellaria, the musical tells the bawdy story of a slave named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door. The plot displays many classic elements of farce, including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of mistaken identity (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by vaudeville comedians to begin a story: \\"A funny thing happened on the way to the theater\\". A revival opened on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on April 4, 1972 and closed on August 12, 1972 after 156 performances. Directed by co-author Burt Shevelove the cast starred Phil Silvers as Pseudolus (later replaced by Tom Poston), Lew Parker as Senex, Carl Ballantine as Lycus and Reginald Owen as Erronius. Larry Blyden, who played Hysterium, the role created by Jack Gilford, also co-produced. \\"Pretty Little Picture\\" and \\"That'll Show Him\\" were dropped from the show, and were replaced with \\"Echo Song\\" (sung by Hero and Philia), and \\"Farewell\\" (added for Nancy Walker as Domina, as she and Senex depart for the country). \\"Echo Song\\" and \\"Farewell\\" had been added to a production staged in Los Angeles the previous year and were composed by Sondheim. They had to close soon after Phil Silvers suffered a stroke. The show won two Tony Awards, Best Leading Actor in a Musical for Silvers, and Best Featured Actor in a Musical for Blyden. The musical was revived again with great success in 1996, opening at the St. James Theatre on April 18, 1996 and closing on January 4, 1998 after 715 performances. The cast starred Nathan Lane as Pseudolus (replaced by Whoopi Goldberg and later by David Alan Grier), Mark Linn-Baker as Hysterium, Ernie Sabella as Lycus, Jim Stanek as Hero, Lewis J. Stadlen as Senex, and Cris Groenendaal as Miles Gloriosus. The production was directed by Jerry Zaks, with choreography by Rob Marshall. Lane won the 1996 Tony Award for Best Leading Actor and the Dramas Desk Award, Outstanding Actor in a Musical; the production was nominated for the 1996 Tony Award and Drama Desk Award, Revival of a Musical. Every actor who has opened in the role of Pseudolus on Broadway (Zero Mostel, Phil Silvers, and Nathan Lane) has won a Best Leading Actor Tony Award for his performance.

Meeting being planned! ||||| President Donald Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting that a highly anticipated diplomatic summit with Kim Jong Un would happen in the next few months. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo Trump says summit with North Korea will occur 'sometime in May or early June' President Donald Trump said on Monday that a meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, would take place “in May or early June,” an announcement that came after Kim expressed a willingness to discuss his country’s nuclear weapons program. Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting at the White House that a highly anticipated diplomatic summit with Kim would happen in the next few months. Story Continued Below “North Korea, by the way — as you can probably see, we’ve been in touch with North Korea,” Trump said. “We’ll be meeting with them sometime in May or early June, and I think there will be great respect paid by both parties.” The timeline for talks between the two countries puts Trump largely on schedule with initial plans put forth last month by South Korean officials, who stunned the international community by announcing the two leaders would meet by May.

Officials from North Korea said on Sunday that the government reached out to the U.S. to convey that Kim is open to discussing denuclearization efforts in a meeting with Trump. Trump told reporters on Monday that “hopefully we’ll be able to make a deal on the de-nuking of North Korea.” The president did not mention Kim by name and did not say whether the meeting would occur in the U.S., North Korea or elsewhere. But Trump’s remarks bolstered the likelihood that the unprecedented sitdown with Kim — which would be the first such summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader — will actually occur. Trump called the prospects of talks between the two countries “very exciting” while criticizing past administrations for not engaging in dialogue with North Korea. “This should have been done by other presidents, and they decided they couldn’t have done it, but it would have been a lot easier if it were done five years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago,” the president said. Though the White House did not initially set pre-conditions for a meeting, Trump administration officials have maintained that North Korea has to get serious about ending its weapons testing and dismantling its nuclear program for talks to be successful. The White House has said it will maintain maximum pressure and keep up sanctions on Kim’s government until progress is achieved in discussions. Trump’s relationship with Kim has been marked by tense public feuding, with the president threatening last year to unleash “fire and fury” on North Korea if its weapons tests continued. ||||| (ATTN: RECASTS headline; ADDS more details in last 3 paras) SEOUL, April 10 (Yonhap) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has talked about prospects for dialogue with the United States at a key party meeting, state media said Tuesday, in his first official comment on a planned summit with U.S. President Donald Trump. The North's ruler made a \\"profound analysis and appraisal\\" of inter-Korean ties and potential talks with the U.S. at the meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea's political bureau Monday, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). Hours before the report came out, Trump said he plans to meet with Kim next month or in early June to \\"hopefully\\" reach a deal on the North's denuclearization. Kim discussed the recent situation on the Korean Peninsula, including details about his planned summit with President Moon Jae-in on April 27. \\"He made a profound analysis and appraisal of the orientation of the development of the north-south relations at present and the prospect of the DPRK-U.S. dialogue,\\" the report said in English, using North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Without elaborating, the KCNA said that Kim set forth the WPK's future policy of international relations and how to respond to them. North Korea held the WPK's political bureau session for the first time since February 2015. Since Kim Jong-un took office in late 2011, the country has so far had nine political bureau sessions and extended meetings, including the latest one. Kim and key party officials usually discuss major policies and their future direction at political bureau meetings. \\"It is quite rare that North Korea mentioned details about the inter-Korean summit and future dialogue with the U.S.,\\" a ministry official said. \\"North Korea seemed to attach meaning to the holding of the WPK meeting by reporting it.\\" The summits come after more than a year of heightened tensions over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. North Korea's denuclearization will top the agenda for the inter-Korean summit and the Kim-Trump meeting. During Kim's surprise visit to China last month, he told President Xi Jinping that denuclearization hinges on Seoul and Washington's \\"progressive and synchronous\\" measures. The WPK meeting came as the North's rubber-stamp parliament prepares to hold a key session Wednesday mainly to discuss the national budget and a personnel reshuffle. Attention is being paid to whether the regime will send any message to the South or the U.S. at the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) meeting ahead of its planned summits. North Korea's state-run TV broadcaster released footage of Kim presiding over the politburo meeting. Experts said that the North is apparently seeking to show to the outside world that it is preparing for the summits in its own way. \\"Kim Jong-un has tried to restore a party-centric system after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, who sought a military-first policy,\\" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies. \\"The North seems to seek to develop itself as a normal state by improving its ties with the South and the U.S.\\" This photo, carried by North Korea's state news agency on April 10, 2018, shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un presiding over a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) a day earlier.

The official accompanied the North's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho at a ministerial-level meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in Baku, Azerbaijan, last week. The move suggests that the communist nation's diplomats are trying to drum up international support for leader Kim Jong-un's vision for denuclearization. Meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing in late March, Kim was quoted as saying that he's willing to achieve peace and stability in the region through phased and synchronized steps toward denuclearization. He's scheduled to hold summit talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at a border village on April 27, followed by a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump as early as May. Kim's reported remarks drew a mixed response from North Korea watchers in Seoul and Washington. It's meaningful that the North's leader expressed a commitment to denuclearization himself. But the talk of phased and synchronized measures triggered concerns that it may herald a setback to the implementation of a potential package deal, which is sought by the U.S. and South Korea, given the secretive regime's track record of reneging on previous agreements that followed a \\"word-for-word\\" and \\"action-for-action\\" approach. Nuclear deals with the North from the currently suspended six-party talks fell apart amid a controversy over the sequence of agreed-upon actions. lcd@yna.co.kr (END) ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kim Jong-un wants \\"dialogue\\" with the US North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has publicly acknowledged talks with the US for the first time, according to state media reports. US President Donald Trump agreed last month to talks with Mr Kim, but Pyongyang had been silent on the summit. Mr Kim mentioned the \\"prospect\\" of dialogue between North Korea and the US at a meeting of party officials. Details of the proposed meeting, including timing, remain unclear. On Monday, Mr Trump said he planned to meet Mr Kim in \\"May or early June.\\" It followed reports from unnamed US administration officials that the US was in contact with North Korea in preparation for the talks. The unexpected announcement in March that talks were to take place so swiftly surprised many observers, who said summits of this kind typically need months of planning and negotiations. If the talks go ahead, it would be the first time a sitting US president has met a North Korean leader. Mr Kim did not explicitly mention a summit with the US president at the Workers Party meeting on Monday.

Mr Kim is due to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in at a rare inter-Korean summit on 27 April, following months of improving relations between the two countries. The planned summits with South Korea and the US are aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, but critics have said Pyongyang may only be seeking the easing of harmful economic sanctions. Shortly after the meeting was first mentioned publicly by Mr Trump in March, a KCNA commentary insisted it was not sanctions but \\"self-confidence\\" that had brought it to the negotiation table. While the US has said North Korea is ready to discuss denuclearisation, it remains unclear what exactly the two sides mean by that. Washington wants Pyongyang to give up its nuclear arsenal while Pyongyang has repeatedly called for the withdrawal of US troops from the South and a guarantee that the US will not use its weapons to defend South Korea and Japan. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are set to meet for a summit on the denuclearisation of North Korea in May or early June, marking the first-ever meeting between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader.

The Battle of Cocos, fought between Australia's HMAS Sydney and German battle cruiser the Emden, was one of the crucial encounters of the early war, fought 100 years ago. In 1914, on November 1, the original Anzac fleet - with nearly 30,000 Australian and New Zealand soldiers aboard - had steamed out of the West Australian port of Albany. They would make their way across the Indian Ocean, through the Suez Canal to Egypt where they would fine-tune their training. From there, on April 25, 1915, they would land at Gallipoli. The men on those troop-carrying ships laid the foundations for the Anzac legend. But there were hazards to be feared on that ocean crossing with the German raider Emden was loose in the Indian Ocean. Watch the full 9NEWS special on the historic WWI battle. Please note, the items is split into three videos. Germany had been left with the scraps when it came to colonies in Asia and the Pacific. Most had already been claimed through the centuries by England, the Netherlands and Spain. But in the early years of the 20th century, they established a strong East Asia fleet in the Chinese treaty port of Tsintao to protect German trading interests. When war erupted in August, 1914 most of the German ships headed across the Pacific, attempting to get back to strengthen the Atlantic fleet, But Captain Karl Von Muller, commander of the cruiser Emden was given a lone-wolf mission - to break into the Indian Ocean to sink Allied shipping and shell the ports of India and Malaya. While Von Muller was a cunning captain hellbent on sinking ships, he did not believe in taking, unnecessarily, the lives of the sailors. For all his ruthless privateering in the shipping lanes, he did not take one life. But now came a new mission - to steam to the Cocos Keeling Islands, smash up the wireless equipment, destroy the masts and cut the undersea cable that connected Europe to Australia.

James Glossop barely knew his father, who died when James was only 10 years old. But he tells great stories of his family history. Among his treasures is his father's sword, which James also carried in his own naval career. Do you have any news photos or videos?

Question: What model cargo plane does Captain Frank Towns pilot? Movie plot title: Flight of the Phoenix Movie plot: Flight of the Phoenix is a remake of the 1965 film The Flight of the Phoenix starring James Stewart. Captain Frank Towns (Dennis Quaid) pilots a C-119 cargo plane full of oil workers who are returning home after shutting down an oil field in Mongolia's Gobi Desert. The plane is overloaded on take off, and soon they hit a violent sandstorm that causes them to crash. They are now stranded over 200 miles off-course and in the harsh desert terrain. Frank must maintain order and ration the little food and water among the survivors and wait for someone to rescue them. As time goes by, they realize their chance of being rescued is zero.

Before seeing this, I was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated \\"Emmanuelle\\" series starring Sylvia Kristel. It was really surprising how good this one turned out to be. It actually has a story, and it is very romantic indeed. What makes 'Yellow Emanuelle' so good is it's leading heroine, the beautiful and exotic Chai Lee. She plays her character, Emy Wong so sweetly, that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her. Emy Wong is a much-respected doctor, statuesque, with a regal quality. She comes from an important old family, where ancient customs are still practiced. Emy will remain a virgin until she is married, to a man she has never met. The beautiful doctor seems OK with this arranged marriage. It is simply how it is done in her world. However she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the British pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works. Emy decides to do away with custom, and she gives herself to her Western man. But only after a very long courtship, as Doctor Wong is anything but an easy woman. Her pilot, George, is a good guy, and promises to marry Emy, so that she doesn't lose her respectability and place in her rigid society. Neither one counts on a third party, one Ilona Staller, who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games. Emy is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man, that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her. Her place in society is gone, she has been debased. The film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud, elegant woman gives up her career, as well as a sweet relationship with her caring father, and succumbs to a life of drinking and prostitution. I was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale. I was on the edge of my seat when George blows back into town, and unknowingly walks into a hotel where his beautiful Emy is working as a prostitute! Classic drama. I imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama. One would expect lots of sex and nudity here, but there is not much. And when there is, it is totally non-exploitative, and very artsy and soft-core. If you are a fan of the first Emmanuelle, with Sylvia Kristel, than you most likely will appreciate this, lesser known classic. I was especially impressed by the extra attention to details. The whole segment where Emy takes George to her fathers house on the island is really nice. Her father shows George, and the viewer his impressive collection of Bonzai trees. He has a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees. Totally unexpected. After catching it on late night cable TV years ago, I spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film. When i finally got it i found that the video version was longer. More sex? No, more melodrama. For the DVD release there is a subplot about George suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease! I actually preferred the cable version better. I am glad that this rare gem has been released finally on DVD. I must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70's soundtrack. While watching this one you just get the feeling that you are watching something very rare, and quite special.

While in the field, she collected two flowers to examine in detail. She puts the first flower, flower X, under a microscope and begins to look at it. After examination she determines it's an anemophilous plant. She then takes flower Y and repeats the same process to determine that it's an entomophilous type of plant. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which flower has a less exposed stamen? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, we need to determine which type of plant typically has a less exposed stamen based on their pollination methods. Step 1: Understand the two types of plants mentioned. Anemophilous plants are those that rely on wind for pollination, while entomophilous plants depend on insects or other animals for pollination. Step 2: Relate the pollination methods to the exposure of the stamen. For anemophilous plants, the stamen needs to be more exposed to ensure that pollen is easily carried away by the wind to achieve successful pollination. In contrast, entomophilous plants have flowers that are designed to attract pollinators, like insects. These plants typically have concealed stamen and more attractive features, such as colours, fragrances, and nectar, to lure pollinators. While visiting the flower, the pollinators come into contact with the stamen and pick up the pollen, ensuring successful pollination. Step 3: Determine which flower has a less exposed stamen, based on the pollination methods. Given the aforementioned information, it's clear that entomophilous plants typically have less exposed stamen compared to anemophilous plants. Conclusion: Flower Y, being an entomophilous plant, has a less exposed stamen compared to flower X, which is an anemophilous plant."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Late on the next Sunday afternoon Gifford had gone for a country walk which he had arranged to bring him round in time for the evening service at the little village church of Wynford standing just outside the park boundary. His way took him by well-remembered field-paths which, although towards the end of his walk darkness had set in, he had no difficulty in tracing. The last field he crossed brought him to a by-road joining the highway which ran through Wynford, the junction being about a quarter of a mile from the church. As he neared the stile which admitted to the road he saw, on the other side of the hedge and showing just above it, the head of a man. At the sound of his footsteps the man quickly turned, and, as for a moment the fitful moonlight caught his face, Gifford was sure he recognized Gervase Henshaw. But he took no notice and kept on his way to the stile, which he crossed and gained the road. As he did so he glanced back. A horse and trap was waiting there with Henshaw in it.

Together with the companion Highs in the Mid-Sixties series , the Pebbles series made available over 800 obscure , mostly American \`\` Original Punk Rock '' songs recorded in the mid- 1960s -- primarily known today as the garage rock and psychedelic rock genres -- that were previously known only to a handful of collectors . In 2007 , the release of the Pebbles , Volume 11 : Northern California CD marked the final album in the Pebbles series ( Curiously , Vol. 12 had been issued in 1999 ) . The following year , Bomp ! marked the 30th anniversary of the original Pebbles album with a spartan , limited - edition , clear - vinyl reissue complete with the original pink cover insert . The Pebbles series played a significant role in the emergence of a \`\` canon '' of garage - rock music and artists in the late 1970s and early 1980s . In his review of the Pebbles series for Allmusic , Richie Unterberger comments : \`\` Though 1972 's Nuggets compilation reawakened listeners to the sounds of mid- ' 60s garage rock , it only focused on the tip of the iceberg . Behind those forgotten hits and semi-hits lurked hundreds , if not thousands , of regional hits and flops from the same era , most even rawer and cruder ... . More than any other factor , these compilations ( in the Pebbles series ) were responsible for the resurgence of interest in garage rock , which remains high among collectors to this day . '' Including the Highs in the Mid-Sixties series , Best of Pebbles series , Essential Pebbles series , Planetary Pebbles series , and two box sets , more than 60 compilation albums have been released using the Pebbles name . Following on the heels of the success of the Pebbles series , dozens of other series of garage rock compilation albums have been started , with numerous albums being released each year for several decades . - AIP Records is a record label that was started by Greg Shaw's Bomp! Records, being launched in 1983 to continue the Pebbles series. The abbreviation AIP stands for \\"Archive International Productions\\". The first 10 volumes in the Pebbles series had been released by BFD Records of Kookaburra, Australia (most likely a fictitious label name to avoid copyright infringement lawsuits) in 1979-1980 and have been kept in print by AIP for many years. Including those in the companion Highs in the Mid-Sixties series which concentrated on American regional music scenes there are over 50 LPs covering some 800 obscure, mostly American \\"Original Punk Rock\\" songs recorded in the mid-1960s primarily known today as the garage rock and psychedelic rock genres that were previously known only to a handful of collectors. - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - A psychedelic drug is a drug whose primary action is to alter cognition and perception, typically by agonising serotonin receptors. - Garage rock (shortened as \\"garage\\"; sometimes '60s punk\\" or \\"garage punk\\") is a raw and energetic style of rock and roll that flourished in the mid-1960s, most notably in the United States and Canada. The term derives from the perception that groups were often made up of young amateurs who rehearsed in the family garage, although many were professional. The phrase \\"garage band\\" is often used to refer to musical acts in this genre. - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Garage punk is a rock subgenre that evokes characteristics identified with punk rock. Its progenitors are with the North American garage rock bands in the early 1960s. The term is sometimes used interchangeably with \\"garage rock\\" or \\"garage revival\\". Another movement that is widely categorized as \\"garage punk\\" drew heavily from stripped-down 1970s punk rock and Detroit proto-punk, taking shape in the indie rock underground between the late 1980s and early 1990s. - The Highs in the Mid-Sixties series is a group of 23 compilation albums of garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings that were issued by AIP Records in the mid-1980s. This series is a companion to the \\"Pebbles\\" series of similar music; the title is technically preceded by \\"Pebbles Presents:\\". The title sounds like it might have come from a weather report, although \\"Highs\\" intends to mean \\"the best\\" (and is also an apparent drug reference), while the recordings on these albums were originally released in the mid-1960s. - Copyright is a legal right created by the law of a country that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights for its use and distribution. This is usually only for a limited time. The exclusive rights are not absolute but limited by limitations and exceptions to copyright law, including fair use.

About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD.

Take bladderworts, a kind of such plant, for example. They appear so small and grow in a quiet pond. \\"But these are the fastest known killers of the plant kingdom, able to capture a small insect in 1/50 of a second using a trap door!\\" Once the trap door closes on the victim, the enzymes similar to those in the human stomach slowly digest the insert. When dinner is over, the plant opens the trap door and is ready to trap again. Meat-eating plants grow mostly in wet areas with soil that doesn't offer much food nutrition. In such conditions, these amazing plants have developed insect traps to get their nutritional needs over thousands of years. North America has more such plants than any other continents. Generally speaking, the traps may have attractive appearance to fool the eye, like pitcher plants, which get their name because they look like beautiful pitchers full of nectar . Hair-like growths along the pitcher walls ensure that nothing can escape, and the digestive enzymes can get to work. A tiny insect can be digested in a few hours, but a fly takes a couple of days. Some of these pitchers are large enough to hold 7.5 liters. Meat-eating plants only eat people in science fiction movies, but sometimes a bird or other small animals will discover that a pitcher plant isn't a good place to get a drink. Options: A A child.

Hypothesis: China still uses traditional Chinese medicine. (1). Yes. (2). It's impossible to say. (3). No.","completion":"Yes, based on the context provided, we can draw the hypothesis that China still uses traditional Chinese medicine. The text explicitly states that poachers in China catch seals \\"to use the genital organs for traditional Chinese medicine.\\" This statement indicates that there is still a demand for seal genital organs within the practice of traditional Chinese medicine in the country. Traditional Chinese medicine is an ancient practice with origins dating back over 2,000 years. It is based on the belief that the body's vital energy, or Qi, needs to flow freely and maintain balance to ensure good health. Traditional Chinese medicine encompasses a variety of treatments, including herbal remedies, acupuncture, massage, and dietary therapy. In the context provided, the demand for seal genital organs is associated with traditional Chinese medicine practices. The use of animal parts in these treatments is not uncommon, as the practice has historically involved various ingredients sourced from plants, animals, and minerals. However, it is important to note that not everyone in China relies solely on traditional Chinese medicine. Many individuals in China also turn to Western medicine to address their health concerns. Additionally, the use of endangered species and controversial methods, such as seal poaching, has been a topic of concern and debate within global conservation efforts. In summary, given the context, we can indeed draw the hypothesis that China still uses traditional Chinese medicine. While it is not the only form of medicine practiced in the country, its continued use of seal genital organs indicates that the practice remains prevalent in some areas or among certain populations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is planning to send nearly 20,000 more shelters as aid agencies deliver emergency supplies to those displaced by the earthquake of 25 April. The international development secretary said the majority of shelter kits were in place before the earthquake hit. This meant temporary homes were provided to thousands within 24 hours of the quake, Justine Greening added. Ms Greening also praised the UK's search and rescue workers for \\"saving many lives\\". The 7.8-magnitude earthquake rocked Nepal, triggering avalanches and mudslides and reducing whole villages to rubble. The death toll has hit 7,500 and is continuing to climb. At least one Briton died in the tragedy while others remain unaccounted for. The UN estimates that eight million people have been affected by the earthquake while 2.8 million people have been displaced by it. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: \\"Our pre-positioned shelter kits meant that within 24 hours of the earthquake British aid was reaching communities who had been hit hard and providing temporary homes to thousands of people across Nepal. \\"Ahead of the monsoon season, we are delivering thousands more to help the Nepalese people cope as they recover from this tragic disaster.\\" Rescue workers are picking through the rubble in the search for people caught up in the earthquake, but the Nepalese Government has announced the search and rescue effort is over. The UK's 60-strong international search and rescue team is also now returning home. The focus has now moved to aid agencies trying to get shelter, clean water and food to those left homeless by the disaster before the monsoon season arrives. A UK Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) public appeal for donations has so far raised more than Â£33m, while the UK government has committed Â£17.5m in humanitarian aid to date.

It added that it had given \\"practical assistance\\" to more than 350 British nationals in Nepal and had arranged flights out of Nepal for around 150. Among the Britons still missing is architecture student Matt Carapiet, 23, from Bearsted, Kent, who was trekking through Langtang Valley when the earthquake struck.

Write a title for this article: KABUL, Afghanistan, July 31  NATO on Monday took over command of international forces from the United States in southern Afghanistan, where the fight against the Taliban insurgency has turned more deadly than at any time since American forces ousted the radical Islamist movement in 2001. The transfer will allow the United States to shift more of its 22,000 troops in Afghanistan toward the border with Pakistan, where leaders of the Taliban and Al Qaeda are believed to have taken refuge and continue to operate across a porous frontier. It will also mean a far larger military role for the 18,000 NATO troops here, which will be embarking on one of the most difficult tasks of its 57-year history. The NATO forces have been in Afghanistan since 2003, but in a peacekeeping role in the largely quiet north. They will now lead the fight against the Taliban, as well as take on powerful drug lords who are backing the insurgents. As if to underscore the challenges, a car bomb exploded in the eastern province of Nangarhar, killing 8 people and wounding 16, as NATO and American generals presided over a flag ceremony marking the transfer of command in an air-conditioned hangar miles away at the southern air base of Kandahar. Clashes between insurgents and troops of NATO and the United States-led coalition continued over the weekend, with a number of insurgents killed or captured, the Afghan Defense Ministry reported. Anticipating the transfer, Taliban insurgents have stepped up their campaign since the spring. They have used car bombs and roadside bombs, assassinated local officials, attacked government posts and gathered in ever larger numbers to fight with international forces. The attacks have terrorized local people, and the perilous security across the south has halted virtually all development and reconstruction projects and helped turned the population against the Afghan government and its foreign backers. The Canadian, British and Dutch troops who make up the bulk of the NATO forces in southern Afghanistan now face an enormous challenge in turning the situation around. The new NATO commander, Lt. Gen. David Richards of Britain, will command 18,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan. The United States coalition commander, Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry, will remain in Afghanistan in command of 18,000 American troops under a coalition flag. The commanders stressed that the transfer would enhance security and the international commitment to Afghanistan. I hope and believe the huge significance of this renewed international commitment will not be lost on the majority who yearn for peace, stability and increased prosperity we came here to deliver, General Richards said in a speech to a select audience of government and provincial officials. These millions of people should be reassured that they will not be let down, he said, according to Afghan news agencies. General Eikenberry, who has spent the last months calming Afghan fears over the withdrawal of United States troops from southern Afghanistan, repeated his own message. The United States will not leave Afghanistan until the Afghan people tell us the job is done, he said. The war on terrorism began here in Afghanistan and it continues today. We must never forget that. NATO will have soldiers from 37 countries under its command in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, deployed in the northern, western and southern parts of the country. The NATO deployment will bring thousands more troops to southern Afghanistan, the Taliban heartland, where insurgents have mounted a vigorous campaign this year. Already, NATO forces have encountered stronger resistance than they expected as they moved into the area over the last several months. Sixty-eight troops from the international forces have died so far this year, most of them American but some Canadian and British. So far the pace of casualties exceeds that of 2005, when 86 troops died in the worst year for coalition forces since American troops invaded Afghanistan in 2001 after its Taliban rulers harbored Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. General Richards has said he plans to do things differently from the United States-led forces, and emphasizes the importance of development and aid to rural communities. But first he has to bring a modicum of security. At the moment, his troops are still battling for control of several districts. In a news conference this weekend, he said he hoped to set up secure zones in the south within the next three to six months. But he said that the current military presence would be needed for 3 to 5 years and that a foreign military presence would be required in Afghanistan for 15 years to ensure stability.","completion":"\\"NATO Takes Over Command in Southern Afghanistan to Battle Taliban Insurgency\\""},{"prompt":"Q: I heard that Cameron was crying and Alex walked up and kissed her.

Johnny O'Clock is a junior partner in a posh casino with Guido Marchettis. Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him.

The 59-year-old was later moved to St Bartholomew's Hospital in central London for treatment. A representative told the BBC that Van Day has \\"had a stent fitted to [a] main artery\\". A stent is a short wire-mesh tube, inserted into the artery via a catheter. The stent is left in place permanently to allow blood to flow through the artery more freely. Van Day's spokesman said the singer \\"should be leaving for home soon\\" following the operation but will need to rest for the next month. The singer has cancelled his scheduled appearances for November. He tweeted: \\"Thanks for all the kind and positive messages I've had today. I'm hoping to make a speedy recovery.\\" Van Day, together with Canadian-born Thereza Bazar, made up Dollar - a pop duo who had a string of chart hits in the late 1970s and 1980s, including Mirror Mirror and Give Me Back My Heart.

Then choose 1 end to seal with packing tape. Tape along the seams to ready the box for packing. For shipping, use corrugated cardboard boxes. These boxes are double-walled, so they’re stronger than regular boxes. The tray is similar to an egg carton, dividing the box into cells that hold containers in place. It’s a useful option when you plan on sending multiple items. They can be purchased from moving and shipping companies, but many liquor stores can give you some for free if you ask nicely. Foam trays are another option. These trays come in various sizes to hold all sorts of containers. If you are using a specialty wine box, the tray will already be in place. Wrapping paper or newspaper is usually enough protection with a tray. Roll the paper around each container as tightly as possible. To be safe, you can also wrap the containers in bubble wrap. When shipping multiple containers, wrap each one individually. Use rubber bands or packing tape as needed to hold the wrapping in place. If you have a tray, this part is easy. Slide the container into the tray’s cell, squeezing the wrapping as needed to fit it. Keep the lid or cap end pointed upwards. Double-check that the container is wedged in place with its cap on securely. Repeat this with any other containers sent in the same package. If you choose not to use a tray, lay the container in the center of the box. Keep it away from the sides as much as possible. Stuff the packing peanuts, bubble wrap, or air bags into the package as needed. Use them to eliminate any leftover space, such as between the container and the wall. Also add cushioning above the container as needed. The extra padding can make the difference between a broken container and successful shipping. Fold the box’s top flaps together. Tape along all the seams. Attempt to lift the flaps to check how well they are taped down. Cover over any loose spots with additional layers of tape to ensure your package doesn’t open up in the delivery person’s hands! Find a black permanent marker. On the top side of the box, write “Liquid” and “Fragile” in capital letters. In fact, write it several times all over the box to make your point. Then, take the box to the shipping company. Have them print out a label and place it on the top of the box. Labeling the contents as liquid or fragile does not guarantee that the box will arrive in 1 piece, but it may alert a carrier about to handle the package roughly.","completion":"The article is all about how to safely pack and ship containers in a box, using materials like corrugated cardboard boxes, protective trays, wrapping paper or bubble wrap, and packing peanuts or air bags to ensure the items stay secure and cushioned, along with marking the box as containing \\"liquid\\" and \\"fragile\\" items before shipping."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - A satellite&#x27;s need is determined - A group of people work to design a satellite capable of accomplishing the need - A team designs the physical structure of the satellite - A crew builds the physical satellite - The satellite is packed into a capsule - The satellite capsule is loaded onto a rocket Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process, after the satellite capsule is loaded onto a rocket, is to launch the rocket and place the satellite into its designated orbit around the Earth. This crucial step is vital to ensuring the satellite's functionality and mission success. Launching the satellite involves several sub-steps, which are detailed below: 1. Pre-launch preparations: Prior to the launch, technicians thoroughly check the rocket, satellite, and launch pad to ensure all systems are functioning correctly. They also confirm the satellite's placement within the rocket and secure all necessary control and support devices. Weather conditions are closely monitored to guarantee a safe launching environment. Final trajectory calculations are made, taking into consideration various factors such as air resistance, orbital altitude, and required orbital inclination. Additionally, the launch window is carefully chosen to ensure a precise orbital insertion. 2. Ignition and lift-off: The rocket's engines ignite, generating a tremendous amount of thrust to lift the rocket and its payload off the launch pad. The initial acceleration is necessary to overcome the Earth's gravity and carry the satellite to its desired altitude. As the rocket ascends, it undergoes several flight phases, including the vertical ascent, gravity turn, and horizontal flight. 3. Staging: Most rockets have multiple stages, which are separate sections of the vehicle containing their own engines and propellant tanks. Once a stage has expended its fuel, it is jettisoned to reduce the rocket's overall mass. This process is known as \\"staging.\\" Each stage takes the rocket progressively higher and faster during its ascent. 4. Fairing separation: During the ascent, the satellite is protected within the rocket's payload fairing. This aerodynamic shell shields the satellite from atmospheric forces, such as drag and temperature variations. Once the rocket reaches a desired altitude, typically above the Earth's denser atmosphere, the fairing is no longer necessary and is separated from the structure to further reduce the rocket's mass. 5. Orbital insertion: After the final rocket stage has completed its burn and attained the desired altitude and velocity, the satellite is released from the rocket and is placed into its intended orbit around the Earth. This phase requires precise control to ensure a successful deployment and the correct orbital parameters. 6. Post-launch operations: Once the satellite is successfully deployed into orbit, ground control teams initiate contact to verify its functionality and health. The satellite's solar panels are extended to provide power, and onboard systems are tested to ensure proper operation. The satellite then begins its mission, carrying out the tasks it was designed to perform, such as Earth observation, telecommunications, or scientific research. In conclusion, the final step of the process detailed above is to launch the rocket, carry the satellite into orbit, and successfully deploy it to carry out its intended mission. This step encompasses several sub-steps, each critical to ensuring the satellite's functionality and overall mission success. The meticulous planning and execution during this final step ensure that the satellite meets its determined need and contributes valuable data, services, or research findings to benefit stakeholders on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's break it down and analyze each aspect mentioned in the review to provide a detailed answer. 1. \\"Not a bad burger\\" - This is a somewhat positive statement, suggesting that the burger is decent enough and met the reviewer's basic expectations. However, the use of the word \\"bad\\" also implies that while it may not be terrible, it's not outstanding either. 2. \\"Price is good\\" - This is a positive aspect as it implies that the pricing of the burger is reasonable, which is always a good selling point for customers. 3. \\"Employees are nice\\" - Another positive point in the review, stating that the staff was friendly and polite during the reviewer's visit. 4. \\"French Fries are probably the wurst I have had. Like eating a piece of hard foam.\\" - This statement is decidedly negative, as the reviewer is comparing the quality of the fries to a hard and unpleasant texture. The use of the word \\"wurst\\" instead of \\"worst\\" could suggest a play on words, possibly intending to make the statement even more negative. 5. \\"Won't return\\" - This is a clear negative point, indicating that the customer's overall experience was not satisfactory enough to merit a repeat visit. To summarize, this review contains some positive points, such as the decent price and nice employees, but the strongly negative critique of the French fries and the customer's decision to not return to the establishment tip the overall review towards the negative side. While there are some redeeming qualities mentioned, the negative elements ultimately outweigh the positive aspects, giving this review a predominantly negative tone."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. I can use this background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. Now, I have a new situation: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Greg and Sandy for the following movie plot: A father and son go hunting in the mountains. Before they can begin hunting, which the son does not want to do anyway, they are killed by flying jellyfish-like creatures, which penetrate their skin with needle-tipped tentacles. Some time later, four teenagers, Tom, Greg, Beth and Sandy, hike in the same area, ignoring the warnings of local truck stop owner Joe Taylor (Jack Palance). A group of Cub Scouts is also in the area; their leader (Larry Storch) is also killed by the alien creatures, while his troop runs into an unidentified humanoid and flee. The teenagers set up camp at a lake, but after a few hours, Tom and Beth disappear. Sandy and Greg go looking for them and discover their bodies in an abandoned shack. They drive away in their van, while being attacked by one of the starfish which tries to get through the car's windshield. After they get rid of it, they arrive at the truck stop. Greg tries to get help from the locals, but they do not believe him, except for Fred 'Sarge' Dobbs (Martin Landau), who is a mentally ill veteran. Meanwhile, Sandy encounters the humanoid and flees into the woods, where Joe Taylor finds and returns her to Greg. While they discuss the situation, the sheriff arrives, but Sarge shoots him and begins to become more paranoid. Greg and Sandy leave with Taylor, who reveals he has been attacked by the humanoid before and secretly keeps the flying jellyfish as trophies. They search for the shack and once there, Taylor goes inside to only find the bodies of Tom, Beth and the cub scout leader. They discuss waiting for the creature when Taylor is attacked by another \\"jellyfish\\". The young people run once again, leaving him behind as ordered. They stop a police car and get into the back seat, but find Sarge driving. He abducts them, believing them to be aliens. Greg plays along, telling the deranged man that an invasion force is on the way, thus distracting him enough to toss him aside, run away with Sandy and jump from a bridge.

Installing the fridge was a lot easier than doing the stove was for Roger. He had previously installed the fridge before in a different house, which provided him with a better understanding of the process and a familiarity with the necessary tools and equipment. The experience he gained from his previous installation proved incredibly beneficial, as he could now approach the task with confidence and efficiency. Before diving into the installation, Roger made sure to carefully read the instruction manual provided by the manufacturer. This helped him identify any differences between the current fridge model and the one from his past installation. He also double-checked the required tools and gathered them in advance, ensuring he was fully prepared for each step of the process. Roger began by carefully measuring the allocated space for the fridge in his kitchen, verifying that the dimensions were accurate and allowing for proper ventilation. He then carefully unpacked the fridge, making sure not to damage any of the components or the appliance itself while removing it from the box and protective materials. Next, he inspected the fridge thoroughly, verifying there were no visible scratches or dents, and that all parts were included. The next step was to level the fridge, which was an important aspect of the installation process. Roger adjusted the feet located underneath the appliance to ensure it was sitting on a solid, even surface. This was crucial for maintaining proper function and preventing any issues down the line. After leveling the fridge, he installed the water and ice line connections, following the manufacturer's guidelines to ensure a leak-free and secure connection. Roger was meticulous with this step, knowing that it could lead to potential water damage if not executed correctly. With the water and ice lines successfully connected, it was time to plug in the fridge and give it a test run. Roger was careful not to kink the power cord or water lines as he slid the fridge into its designated space in the kitchen. As the fridge powered up, he listened for any unusual noises or signs of potential malfunction. Hearing nothing out of the ordinary, he moved on to testing the ice maker and water dispenser, ensuring both operated smoothly and efficiently. Finally, with all tests yielding positive results, Roger began transferring the contents of the old fridge to the new one. As he did, he took the opportunity to clean and organize the items, discarding expired products and wiping down the shelves to start fresh. Once the fridge was fully stocked and organized, he stood back and admired his handiwork, feeling a great sense of satisfaction in having successfully installed the appliance with ease and confidence. In summary, Roger's prior experience in installing a fridge in a different house considerably facilitated the installation process for him. He diligently followed the manufacturer's guidelines, ensuring a safe and efficient setup while preventing any potential issues down the line. Thanks to his commitment to doing things right and the knowledge derived from his previous experience, Roger was able to smoothly complete the installation and enjoy the benefits of his new fridge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From shorter to longer wavelengths, the order is as follows: gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet rays, visible light (violet to red), infrared rays, microwaves, and radio waves. In this context, visible light has a wavelength range of approximately 400 to 700 nanometers. On the other hand, infrared light, as mentioned in your background, has a wavelength range of 0.7 to 300 micrometers (or 700 nanometers to 300,000 nanometers).

The employee of the Milwaukee County treasury office- who entered his home in the West Allis neighborhood in order to start the repossession process- found Mr Carter's 'nearly skeletonized' remains on his stairway, a gunshot in his head, and a handgun on his chest. No bill or income tax has been paid by Mr Carter since late 2007, so that is the approximate date-of-death that officials have given him, but there is no way to be exact. 'We're trying to figure it out, too. How could it go this far?' said local government worker Michael Czaplewski. 'It's one of those things where it falls between the cracks, I guess,’ he told the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel. Unexpected: The city of Milwaukee mowed his lawn and shovelled his snow since he went missing, and sent bills totalling 37,000 for the services that went unpaid. Though Mr Carter clearly did not maintain the house, the city took it upon themselves to shovel and mow his lawn through the years and then charged him for those services; his bill is now 37,000 for the years of maintenance. Mr Carter, whose 45th birthday would have been January 23 of this year, lived and studied in Milwaukee, and school records show him attending the local high school and earning a college degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As an only child raised by a single mother, Mr Carter had few close relatives after his mother died following a battle with cancer in 1997. Mr Carter's cousin, Kevin O'Neill, said that he became emotionally withdrawn and began drinking heavily after his mother's death. His remains were found last week when a city employee came to the house to start the foreclosure process. In spite of his grief, he moved on to work as a nuisance control officer for the city of Milwaukee from 1999 to 2007. He resigned from that job in September 2007 and said he was planning to move to Albequerque, and then he disappeared. 'The people closest to him knew he moved so nobody ever did bother to think that anything was wrong with him,' said his high school friend Teresa Bornheimer. Since his body was found, more details are being discovered as people try to understand how he could have been dead in his own house for four years without anyone noticing. Medical records show that he was listed as the father of a girl who is now 14 years old. He and the mother never married and the mother, whose name has not been released, said that the last time she saw him was in 2006. Certain: His 'nearly skeletonized' body was identified using dental records. Though he clearly was not a constant part of the girl's life, he did keep her in his thoughts as investigators found a note which had a list of his possessions that he bequeathed to her. 'My jaw just dropped when I found out. I told myself maybe it's a bum living at the house,' said Ms Bornheimer. The decomposed body was identified as Mr Carter using dental records. The profits from the sale of his house, which originally belonged to his mother, will go to the county but because of the discovery that he had a daughter, she could likely challenge the county for the profits. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"A man named David Carter, who lived in Milwaukee, told his friends he was moving to New Mexico in 2007. But actually, he stayed in his home and sadly took his own life. His body was found four years later by a person who came to take the house because David had not paid any bills. The city did things like mow his lawn and shovel snow, not knowing he was gone, and charged him for it. David's friends and family thought he had just moved away and didn't know what had happened.

Answer:","completion":"This review would likely increase the chances of me buying the product. Here's my step-by-step justification: 1. The reviewer acknowledges that the recordings are from 50+ years ago and are derived from existing LPs, 45s, or 78s. This sets an expectation of potentially lower audio quality due to the age and source of the recordings. 2. However, the reviewer states that this is the \\"VERY BEST reconstruction\\" they have ever heard, which suggests that the product's audio quality is better than other similar products. 3. The reviewer also mentions their involvement in the product's production, which could indicate a potential bias. However, their excitement and enthusiasm for the product, coupled with specific examples (e.g., Buddy Rich on drums, the song \\"CARIOCA\\") may still be persuasive. 4. The reviewer addresses potential concerns about purchasing public domain material by assuring potential buyers that they will \\"LOVE IT.\\" Overall, the reviewer's excitement and satisfaction with the product, as well as their assurances that it is of high quality despite being derived from older original sources, would increase the chances of me buying the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Then I will assign points for each element, considering the scale from 0 (not similar) to 5 (very similar). 1. Topic (Earthquake): Both sentences mention an earthquake occurring, so their topic is the same. Points: 5/5 2. Magnitude: The first sentence is about a 6.0-magnitude earthquake, while the second is about a 5.0-magnitude earthquake. They are similar to some extent, but not identical. Points: 3/5 3. Location: The first sentence mentions Greece, while the second talks about Japan. These locations are different and not similar at all. Points: 0/5 4. Reporting agency: The first sentence refers to the \\"USGS\\" (United States Geological Survey) as the source, while the second sentence doesn't mention any source.

Why doesn't the Moon spin? -no. -yes.","completion":"To determine whether these questions have the same meaning, let's analyze them step by step. 1. Read and understand both questions: - Why isn't the Moon spinning? - Why doesn't the Moon spin? 2. Break down the questions into their essential components: - Both questions are asking about the Moon's rotation (spinning). - The first question uses the present continuous tense (isn't spinning), whereas the second question uses the simple present tense (doesn't spin). 3. Consider potential differences in meaning or context based on the tenses used: - The present continuous tense might imply an ongoing action or process. In this case, the first question could possibly be asking why the Moon is not currently spinning at this very moment. - The simple present tense is more general and used for habits, facts, and general truths. The second question, therefore, is asking about the Moon's lack of spin as a general phenomenon, not necessarily focused on the current moment. 4. Assess the potential difference in meaning: - Despite the difference in tense usage, both questions are effectively asking about the same phenomenon: the Moon's lack of rotation. 5. Provide a final analysis: - While there might be a subtle difference in tense, in practical terms, both questions convey the same essential meaning.

What's the answer? Pick from: 1). vapor particles. 2). solid. 3). ice. 4). frigid.","completion":"The answer is 1). vapor particles. When water is heated above 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric pressure, it undergoes a phase transition from liquid to gas. This gaseous state of water is referred to as steam or water vapor. Above 100 degrees Celsius, water molecules gain enough kinetic energy to break free from the liquid state and enter the gaseous phase. Let's delve a little deeper into the science behind this phenomenon. Water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen atoms bonded together, with the molecular formula H2O. In the liquid state, water molecules are packed closely together and are held in place by hydrogen bonds that form between the negatively-charged oxygen atom in one water molecule and the positively-charged hydrogen atom in another. As water is heated, the kinetic energy of its molecules increases, causing them to move faster. When the temperature reaches the boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius, these molecules have enough energy to overcome the hydrogen bonds holding them together in the liquid state, and they transition into the gaseous state. This is when steam is formed, comprising water vapor particles that are spaced farther apart than in the liquid state. To recap, when water is heated above 100 degrees Celsius, it transforms from liquid to gas, generating steam or water vapor particles. The other options provided, solid, ice, and frigid, do not describe the state or characteristics of water at this temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Chuck said works of Chinese literature are hard to get in the United States, as bookstores simply don't carry many English translations. \\"Besides, China is considered a mysterious country and far away from our daily life.\\" Chuck said when he was in school, pupils mostly studied Western literature translated from French, German and Portuguese, not literature translated from Asian languages. \\"China's Nobel prize will inspire more Westerners to notice Chinese literature, and I may read some of Mo's works,\\" he added. Li Ling, a professor at Beijing Language and Cultural University, said Chinese literature has less of a market than English-language literature because Western culture is the dominant culture. Moreover, it is difficult to fully express some Chinese words in English, which can limit Chinese literature to a Chinese-literate audience, Li added. \\"Western readers are more picky about what they read,\\" he said, explaining that if a Chinese book is not translated well, it would be \\" _ \\" to recommend it to Western readers. Li expects China's Nobel laureate to expand foreign readership. Question: According to what Chuck said, Mo's winning Nobel Prize has a/an _ effect on Chinese Literature.

They dim immediately when it's sunny and brighten when a passing cloud blocks the sun. A wall of windows at a University of Pennsylvania engineering building has built-in blinds controlled by a computer program that follows the sun's path. Buildings are getting smarter and the next generation of building materials is expected to do even more. Windows could catch the sun's energy to heat water. Sensors that measure the carbon dioxide breathed out by people in a room could determine whether the air conditioning needs to be turned up. Many new materials and technology have been designed in the last 15 years. They are now being used in a wave of buildings designed to save as much energy as possible. They include old ideas, like \\"green roofs\\", where a belt of plants on a roof helps the building keep heat in winter and stay cool in summer, and new ideas, like special coating for windows that lets light in, but keeps heat out. As technologies such as sensors become cheaper, their uses spread. The elevators at Seven World Trade Center, which is under construction in New York, use a system that groups people traveling to nearby floors into the same elevator, thus saving elevator stops. People who work in the building will enter it by swiping ID cards that will tell the elevators their floor, readouts will then tell them which elevator to use. The building also has windows with a coating that blocks heat while letting in light. More new building materials and technology are in development. A Philadelphia building firm is now working on \\"smart wrap\\" that uses tiny solar collectors to catch the sun's energy and transmitters as wide as a human hair to move it. They are expected to change the face of the construction industry in the next ten years or so.

As a mother, I’m right now navigating the hardest moment with my two daughters and my son … I was raped at 15 and molested by a teacher from 15–16 … it took 13 years of fighting before I saw any justice for those crimes and it paled in comparison to having to live with that trauma for the last 25 years. I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia. Louis the Pious died in 840, with the empire still in chaos.A three-year civil war followed his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers was created for Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) as king. In the eastern lands the dynasty had died out earlier, in 911, with the death of Louis the Child, and the selection of the unrelated Conrad I (r.... Guess a valid title for it!

[I] negative; [II] positive;).","completion":"[I] Insidious (2010) - Positive Movie Review Title: Delving into the Dark Side of Paranormal Directed by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell, 'Insidious' (2010) is a spine-chilling horror film that breathes new life into the ever-popular paranormal genre. With impeccable acting, a concise storyline, and jump scares that genuinely send shivers down your spine, this movie is a must-see for horror enthusiasts everywhere. As a positive movie review, it's essential to recognize the film's outstanding features that make it stand out from the crowd. Insidious delivers a satisfying blend of psychological thriller and supernatural suspense. It masterfully avoids the common horror movie clichés, allowing the audience to experience a rich and engrossing narrative that keeps them engaged and anxious throughout. The plot of the film revolves around Josh and Renai Lambert, played by Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne, a couple who moves their family - their daughter and two young sons - into a new home, only to discover sinister forces haunting them. When one of their sons, Dalton, falls into an unexplainable coma, the couple seeks the help of paranormal investigator Elise Rainier (played by Lin Shaye) to unravel the mystery and save their son from a dark and dangerous spirit realm known as The Further. The acting in 'Insidious' is nothing short of phenomenal, with all the main characters delivering powerful and raw performances that strike an emotional chord. Byrne convincingly portrays a devoted mother desperate to save her child, while Wilson brings depth to his role as a man torn between skepticism and fear. Lin Shaye's performance as the seasoned psychic is equally captivating, with a strong on-screen presence that effectively bridges the gap between viewers hungry for answers and the horrifying dilemma our protagonists face. One aspect where 'Insidious' truly excels is its sound design, which dramatically enhances the film's eerie atmosphere. The atonal musical score by Joseph Bishara is a standout, creating a chilling backdrop that further intensifies the on-screen tension. Clever utilization of sound effects in pivotal scenes makes even the smallest moments feel ghastly and spine-chilling, ensuring that the audience remains on edge throughout the film. The film's visuals are another highlight, with an intelligent combination of practical effects, makeup, and minimal reliance on CGI. This lends the movie an air of authenticity and keeps the paranormal encounters terrifyingly grounded in reality. James Wan's direction, combined with David M. Brewer and John R. Leonetti's cinematography, elevates the movie to a visual spectacle, with atmospheric lighting and clever camera angles that keep the viewers glued to their seats. With a compelling narrative, exceptional performances, and haunting visuals that stand tall in the world of horror films, 'Insidious' is a cinematic triumph that redefines the genre and leaves a lasting impact on its viewers. Despite being over a decade old, this film continues to entertain and disturb audiences, making it a timeless classic in the world of horror."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(March 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Dave (Vince Vaughn), a dealer for Guitar Hero, and Ronnie (Malin Ãkerman), a stay-at-home mom, are a typical couple raising two young children in the suburbs of Chicago. They experience various stresses including redecorating their house and raising their kids.

At Dave's son's birthday party, Jason and Cynthia, using PowerPoint, announce their troubled marriage and they are considering divorce because they cannot have a baby. As a last-ditch effort, they have found a couples therapy resort named Eden. A deal called the Pelican Package is half the normal cost if they can get three other couples to join them. In their presentation, they show beautiful pictures of sunlit beaches and beautiful locations. They also assure the others that the couples therapy is purely optional. Dave and Ronnie discuss their inability to go because of childcare responsibilities and decline the trip. In the middle of the night, their home security alarm is activated when Jason shows up unexpectedly to further sell the idea of the retreat.

(CNN) -- Despite their public handshake on Monday it appears there is still some way to go before Tiger Woods and Sergio Garcia bury the hatchet. A long-running spat between the two golfers resurfaced after they shared a contentious round together at The Players' Championship in May. After several verbal volleys in either direction, Garcia's joke that he would invite Woods round for \\"fried chicken\\" during the U.S Open led to an immediate and unreserved apology from the Spaniard, who denied it was racially motivated. A statement from the world No. 1 on social networking site Twitter called the remarks \\"wrong, hurtful and clearly inappropriate.\\" Woods also said that he was sure there was \\"real regret\\" on the part of Garcia and that it was time to move on. Inevitably, the issue resurfaced as both players prepared to come face-to-face ahead of the second major of the year at Merion in Philadelphia. The pair greeted each other on the practice range but the world No. 1 told a press conference on Tuesday there had been no time for a formal apology. Asked if they had discussed Garcia's comments Woods replied: \\"No, we didn't discuss anything. Just came up and said 'hi' and that was it.\\" Woods was pressed by reporters as to whether the Spaniard had offered him any form of apology but he said: \\"No, we haven't had time for that. \\"It's already done.

Options: A. flintlock B. tennis court C. at home D. motion E. arcade Answer:","completion":"E. Arcade The most sensible option for firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth would be at an arcade. This is because arcades are designed for fun and safe entertainment, and have specific games and attractions where you can participate in activities like this. In this case, the game would likely be a well-designed and controlled environment, already set up for players to aim and fire projectiles at targets such as a clown's mouth. The arcade staff would ensure the equipment is functional and safe to use, adhering to various safety regulations. Comparing this option to the others, it's clear that an arcade is the most logical and common-sense choice: A. Flintlock: A flintlock is a type of firearm dating back to the 17th century, which is not a safe nor relevant option for the given situation. Firing any firearm, whether antique or modern, at a clown's mouth would be not only dangerous but also inappropriate in any context. B. Tennis court: While a tennis court is a place to hit a ball, it is a setting strictly meant for playing tennis with proper gear like racquets and tennis balls. Using it to shoot a projectile ball at a clown's mouth would be both disrespectful to others who may be playing or wanting to play tennis and unsafe without proper targets and infrastructure in place. C. At home: Firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth in a home setting isn't the most appropriate choice. There's a higher risk of causing damage to objects or injury to people present, as homes are not designed or equipped for this kind of activity. Parents or guardians would also likely have concerns about safety and stress the importance of not playing with projectiles indoors. D. Motion: This option doesn't make sense, as \\"motion\\" is not a place or context where one could fire a projectile ball at a clown's mouth. Motion is a term that describes movement and is not relevant to the question at hand. In conclusion, an arcade is the most logical and safe place to fire a projectile ball at a clown's mouth. This environment is specifically created for such games and activities, making it the most common-sense option among the ones provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Either a handwritten or typed letter is totally acceptable. A handwritten letter will have a slightly more personal look, but a typed letter is better if you're more comfortable that way. What matters is the effort you're making to craft a letter and send it, so don't worry too much about your choice here. If you choose to handwrite it, use a pen with black or blue ink. Write in either print or cursive, as long as your writing is legible. If you choose to type it, use a font that's easy to read, like Times New Roman or Arial. This is especially necessary if you're writing a thank you letter to a professional colleague. While dashing off a note on a torn piece of scrap paper demonstrates your interesting character, it's considered more polite to use a nice piece of stationery or a thank you card. If someone went to the trouble of giving you a gift, the nice thing to do is send them your letter in a format that shows you're sincerely grateful. If you go with stationary, it doesn't have to be fancy. Look for heavier-weight paper made with cotton or another high-quality material. It's fine to use stationary with a design or your initials. Packs of thank you cards are sold in stationary shops and drug stores. Consider getting more than one so you'll have more cards on hand for next time. The style of your note will be a little different depending on who's receiving it. Keeping the nature of the gift in mind, think about what type of note would be most appropriate. No matter what, you want to leave the person receiving the note feeling that you're sincerely grateful. For example, if you're sending a thank-you note to your boss, and the workplace setting is pretty formal, you might want to choose high-quality business stationery, type the letter and format it according to the standards for a professional business letter. If the note is for a friend, you can show a little more personality. Write your note on a funny postcard, or make your own cool stationary. While sending a thank-you text message never quite has enough oomph to show how grateful you are, sometimes it's fine to send an email. This is especially true if you're not writing the note in thanks for a physical gift. For example, if your aunt lent an ear when you were upset over breaking up with your boyfriend, you might want to send her a thank-you email in gratitude for her patience and understanding. However, if you need to thank someone for giving you an actual gift or for dedicating a significant amount of time toward helping you, it's better to send a real letter. People realize that it takes effort to write and mail a letter, and that extra time will be appreciated. If you send an email, it should be as well composed and thoughtful as a regular letter would be. In fact, you might want to take even more time making sure it's well written, since you're not going to the trouble of sending it by snail mail.

A progress indicator will be displayed during the decryption process, so you can monitor its progress. Please note that you might be prompted to provide the BitLocker recovery key for the drive during this process. If you encrypted your drive with a password or smart card, enter that information when prompted. If you saved the BitLocker recovery key to a file or your Microsoft account, retrieve it from there. Once the decryption process is complete, you will receive a notification saying that BitLocker has been turned off for the selected drive. At this point, your files and the drive itself can be accessed without needing BitLocker decryption, but it's essential to remember that turning off BitLocker encryption decreases the security of the drive and its files. If you need to enable BitLocker again in the future, simply follow the same steps and choose the \\"Turn On BitLocker\\" option instead.

Context: The leading U.S. presidential hopefuls reacted strongly Monday to the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Sunday's incident that left 49 people dead and 53 others wounded was the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was a U.S. citizen and the son of Afghan parents. In her first speech since the shooting, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told supporters in Cleveland, \\"The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive.\\" Clinton laid out a multi-faceted approach to combating terrorism. The plan would disrupt terrorist groups by infiltrating their online networks, enhancing intelligence sharing among local and federal law enforcement agencies, and asking allied nations to help \\"prevent the radicalization and recruitment\\" of potential terrorists in the U.S. and Europe. In an apparent response to presumptive Republican Party opponent Donald Trump's charge that President Barack Obama and other Democrats refuse to use the word \\"radical\\" to describe terrorists who happen to be Muslim, Clinton said earlier on CNN that she is not afraid to use the term, but says she refuses \\"to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\\" Doing so, she said, \\"plays right into the ISIS' hands.\\" ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as IS, ISIL and Daesh. Clinton called for citizens to reach out to Muslims in the United States \\"to help us defeat this threat.\\" She cited the need for \\"common sense reform\\" of gun ownership laws, including a ban on assault weapons. After Obama did not use the term \\"radical\\" in his remarks Sunday from the White House, Trump criticized Obama's approach to extremism and said the president \\"should step down.\\" Trump, meanwhile, renewed a call for a ban on the entry of Muslim immigrants into the United States. \\"The only reason the killer was in America in the first place was we allowed his family to come here,\\" Trump said in a speech to supporters in Manchester, New...

Summarize: The helicopters are in addition to the £2.5m donated by the UK to the UN's Humanitarian Air Service. The military and UN helicopters will ferry people and aid supplies across remote and hard-to-reach terrain. The Foreign Office has confirmed that British dual national Hemchandra Rai, 42, was killed in the disaster. The married father of three lived in Hong Kong. Reports of another British victim killed at Mount Everest base camp are still being investigated. Ms Greening said: \\"These highly versatile Royal Air Force helicopters and UN aircraft will mean life-saving aid supplies can be moved around Nepal and reach people in remote communities cut off by the earthquake who are in desperate need. \\"Conditions in Nepal are dire, but the UK is determined to do everything it can to help support Nepal and its people.\\" The three CH47 Chinook aircraft will be transported from RAF Brize Norton to the region. The Department for International Development (DfID) says the first Chinook is being prepared for transit on Thursday and will be sent out on Friday, with the other two being sent in the coming days. The Foreign Office also confirmed that two of its teams, deployed to locate and assist British nationals in remote areas, helped rescue eight British nationals who were then transported from Dhunche to Kathmandu. Some 300 British citizens have been assisted by the British embassy in Kathmandu since Saturday's 7.8-magnitude quake struck, killing more than 5,500 people. An aid flight carrying 120 Britons from Nepal to the UK landed on Thursday. There were emotional scenes as family members greeted relatives after the plane landed at Stansted Airport shortly after 03:00 BST. Meanwhile, a boy and a woman have been rescued from collapsed buildings in Kathmandu after surviving for five days in the rubble. Among those arriving back at Stansted on board the DfID-chartered Boeing 767 - which flew aid out to Nepal on Sunday - were children and people chosen as a priority because of health conditions. The youngest passenger was a three-month-old baby. Husband and wife Grahame and Holly Jobes, from Sunderland, were reunited as he stepped through immigration. Mr Jobes, who was in Nepal for a friend's wedding, told the BBC he was in Kathmandu when the earthquake struck. \\"Things were dropping down, people were running,\\" he said. \\"I am very fortunate, I managed to get out. I was next to people who are no longer here.\\" Harry Quinn, 26, from Brighton, said a hotel - which had turned him away because it was full - completely collapsed with 80 people inside. \\"We were among the lucky ones but we saw plenty of others who weren't so lucky.\\" Chris Berriman, from Morpeth, Northumberland, arrived back in the UK on Monday. He said he was in a bookshop in Kathmandu when the quake struck. \\"I dropped to my knees in the doorway and watched large cracks appear in the walls around me,\\" he said. \\"I staggered out into the streets when the quake passed. The streets are narrow with tall buildings so there was debris falling everywhere.\\" About 30 British and Irish families are reportedly still waiting for news of their loved ones who may have been in Nepal at the time of the earthquake. Judy Ross, from Bath, said she feared for the safety of her daughter, Susannah Ross, 20, who is among a group of trekkers stranded in northern Nepal following the earthquake. She has heard her daughter is alive, but said she did not know what state she was in and that she feared boulders \\"the size of a car\\" were still falling in the area. An appeal launched by the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) has raised more than £19m in the UK - including £14m in public donations and £5m from the government, which matched the first £5m of public donations. The UK government has also pledged £15m to Nepal in aid. Members of a 60-strong UK International Search and Rescue (UKISAR) team have also started searching for victims on the ground - including in remote parts of Nepal - with specialist rescue dogs. Hundreds of shelter kits and solar lanterns are among 18 tonnes of supplies from the UK which have arrived in the devastated region, Ms Greening said. A team of Gurkha engineers - 12 from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles and six from the Queen's Gurkha Engineers - has also travelled to the country to help operate water purification equipment. The DEC, an umbrella organisation that brings together 13 British aid charities to deal with international crises, has launched a website and donation line.","completion":"The UK has donated £2.5m to the UN's Humanitarian Air Service and is sending military and UN helicopters to ferry aid supplies and people across remote and hard-to-reach areas in Nepal.

First one has to take into account the time period this film was made in. 1995. Rappers were in it, and that added to the flair of it. Remy was a socially awkward teen trying to find his way and couldn't, until he met and was befriended by Nazis. They took him in. Nazi's aren't all this awkward, but like most gangs, they fill a void that is missing be it economic, social, emotional, whatever. Michael Rappaport played the part perfectly. Omar Epps was the hot shot track star, with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder. He kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight, and had his girlfriend and professor to straighten him out on it. Kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in, until she was date raped. She then found her self experiment with her sexuality, and getting involved politically. This film deals with racism and like most things that deal with racism, people's own perspectives come into play. I read so many comments about how there were no 'evil' black characters but there were evil white one (Nazis). So what? Remy wasn't portrayed as evil at all, he was trying to find his way, and kept failing until some skinheads accepted him. He was scared, it was sad to see him devolve how he did. He even says right before he kills himself, I didn't mean it, I wanted to be an engineer. Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes were angry black men, Ice Cube was somewhat of an intellectual, and Busta Rhymes was just portrayed as a dumb thug. They both showed no consideration at all for their roommates, and generally appear to not like white people very much. They were angry like the Nazis but not on the level of Nazis in terms of overall badness. Sorry if this makes it seem unfair, but are there really black groups like the Nazis? No. People say it shows white=-bad black=good. Not true, the only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police, which is more or less true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (omar epps roommate) was a good guy, and even Remy was a good guy, he was just misguided. Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta were seriously flawed characters, angry and inconsiderate. Although their constant harassment by police seemed to justify some of their anger. Remy's inability to fit in seemed to justify his anger as well. Good movie, well done. Like all movies that deal with racism, its a great piece to get a discussion going. I don't think Cube and Busta coulda beat those Nazis though. Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review? Options are: A). negative.

Hello, my little friend! Today we're going to learn about a period in London's history when people got very sick from a bad germ called the plague. The plague made lots of people in London sick many different times, and it lasted for about 400 years! Let me explain it to you in a simple way. First, what is the plague? The plague is an icky germ that can make people feel very sick or even cause them to die. It was like a really, really bad flu. And like the flu, it could spread from one person to another. In the olden days, people didn't have the same medicine and doctors as we do now to help them feel better. Now let's talk about London. London is a big city in a country called England, far away across the ocean. A long, long time ago, London had a few big times when the plague made a lot of people sick. These times were called \\"epidemics.\\" Let's count those epidemics! 1. The first time was called the \\"Black Death.\\" The Black Death happened a very long time ago, way back in the years 1348-1350. Many people in London, and in other parts of the world, got sick and could not get better. 2. The second big time happened in 1603. During this time, the plague didn't make as many people sick as during the Black Death, but it still made a lot of people in London very sick. 3. Another big time happened in 1625. That's only 22 years after the second time. This one was called the \\"Great Plague of 1625.\\" 4. The very last big time was in 1665. This one was called the \\"Great Plague of London.\\" Many, many people got sick during this time. But, after the year 1666, the big plague epidemics stopped happening in London. So between the Black Death in 1348 and the Great Plague of London in 1665, plague epidemics in London happened for about 400 years. That's a long, long time! But don't worry, my little friend. Today, we have medicine and doctors to help keep people healthy, and the plague doesn't make people sick like it used to. So, it's a good thing that we live now and not during the time when the plague was making so many people in London sick!"},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

If the guests fail to change his/her ways by dessert, the group offers the guest poisoned white wine from a blue decanter and raises a toast. The bodies are buried in the group's vegetable garden. Guests include a homophobic protestant reverend; a misogynistic, chauvinistic rape apologist; a Neo-Nazi; an anti-environmentalist; a racist, anti-Semitic Nation of Islam fundamentalist; a Pro-life extremist; a censorship advocate; a hobo assailant (the only dinner guest who momentarily considers recanting his beliefs); and opponents of gay rights, all of whom are murdered. After ten murders, misgivings begin to surface within the group as a couple of them grow indecisive regarding the justification of their actions. Infighting and guilt compel Jude, Pete, Marc, and Paulie, in an almost unanimous decision with only the dissent of Luke, to spare a teenage opponent of mandatory sex...

Hospital workers wash their hands as little as 30 percent of the time they interact with patients, studies show. Efforts in New York hospitals and elsewhere seek to save 30 billion lost per year to hospital-acquired infections by installing surveillance equipment at hand washing sinks. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Surveillance Systems at Handwashing Sinks: A New Approach to Preventing Hospital-Acquired Infections and Saving Billions Introduction: Hospital-acquired infections are a major concern for public health officials as they contribute to extended hospital stays, increased risk of complication, increased mortality rates, and a massive financial burden. In fact, in the United States alone, studies reveal that an astounding 30 billion is lost yearly to hospital-acquired infections. One common factor contributing to these infections is the inadequate hand hygiene of hospital workers. Recent studies show that they wash their hands only 30% of the time when they interact with patients, despite being a standard protocol in medical facilities. Installing Surveillance Equipment at Handwashing Sinks: In response to this alarming trend, several hospitals in New York have emerged at the forefront of implementing new strategies to reduce hospital-acquired infections. One such strategy involves the installation of surveillance equipment at handwashing sinks that monitor the hand hygiene of healthcare workers. Step 1: Identifying Key Locations for Surveillance Equipment: To effectively implement this strategy, it is crucial to identify and install surveillance systems in places where handwashing is most essential, such as entrance and exits of patient rooms, intensive care units, operating rooms, and laboratories. Step 2: Integrating Technology for Real-Time Monitoring: The surveillance systems are integrated with advanced technological sensors that can monitor the hand hygiene of healthcare workers in real-time. This real-time monitoring allows hospitals to identify potential lapses in hygiene protocol and address them promptly, reducing the risk of hospital-acquired infections. Step 3: Monitoring Compliance and Providing Feedback The data collected by the surveillance equipment can be used to analyze the overall compliance with hand hygiene protocols and generate customized reports for each healthcare worker. This feedback can be used to encourage diligent handwashing and reinforce the need for proper hand hygiene as a crucial part of patient safety. Step 4: Educating Healthcare Workers on Hand Hygiene Importance: In addition to surveillance and feedback, it is crucial to provide ongoing education, training, and reinforcement of the importance of hand hygiene for healthcare workers. This can be achieved through mandatory training seminars, educational materials, and regular reminders throughout the hospital facility. Conclusion: With hospital-acquired infections posing a significant threat to public health, it is imperative that healthcare facilities adapt to new strategies to help reduce the spread of infections. The installation of surveillance equipment at handwashing sinks serves as a promising approach to address inadequate hand hygiene and take proactive measures in halting the spread of infections. By increasing the handwashing compliance among hospital workers, this innovative strategy has the potential to reduce the 30 billion lost annually to hospital-acquired infections and improve overall patient care and safety."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The latest fashion in the kitchen is the food steamer.All the stores are selling them;everyone wants one.Steaming is one of the simplest and healthiest ways of cooking food.However,that cooking time is usually longer than with other methods.In case you're thinking of buying a steamer,I've done a survey about the steamers available on the market to help you decide which will suit you best. Folding Steamer The simplest and least expensive is the folding stainless-steel version. Advantages:This is a good,basic design which sits inside a variety of different shapes of pans with the water under it;a ring in the centre allows for easy lifting and it's easy to clean. Disadvantages:It only holds small dishes.Also,if you put too much water in the pan,it will boil up through the vegetables and they will be watery.If you put too little water in and let it get dry,you will burn the pan and get strange-smelling vegetables. Steaming Pan This is a three-layered black Teflon-coated version with a lid and two double-handled steamers,which sits on the oven ring.The brand I bought is calledNutritious Living. Advantages:This is an excellent steamer, lightweight,easy to clean,and of all the steamers I've tried,this cooks the fastest.Fish and chicken can be cooked on the bottom with rice or vegetables on the top.It's easier to store. Disadvantages:Water can boil away until the pan is dry,but if you make sure you fill the pan up to the suggested level and do not overcook the food,this should not happen.You cannot see the food cooking from the top.It doesn't supply a dish for cooking rice. For serious users of steamers,I recommend having one of each version.If you just want to try it,get the folding stainless-steel type.

Options: - wilderness - encyclopedia - magazine - commercial - countryside The answer is \\"encyclopedia\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer is \\"encyclopedia\\" because encyclopedias are comprehensive collections of information and knowledge on a wide variety of subjects, systematically arranged for easy access and retrieval. They are designed to provide the reader with a broad understanding of a specific topic, concept, or field of study. Encyclopedias can be general, covering a vast array of subjects, or specialized, focusing on a particular discipline or area of interest. In the case of looking up information about a sloth, an encyclopedia would be the most appropriate source among the given options. Here's why: 1. Wilderness and countryside: These terms refer to natural, rural, or undeveloped areas that are characterized by their unspoiled landscapes and ecosystems. While sloths may inhabit these environments, these terms on their own do not comprise a collection of writings where one could find information on the topic. 2. Magazine: Magazines are periodicals that usually focus on particular areas of interest or subjects, and they contain articles, essays, news items, and other content related to their chosen topic. Although it is possible to find articles or features on sloths in certain magazines (e.g., wildlife, nature, or zoology publications), magazines are not a consistently reliable source for comprehensive or detailed information about a specific animal. 3. Commercial: This term generally refers to something related to business, commerce, sales, or marketing. In the context of written works, it could potentially refer to promotional materials, product catalogs, or advertisements. Although it is conceivable that a sloth-related product or service could appear in a commercial context, this would not be an ideal source to consult for information about sloths. An encyclopedia, on the other hand, offers readers a reliable and organized source of in-depth knowledge on a vast range of topics, including animals like sloths. Within an encyclopedia, one would likely find an article or entry dedicated to sloths that covers their habitat, behavior, diet, physiology, taxonomy, and more. Furthermore, encyclopedias usually undergo rigorous editorial processes and expert review, which helps ensure the accuracy of their content. As such, encyclopedias are a superior choice for accessing dependable and comprehensive information about sloths."},{"prompt":"Question: Article: Dear Peter, My name is Frank. I am from America.

Woo island was frequently shaken by earthquakes, but Mud island had no such problems. But I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

Write an article using the following points: Vance McAllister's loss went against tide of Republican mid-term victories. Known as 'kissing congressman' after amorous embrace caught on video. Partner in the affair was wife of a friend of McAllister's since high school. McAllister, married at the time, admitted 'personal mistakes' and ran again. Failed to win enough votes to join other candidates in run-off ballot. Article:","completion":"Title: Vance McAllister's Loss in Mid-Term Elections: A Notable Exception to Republican Victories Introduction: (Background and context for the article) The mid-term elections of [year] witnessed a sweeping wave of Republican victories, securing numerous seats in boards, councils, and even Congress. However, standing in stark contrast to these wins was the loss of Vance McAllister, a candidate who had earned the controversial moniker of \\"kissing congressman.\\" This article delves into the factors that contributed to McAllister's downfall and examines how personal indiscretions may have impacted his campaign. Body: 1. The Scandal: (Brief description of the scandal) Vance McAllister, at the time a married man, was captured on video engaging in an amorous embrace with a woman who was not his wife. To make matters worse, the woman turned out to be the wife of one of McAllister's high school friends. This incident garnered widespread media attention and earned him the nickname \\"kissing congressman.\\" 2. Aftermath and Response: (McAllister's reaction to the scandal) Following the exposure of the scandal, McAllister admitted to making \\"personal mistakes\\" and took responsibility for his actions. Despite the negative press, he decided to run for re-election in the mid-term polls, possibly believing that his constituents would overlook his transgressions. 3. Impact on the Campaign: (How the scandal may have affected McAllister's chances) While other Republican candidates successfully wooed voters with their political agenda and promises, McAllister's campaign was marred by his past indiscretion. Voters now examined him more critically and struggled to reconcile the image of a devoted representative with that of a man who had betrayed his wife and friend. 4. Election Results: (McAllister's performance in the elections) In a sea of Republican victories, Vance McAllister failed to garner sufficient votes to join the other candidates in the run-off ballot. Many believe that his personal scandal played a significant role in undermining his campaign, casting doubt on his ability to uphold public trust and maintain an untarnished image. Conclusion: (Significance of McAllister's loss) Vance McAllister's defeat in the Republican-heavy mid-term elections highlights the impact of personal misconduct on political careers. His loss serves as a cautionary tale, reminding aspiring politicians that they must remain accountable for their actions and maintain a strong moral compass. As the so-called 'kissing congressman' fades from the public eye, his experience raises important questions about the expectations of character and conduct that we hold for our political representatives."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers.

This is because the availability of more landfill space can encourage waste disposal instead of recycling. Landfills serve as an easier and cheaper option for waste management compared to recycling. However, landfills have adverse effects on the environment, such as emitting greenhouse gases, contaminating groundwater, and occupying valuable land resources. When there are limited landfill sites or high landfill taxes, industries and governments are motivated to invest more in recycling programs and encourage the public to recycle. This approach helps to conserve resources and reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal. In summary, creating more landfill sites could lead to a decrease in recycling efforts, as the focus shifts towards disposal rather than repurposing and reusing materials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which Israeli Prime Minister was assassinated in Tel Aviv in 1995?","completion":"The Israeli Prime Minister who was assassinated in Tel Aviv in 1995 was Yitzhak Rabin. Born on March 1, 1922, in Jerusalem, Rabin had a long and storied career in both the Israeli military and government before his tragic assassination. Rabin initially started his career in the military when he joined the Palmach, an elite fighting force of the Haganah, the underground Jewish military organization during the British Mandate in Palestine. He quickly rose through the military ranks, and by 1947, he was serving as the Chief of Operations for the Palmach. In 1964, he was appointed the Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and oversaw Israel's military victory during the Six-Day War in 1967. Following his military career, Rabin entered the world of politics. He was appointed as the Israeli ambassador to the United States in 1968, where he built strong ties with the American administration and strengthened the US-Israel alliance. In 1974, he was elected as the Prime Minister of Israel, a position he held until 1977. During his first term, Rabin focused on strengthening Israel's economy and increasing social spending. In 1992, Rabin was elected again as the Prime Minister of Israel, serving for the second time. His second term was marked by his commitment to finding a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This led to the signing of the Oslo Accords on September 13, 1993, a historic agreement that established mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and opened peace negotiations between the two parties. On November 4, 1995, Yitzhak Rabin was attending a peace rally in the Kings of Israel Square (now known as Rabin Square) in Tel Aviv when he was tragically assassinated by a Jewish extremist named Yigal Amir. Amir, a right-wing Israeli opposed to the Oslo Accords and the idea of Israel relinquishing territory for peace, shot Rabin three times as he made his way to his car after the rally, ending the life of a prominent Israeli leader. Rabin's assassination sent shock waves throughout Israel and the world, and left a lasting impact on the peace process. In recognition of his commitment to peace and the Oslo Accords, Yitzhak Rabin was posthumously awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994, along with Shimon Peres, then Israel's Foreign Minister, and Yasser Arafat, the Chairman of the PLO. Rabin's legacy as a military hero and a peacemaker continues to be remembered and celebrated in Israel and around the world."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

As a result of these activities, alterations in the environment occur, causing changes in the geographical attributes of the area surrounding the river. To address the query \\"If a beaver does what it does in order to build its home, then near the river will form...\\", we examine the options given. A). a large H2O source - This is the most correct answer. When beavers construct dams, they cause the water flow from the river to slowly accumulate, leading to the formation of a pond or lake around the dam. This expanded water body serves as both a home for the beaver and an augmented water source in the local ecosystem. They choose areas with a slow-moving current to build their dams, as this makes it easier for them to swim and gather materials. The held back water forms a wide and deep body, which the beaver uses for protection from predators, easy access to food during winter, and a method of transportation. This newly formed water source can be referred to as a 'large H2O source.' B). a den for tigers - This option is incorrect. While tigers are known to swim and may utilize bodies of water in their environment, the formation of a water body due to the construction of a beaver dam would not inherently lead to the creation of a tiger den. The presence of tigers is dependent on several factors including availability of prey, vegetation cover, and favourable climatic conditions. C). a small military camp - This option is also incorrect. The formation of a dam by a beaver resulting in the creation of a lake or pond has no direct connection with the establishment of a military camp. The location and establishment of a military camp are strategic decisions made by human beings taking into account factors such as terrain, logistics, and strategic advantage. D). a giant black hole - This option is absolutely incorrect. The activities of a beaver, no matter how transformative to the local environment, cannot give rise to a physical phenomenon such as a black hole. Black holes are cosmic bodies with gravity so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape from them once inside a certain region known as the event horizon. They are formed from the remnants of massive stars after their supernova explosions. In conclusion, from the options provided, if a beaver builds a dam for its home, near the river, it would most likely form 'a large H2O source’ (Option A) as the beaver's activities lead to water accumulation and thus an increase in the water source available in that local environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Portsmouth Harbour Dredging Unearths Treasure Trove of Over 20,000 Historical Artifacts Introduction Portsmouth Harbour, located on the south coast of England, has long been a busy hub of maritime activity for both civilian and military vessels. Recently, the harbor underwent a major dredging operation to deepen and widen the navigation channel to accommodate larger ships including the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers. In the process, a fascinating array of over 20,000 historical artifacts has been unearthed, which ranges from a human skull to shoes and sea mines. This vast treasure trove offers an exciting insight into the harbor's past and offers researchers and historians valuable information about the region's maritime history. The Dredging Process and Discoveries The dredging work began in September 2016 as part of the preparation for the arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers. Over a period of 24 months, a total of £31 million was spent on the project, and it involved the removal of around 3.2 million cubic meters of sediment from the harbor floor. A team of archaeologists from the UK Ministry of Defence, environmental consultants, and divers were tasked with monitoring the dredging operation, as there was always a strong possibility to discover significant historical artifacts during such projects. And indeed, the findings exceeded all expectations, uncovering a remarkable collection of more than 20,000 items, some dating back to the Bronze Age, that paint a detailed picture of Portsmouth's extensive naval and maritime history. A Glimpse into the Past Many of the items found during the dredging work are highly valuable in understanding the development of naval warfare, shipbuilding techniques, and lifestyle in different historical periods. Some of the most interesting discoveries include anchors, cannonballs, musket balls, and remarkably well-preserved iron, copper, and bronze age tools. Also found were over 50 German sea mines from World War II that were safely removed by Royal Navy bomb disposal experts. Other intriguing discoveries include a human skull, several personal items such as leather shoes, clay pipes for tobacco, and various pieces of pottery. These artifacts provide valuable insights into the daily lives of people who lived and worked in the Portsmouth Harbor area throughout history. Conservation and Display of the Findings The discovered artifacts have been cataloged and are currently undergoing restoration and conservation efforts in collaboration with the Mary Rose Trust, Southampton University, and other leading archaeological institutions. Once the conservation process is complete, these unique pieces of history are expected to go on public display, with the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard and other local museums being the most likely venues. Some of these artifacts may also become part of traveling exhibitions showcasing British naval history, attracting history enthusiasts and the general public alike, while also contributing to the understanding and preservation of the nation's maritime heritage. Conclusion The Portsmouth Harbour dredging project has brought to light a treasure trove of priceless historical artifacts, each one telling its own story of the harbor's past. The excavated items offer an unprecedented peek into the lives of people who lived or visited the harbor over the centuries and contribute significantly to the understanding of the region's maritime history. The preservation and display of these artifacts will ensure that these stories and the lessons they hold will continue to educate and inspire future generations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: On November18, 1995, Itzhak Perlman, the world famous violinist, came on stage to give a concert at Lincoln Centre in New York City. If you have ever been to a Perlman concert, you know that getting on stage is not easy for him. He got polio as a child, and has to walk with the aid of two crutches now. That night Perlman walked slowly to his chair. Then he sat down and began to play. But, suddenly, one of the strings on his violin broke. You could hear it break---it broke with a loud noise. People thought to themselves, \\"He would have to get up to either find another violin or find another string for this one.\\" But he didn't. Instead, he waited a moment, closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again. The orchestra began, and he played from where he had stopped. He played with such passion and such power. Of course, everyone knows that it is impossible to play a symphonic work with just three strings. But that night Itzhak Perlman refused to know that. You could see him changing and recomposing the piece in his head. When he finished, there was a silence in the room. Then people rose and cheered. We were all on our feet, doing everything we could to show how much we appreciated what he had done. He smiled and then he said in a quiet tone, \\"You know, sometimes it is the artist's task to find out how much music you can make with what you have left.\\" His words have stayed in my mind ever since I heard them. That is also the way of life. Perhaps our task in this quickly changing world in which we live is to make music, at first with all that we have, and then, when that is no longer possible, to make music with what we have left.

A:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"to express their appreciation of Perlman's creative mind.\\" The audience recognized the incredible feat of improvisation and skill that Perlman displayed by continuing to play with only three strings, and they cheered to show their admiration and appreciation for his unique performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Atlanta (CNN) -- A Georgia man was alone before his fatal fall from an upper level of Atlanta's Turner Field, police said Tuesday, as they continue to investigate his death. Ronald L. Homer, 30, was attending Monday night's Braves game against the Phillies. The Braves said they planned to observe a moment of silence for Homer before Tuesday's game. Four witnesses told officers that they saw Homer fall from the fourth level of the stadium during a rain delay in the game, the Atlanta Police Department said. \\"All the witnesses stated that there was (sic) no other people around Mr. Homer when he fell,\\" police said, adding there were no surveillance cameras at the scene. Police said the fall appeared to be accidental but that it was too early to tell if alcohol was a factor. Homer, of nearby Conyers, fell 65 feet into the players' parking lot. He was unconscious when emergency responders found him, but he died later at the hospital, police said. An autopsy on Homer is complete, but authorities are not releasing details, citing pending toxicology results, Tami Sedivy-Schroder, an investigator with the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office, said Tuesday. Results can take up to eight weeks, she said. Homer's mother, Connie Homer, told CNN affiliate WXIA that he was a big Braves fan who was attending the game with a friend. \\"I'm just sick,\\" she said. \\"We're a very close family. He was big-hearted.\\" The game was scheduled to start at 7:10 p.m. but heavy rains pushed back the start time nearly two hours. 1. How old was the man who died? 2. What was his first name? 3.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Besides desert parsley and California goldfields, what are the most common wildflowers that grow on the Table Rocks?, using the article: Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, the Table Rocks host a diverse range of flora throughout its four ecological regions: oak savanna, chaparral, mixed woodland, and mounded prairie. The area contains over 340 species of plants, including about 200 species of wildflowers. While your friend specifically asked for wildflowers excluding desert parsley and California goldfields, the article mentions several other common wildflowers that grow abundantly in the Table Rocks area: 1. Western buttercups (Ranunculus occidentalis): These wildflowers feature bright yellow petals and are native to western North America. They grow well in moist habitats, such as the mounded prairie region, where vernal pools are present. 2. Bicolor lupine (Lupinus bicolor): This wildflower is characterized by its blue and white flowers, growing in clusters along a central stem. Bicolor lupine is well-adapted to various habitats and thrives in areas with moist to moderately dry soils, making it suitable for different regions of the Table Rocks. 3. Camas (Camassia spp.): Camas wildflowers can also be found on the Table Rocks, producing an edible bulb. They are characterized by their star-shaped, blue-purple flowers, which grow in racemes. Camas prefer moist meadows and prairies, such as those found in the mounded prairie region. It is essential to note that Death camas (Toxicoscordion spp.) also grows on the Table Rocks and is poisonous. Native Takelma people used death camas as an anesthetic. It somewhat resembles camas; therefore, the two should not be confused. In summary, besides desert parsley and California goldfields, other common wildflowers observed on the Table Rocks include western buttercups, bicolor lupine, and camas. These wildflowers, along with many others, contribute to the biodiversity and beauty of the Table Rocks landscape across its four distinct ecological regions."},{"prompt":"Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Obama: 'Our hearts are broken' for families of Connecticut shooting victims An emotional President Obama, wiping away tears and choking up as he spoke, said Friday that \\"our hearts are broken\\" for the families of the victims in the deadly mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school. The president, hinting at possible legislation, pledged \\"meaningful action\\" to prevent more killings in the future. The president addressed the tragedy during remarks at the White House Friday afternoon, as details continued to emerge. Authorities say at least 26 people, most of them children, were killed when a gunman clad in black military gear opened fire inside a Connecticut elementary school. The president, who in the past has maintained his composure at such moments no matter the depth of the tragedy at hand, on Friday paused repeatedly, struggling to get through his remarks. The president stopped for several seconds, his eyes welling up, as he discussed the victims. \\"The majority of those who died today were children -- beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old,\\" Obama said. \\"They had their entire lives ahead of them -- birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own.\\" Shortly before speaking, Obama ordered that U.S. flags be flown at half-staff on public grounds through Tuesday. House Speaker John Boehner ordered flags be lowered at the U.S. Capitol. The president said he reacted to the tragedy as a parent. \\"We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years, and each time I learn the news, I react not as a president, but as anybody else would, as a parent. And that was especially true today,\\" Obama said. \\"I know there's not a parent in America who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that I do.\\" The shooting quickly stirred questions about whether lawmakers in Washington might pick up the push for stricter gun control. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney brushed off such questions at the briefing, but Obama called for \\"action\\" toward the close of his remarks Friday, citing the frequency with which such mass shootings have occurred. \\"These neighbors are our neighbors, and these children are our children, and we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this -- regardless of the politics,\\" Obama said. Several Democratic lawmakers were also calling Friday for stricter gun control. \\"Our expressions of sympathy must be matched with concrete actions to stop gun violence,\\" Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., said. Obama was first briefed on the shooting Friday morning by counterterrorism adviser John Brennan and is continuing to receive regular updates. Obama also spoke with Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy to express his condolences, and offer support. The White House said the FBI is supporting state and local law enforcement officials in Connecticut as they respond to and investigate the incident. The Associated Press contributed to this report. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"A very sad thing happened in Connecticut where a person with a gun went into a school and hurt many people, mostly young children.

Summarize this article: After the first leg of their play-off finished goalless, Fraser Mullen, for Beath, and Kieran Gibbons, for Kilby, netted in normal time. With no further score after 30 more minutes of play, the hosts scored all five of their spot-kicks. Liam Henderson struck the decisive penalty, keeping Gary Locke's side in Scottish League Two. The home side came flying out of the traps and duly took the lead after just three minutes. There was excellent build-up play down the left involving Robbie Buchannan and Dale Carrick, before Henderson laid the ball off for Mullen. The former Hearts and Hibernian defender drilled a low shot beyond Matthew McGinley in the visiting goal to break the deadlock. The Blue Brazil keep their foot on the gas, and only a magnificent stop by McGinley denied Carrick from doubling the lead. The striker also crashed a header off the crossbar before Kris Renton's deflected volley flew inches wide. East Kilbride slowly eased their way into the game and Joao Victoria, then Sean Winter, came close to a leveller. The Lowland League champions began the second half on the front foot and had claims for a penalty turned down by referee Craig Charleston after the ball appeared to strike the arm of David Syme. The Lanarkshire side's pressure did pay off, though, when the home defence failed to clear their lines, allowing Gibbons to drill the ball along the slippery surface from 25 yards out and find the bottom corner. Neither side were able to strike a knockout blow before normal time expired, and the game East Kilbride's Adam Strachan fired in a deflected 20-yard effort that struck the crossbar on its way over. Both teams looked weary as the rain-soaked pitch began to take its toll. but Cowdenbeath almost snatched a late winner through Craig Johnston, whose effort was tipped over by McGinley. With Mullen, Johnston, Renton and Syme netting spot-kicks for Cowdenbeath, and Strachan, Russell McLean and Victoria replying, it was Jamie Sneddon's save from Paul Woods that proved crucial. The stop gave Henderson the opportunity to seal victory for the Blue Brazil, and the defender duly converted his penalty, preserving Cowden's SPFL status, and consigning East Kilbride to another season of junior football. Cowdenbeath manager Gary Locke: \\"I don't think it's really anything to celebrate. The chairman is a flamboyant character, and when I came to the club, he said, we're in the play-offs, just win them for us. \\"Credit to the players, they've battled really hard over the two games. East Kilbride were fantastic, I certainly feel if they came up they'd be top-four or top-five team in this league. \\"So it was a really difficult two games, it gets to be a bit of a lottery when it goes to penalties, but I'm delighted the club's kept their place in the league, because the consequences of going down would've been pretty tough, I'd have thought.\\" East Kilbride manager Martin Lauchlan: \\"It's devastating - we put so much into the game. We lost a goal early - the worst possible start we could've had - but after that we looked the better team and the more likely to score. \\"I think our fitness levels looked terrific. It's so difficult to get to this point, with so many play-off games, and to get here and lose it is tough. \\"I think they showed in the game they're well capable of playing at this level, but we're bitterly disappointed.\\" Match ends, Cowdenbeath 1(5), East Kilbride 1(3).

David Strohm Jr., 27, climbed a tree in his parents' backyard Saturday in Tustin, Calif., snapped the sunset pics, and posted one on Facebook shortly after 6pm. Friends and family, concerned as to his whereabouts, searched for him all night, even going door-to-door, the LA Times reports.

David Strohm Jr., a 27-year-old man from Tustin, California, lost his life after climbing a tree in his parents' backyard on Saturday evening. What started as an innocent last climb ended in an electrical accident that cut his life short. According to the Los Angeles Times, Strohm proceeded to climb the tree to snap the perfect shots of the sunset, which he then posted to Facebook at around 6 pm. As the evening progressed and he did not return, concerned friends and relatives began searching for Strohm. They spent the entire night looking for him, even taking the extreme measures of going door-to-door in the neighborhood. It wasn't until the next morning that they received an ominous clue to the whereabouts of Strohm. Underneath the tree he had climbed, his cellphone was discovered on the ground, as reported by the Orange County Register. Upon further investigation, they tragically found Strohm still in the tree, lifeless and leaning against a power line. The exact details of how Strohm came into contact with the power line are still unknown. When firefighters arrived on the scene, they were forced to shut down power to approximately 20 homes in the area in order to safely retrieve and bring down Strohm's body. The situation highlights the grave danger electricity poses and serves as a reminder for everyone to exercise caution around such hazards. David Strohm Jr. was described by neighbors and family as a \\"nice kid\\" who enjoyed helping his family and neighbors. The Strohm family lived together in the Tustin home, with David residing there along with his mother and stepfather. His father was also present, witnessing the heart-wrenching scene as his son's body was taken down from the tree. As questions continue to emerge and the community grieves for the loss of Strohm, authorities remind everyone of the critical importance of safety around electrical power lines. An Orange County firefighter involved in the incident emphasized this by stating, \\"Our message is: stay away. Electricity is so dangerous.\\" The tragic passing of David Strohm Jr. serves as a somber reminder of the risks associated with electrical hazards, even for something as innocent as capturing the beauty of nature. Lessons learned from this unfortunate event must encourage a greater awareness of electrical safety. It is essential for individuals to educate themselves about the potential dangers in their environment and understand the need for extreme caution around power lines and other electrical equipment. In memory of David Strohm Jr., it is important to honor his love for nature and photography and ensure that his tragic death serves as a wake-up call to others. Prioritizing safety and raising awareness of the potential dangers associated with everyday activities like climbing trees must prevent further loss of life in such devastating circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"No, the suggested answer does not accurately address the question about the major economic activities of the early Canadians. Instead, it focuses on prominent English Canadian historians. A more appropriate answer to the question would be: The major economic activities of the early Canadians were primarily based on natural resources and agriculture. Early Canadians engaged in the fur trade, which was a significant economic driver during the 17th and 18th centuries. This trade heavily relied on the Indigenous peoples' skill and knowledge in hunting and trapping. Additionally, the fishing industry, particularly cod fishing, was vital to the economy of coastal areas, such as those in present-day Newfoundland and Labrador. Agriculture was another significant economic activity for early Canadians. Settlers cultivated various crops and engaged in livestock farming, particularly in regions with fertile soil, like the St. Lawrence River valley. The abundance of forests allowed for a thriving lumber industry, which supplied materials for shipbuilding and export to European markets. As the population grew and urban centers developed, manufacturing industries began to emerge, mainly to meet the demand for domestic goods, such as textiles and metal products. Over time, transportation, communication, and infrastructure improvements facilitated the expansion of trade and contributed to further economic growth in Canada. In conclusion, the major economic activities of the early Canadians included fur trade, fishing, agriculture, lumber industry, and gradually expanding manufacturing sectors."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Since we have 200 grams of solution p, we can calculate the weight of liquid x in solution p as follows: Weight of liquid x in solution p = (0.5 / 100) * 200 Weight of liquid x in solution p = 1 gram Step 2: Calculate the weight of liquid x in solution q. Liquid x makes up 1.5% of solution q. Since we have 800 grams of solution q, we can calculate the weight of liquid x in solution q as follows: Weight of liquid x in solution q = (1.5 / 100) * 800 Weight of liquid x in solution q = 12 grams Step 3: Calculate the total weight of liquid x in the resulting solution. Total weight of liquid x in the resulting solution = Weight of liquid x in solution p + Weight of liquid x in solution q Total weight of liquid x in the resulting solution = 1 gram + 12 grams Total weight of liquid x in the resulting solution = 13 grams Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the resulting solution.

Passage: The Sarmatians were an Iranian people during classical antiquity, flourishing from about the 5th century BC to the 4th century AD. They spoke Scythian, an Indo-European language from the Eastern Iranian family. Originating in Central Asia, the Sarmatians started their westward migration around the 6th century bc, coming to dominate the closely related Scythians by the 2nd century bc. The Sarmatians differed from the Scythians in their veneration of the god of fire rather than god of nature, and their women's prominent role in warfare, which possibly served as the inspiration for the Amazons. At their greatest reported extent, around 1st century AD, these tribes ranged from the Vistula River to the mouth of the Danube and eastward to the Volga, bordering the shores of the Black and Caspian seas as well as the Caucasus to the south. Their territory, which was known as Sarmatia to Greco-Roman ethnographers, corresponded to the western part of greater Scythia . According to authors Arrowsmith, Fellowes and Graves Hansard in their book A Grammar of Ancient Geography published in 1832, Sarmatia had two parts, Sarmatia Europea and Sarmatia Asiatica covering a combined area of 503,000 sq mi or 1,302,764 km2.

Article: Hostels may not have things that hotels nearly always provide, such as towels, washcloths, WiFi, or toiletries. Make sure you pack anything you’ll need that you can’t rely on your hostel to provide. You’ll be sharing a room with multiple people who might snore loudly or come back to the room very late at night. If this type of late-night activity is likely to wake you up, you’ll need to have earplugs and a sleeping mask to be able to get a restful night’s sleep in a hostel. Some hostels have more than 20 beds in the same room, so the odds of you sharing a room with someone who snores may be extremely high. In dormitory style hostels, the best accommodations offer personal lockers for stowing your valuables. Bring a combination lock that you can use to secure this locker when you go to put your belongings in it. A combination lock will be more reliable than a lock that requires a key, since you won’t be out of luck if you lose the key! Hostels are typically located in the center of a city, which unfortunately means that some locations are in relatively sketchy or dangerous areas. When you check in, just ask the people at the front desk if they have any particular recommendations or suggestions on places to avoid or steps to take to stay safe.

Accuses academies of profiteering from junk food vending machines. Education Secretary Michael Gove says he trusts headteachers to make the right choices. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: The Critical Issue of Nutrition in Schools: The Controversy Surrounding Healthy Eating Guidelines and Junk Food Profiteering Famed chef Jamie Oliver has once again put the spotlight on the critical issue of food and nutrition in schools, raising important questions about the efficacy of current healthy eating guidelines. He argues that allowing schools to opt-out of these regulations is leading to a significant decrease in the nutritional levels among youngsters. Using his strong culinary platform, Oliver has constantly bubbled over with passion for revolutionizing school meals. Known for his concerted efforts against the proliferation of unhealthy food in school environments, the latest crusade pits him against the academies that are gaining significantly from vending machines stocked with junk food. The chief concern raised by Oliver is that these establishments are profiteering – that is, making an undue profit from an unmerited source – from these vending machines. Filled with high-sugar, high-salt, and fat-laden snacks, these machines are a tempting option for students and a financial boon for academies. However, they pose a grave threat to the health of our children, contributing to rising rates of obesity, childhood diabetes and other diet-related health issues. While healthy eating guidelines are in place to ensure that children receive balanced meals at schools, there’s currently a legal loophole exposing many academies and free schools to override these edicts. Oliver suggests that this option to opt-out contributes directly to the degradation of the nutritional intake of youngsters. In contradiction to Oliver’s arguments, Education Secretary Michael Gove has expressed his faith in headteachers' discretion. He believes that school leaders are best equipped to make the right decisions for their students’ nutritional welfare. Gove's standpoint implies trust in the autonomous judgement of each headteacher to balance the financial benefits of vending machines with the health implications. The controversy hence lies between strict adherence to the nutrition guidelines or providing academies with the autonomy to choose what best fits their circumstances. Developing an approach that provides the necessary balance is a challenging task. Stricter regulation could indeed secure a higher nutritional standard in schools while possibly straining their finances or undermining their autonomy. Meanwhile, giving schools the discretion to decide could result in lowered nutritional standards, risking the health and wellbeing of children under the guise of profiteering. This conflict urges a critical revaluation of the existing guidelines. Striking a balance between the nutritional health of students, the financial independence of schools, and the autonomy of school leaders in shaping their institution is much needed. It is clear that beyond just guidelines, there is a need for a comprehensive strategy, ensuring that schools provide nutritious meals without compromising on their financial health. Jamie Oliver's advocacy for nutritional reform in schools provides an essential push for this issue to be addressed more seriously. It underscores the immediate need for collaboration among educators, policymakers, dieticians, and chefs like Oliver himself, to ensure that the nutrition and health of our future generations are not compromised. Education Secretary Michael Gove’s trust in headteacher’s autonomy also raises the important question of how we can empower our educators to make smart decisions regarding nutrition. In conclusion, the controversy surrounding healthy eating guidelines and junk food profiteering among academies is a noteworthy concern that deserves critical attention. A fair solution needs to be sought – one that incorporates the importance of nutritional health in schools, respects the autonomy of academies, but without allowing a platform for profiteering at the expense of our children’s health."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

And they have yet to analyse satellite images of the region in which the most famous Himalayan peak - Everest - is located. However, there continues to be debate over exactly how tall Everest is. \\"The primary stretch that had its height dropped is a 80-100km stretch of the Langtang Himal (to the northwest of the capital, Kathmandu),\\" said Richard Briggs, a research geologist with the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Langtang range is the region where many locals and trekkers are still missing, presumed dead, after the avalanches and landslides that were triggered by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 25 April. Scientists believe the height of a handful of other Himalayan peaks, including the Ganesh Himal to the west of the Langtang range, may also have dropped. The satellite images they have analysed so far have focused on central Nepal, which was the hardest hit by the quake. Everest is to the east of this main shaking zone. Scientists say whether or not the world's highest peak saw a change in its height by few centimetres will have to be further confirmed by ground survey and GPS or an airborne mission. \\"But what we see in the data that we evaluated further away from the plate boundary, to the north of the capital Kathmandu, is a clearly identifiable region with subsidence of up to 1.5m,\\" says Christian Minet, a geologist with the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), which processed the Nepal earthquake data sent by the Sentinel-1a satellite. Scientists with DLR's Earth Observation Centre of compared two separate images of the same region sent by the satellite, before and after the quake. \\"The positive value we have received (from the satellite image) after the quake means the area (the mountains in and around the Langtang region) is further away from the satellite and it is lower now,\\" said Mr Minet. \\"But with this result we cannot say that a specific mountain is one-point-something-metres lower; it is the general area that we can assess.\\" He said the satellite images showed the area of the mountain range had dropped by 0.7m-1.5m. The study has also found that areas including the capital, Kathmandu, to the south of the Himalayan mountains have been uplifted by the quake. \\"The negative value we have received from the acquisitions of the before and after earthquake images means that some areas (Kathmandu and its surroundings) are now closer to the satellite, and that means they have seen an uplift,\\" says Mr Minet. Scientists say the drop and the uplift are normal geological behaviour during an earthquake of this scale. \\"The fault underneath Kathmandu has slipped and it's moved the overriding part of the crust to the south towards the southern end of the part that squashes the crust; and to the northern end it stretches it,\\" says Tim Wright, professor of satellite geodesy at the University of Leeds. \\"From where it is squashed, which is more or less underneath Kathmandu, we get uplift. And where it stretches, which is in the high mountains to the north of Kathmandu in this case, we get subsidence. \\"The biggest amount of slip on the fault was actually just north of Kathmandu, so it's the mountains north of Kathmandu that have subsided the most in this particular case.\\" Normally, the Himalayas are on the rise because of the collision between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. But during major earthquakes the process gets reversed, experts say. \\"Between earthquake events, Nepal is being squashed and the part (including Kathmandu) nearest the big fault underneath it is being dragged down by the Indian plate, and [areas] further back are being lifted up as you imagine squashing something is going to push things up,\\" says Prof Wright. \\"Now, during the earthquake itself what happens is the opposite. The part that was dragged down because it was stuck at the fault - that slips freely and rebounds up, and the part that was being squashed upwards drops down.\\" Authorities in Nepal say they are yet to assess the impacts of the earthquake on the Himalayas as they are still occupied with rescue and rehabilitation after the devastating earthquake.

Q:Information: - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program. These screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression, and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a teleplay. - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show). - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Mathias Woo Yan Wai ( Chinese : ; born 1968 ) is a cultural worker in the cross-media discipline in Hong Kong , with creative works ranging from theatre and multi-media design , to cultural policy research and analysis , art education , architectural design and screenplay writing .

The PRD is a megalopolis, with future development into a single mega metropolitan area, yet itself is at the southern end of a larger megalopolis running along the southern coast of China, which include metropolises such as Chaoshan, Zhangzhou-Xiamen, Quanzhou-Putian, and Fuzhou. The nine largest cities of PRD had a combined population of 57.15 million at the end of 2013, comprising 53.69% of the provincial population. According to the World Bank Group, the PRD has become the largest urban area in the world in both size and population. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool. - Theatre or theater is a collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers, typically actors or actresses, to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. The specific place of the performance is also named by the word \\"theatre\\" as derived from the Ancient Greek (théatron, \\"a place for viewing\\"), itself from (theáomai, \\"to see\\", \\"to watch\\", \\"to observe\\"). - Stagecraft is the technical aspect of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes constructing and rigging scenery, hanging and focusing of lighting, design and procurement of costumes, makeup, procurement of props, stage management, and recording and mixing of sound. Stagecraft is distinct from the wider umbrella term of scenography. Considered a technical rather than an artistic field, it is primarily the practical implementation of a designer's artistic vision. - A performance, in the performing arts, generally comprises an event in which a performer or group of performers present one or more works of art to an audience. Usually the performers participate in rehearsals beforehand. Afterwards audience members often applaud. - A teleplay is a screenplay or script used in the production of a scripted television program or series. In general usage, the term is most commonly seen in reference to a standalone production, such as a television film, a television play or an episode of an anthology series; in internal industry usage, however, all television scripts (including episodes of ongoing drama or comedy series) are teleplays, although a \\"teleplay\\" credit may be subsumed into a \\"written by\\" credit depending on the circumstances of its creation. - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.

Article: Every autumn, as families across the United States get ready to send their kids to college, the economics of higher education receive renewed attention. College is expensive and becoming more so in the U. S. The situation raises two questions: Why does it cost so much, and how can students and their families afford it? Several studies published in the past few weeks reflect on these questions. The findings provide comfort to poor families. First, it appears that only the minority actually pay the \\"high price\\". A study by the US Education Department's National Center for Education Statistics found that 55 percent of college students last year received some forms of help--scholarships, loans or jobs. Other factors are also at work. The government has increased the size of its grants to lower-income students. Grants, unlike loans, don't have to he repaid and are awarded only to college students who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree. At the same time, most colleges are spending more on undergraduate education than they are collecting in tuition fees. A study, which is part of the Williams College Project on the Economics of Higher Education, reaches the conclusion that on average colleges \\"subsidize \\" their students. The results of these studies, however, leave unanswered the questions of whether educational costs are higher than they need to be. Some experts argue that much of the college cost results from educational competition for fame, students and facilities. This puts upward pressure on tuition, hut many colleges feel that good fame will enable them to attract students even if they charge them more. Therefore, until something important changes in the marketplace, costs seem likely to continue rising. And American families will continue to beat down the doors of the high price \\"college in the end. Question: The writer of this passage seems to hold the opinion that _ .

The answer to the question: Whose piece is now called the Festive Symphony? is inside the article: Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before. To musicologist John Clapham, the cycle presents \\"a cross-section of Czech..., can you guess it ?

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: From hitting the mall with your girl friends on a Saturday afternoon, to holiday spending on gifts that go under the tree, shopping could be called one of America's favorite pastimes. For most people, it means some new clothes for work or a small trinket for a friend. For others, however, shopping is much more than an enjoyable pastime, and in some cases, it is a real and destructive addiction that can turn into a financial disaster. Compulsive shopping and spending are defined as inappropriate, excessive, and out of control. Like other addictions, it basically has something to do with impulsiveness and lack of control over one's impulses. In America, shopping is embedded in our culture; so often, the impulsiveness comes out as excessive shopping. Sometimes this is referred to as \\"shopholism\\". Shopping addiction can damage a person's life, family, and finances. \\"No one knows what causes addictive behaviors, like shopping, alcoholism, drug abuse, and gambling\\", says a professor of applied health science. Some of the new evidence suggests that some people, maybe 10%-15%, may have a genetic predisposition to an addictive behavior, coupled with an environment in which the particular behavior is triggered, but no one really knows why.\\" Individuals will get some kind of high from an addictive behavior like shopping. What are the telltale signs that shopping has crossed the line and become and addiction? What should a concerned family member or friend look out for when they think shopping has become a problem? The behaviors can signal a serious problem: *Shopping or spending money as a result of feeling angry, depressed, anxious, or lonely *Having arguments with others about one's shopping habits *Feeling lost without credit cards -- actually going into withdrawal without them *Buying items on credit, rather than with cash *Describing a rush or a feeling of euphoria with spending *Feeling guilty, ashamed, or embarrassed after a spending spree *Thinking obsessively about money *Spending a lot time juggling accounts...

He is the son of Carol (nee Lutz) and Warren Elliott Norquist (a vice president of Polaroid Corporation), and is of Swedish ancestry. His brother, David Norquist has served in senior posts in Republican administrations at both the United States Department of Defense and the United States Department of Homeland Security. Norquist became involved with politics at an early age when he volunteered for the 1968 Nixon campaign, assisting with get out the vote efforts. Norquist is best known for founding Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) in 1985, which he says was done at the request of then-President Ronald Reagan. Referring to Norquist's activities as head of ATR, Steve Kroft, in a 60 Minutes episode that aired on November 20, 2011, claimed that \\"Norquist has been responsible, more than anyone else, for rewriting the dogma of the Republican Party.\\" The primary policy goal of Americans for Tax Reform is to reduce government revenues as a percentage of the GDP. ATR states that it \\"opposes all tax increases as a matter of principle.\\" Americans for Tax Reform has supported Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) legislation and transparency initiatives, while opposing cap-and-trade legislation and efforts to regulate health care. In 1993, Norquist launched his Wednesday Meeting series at ATR headquarters, initially to help fight President Clinton's healthcare plan. The meeting eventually became one of the most significant institutions in American conservative political organizing. The meetings have been called \\"a must-attend event for Republican operatives fortunate enough to get an invitation\\", and \\"the Grand Central station of the conservative movement.\\" Medvetz (2006) argues that the meetings have been significant in \\"establishing relations of...exchange\\" among conservative subgroups and \\"sustaining a moral community of conservative activists.\\" As a nonprofit organization, Americans for Tax Reform is not required to disclose the identity of its contributors. Critics, such as Sen. Alan Simpson, have asked Norquist to disclose his contributors; he has declined but has said that ATR is financed by direct mail and other grassroots fundraising efforts. According to CBS News, \\"a significant portion appears to come from wealthy individuals, foundations and corporate interests.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did this action help Clinton's healthcare plan?","completion":"The action mentioned in the article is the launch of Grover Norquist's Wednesday Meeting series at ATR headquarters in 1993. The primary objective of this meeting series was to help fight President Clinton's healthcare plan. Therefore, this action did not help Clinton's healthcare plan; instead, it was aimed at opposing it as part of the conservative movement against the proposed policy. The meetings have grown in importance in American conservative political organizing, and they serve as a significant platform for conservative activists and operatives to discuss and strategize their agenda."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gay man left paralyzed in vicious New Glasgow attack The friends and family of a man who was stabbed in a vicious attack in New Glasgow, N.S., leaving him paralyzed, say they believe he was targeted because he's gay. New Glasgow police said a 27-year-old man was airlifted to Halifax hospital with critical injuries Saturday morning after police discovered the victim lying on a downtown street after he was stabbed. Police were on a routine patrol shortly before 2:30 a.m. local time when they saw a man on the ground near the intersection of Archimedes Street and Forbes Street. After closer inspection they saw that the man was stabbed. Amy Punke said she and a group of friends, including her 27-year-old roommate Scott Jones, were out celebrating the opening of a friend's art studio. She said the group decided to leave one bar and go to another. She went on ahead and did not witness the attack. Scott Jones, 27, was stabbed twice in the back leaving him paralyzed after a vicious attack early Saturday morning in New Glasgow, N.S. (Courtesy of Amy Punke) “He was walking with a friend and two men, who had previously been at the bar we were at, came running across the street. One of the men distracted Scott’s friend and the other man stabbed Scott twice in the back and tried to slit his throat,” she said. The injury to Jones' throat was superficial, said Punke, but the stabbing severed Jones’ spinal cord leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. According to Punke — who has been speaking to Jones and has been by his side in hospital — when one of the attackers grabbed the victim, he whispered something in his ear before stabbing him. Jones told Punke he doesn't remember what the man said. She said she doesn’t know why anyone would want to hurt Jones. “Myself, and his family and the people that know him, we feel that he may have been targeted because of the fact that he’s gay — and he’s openly gay in town,” said Punke. She said Jones is very well known in New Glasgow. “He’s a musician and he’s very open about his sexuality in that he encourages conversation. In fact just two days ago we were talking about him going to high schools and junior high and talking to teens that are afraid of coming out. Just the nature of the evening and the people that we were with and the fact that he was targeted out of all of us,” said Punke. Jones was taken to Aberdeen Hospital but then was airlifted to the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre in Halifax. Police said the victim remains in critical but stable condition. Police said they are still in the preliminary stages of the investigation and it’s too early to say what the motive may have been or exactly what happened early Saturday morning.

Until its acceptance by the National Trust, Belton House was always in the ownership of the family of its builder, though the failure of three generations to produce a son and heir caused the ownership to pass sideways and sometimes through the female line. The owners of Belton are buried in the village of Belton's parish church close to the house. Their tombs are collectively one of the most complete sets of family memorials in England—continuous generation to generation for almost 350 years. The earliest Brownlow buried here is the founder of the family fortune the lawyer Richard Brownlow (1555–1638), and one of the most recent is the 6th Baron Brownlow (1899–1978).

Q:Background: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Paragraph: Sand mining in the north coastal region was stopped 20 years ago, but it still continues to this day in the south region. Both fishing communities there are still prosperous, but the southern one had a couple of bad years, with fish and other marine wildlife becoming more scarce. The southern beach had erosion problems as well. The northern beach recovered, and is suitable for tourism. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which region has a less coral riffs? A:","completion":"Based on the given paragraph, it can be inferred that the southern region has less coral reefs compared to the northern region. This conclusion can be drawn from the information that the southern region is still facing sand mining activities, which leads to an increase in water turbidity. The disturbance of underwater and coastal sand negatively affects the marine ecosystem and organisms that require sunlight, such as coral reefs. On the other hand, sand mining has stopped in the northern coastal region 20 years ago, which allowed the beach to recover and become suitable for tourism, suggesting that the coral reefs in the northern region are less affected and potentially more abundant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the domestic front, he covertly opposed Joseph McCarthy and contributed to the end of McCarthyism by openly invoking the modern expanded version of executive privilege. He otherwise left most political activity to his Vice President, Richard Nixon. He was a moderate conservative who continued New Deal agencies and expanded Social Security. He also launched the Interstate Highway System, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the establishment of strong science education via the National Defense Education Act, and encouraged peaceful use of nuclear power via amendments to the Atomic Energy Act. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What sort of conservative was Eisenhower?","completion":"Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States, can be described as a moderate conservative. As a moderate conservative, he sought to preserve and continue certain policies and institutions from the past, but he also embraced change and innovation when necessary for the betterment of the nation. Eisenhower's conservative values were evident in his adherence to principles such as limited government intervention, fiscal responsibility, and the importance of a strong national defense. However, unlike some other conservatives of his time, he was pragmatic and open to the idea of the government playing a somewhat larger role in certain areas of public life, especially those that promoted national security, economic growth, or societal progress. Continuation of New Deal agencies: Eisenhower believed in maintaining the stability and continuity of the country, which is why he continued to support the New Deal agencies initiated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Instead of dismantling these agencies, he sought to manage them more efficiently and effectively. Expansion of Social Security: While some conservative politicians sought to limit or even eliminate social welfare programs, Eisenhower expanded Social Security. This action served as an example of his pragmatic and flexible approach to governance, as he recognized the value of the program in providing support to vulnerable populations. Interstate Highway System: The establishment of the Interstate Highway System in the United States under Eisenhower's administration demonstrated his willingness to balance his conservative principles with the need for progress and modern infrastructure. This ambitious project, which required significant federal investment, helped to facilitate economic growth and strengthen the nation's defense capabilities. National Defense Education Act: Similarly, Eisenhower's investment in education through the National Defense Education Act reflected his belief in the importance of a well-educated population for national security and prosperity. This legislation provided funding for higher education, particularly in the areas of mathematics, science, and foreign languages. Peaceful use of nuclear power: Eisenhower's amendments to the Atomic Energy Act encouraged the peaceful use of nuclear technology in areas such as energy production. This approach exhibited his pragmatic conservatism by balancing the potential dangers of nuclear proliferation with the benefits it could bring to society. In summary, President Dwight D. Eisenhower can be characterized as a moderate conservative who blended traditional conservative values with a willingness to embrace change and innovation when necessary for the overall welfare of the nation. His presidency saw a continuation of New Deal policies, expansion of social programs, and investment in education and infrastructure, all while maintaining his commitment to fiscal responsibility and a strong national defense."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Egypt's president says comments he made more than two years ago that are being criticized as anti-Semitic were taken out of context, Egypt's official news agency reported Wednesday. President Mohamed Morsy said the statements, made in 2010, were about Israeli aggression against Palestinians in Gaza, not about the Jewish people, according to a statement published in Egypt News. U.S. senators visiting Cairo on Wednesday confronted him about the comments, according to one of the senators. \\"In our meeting with President Morsy, we voiced our strong disapproval of statements he made a few years ago that have recently surfaced,\\" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said in a written statement. \\"We had a constructive discussion on this subject. We leave it to the president to make any further comments on this matter that he may wish.\\" The","completion":"controversy around President Morsy's comments has raised concerns about the future of Egypt's relationship with Israel and the United States, as well as the issue of anti-Semitism in the region. According to the Middle East Monitor, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) called the 2010 statements \\"deeply disturbing\\" and urged Morsy to retract his remarks and demonstrate his commitment to peace and tolerance. Various political and religious leaders have also weighed in on the matter, with some condemning the president's comments as harmful to regional stability, while others have defended Morsy's right to express his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some analysts have argued that the Egyptian president's previous affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood, a group often accused of promoting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, may have influenced his controversial remarks. In an effort to address the situation and ease tensions, Egypt's government has initiated diplomatic efforts to clarify the president's position, reassuring both Israel and the United States that Cairo is committed to maintaining peace agreements and fostering a spirit of cooperation in the region. Egyptian Foreign Ministry officials have highlighted the progress made in recent negotiations with Israel, particularly in areas such as border security and counter-terrorism efforts. In response to the senators' concerns, Morsy's press secretary released a statement clarifying the president's position on the matter. \\"President Morsy reaffirms that he strongly believes in religious tolerance and peaceful coexistence among all people of the world,\\" the statement read. \\"The comments expressed in 2010 were specifically targeting Israel's actions against Palestinians in Gaza and should not be interpreted as a reflection of his views towards the Jewish community.\\" The Egyptian leader has acknowledged the need for improved communication and reiterated his commitment to engage in open dialogue with the international community. President Morsy has pledged to work closely with the U.S. and other allies in the region to address shared concerns, including the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians, the ongoing civil war in Syria, and the fight against terrorism. Nonetheless, critics argue that concrete actions must be taken by the Egyptian president in order to demonstrate his commitment to religious tolerance and regional stability. Some suggest the need for Egypt to take on a stronger role in mediating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and promoting bilateral agreements, while others propose the implementation of domestic policies that expressly protect the rights of religious and ethnic minorities in the country. The recent episode involving President Morsy's comments highlights the importance of responsible political discourse and the need for leaders to choose their words carefully, particularly when dealing with sensitive topics such as religious tensions and the complex dynamics of the Middle East. As Egypt continues to navigate its new role on the global stage following the 2011 revolution and the establishment of a civilian government, it will be crucial for President Morsy and his administration to foster an environment of trust, respect, and open dialogue with their international partners, in order to address pressing regional challenges and work towards a more peaceful and prosperous future for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That year he arrived first in Cyprus, where he antagonised the nobles, and then in Jerusalem, where he stayed until 1229, leaving in humiliating circumstances after having produced an anti-imperialist reaction in the people. In 1231 he sent Riccardo Filangieri as his marshal. His attempt to assert his authority was opposed by John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut, who had been regent until Frederick's arrival. On John's death in 1236 the war was taken up by his son Balian. In 1239 Philip of Montfort assumed the leadership of the opposition. Though the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the Knights Templar supported the nobility, the Teutonic Knights and Knights Hospitaller supported Filangieri. In general his rights as regent were recognised but his practical power was denied on the basis of the Assizes and the Haute Cour. His headquarters were in Tyre and he had the allegiance of Bohemond V, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli. He also held the Holy City of Jerusalem itself, which had been negotiated away from the Saracens by Frederick. So long as the Ibelins controlled the opposition, Filangieri could count on the support of their enemies as well. The Italian cities were also divided between the two factions: Pisa supported Filangieri and Genoa the Ibelins. The Ibelins controlled Beirut, Arsuf, and Caesarea as well as the old capital of Acre. In 1231 the citizens of Acre formed a commune with their headquarters at the church of Saint Andrew's in order to unify their opposition to Filangieri. In 1232 John of Ibelin was elected its mayor.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Eakins referred to the painting as Swimming in 1885, and as The Swimmers in 1886. The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \\"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast. The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while... answer the following question: What painting possibly influenced the painting The Swimming Hole? A:","completion":"The painting that possibly influenced \\"The Swimming Hole\\" is \\"Scène d'été\\" created in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is suggested that Thomas Eakins might have seen Bazille's painting at the Salon during his time in Europe, which could have inspired the composition and theme of \\"The Swimming Hole.\\" Both paintings depict a group of male figures enjoying leisurely activities in a natural setting, highlighting themes of camaraderie and appreciation for the male form."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Input: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) evolved into one of the most successful unsupervised techniques for generating realistic images. Even though it has recently been shown that GAN training converges, GAN models often end up in local Nash equilibria that are associated with mode collapse or otherwise fail to model the target distribution. We introduce Coulomb GANs, which pose the GAN learning problem as a potential field, where generated samples are attracted to training set samples but repel each other. The discriminator learns a potential field while the generator decreases the energy by moving its samples along the vector (force) field determined by the gradient of the potential field. Through decreasing the energy, the GAN model learns to generate samples according to the whole target distribution and does not only cover some of its modes. We prove that Coulomb GANs possess only one Nash equilibrium which is optimal in the sense that the model distribution equals the target distribution. We show the efficacy of Coulomb GANs on LSUN bedrooms, CelebA faces, CIFAR-10 and the Google Billion Word text generation.

And it also argues that Cassidy received compensation from OPTIONS: - ADLF for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to. - American Democracy Legal Fund for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to. - Bill Cassidy for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to. - CNN for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to. - Cassidy for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to. - Democratic for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to. - Democrats for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to. - Ethics Committee for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to. - LSU for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to. - Louisiana for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to. - Louisiana Democratic Party for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to. - Louisiana State University for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to. - Mary Landrieu for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to. - Office of Congressional Ethics for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to. - Republican for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to.","completion":"- Louisiana State University for months when he didn't put in any hours there, meaning the compensation constitutes a gift in excess of the 100 limit lawmakers must adhere to. The passage discusses ethics complaints against Rep. Bill Cassidy related to his work at Louisiana State University (LSU). Because the alleged ethics violations are connected to his LSU work, the correct option should mention this organization. It makes sense that Cassidy received compensation from LSU since the entire passage is about his work there.

Yes; The answer is:","completion":"1). No; A more detailed and comprehensive answer to the question \\"What state was the Civil War in?\\" would be: The American Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865, took place in several states throughout the United States. The war was primarily fought between two sides – the Union, which was made up of states that remained loyal to the federal government, and the Confederacy, which was made up of states that seceded from the Union to form their own government due to their support for the institution of slavery and other differences. The war was not confined to a single state, as battles and significant events occurred in numerous states across the country. Before the Civil War began, seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederate States of America: South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. These states seceded from the Union in the period between President Abraham Lincoln's election in November 1860 and his inauguration on March 4, 1861. Lincoln's opposition to the extension of slavery into the western territories was among the main reasons for their secession. Four additional states – Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina – seceded following the start of the war in April 1861, when the Confederates attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina. The 11 Confederate states formed the core of the Southern rebellion, while the Union consisted of 20 free states and 5 border states. The Civil War saw many significant battles and skirmishes in various states, including landmark battles such as the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania, the Battle of Antietam in Maryland, and the Battle of Bull Run in Virginia. Additionally, many states experienced smaller but still important battles, guerrilla warfare, and other military engagements throughout the course of the war. In conclusion, the American Civil War was not restricted to one specific state; rather, it was a conflict that spanned several regions throughout the United States. The statement \\"Lincoln won, but before his inauguration on March 4, 1861, seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy\\" would not be a reasonable answer to the question, as it fails to fully explain the complexity and scope of the war."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field?, using the article: Immediately southeast of Mount Cayley lies Mount Fee, an extensively eroded volcano containing a north-south trending ridge. It has an elevation of 2,162 m (7,093 ft) and is one of the older volcanic features in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. Its volcanics are undated, but its large amount of dissection and evidence of glacial ice overriding the volcano indicates that it formed more than 75,000 years ago before the Wisconsinan Glaciation. Therefore, volcanism at Mount Fee does not display evidence of interaction with glacial ice. The remaining products from Fee's earliest volcanic activity is a minor portion of pyroclastic rock. This is evidence of explosive volcanism from Fee's eruptive history, as well as its first volcanic event. The second volcanic event produced a sequence of lavas and breccias on the eastern flank of the main ridge. These volcanics were likely deposited when a sequence of lava flows and broken lava fragments erupted from a volcanic vent and moved down the flanks during the construction of a large volcano. Following extensive dissection, renewed volcanism produced a viscous series of lava flows forming its narrow, flat-topped, steep-sided northern limit and the northern end of the main ridge. The conduit for which these lava flows originated from was likely vertical in structure and intruded through older volcanics deposited during Fee's earlier volcanic events. This volcanic event was also followed by a period of erosion, and likely one or more glacial periods. Extensive erosion following the last volcanic event at Mount Fee has created the rugged north-south trending ridge that currently forms a prominent landmark.Pali Dome, located north and northeast of Mount Cayley, is an eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field. Like Cauldron Dome, it consists of two geological units. Pail Dome East is composed of a mass of andesite lava flows and small amounts of pyroclastic material. It lies on the eastern portion of the Powder Mountain Icefield. Much of the lava flows form..., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"The full name of the eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field is Pali Dome. This volcano, which is located north and northeast of Mount Cayley, is a significantly eroded structure and constitutes an important part of the central Mount Cayley volcanic field. Pali Dome, similar to Cauldron Dome, is composed of two geological units and is largely made up of andesite lava flows and small quantities of pyroclastic material. Like Mount Fee, which lies to the southeast of Mount Cayley, Pali Dome showcases signs of significant erosion. However, the lava flows and pyroclastic remnants found in Pali Dome specifically point towards the explosive volcanic activity that it has witnessed in the past. Despite extensive erosion and the passage of geological time, the physical attributes of the Pali Dome provide invaluable insights into its volcanic history. Its exact age and the timeline of volcanic events it has experienced might be undisclosed, but it clearly forms a part of the older geological features in the Mount Cayley volcanic field.

Movie title: Calvary Movie plot: The film Calvary is a parable of the betrayal of the Irish people by the Irish Catholic Church.Context for the story: The Irish Catholic Church which was a pillar of, and defined Ireland's soul has been revealed to have consciously and methodically covered up institutional atrocities perpetrated by themselves.Set in rural Ireland, the film begins in a confessional where Father James Lavelle (Brendan Gleeson) is taking confession. The voice on the other side speaks, \\"I was seven the first time I tasted semen\\". \\"Certainly a startling opening line\\", Father James replies. The voice asks if he's being ironic. Father James takes a more serious tone. The voice tells him that he was molested both orally and anally by a priest when he was seven and he bled a lot. Father James asks if he would like to report the priest. The voice says that the priest died a long time ago and that it didn't matter. \\"Killing a bad priest isn't a big deal, but if you kill a good priest, people take notice\\". The voice says he's going to kill Father James in seven days on the beach.James lives a very simple life. He sleeps in a small room with a bed and his only two possessions are his crucifix and his dog. He takes walks on the beach and interacts with the town people. On the beach, he sees his altar server is drawing a landscape. In it there are two figures. James asks who they are and the boy says he doesn't know, but he has been having a lot of dreams about ghosts lately.After mass, Father James is speaking with Father Leary (David Wilmot) who is gossiping about the townsfolk, sharing information he's heard in confession and making racially inappropriate comments about Simon (Isaach De Bankole) the only black man in the town. Father James doesn't say a word about the threat on his life.James' daughter Fiona (Kelly Reilly) comes to town to lay low after a botched suicide attempt. The townsfolk didn't know it was possible for a Catholic priest to have a daughter. James explains that he became a priest after his wife died. The locals in... The answer is:","completion":"In the movie Calvary, Dr. Frank Harte (played by actor Aidan Gillen) is introduced initially as a cynical, atheist doctor who is disrespectful towards Father James. Despite the angst and tension between the two characters, Harte plays a crucial role as he interestingly provides a confrontational and skeptical perspective on the church and its teachings. It’s essential to clarify the dynamic between Dr. Frank Harte and Father James. Their interactions are defined by frank, straightforward dialogs, challenging the faith and suffering that Father James represents. In the context of the film, Dr. Harte serves a potent role, embodying the skepticism, doubt, and anger towards the church, especially considering the backdrop of the church's betrayal of Irish society. Given his profession as a doctor, Harte represents a more scientific, rational viewpoint on life, which profoundly contrasts with Father James's religious, faith-based perspective. Frequently, he pushes the boundaries of propriety and respect, as his disbelief and skepticism towards Father James's faith manifest in bitter, cutting sarcasm. This gap between their viewpoints spurs dynamic conversational exchanges that fuel the narrative. Specifically, Dr. Harte's reaction to Father James is ambivalent and complex. On one hand, he openly mocks and challenges Father James, displaying contempt for his faith. He relatively lacks reverence for the church, considering his personal beliefs and the overarching narrative of the church's penetration in Ireland. But on the other hand, Harte never attempts to take physical action against Father James, which might suggest a confusing sense of respect or at least tolerance for Father James as an individual, if not for the institution he represents. The scene where Dr. Harte draws a comparison between the church and his profession, claiming doctors are moving towards obsoleteness with reference to the increasing irrelevance of the church in modern society, is demonstrative of his complex relationship with Father James. His acknowledgment that they both might be remnants of a past era distinctively captures the layered relationship between these characters rooted in skepticism and an unavoidable understanding. Considering investing in the film proposal based on the relationship between Dr. Harte and Father James, it's pivotal to recognize their interaction's intensity and depth. The characters' contrasting outlooks incite profound questions about faith, guilt, redemption, and the role of the church in society, fostering thoughtful and engaging content for audiences, a pointer to a potentially successful film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Government-intelligence firm Input says state and local spending on transportation IT systems should rise from 1.8 billion in fiscal 2005 to 2. What best summarizes the content of the above article?","completion":"The article primarily discusses the forecasted growth in the expenditure on transportation Information Technology (IT) systems by state and local governments. According to the government-intelligence firm Input, this spending is projected to increase from 1.8 billion in fiscal 2005 presumably to 2 billion, although the exact figure isn't clear in the context provided. This predicted rise indicates a future where technology will likely become an increasingly integral part of managing and improving transportation systems at the state and local level. Such systems could include anything from infrastructure management, GPS and tracking systems, ticketing and payment solutions to traffic management and smart city initiatives. Investment in these areas is key to ensure smooth running of transportation networks, improve service efficiency, safety, and manage operational expenses. The increased budget adoption suggests the recognition of the importance of IT systems in transportation by the involved government entities. However, to understand the full impact, it would be beneficial to assess what specific areas this budget will be funneled into - whether it will be distributed for upgrading existing systems, introducing new innovative solutions, or perhaps a combination of both. Moreover, the fact that such financial statistics are being reported by a government-intelligence firm implies that this could be useful data for other key players in the industry. For instance, IT solutions providers, contractors, analysts, or even other governments could find this information impactful. It could also influence strategic planning, competition, and collaboration within the industry. Providing a figure for future spending provides a valuable insight into the potential market size for companies providing transportation related IT solutions and services.

Superpowers HQ | The Sun |Features Inside the imposing, hotel-sized building workmen put the finishing touches to a series of rooms packed with space-age equipment aimed at boosting the \\"superpower\\" of its users. It may sound like something from Tom Cruise's next film Mission: Impossible 4, but this is the latest venture of the Church of Scientology, which has the Hollywood superstar as its most famous devotee. Cruise is expected to attend the grand opening of what is known as The Super Power Building, which has nearly 900 rooms and has taken more than 13 years to build at a cost of £50million. Fellow film stars John Travolta and Kirstie Alley are also expected to be there. The building in Clearwater, Florida, has been shrouded in secrecy since its foundations were first laid. And when The Sun tried to find out about the imposing structure, it turned out to be Mission: Impossible. Within minutes of arriving outside the entrance a security guard stepped out from behind a blacked-out door to monitor us. Somebody's watching ... cult security guard takes pictures of The Sun's men in Florida Moments later another guard on a mountain bike peddled up and asked what we were doing. He wore a white shirt and black trousers, the uniform adopted by many Scientology staff. Later, yet another security guard began filming us before ducking behind a tree when we trained our camera on him. Attempts to find out what will happen in the Super Power Building were met with silence by officials. The veil of secrecy does not surprise experts who have followed the religion since it was founded by the late science fiction writer L Ron Hubbard in 1952. Someone who has spoken to dozens of former members, said: \\"Scientology claims not to be a cult but all they do gives that impression. They don't like people snooping around what they are doing.\\" A series of alleged artists' impressions of the interior that were leaked on to the net have revealed NASA-like training gizmos that will be used to help devotees of the religion to boost their so-called \\"theta powers\\". The building houses an ANTI-GRAVITY SIMULATOR central to boosting devotees' mental abilities. Users are strapped blindfolded into the machine which spins around and is said to aid perception of direction. Other rooms contain a VIDEO SCREEN that moves back and forwards while flashing up images. It is said to help users enhance their ability to spot subliminal messages. The centrepiece of the 12-storey building is the sixth-floor INDOOR RUNNING TRACK the length of the structure, which is kept in semi-darkness. Hi-tech ... artist's impression of a training machine at the new Scientology building in Florida An insider said Scientology worshippers will be encouraged to run until they are close to exhaustion and their mind freed of painful memories. The highly secret Super Power course was developed by Hubbard and is said to boost a person's perceptions or senses through mental and physical exercises. Scientologists believe that in addition to the five senses of hearing, sight, touch, taste and smell, we all have 57 extra \\"abilities\\". These include being able to sense blood circulation, balance and know compass direction, temperature and gravity as well as have an \\"awareness of importance, unimportance\\". Almost half the building's 889 rooms will be used to carry out \\"audits\\"  the Scientology term for counselling sessions. Auditing is a cornerstone of the religion, which all members must undergo. It is said that a museum dedicated to Hubbard will be on the ground floor, plus murals depicting famous moments in Scientology's history. The Super Power Building is connected by a walkway to a luxury hotel, Fort Harrison, used as a retreat exclusively by Scientology members. The hotel is also ringed by CCTV cameras and security guards hover at the entrance. Both Pulp Fiction star Travolta and Alley, best known for TV's Cheers, are regular visitors. Tom Cruise has also spent time at Fort Harrison. The Top Gun star is by far the most high-profile of the estimated eight million who follow the Church of Scientology worldwide. Followers ... Kirstie Alley, Tom Cruise and Juliette Lewis Cruise has helped raise hundreds of thousands towards it. He joined the religion in the late Eighties. Other celeb followers include actor Will Smith, Elvis Presley's daughter Lisa Marie, actress Juliette Lewis and My Name Is Earl star Jason Lee. Cruise rarely talks in public about his devotion but he has appeared at many official functions. Insiders say he is second in command to Scientology leader David Miscavige in all but name. The Super Power Building's £50million costs were met by followers, but Cruise's name does not appear on a list of donors leaked by ex-members. Kirstie Alley is reported to have donated more than £160,000. Scientology's main headquarters in Britain is in Saint Hill, West Sussex, but quiet Gulf Coast town Clearwater  a popular spot for Brits after they have visited Orlando's Disney World  has become ground zero for the religion. The building is expected to draw many more Scientologists to the area. Over the past two decades the church has become the largest single property owner in Clearwater. Futuristic ... cutting edge design at the new Scientology building Many residents resent the takeover but are afraid to speak out. \\"They have such an imposing presence that no one wants to say anything against them,\\" said one local. \\"You hear so many stories about harassment of people who dare to speak out against them.\\" Nancy Beckman, 78, who runs a Christian Science Reading room close to the Super Power Building, said: \\"I call them the ants. All you see are lots of people wearing black and white scurrying around. I have nothing against them but they are secretive. A lot of people do not feel secure around them.\\" She said visitors to Clearwater were \\"mesmerised\\" by the Super Power Building. \\"Clearwater is the training ground for Scientology and they are here to stay,\\" she said. Another resident, who would not be named, said Scientology is nothing more than a cult. \\"Most people follow the teachings of religious scripts, Scientologists follow those of a failed science fiction writer,\\" they said. \\"That tells you all you need to know about their church.\\" What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the Church of Scientology's Super Power Building located in Clearwater, Florida.

It was awesome. This was about a month ago. It was the last day I worked. Memorial Day at the city rec center is SLOW, especially when it's beautiful outside, but for some reason, we had two front desk attendants: me, and “bully #1”. Bully #1 clearly had a major distaste for me. She hated my tattoos, the way I would get into a heated debate one day with a police officer patron, then have a fantastic conversation with him days later about legalizing marijuana. She hated that I was liked, but still could give fuck-all about what others thought of me. Bully #2 was our financial director, who got stuck as the manager on duty that day. I honestly never had a clue she didn't like me. She was intense and sarcastic with everyone. I liked her style.

After a scoreless first quarter, the Broncos took the lead in the second quarter, as quarterback Kyle Orton threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal. The Titans responded, with quarterback Vince Young throwing an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Kenny Britt. The Broncos would retake the lead, with a 36-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater, but The Titans replied, when placekicker Rob Bironas nailed an incredible 55-yard field goal just before halftime. In the third quarter, the Broncos took the lead again, with another 36-yard field goal by Prater, but Titans' wide receiver Marc Mariani returned the ensuing kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown, putting Tennessee ahead 17-13. Tennessee's lead was narrowed, with a 35-yard field goal by Prater, but was increased again with a 46-yard field goal by Bironas.

Process: - A sperm and egg meet inside a woman&#x27;s fallopian tube - The fertilized egg, now a zygote, travels to the uterus - The zygote implants in the uterus - The zygote becomes an embryo - The embryo becomes a fetus - The fetus grows for approximately 9 months - The woman gives birth to a baby - The baby grows into a child - The child becomes an adult - The adult mates with another adult - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the egg will not be fertilized happens, how will it affect MORE babies. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of the egg not being fertilized has a direct effect on the process. The process of human reproduction and development is interrupted at the very beginning, ultimately affecting the production of more babies. Here is the step-by-step analysis and justification of the effects of this perturbation: 1. An unfertilized egg cannot create a zygote, as fertilization is the fusion of a sperm and an egg to form a zygote. This means that the entire process would come to a halt at the first step. 2. Since there is no zygote formed, it won't travel to the uterus and won't implant in its wall. This means that steps involving zygote travel and implantation will not take place. 3. As there is no zygote present, it won't develop into an embryo, and subsequently, no fetus will form. This leads to the disruption of the process at steps concerning embryo and fetus development. 4. With no fetus growing inside the womb, the woman will not become pregnant and will not give birth to a baby after approximately nine months. This directly impacts the generation of more babies. 5. Consequently, there will be no baby to grow into a child and, eventually, an adult. The subsequent steps involving baby growth, child development, and adults mating with others for reproduction are affected as well. Overall, the perturbation of the egg not being fertilized directly impacts the process of human reproduction and development by interrupting the initial steps and influencing the subsequent stages. This ultimately leads to fewer babies being born, affecting the overall population and its growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - sore feet - amazement - retrospection - boredom - crowding The answer is \\"crowding\\" because A:","completion":"When visiting a museum with narrow halls, the experience can often lead to \\"crowding\\" due to a number of factors contributing to this overwhelming sensation. However, it is important to note that each individual's experience may differ based on their personal preferences and the specific museum being visited. Firstly, museums with narrow halls typically have limited physical space for visitors to navigate through the exhibits. This creates a constrained environment where people are forced to walk close together, sometimes brushing against each other or even bumping into one another. The limited personal space available can make some feel increasingly uncomfortable or anxious, especially in a world that has become increasingly aware of the importance of personal space for both health and comfort reasons. Secondly, narrow halls can impact the overall visual experience of the museum for visitors as it can be challenging to get a clear view of the exhibits. In these confined spaces, it is often difficult to appreciate or fully comprehend the displayed items from an optimal distance or from multiple angles. This can lead to a less engaging experience in comparison to museums with spacious galleries that allow for a more immersive, balanced interaction with the art or artifacts. Another contributing factor to crowding is the potential concentration of visitors in a particular area or around a popular exhibit. When there is a high demand for viewing a specific exhibit or numerous visitors in a confined area, wait times can increase, and congestion can create bottlenecks that disrupt the flow of movement. The pressure of staying within an allocated time slot and navigating the crowd adds to the stress experienced by the visitors. It is also worth considering that some visitors may feel the need to rush through the museum to avoid the crowded areas, resulting in an inability to fully appreciate and absorb the experience at their own pace. This may lead to a superficial interaction with the displayed items or the inability to retain valuable information presented in the museum. Lastly, the presence of large groups, such as guided tours or school trips, may exacerbate the crowding issue. These groups often move in clusters, taking up even more limited space in the narrow halls, resulting in additional navigational challenges, noise, and increased levels of discomfort for other visitors. In conclusion, visiting a museum with narrow halls might lead to the experience of crowding due to spatial limitations, inadequate viewing opportunities, concentrated visitor clusters, and reduced overall enjoyment. As museums are typically meant to inspire, educate, and provoke reflection, the impact of crowding within narrow halls should be acknowledged and, where possible, addressed by both visitors and museum management in order to optimize the museum experience for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy. We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing. I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity...., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"The man who scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music is named Camille Saint-Saëns. He was known for his nontraditional teaching methods when he served as a professor at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, following the death of Louis Niedermeyer. Rather than strictly adhering to the traditional classical music program, Saint-Saëns introduced his students to the works of several contemporary musicians of his time, such as Schumann, Liszt, and Wagner. His unique approach to teaching music wasn't well received by all his colleagues, which led to some contention. However, this did not deter him from his philosophy of introducing a wider range of musical styles to his students. His philosophy is reflected in the words of his best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, who remembered Saint-Saëns revealing to them the works of masters from whom the rigorous classical nature of their program of study kept them distant. In addition to teaching, Saint-Saëns was also a composer. He even used his position to organize a farce performed by the students and contributed to it by composing incidental music. The article also mentions his well-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, which he originally conceived with his students in mind. These examples further illustrate the way Saint-Saëns embraced and encouraged creativity and expression, pushing the boundaries of the academic regime. Despite his proactive approach and his growing reputation as a soloist and composer, Saint-Saëns faced some setbacks. For instance, when he decided to compete a second time for the Prix de Rome in 1864, it was met with surprise, and he was unsuccessful. However, even one of the judges, Berlioz, recognized and regretted having to vote against a man who truly is a great artist. Saint-Saëns' influence on the music world and his timeless impact on his students serves as a testament to his skill and unconventional methods, even in the face of professional adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is an article: WASHINGTON — The Obama administration has initiated a last-ditch diplomatic campaign to avert a confrontation this month over a plan by Palestinians to seek recognition as a state at the United Nations, but it may already be too late, according to senior American officials and foreign diplomats. The administration has circulated a proposal for renewed peace talks with the Israelis in the hopes of persuading the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, to abandon the bid for recognition at the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly beginning Sept. 20. The administration has made it clear to Mr. Abbas that it will veto any request presented to the United Nations Security Council to make a Palestinian state a new member outright. But the United States does not have enough support to block a vote by the General Assembly to elevate the status of the Palestinians’ nonvoting observer “entity” to that of a nonvoting observer state. The change would pave the way for the Palestinians to join dozens of United Nations bodies and conventions, and it could strengthen their ability to pursue cases against Israel at the International Criminal Court. Senior officials said the administration wanted to avoid not only a veto but also the more symbolic and potent General Assembly vote that would leave the United States and only a handful of other nations in the opposition. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic maneuverings, said they feared that in either case a wave of anger could sweep the Palestinian territories and the wider Arab world at a time when the region is already in tumult. President Obama would be put in the position of threatening to veto recognition of the aspirations of most Palestinians or risk alienating Israel and its political supporters in the United States. “If you put the alternative out there, then you’ve suddenly just changed the circumstances and changed the dynamic,” a senior administration official involved in the flurry of diplomacy said Thursday. “And that’s what we’re trying very much to do.” Efforts to head off the Palestinian diplomatic drive have percolated all summer but have taken on urgency as the vote looms in the coming weeks. “It’s not clear to me how it can be avoided at the moment,” said Ghaith al-Omari, a former Palestinian negotiator who is now executive director of the American Task Force on Palestine in Washington. “An American veto could inflame emotions and bring anti-American sentiment to the forefront across the region.” While some officials remain optimistic that a compromise can be found, the administration has simultaneously begun planning to limit the fallout of a statehood vote. A primary focus is to ensure the Israelis and Palestinians continue to cooperate on security matters in the West Bank and along Israel’s borders, administration officials said. “We’re still focused on Plan A,” another senior administration official said, referring to the diplomatic efforts by the administration’s new special envoy, David M. Hale, and the president’s Middle East adviser on the National Security Council, Dennis B. Ross. Mr. Hale replaced the more prominent George J. Mitchell Jr., who resigned in May after two years of frustrated efforts to make progress on a peace deal. The State Department late last month issued a formal diplomatic message to more than 70 countries urging them to oppose any unilateral moves by the Palestinians at the United Nations. The message, delivered by American ambassadors to their diplomatic counterparts in those countries, argued that a vote would destabilize the region and undermine peace efforts, though those are, at least for now, moribund. Two administration officials said that the intent of the message was to narrow the majority the Palestinians are expected to have in the General Assembly. They said that and the new peace proposal — to be issued in a statement by the Quartet, the diplomatic group focused on the Middle East comprising the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations — could persuade potential supporters to step back from a vote on recognition, and thus force Mr. Abbas to have second thoughts. “The fact is there are countries who would choose not to do that vote if there was an alternative,” the first senior administration official said. Ethan Bronner and Isabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Neil MacFarquhar from the United Nations.

Breaking down the given premise, we have two important pieces of information to consider: 1. Both men are wearing similar colors. 2. There is a conversation happening between the two men. The primary premise specifies that both men are wearing similar colors. In the context of the statement \\"A man in red winter clothes talks to another man in red,\\" this implies that both men are wearing some shade of red. Therefore, this part of the statement is consistent with the given premise, as long as these similar colors are red. Next, we need to consider the second part of the statement, which is involving the two men in conversation. Since the given premise does not mention any detail about the conversation, we can assume that there's no contradiction with the statement in this aspect. In conclusion, the statement \\"A man in red winter clothes talks to another man in red\\" can be considered true based on the premise \\"Both men are wearing similar colors,\\" if we ensure that the similar colors are red and if there is indeed a conversation happening between the two men. However, it is important to note that the given premise alone does not directly confirm the truthfulness of the statement, but it does not contradict it either. To definitively confirm the truthfulness of the statement, further clarification regarding the specific color they are wearing (red) and the existence of the conversation would be required."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Learn from your failures and keep moving forward even when you face setbacks. 8. Participate in competitions or auditions: Take part in competitions, auditions, or casting calls relevant to your field. Winning or participating in such events can get you noticed by potential collaborators, agents, and others who can help boost your career. 9. Be adaptable: The road to fame is often unpredictable.

Johnny is a compulsive gambler who is down on his luck and in debt. Johnny and his friend Cully, a musician and composer, visit a gypsy camp to get his fortune told. A lady reads tea leaves and tells Johnny that he will soon meet a red-haired woman who will bring him luck. Back on the boat, Johnny and Cully promptly encounter Nellie Bly, their boss Clint Braden's on-again, off-again girlfriend. Nellie has just caught Braden seducing another singer, Mitzi. Since she has red hair, Nellie is persuaded by Johnny to touch his chips for luck. After he wins, Johnny is convinced that the gypsy must be correct. Frankie finds out and becomes jealous, as does Johnny's boss. In a bit of musical theatre, Frankie shoots Johnny for dancing with Nellie Bly while singing Cully's latest song. A Broadway recruiter sees the riverboat show and buys the rights to this new song, suggesting that Frankie and Johnny should work together with him in New York City. Landing in New Orleans, the musical cast and riverboat crew attend a masked ball. Frankie, Nellie and Mitzi all rent the same Madame Pompadour costume. Johnny is eager for the luck of redhead Nellie to win more money, contrary to Frankie's expressed wishes.

Club leader Sean (Andre Gower), whose five-year-old sister Phoebe (Ashley Bank) desperately wants to join the club, is given the diary of legendary vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing (Jack Gwillim) - but his excitement is toned down when he finds it's written in German. Sean, his best friend Patrick (Robby Kiger), and the rest of the Monster Squad visit an elderly man, known as the \\"Scary German Guy\\" (Leonardo Cimino), actually a kind gentleman, to translate the diary. When the Monster Squad wonders how the German man is knowledgeable about Van Helsing's battle with monsters, he wryly comments that \\"he has some experience with monsters\\" and his shirt sleeve briefly reveals a concentration camp tattoo.The diary describes, in great detail, an amulet that is composed of concentrated good. One day out of every century, as the forces of good and evil reach a balance, the otherwise indestructible amulet becomes vulnerable to destruction, and the next day of balance falls within a couple days, at the stroke of midnight. The kids realize they must gain possession of the amulet before the day of balance arrives; once they have the amulet, the kids can use it with an incantation from Van Helsing's diary to open a hole in the universe and cast the monsters into Limbo. As shown in the prelude, van Helsing had unsuccessfully attempted this one hundred years ago in order to defeat his old adversary Count Dracula; his apprentices then emigrated to the United States to hide the amulet, where it was out of Dracula's immediate reach.Dracula, meanwhile, seeks to obtain the amulet before the Monster Squad does, so that the Count can take control of the world and plunge it into darkness.

Frank Parnell. The policeman opens the trunk, sees a blinding flash of white light, and is instantly vaporized, leaving only his boots behind. Otto Maddox, a young punk rocker in L.A., is fired from his job as a supermarket stock clerk. His girlfriend leaves him for his best friend. Depressed and broke, Otto is wandering the streets when a man named Bud drives up and offers him 25 to drive a car out of the neighborhood. Otto follows Bud in the car to the Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation, where he learns that the car he drove was being repossessed. He refuses to join Bud as a \\"repo man,\\" and goes to his parents' house. He learns that his burned-out ex-hippie parents have donated the money they promised him for finishing school to a crooked televangelist. He decides to take the repo job. After repossessing a flashy red Cadillac, Otto sees a girl named Leila running down the street. He gives her a ride to her workplace, the United Fruitcake Outlet. On the way, Leila shows Otto pictures of aliens that she says are in the trunk of a Chevy Malibu. She claims that they are dangerous because of the radiation that they emit. Meanwhile, Helping Hand is offered a 20,000 bounty notice for the Malibu. Most assume that the car is drug-related, because the bounty is so far above the actual value of the car. Parnell arrives in L.A. driving the Malibu, but he is unable to meet his waiting UFO compatriots because of a team of government agents led by a woman with a metal hand. When Parnell pulls into a gas station, Helping Hand's competitors, the Rodriguez brothers, take the Malibu. They stop for sodas because the car's trunk is so hot.

To do this, we will first subtract 2*k from both sides of the equation. 2*k - 2*k + 725 = 30*k - 2*k + 641 This simplifies to: 725 = 28*k + 641 Step 3: Now, we need to get k alone.

Given the question: Given the below context: Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

Pakistan Rejects U.S. Disavowal of Drone Strikes ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — The Pakistani military on Tuesday denied suggestions by American officials quoted in an article in The New York Times that Pakistan had used the C.I.A. drone program as cover for its own military operations in the tribal belt. The Times article, first published online on Monday, cited United States government officials who said that, contrary to media reports at the time, the C.I.A. had not carried out two reported strikes in North and South Waziristan on Feb. 6 and Feb. 8. Instead, the Americans said, they suspected that the Pakistani military had carried out at least one of the attacks, mostly likely using conventional warplanes. The Pakistani military did not respond officially to requests for comment before the Times article was published. But afterward, it issued a statement criticizing the American claims as “a distortion of the facts” that “seems to be aimed at diluting Pakistan’s stance on drone strikes.” In the statement, which was widely reported in the Pakistani media, the military spokesman denied that Pakistani security forces had carried out “any operation, including airstrikes, in the area on dates mentioned in the news report.” The strident denial creates an unusual situation in which officials from both countries are effectively accusing the other of carrying out the same attack, albeit with different weaponry. The C.I.A. has carried out about 330 attacks in the tribal belt, using Predator and Reaper drones, mostly over the past five years. The Pakistani military is not widely thought to have armed drone capability, but does have both American- and Chinese-designed warplanes capable of delivering airstrikes. The furor reflects the political sensitivity of the drone campaign, which is viewed by many Pakistanis as an expression of American hostility that infringes their sovereignty and undercuts human rights. In private, however, American officials say that a handful of Pakistani military and intelligence leaders have knowledge of the program, and that protocols exist for giving the Pakistanis advance notice of some strikes. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1. The Pakistani military denied the suggestions by American officials that Pakistan used the CIA drone program as cover for its own military operations in the tribal belt. 2. The New York Times article cited US government officials who claimed that the CIA did not carry out two reported strikes in North and South Waziristan on Feb. 6 and Feb. 8, instead suspecting the Pakistani military had carried out at least one of the attacks, likely using conventional warplanes. 3. The Pakistani military responded by criticizing the American claims as \\"a distortion of the facts\\" and denied carrying out any operations, including airstrikes, during the specified dates. 4. The situation has led to both countries effectively accusing each other of carrying out the same attack with different weaponry. 5. The CIA has carried out around 330 attacks in the tribal belt using Predator and Reaper drones, mainly over the past five years. 6. The drone campaign is politically sensitive in Pakistan, as it is perceived by many as a symbol of American hostility that violates their sovereignty and disregards human rights. 7. American officials privately admit that a few Pakistani military and intelligence leaders know about the drone program, and protocols exist for providing Pakistan advance notice of some strikes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Comet A and C are very faint, but Comet B is very bright. Comet A would enter the inner solar system on February 10, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 20, 2022. Comet B would enter the inner solar system on February 18, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 26, 2022. Comet C would never enter the inner solar system. and a hint : A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye.

Add punctuation: And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ","completion":"The sentence, when punctuated correctly, reads: \\"And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.\\" Here's a breakdown: Firstly, commas are used to separate two independent clauses within a sentence. In this case, \\"And Jacob begat Joseph\\" and \\"the husband of Mary\\" are two separate thoughts, so we use a comma to separate them. Secondly, \\"the husband of Mary\\" is a parenthetical phrase, this means it provides additional information about the subject, \\"Joseph\\", but isn't essential for the sentence to make sense or be complete, hence the need for a comma before and after this phrase. Thirdly, a comma is needed after \\"Mary\\" because the following phrase \\"of whom was born Jesus\\" provides additional information about Mary, but again it isn't needed for the sentence to be complete. Lastly, \\"who is called Christ\\" is a relative clause providing more information about \\"Jesus\\" so we use a final comma to separate this additional information. By adding the appropriate punctuation, the sentence becomes clearer and easier to read."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Many basic identification documents, such as state-issued driver's licenses, include the address of your primary residence. The address of the house on official identification is strong evidence that you live there. While having the address on your driver's license doesn't necessarily prove that you own the house, it can help to prove that you live there. Particularly if you were the victim of a natural disaster, you may have to prove both ownership and occupancy to be eligible for some types of aid. If you purchased appliances or other supplies used in the house, the sales agreement may include the address of the house. Any other legal document that includes your residence would also have the address of the house. Court documents require your address, in part to establish that the court has jurisdiction. Other legal forms or applications may also include your address. If you've lost your copies of these documents, you may be able to get new copies at the courthouse, or by contacting the store or other person involved in the transaction. Bills for water or electricity in your name are strong evidence that you live in the house. If you've lost copies of past utility bills, contact the utility company and ask for an account history or transaction record. Since virtually anyone can start utilities at a house, utility bills are never proof of ownership. However, they are solid evidence that you live in the house. If the utilities are not in your name, you may still be able to prove occupancy if you can demonstrate your relationship to the person who turned on the utilities. For example, if your mother turned on the utilities, that relationship would typically be sufficient. It's generally accepted that you live at an address if you gave that address out to businesses or organizations to communicate with you. Any sort of bills or statements with your name and address are sufficient. Mail provides better evidence if it is generated in the course of business, such as a credit card statement or a delivery notice. Anything that says \\"or current resident\\" (or similar) under your name won't work to establish occupancy. If all else fails, you can swear out an affidavit stating that you occupy the house in question. While you do sign the statement under penalty of perjury, this is considered the weakest form of proof and may not be accepted by some relief organizations or government agencies. Whenever possible, have other documents to support your declarative statement. Even if a document isn't enough to prove occupancy by itself, it may gain strength when combined with other documents.

A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land. Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs \\"Harmonica\\", pursues Frank. In the film's opening scene, Harmonica kills three men sent by Frank to kill him. In a roadhouse on the way to Sweetwater, he informs Cheyenne that the three gunfighters appeared to be posing as Cheyenne's men. Back at Sweetwater, construction materials are delivered to build a railroad station and a small town. Harmonica explains that Jill will lose Sweetwater unless the station is built by the time the track's construction crews reach that point, so Cheyenne puts his men to work building it. Frank turns against Morton, who wanted to make a deal with Jill; Morton's disability makes him unable to fight back. After raping Jill, Frank forces her to sell the property in an auction. He tries to buy the farm cheaply by intimidating the other bidders, but Harmonica arrives, holding Cheyenne at gunpoint, and makes a much higher bid based on his reward money for delivering Cheyenne to the authorities.

Chon, a former Navy SEAL, smuggled the seeds for the plants out of Afghanistan. Ben, a University of California, Berkeley graduate in business and botany, cultivates the marijuana. The seeds yield a particularly potent strain, which develops a wide customer base. Chon and Ben become wealthy, and Ben devotes time and money to charity work in Africa and Asia.

The trio receives a video from Mexican drug-cartel enforcer Miguel \\"Lado\\" Arroyo (Benicio del Toro) of severed heads and a chainsaw, and Arroyo demands a meeting at which the cartel offers a partnership. Although Chon and Ben offer to hand over their network and get out of the business, the cartel wants their expertise and insists on a partnership. Chon and Ben make plans with Ophelia to go to Indonesia for a year, not telling her that they are fleeing the cartel. They speak to corrupt DEA agent Dennis Cain (John Travolta), who urges them to join the cartel. Ophelia is kidnapped by Lado's gang; Chon and Ben are notified of the kidnapping by a video call from cartel leader Elena SÃ¡nchez (Salma Hayek), who threatens to harm Ophelia if they decline the partnership.

But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much. Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \\"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \\"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying \`You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise.

Given the question: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a great film, and often regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. I never much paid attention to how the film was lit, but on examination I don’t know what I think of the lighting. Maybe i’m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I’m very intrigued to properly analyse it. The first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious 😉 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows. It seems like there is another light, maybe coming from high up near the roof, lighting the right hand side of the frame, near the back of the hallway. Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background.

Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. not enough information B. a pretty good movie C. one of the greatest films of all time D. a fantastic documentary The answer is:","completion":"C. one of the greatest films of all time The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is often regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. The film, directed by Sergio Leone, is a highly influential spaghetti western and features a unique blend of stylistic storytelling, memorable characters, and vibrant, striking visuals. The film's iconic score, composed by Ennio Morricone, is also considered a major factor in the movie's lasting appeal and success. The lighting in the film is indeed a critical aspect of its overall artistic vision, as it contributes to the film's distinct atmosphere and helps to create depth and contrast in the various scenes. The way light and shadow are balanced within the frame can greatly impact the visual storytelling, and in the case of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, it is clear that the filmmakers paid close attention to this aspect. While some viewers might find the lighting techniques to be somewhat obvious upon closer examination, it is important to consider that this is likely a purposeful choice on the part of the filmmakers. The use of stark, high-contrast lighting is a stylistic choice that is often employed in classic western films, as it helps to accentuate the rugged environments and heightened emotions of the characters. The manipulation of light and shadow in this manner can also serve to heighten the sense of suspense and tension in key scenes. In the specific scene you describe, the strategic use of key light and backlighting, along with the use of cutters, helps to create a visually striking and memorable shot that effectively evokes the intended mood and atmosphere. Furthermore, the presence of multiple shadows on the characters is not necessarily a negative aspect, as it can also be viewed as a stylistic choice that adds depth and complexity to the visuals. The use of deliberately obvious lighting techniques can also be seen as a nod to the artistic influences of the film, which may include classic Hollywood westerns and Italian giallo cinema. In summary, while the lighting in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly could potentially be seen as obvious when analyzed, it is important to consider that this very likely results from conscious artistic choices made by the director and his team. The film's striking use of light and shadow serves to heighten the sense of atmosphere and intensity in each scene, contributing to the overall success and lasting impact of the movie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"In English, the statement translates to: \\"Concerning economies of scale in the case of assets less than one billion dollars and diseconomies for large banks.\\" This statement discusses the impact of economies of scale for financial institutions with relatively smaller assets (less than one billion dollars) and the diseconomies faced by larger banks. Economies of scale represent the cost advantages that an organization obtains due to expansion. As financial institutions grow in size and manage greater asset amounts, they benefit from efficiencies that come from spreading the costs of production over a larger quantity of output. In simple terms, as the size of an organization increases, the average cost per unit of production decreases. This often results in increased competitiveness and profitability. In the context of this statement, smaller financial institutions with assets less than one billion dollars could potentially enjoy economies of scale as they expand. These institutions may experience reductions in average costs as they grow, which can lead to improved efficiency and a stronger market position. On the other hand, diseconomies of scale occur when the average cost per unit increases as the firm grows. This can be due to a number of factors, such as increasing complexity, challenges in coordinating tasks, or inefficiencies in resource allocation. Large banks, as mentioned in the statement, may face these diseconomies as a result of their expansive scale. These banks may experience higher levels of inefficiency and be at a competitive disadvantage compared to smaller institutions that benefit from economies of scale. In summary, this statement highlights the potential benefits of economies of scale for financial institutions with assets less than one billion dollars and the potential challenges and disadvantages faced by larger banks in the form of diseconomies of scale. Overcoming these challenges and maintaining efficiency is crucial for the success and competitiveness of banks, regardless of their size."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's start by looking at our problem: 172 * m + 8584 = 38 * m - 170 * m - 16344 2. Now, let's add together the \\"m\\" parts on the right side of the equal sign: 38 * m - 170 * m = (38 - 170) * m = -132 * m Now our problem looks like this: 172 * m + 8584 = -132 * m - 16344 3. Next, let's get all the \\"m\\" parts on one side of the equal sign. To do that, we'll add 132 * m to both sides of the equation: 172 * m + 132 * m + 8584 = -132 * m + 132 * m - 16344 This will cancel out the \\"-132 * m\\" on the right side, so now it looks like this: 304 * m + 8584 = -16344 4. Now, we need to get \\"m\\" all by itself. To do that, we'll subtract 8584 from both sides of the equation: 304 * m + 8584 - 8584 = -16344 - 8584 Now our problem looks like this: 304 * m = -24828 5. Finally, we need to find what \\"m\\" is. To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 304: 304 * m / 304 = -24828 / 304 Now we have: m = -81.68421052631578 So, the answer is m ≈ -81.68 (rounded to two decimal places).

Plot title: Toy Story 2 Movie plot: Woody prepares to go to cowboy camp with Andy, but when he accidentally rips Woody's right arm, Woody is put on a shelf. The next day, Woody finds Wheezy, a penguin squeaky toy, has been shelved for months due to a broken squeaker. When Andy's mother puts Wheezy in a yard sale, Woody rescues him, only to be stolen by a greedy toy collector, who takes him to his apartment. Buzz Lightyear and all of Andy's toys identify the thief from a commercial as Al McWhiggin, the owner of a toy store called Al's Toy Barn. Buzz, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Rex all set out to rescue Woody. At Al's apartment, Woody learns that he is a valuable collectable based on a 1950s[7] TV show called Woody's Roundup and is set to be sold to a toy museum in Tokyo, Japan. While the toys from the showâJessie, Woody's horse Bullseye, and Stinky Peteâare excited about going, Woody intents to return home since he is still one of Andy's toys. Jessie is upset because the museum is only interested in the collection if Woody is in it, meaning they will return to storage if he is absent from the collection. When his arm is torn off completely, Woody attempts to retrieve it and escape but is foiled by someone mysteriously turning on Al's television set. The next morning, a cleaner repairs his arm, and Woody learns that Jessie once belong to a child named Emily, who eventually outgrew her and gave her away. Stinky Pete warns him that the same fate awaits him when Andy grows up, whereas he will last forever in the museum.

Trying to break a two-game losing streak, the Broncos went home for a Sunday Night fight with the Seattle Seahawks. This game would be notable for the NFL debut of QB Jay Cutler. In the first quarter, the Broncos struck first with kicker Jason Elam's 37-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, Denver's lead increased with Cutler's 7-yard TD pass to TE Stephen Alexander. However, the Seahawks got into game with DE Darryl Tapp's 25-yard interception return for a touchdown. After a scoreless third quarter, Seattle took control of the game with RB Shaun Alexander's 1-yard TD run, along with kicker Josh Brown's 44-yard and 23-yard field goal. The Broncos responded with a huge play, as Cutler completed a 71-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Marshall. However, Denver's defense couldn't hold off the Seahawks' response, as Brown nailed a 50-yard field goal, spoiling Cutler's debut. With their third-straight loss, the Broncos fell to 7-5.

Article: What are some of the steps a person can take to prevent his house from being broken in while he or she is away? One step is to make sure that the house has a _ look. Living room shades could be pulled down only half-away. Bedrooms that usually have the shades pulled down at night should be left down. Another is to make sure that all outside looks are the dead-belt type. Still another is to leave several low-watt lights burning and make sure that one is in the kitchen. Lights that turn on and off automatically are the best. Then, too, it is a good idea to leave a radio turned into a talking station. Any type of conversation makes a burglar think twice before trying to enter. Finally, while away on vacation, make sure that nothing collected in the front or back of the house. Make certain that the newspaper is stopped and that a trusted neighbor has been asked to pick up the posts. Question: What is the meaning of \\"live-in\\" in this passage? Options: A: Worn out. B: Lively and cheerful. C: Fed on. D: Presently taken by people. Answer:","completion":"D: Presently taken by people. Justification: In the context of the passage, the term 'live-in' corresponds to maintaining the appearance of the house as if people were currently living in it. This contributes to the overall aim of deterring burglars. The options 'Worn out', 'Lively and cheerful', and 'Fed on' do not seem to fit with the context provided in the passage. Hence, option D: 'Presently taken by people' is the best choice since it aligns with the central theme of the article, i.e., home security tips for when one is away. Options B and C are unrelated to the context of the passage, and although option A may seem slightly relevant, option D accurately conveys the sense of a house appearing inhabited."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Though she did not again win the Sulman, she was successful in having works hung in that competition on many occasions, including the 1946, 1947, 1948 and 1950 shows. Bellette continued to paint classical scenes, and around 1950 produced the work Chorus without Iphigenia. Purchased by the National Gallery of Australia in 1976, this oil painting shows five figures, \\"posed like statues in a tableau vivant, [and who] possess a kind of erotic energy\\". Anne Gray, the National Gallery's curator, interpreted the scene chosen by Bellette: Although nothing is happening in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death. In 1951, Bellette came second in the Commonwealth Jubilee Art Competition, behind the young Jeffrey Smart. The following year, she won a competitive exhibition sponsored by Metro Goldwyn Mayer, with Girl With Still Life.Although Haefliger never critiqued his wife's exhibitions, others occasionally stepped in to provide reviews in the Herald.

Apple shares fall after reports of cuts to iPhone 6S and 6S Plus production Apple is expected to cut production of its latest iPhone models by about 30% in the January-March quarter due to mounting inventories, it has been reported, rattling the nerves of investors in the US tech giant’s Asian suppliers. As inventories of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus have piled up since they were launched last September, production will be scaled back to let dealers go through their current stock, the business daily Nikkei reported. The report prompted a 2.5% drop in Apple shares, which have lost about a quarter of their value from record highs in April, reflecting worries over slowing shipments. Shares in the mainly Asian makers of iPhone screens and chips were also sharply lower on Wednesday. “This is an eye-opening production cut which speaks to the softer demand that Apple has seen with 6s out of the gates,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said. “[Wall] Street was bracing for a cut but the magnitude here is a bit more worrisome.” Among LCD panel makers, Japan Display Inc fell 4.7% while LG Display Co Ltd fell 3.4%. Hon Hai Precision Industry was down 1.8% to trade around T77.80, lows not seen in over four months. Hon Hai, which goes by the trade name of Foxconn, is a major assembler of Apple’s iPhones. TSMC, the world’s largest chipmaker and which has supplied some of the chips used in Apple iPhones, was off about 1.1% to T136.50, levels not seen since mid-November. Another Taiwanese assembler, Pegatron Corp, was off about 4% to trade around T69.00, lows not seen in a year. Other suppliers such as Japan’s Murata Manufacturing Co Ltd , Alps Electric Co Ltd and TDK Corp fell by 3% or 4%. Production is expected to return to normal in the April-June quarter, the Nikkei reported. However, Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said he was a bit skeptical about the production cut reports. “Apple has been gaining significant market share in pretty much every region, and I’m not seeing a global slowdown,” he said. Apple was not immediately available for comment. The parts suppliers cited in the Nikkei report were not available for comment outside their regular business hours. Tepid forecast by Apple suppliers such as Jabil Circuit , which manufactures casings for iPhones, and Dialog Semiconductor GmbH in December stoked fears that iPhone shipments could fall for the first time. Wall Street has also tempered its view on the high-flying stock in recent months. Since early December, about a third of the analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters have trimmed their estimates on Apple. For fiscal 2016, Apple is expected, on average, to grow revenue by under 4%, a far cry from the 28% revenue growth it achieved in the fiscal year that ended in September.

Here are possible answers to this question: - thank god - turn around - work hard - walk away - do a backflip I believe the correct choice is \\"turn around\\", here's why: A:","completion":"When a person starts to go in another direction and you yell at them, their most likely response would be to \\"turn around.\\" This is because the sudden noise or the sound of someone yelling usually garners an immediate reaction and draws their attention to the source of the sound. It's a natural human instinct to respond to unexpected loud noises by facing them, as it could signify danger or important information. Here's a brief explanation of the other options and why they are less likely in this situation: - Thank god: This response might not be typical in this scenario, as it doesn't directly relate to the action of moving in another direction or reacting to someone yelling. - Work hard: This option is also less likely, as it doesn't have any direct connection with the situation. Instead, this response might be relevant in a scenario where someone is given feedback or advice that requires additional effort. - Walk away: Although this could be a possibility, especially if the person feels threatened or uncomfortable by someone shouting at them, the more common reaction would still be to turn around first to identify the source of the yelling before choosing to walk away or not. - Do a backflip: This response is highly unlikely and situational, as most people cannot perform a backflip. Moreover, it does not align with the typical behavior one might exhibit when someone yells at them. So, based on the listed options, the most likely response when a person starts going in another direction and you yell at them would be to \\"turn around.\\" However, human behavior can be unpredictable and vary depending on the individual and context, so reactions might not always conform to these expectations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Somalis Ancient rock paintings in Somalia which date back to 5000 years have been found in the northern part of the country, depicting early life in the territory. The most famous of these is the Laas Geel complex, which contains some of the earliest known rock art on the African continent and features many elaborate pastoralist sketches of animal and human figures. In other places, such as the northern Dhambalin region, a depiction of a man on a horse is postulated as being one of the earliest known examples of a mounted huntsman. Q: How long ago were rock paintings found in Somalia created?","completion":"The rock paintings found in Somalia were created approximately 5000 years ago. These ancient artworks offer valuable insights into the early life and culture in the region. Some of the most famous examples can be found in the Laas Geel complex, renowned for containing some of the earliest known rock art on the African continent. These paintings display elaborate pastoralist sketches of animal and human figures, illustrating the connection between the ancient Somali people and their surroundings. In addition to the Laas Geel complex, there are other significant rock art discoveries throughout Somalia. For example, the northern Dhambalin region houses a depiction of a man on a horse, which is suggested to be one of the earliest known representations of a mounted huntsman. This finding highlights the possible early use of horses in hunting practices among the ancient Somali people. The exact timeline of the creation of these rock paintings may vary, but what remains evident is their historical importance and contribution to the understanding of the development of human civilization in the region. These 5000-year-old artworks serve as a testament to the rich cultural heritage of the Somali people, offering a unique window into their ancient way of life and their interactions with the environment.

Q:Information: - Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases which result in damage to the optic nerve and vision loss. The most common type is open-angle glaucoma with less common types including closed-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly over time and there is no pain. Side vision may begin to decrease followed by central vision resulting in blindness if not treated. Closed-angle glaucoma can present gradually or suddenly. The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, and nausea. Vision loss from glaucoma, once it has occurred, is permanent. Risk factors for glaucoma include increased pressure in the eye, a family history of the condition, migraines, high blood pressure, and obesity. For eye pressures a value of greater than is often used with higher pressures leading to a greater risk. However, some may have high eye pressure for years and never develop damage. Conversely, optic nerve damage may occur with normal pressure, known as normal-tension glaucoma. The mechanism of open-angle glaucoma is believed to be slow exit of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork while in closed-angle glaucoma the iris blocks the trabecular meshwork. Diagnosis is by a dilated eye examination. Often the optic nerve shows an abnormal amount of cupping. If treated early it is possible to slow or stop the progression of disease with medication, laser treatment, or surgery. The goal of these treatments is to decrease eye pressure. A number of different classes of glaucoma medication are available. Laser treatments may be effective in both open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma. A number of types of glaucoma surgeries may be used in people who do not respond sufficiently to other measures. Treatment of closed-angle glaucoma is a medical emergency. About 11 to 67 million people have glaucoma globally. The disease affects about 2 million people in the United States. It occurs more commonly among older people. Closed-angle glaucoma is more common in... - Visual impairment, also known as vision impairment or vision loss, is a decreased ability to see to a degree that causes problems not fixable by usual means, such as glasses. Some also include those who have a decreased ability to see because they do not have access to glasses or contact lenses. Visual impairment is often defined as a best corrected visual acuity of worse than either 20/40 or 20/60. The term blindness is used for complete or nearly complete vision loss. Visual impairment may cause people difficulties with normal daily activities such as driving, reading, socializing, and walking. The most common causes of visual impairment globally are uncorrected refractive errors (43%), cataracts (33%), and glaucoma (2%). Refractive errors include near sighted, far sighted, presbyopia, and astigmatism. Cataracts are the most common cause of blindness. Other disorders that may cause visual problems include age related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, corneal clouding, childhood blindness, and a number of infections. Visual impairment can also be caused by problems in the brain due to stroke, prematurity, or trauma among others. These cases are known as cortical visual impairment. Screening for vision problems in children may improve future vision and educational achievement. Screening adults without symptoms is of uncertain benefit. Diagnosis is by an eye exam. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 80% of visual impairment is either preventable or curable with treatment. This includes cataracts, the infections river blindness and trachoma, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, uncorrected refractive errors, and some cases of childhood blindness. Many people with significant visual impairment benefit from vision rehabilitation, changes in their environmental, and assistive devices. As of 2012 there were 285 million people who were visually impaired of which 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind. The majority of people with poor vision are in the developing world and are over... - A cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye leading to a decrease in vision . It can affect one or both eyes . Often it develops slowly . Symptoms may include faded colors , blurry vision , halos around light , trouble with bright lights , and trouble seeing at night . This may result in trouble driving , reading , or recognizing faces . Poor vision may also result in an increased risk of falling and depression . Cataracts are the cause of half of blindness and 33 % of visual impairment worldwide . Cataracts are most commonly due to aging , but may also occur due to trauma , radiation exposure , be present from birth , or occur following eye surgery for other problems . Risk factors include diabetes , smoking tobacco , prolonged exposure to sunlight , and alcohol . Either clumps of protein or yellow - brown pigment may be deposited in the lens reducing the transmission of light to the retina at the back of the eye . Diagnosis is by an eye examination . Prevention includes wearing sunglasses and not smoking . Early on the symptoms may be improved with eyeglasses . If this does not help , surgery to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens is the only effective treatment . Surgery is only needed if the cataracts are causing problems . Surgery generally results in an improved quality of life . Cataract surgery is not easily available in many countries , which is especially true for women , those living in rural areas , and those who can not read . About 20 million people globally are blind due to cataracts . It is the cause of about 5 % of blindness in the United States and nearly 60 % of blindness in parts of Africa and South America . Blindness from cataracts occurs in about 10 to 40 per 100,000 children in the developing world and 1 to 4 per 100,000 children in the developed world . Cataracts become more common with age . About half the people in the United States have had cataracts by the age of 80 . - Sunglasses or sun glasses are a form of protective eyewear designed primarily to prevent bright sunlight and high-energy visible light from damaging or discomforting the eyes. They can sometimes also function as a visual aid, as variously termed spectacles or glasses exist, featuring lenses that are colored, polarized or darkened. In the early 20th century, they were also known as sun cheaters (cheaters being an American slang term for glasses). - Infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to these organisms and the toxins they produce. Infectious disease, also known as transmissible disease or communicable disease, is illness resulting from an infection. Infections are caused by infectious agents including viruses, viroids, prions, bacteria, nematodes such as parasitic roundworms and pinworms, arthropods such as ticks, mites, fleas, and lice, fungi such as ringworm, and other macroparasites such as tapeworms and other helminths. - Trachoma, also called granular conjunctivitis, Egyptian ophthalmia, and blinding trachoma, is an infectious disease caused by bacterium \\"Chlamydia trachomatis\\". The infection causes a roughening of the inner surface of the eyelids. This roughening can lead to pain in the eyes, breakdown of the outer surface or cornea of the eyes, and eventual blindness. Untreated, repeated trachoma infections can result in a form of permanent blindness when the eyelids turn inward. The bacteria that cause the disease can be spread by both direct and indirect contact with an affected person's eyes or nose. Indirect contact includes through clothing or flies that have come into contact with an affected person's eyes or nose. Children spread the disease more often than adults. Poor sanitation, crowded living conditions, and not enough clean water and toilets also increase spread. Efforts to prevent the disease include improving access to clean water and decreasing the number of people infected by treatment with antibiotics. This may include treating, all at once, whole groups of people in whom the disease is known to be common. Washing by itself is not enough to prevent disease but may be useful with other measures. Treatment options include oral azithromycin and topical tetracycline. Azithromycin is preferred because it can be used as a single oral dose. After scarring of the eyelid has occurred, surgery may be required to correct the position of the eyelashes and prevent blindness. Globally, about 80 million people have an active infection. In some areas infections may be present in as many as 6090% of children and it more commonly affects women than men likely due to their closer contact with children. The disease is the cause of decreased vision in 2.2 million people of whom 1.2 million are completely blind. It commonly occurs in 53 countries of Africa, Asia, Central and South America with about 230 million people at risk. It results in US8 billion of economic losses a year. It belongs to a group of diseases known as... - Stroke is when poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control. The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, previous TIA, and atrial fibrillation. An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically with medical imaging such as a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan along with a physical exam. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms. Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, as well as possibly aspirin, statins, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic narrowing, and warfarin in those with atrial fibrillation. A stroke or TIA often requires emergency care. An ischemic stroke, if detected within three to four and half hours, may be treatable with a medication that can break down the clot. Aspirin should be used. Some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from... - In ophthalmology, high-energy visible light (HEV light) is high-frequency, high-energy light in the violet/blue band from 400 to 500 nm in the visible spectrum.

His accuser, in an online column for the Manhattan Times, recounted how Frieden offered a “kind of” apology and claimed that he became suicidal over the groping. While she initially kept her mouth closed to protect everyone involved, the woman wrote that a sudden change of heart followed when she later encountered Frieden. ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who helped contain the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, was arrested and charged with sexual abuse on Friday after being accused of groping a woman last year. A 55-year-old woman filed a complaint in July against Thomas Frieden, who once served as the city’s health commissioner, accusing him of grabbing her buttocks without permission last October at his Brooklyn apartment, said New York City Police Department spokeswoman Arlene Muniz. The woman’s name was not divulged. Frieden, 57, turned himself in to a Brooklyn police station, Muniz said, and he was arrested on misdemeanor charges of sexual abuse, forcible touching and harassment. He appeared in front of Judge Michael Yavinsky in New York City Criminal Court in Brooklyn on Friday afternoon and pleaded not guilty to the charges, his lawyer Laura Brevetti said. He was released on his own recognizance. Frieden is next due in court on Oct. 11, according to court staff. Brevetti, reached by telephone, declined further comment. A number of prominent men in business, entertainment, and the media in the United States have been accused of sexual misconduct in the past year in what has become known as the #MeToo movement. As head of the country’s main public health agency, Frieden played a prominent role in helping respond to the outbreaks of Ebola in West Africa in 2014 and Zika fever that began in Brazil in 2015. He appeared frequently on cable news channels to explain the CDC’s initiatives to staunch the crises. As New York City’s health commissioner from 2002 to 2009, he oversaw efforts to ban smoking in public places. In 2009, President Barack Obama named him to lead the CDC. He stepped down in 2017. Afterwards, Frieden became the president of Resolve to Save Lives, an effort by the non-profit health organization Vital Strategies to improve public health systems around the world. Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have funded the program. Slideshow (6 Images) The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the charity run by Facebook (FB.O) co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, said in a statement that the organization was “disturbed and saddened” by the charges. “At the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, we take any allegation of personal misconduct very seriously and are monitoring the situation closely,” the statement said. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also said it took allegations of sexual misconduct very seriously. ||||| Story highlights A law enforcement official told CNN that authorities filed three charges against Frieden He is accused of grabbing a woman without her consent at his home in October (CNN) Dr. Thomas Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was arrested Friday and charged with forcible touching, according to the New York Police Department. A law enforcement official told CNN that authorities filed three charges against Frieden stemming from an alleged incident in his home in Brooklyn Heights in October. Frieden, 57, who left the CDC in January 2017, was arraigned in Brooklyn Criminal Court to face one count of forcible touching, one count of sex abuse in the third degree and one count of harassment in the second degree, authorities said. He was released on his own recognizance. An order of protection was issued, and Frieden is to have no contact with the alleged victim, according to the district attorney's office. The law enforcement official said that allegedly, there was a dinner party at Frieden's home, and as things were wrapping up and people were leaving, Frieden reached over and grabbed the woman without her consent.

It gives you a chance to slow down, to relax and to appreciate yourself and your life in general. It helps you slow down enough to breathe deeply, to calm your thoughts, and to research the natural world filled with wonders. And yes, to love yourself more. Try to spend one day for a long travel on foot--far from the requirements of work and family. First, choose a date and mark it as your \\"relaxing day\\". Next, choose a place that you want to visit on foot. If you enjoy being out in nature, head to a wide and open place. Try to choose a place that's no more than 15 minutes from your home. You want to spend your time walking, not driving. Walk at an easy speed so you can walk longer and farther. If you normally walk two miles a day, go for four to six miles. Wear comfortable clothes. If it's warm, wear a hat to protect your face. And don't forget your sunglasses-- not only to protect your eyes but also to give you a sense of privacy while you walk. Before you go out, get up early so you can spend a few minutes relaxing. Relaxing is something few people spend in their spare time, but it leaves you feeling much lighter and less annoyed. Read something relaxing before you leave home, and it'll put you in a different condition of mind. And, of course, eat a healthy breakfast and drink plenty of water.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: Although a formal education is useful, plenty of artists never stepped foot in a classroom. Expand your drawing knowledge by looking for tips online or by getting manuals from the library or bookstore. Also, have fun spending time around other artists and their works. They’ve got a lot of tips and tricks to pass along. As a satirist, you can use exaggerations in your images to make an argument. Try drawing caricatures of people by expanding their notable features. These features might be large ears, cheap boots, or a jutting chin. Exaggerations show the subject’s personality. For example, drawing Napoleon shorter than he was in reality made him seem weaker and more cartoonish, even giving rise to the term “Napoleon complex.” Exaggeration shows that the work is satirical because it looks cartoonish, and that prevents the subject from claiming you’re attacking their reputation. Each cartoonist develops their own identifiable style through practice and hard work. The only way you can do this is by drawing and experimenting to find out what works best for you. Some styles look simpler and less detailed while others are more colorful. For example, Matt Groening’s characters on The Simpsons are identifiable by their large, simplified facial features. Garry Trudeau’s Doonesbury comics feature characters with longer faces with larger noses and detailed hair. Disney cartoon characters are very colorful and have large, soft eyes. Satire comes out in the captions or words you place around drawings. It is humor that relies on irony, sarcasm, and exaggeration to criticize others. Research tips on satirical writing and attend any classes on the subject you can find, then practice captioning your drawings. An example of a satirical comment is someone saying “I’m still undecided” after they’ve voted in an important election. It takes practice to get the right subject matter and tone, since you need to be sharp and intelligent instead of mean-spirited or obscene. Balancing irreverent humor with political correctness or cultural sensitivity is a tough but meaningful goal in satire. Immerse yourself in the styles of modern cartoonists such as Gerald Scarfe and Garry Trudeau. Study their approach and humor, then use the parts you like to make your own work better. Pay attention to the reasons why controversial cartoons failed to find a receptive audience. Feel free to go back in time and check out satirists from a previous time period, such as Thomas Nast, James Gillray, and William Hogarth. Satire can be found in publications including The Onion, Mad, and National Lampoon. Satire exists in all artistic fields. For example, try reading Kurt Vonnegut or Alexander Pope novels. Watch shows like Saturday Night Live or The Colbert Report. about political and social events. The world is always changing, and it’s your job to stay on top of it. Spend time everyday reading articles or watching the news. Current events are the fuel of cutting-edge satire. You can only strike a chord with an audience if you know the subject matter and how it impacts the lives of others. Where you get your information depends on your topic. If you plan on making political cartoons, news articles and programming are for you. Satire can focus on other topics though, such as popular culture or life struggles people face. All satirists run the risk of legal troubles. Make sure you know the laws in your district and country. Though they vary from place to place, they’ll always prevent you from viciously attacking someone. Don’t publish lies or claim you’re writing facts. Stick to satirizing well-known people such as political and religious leaders. Ridiculing your neighbors isn’t funny and will probably get you sued for defamation. For example, drawing Napoleon short isn’t to mock his height. It’s a metaphor for his political inadequacy. You will get backlash for your work, especially when you misjudge how the audience will react. Stay calm and disregard criticism that isn’t constructive. Satirists step near the line of what’s acceptable, and you’ll learn where that line is by paying attention to your mistakes. In some countries, you can get away with satirizing visible and powerful people or subjects. In others, criticizing anyone in authority comes with terrible repercussions. For example, the Danish publication Jyllands-Posten and the French publication Charlie Hebdo made cartoons about Islam. Violent protests broke out when these were printed. Summary:","completion":"Expanding one's drawing knowledge can be achieved through online resources, manuals, and spending time around other artists. Satire uses exaggerations in images, irony, sarcasm, and exaggeration in captions to criticize others. Developing an identifiable style is essential, as seen in the works of Matt Groening, Garry Trudeau, and Disney. Balancing irreverent humor with political correctness or cultural sensitivity is important in satire, and studying the works of various cartoonists can help refine one's own work. Staying well-informed about current events is crucial for effective satire. It's essential to be aware of legal boundaries and to focus on satirizing well-known figures rather than individuals in one's personal life. Finally, accepting and learning from criticism is a vital part of growing as a satirist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The U-boat succeeds in evading an RCAF patrol and moves north. While a raiding party of six Nazi sailors is put ashore in an attempt to obtain supplies, the U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay. The six attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the neutral United States. Led by Lieutenants Hirth (Eric Portman) and Kuhnecke (Raymond Lovell), the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalise a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick (Ley On), and a French-Canadian trapper (Laurence Olivier). Happening across a floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, the group steals the aircraft and begins flying across Canada. Outside Winnipeg they attempt to stir up the Hutterite community, believing them to be sympathetic to the German cause. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter (Anton Walbrook), the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel (Niall MacGinnis), who comes to the aid of Anna (Glynis Johns), a 16-year-old girl. Vogel, who would rather join the community and ply his trade of baker, is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his car, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee west. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed eleven civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering. Next, Kranz confronts writer Phillip Armstrong-Scott (Leslie Howard) in a cave and despite wounding him is knocked cold.

Befitting a lush, tropical island stranded in the middle of the ocean, Madeira’s origins are shrouded in mystery and fanciful legend. Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo.

It has been called an \\"architectural gem\\" and was featured by Dan Cruickshank in the BBC television series Around the World in 80 Treasures. From 1966 to 1993 the spire of St James' appeared on the Australian Australian ten-dollar note among other Greenway buildings. In 1973, the church appeared on a 50 cent postage stamp, one of four in a series illustrating Australian architecture issued to commemorate the opening of the Sydney Opera House. The Old Supreme Court building, also designed by Greenway with alternations by others, located next to the church is of the same date. Across the square is Greenway's \\"masterpiece\\", the UNESCO World Heritage listed-Hyde Park Barracks, designed to align with the church. Beside the barracks stands Sydney's oldest public building, part of the General Hospital built in 1811 and now known as the Mint Building. Separated from the Mint by the present-day Sydney Hospital is Parliament House, Sydney, of which the central section is a further part of the early hospital, and is now home to the New South Wales State Parliament.The church was constructed between 1820 and 1824 with later additions made in 1834 by John Verge who designed the vestries at the eastern end. Apart from these vestries, which retain the established style and proportions, the church externally remains \\"fine Georgian\\" much as Greenway conceived it. Relying on the \\"virtues of simplicity and proportion to achieve his end\\", Greenway maintained the classical tradition, unaffected by the Revivalist styles that were being promoted in London at the time he arrived in the colony. He planned the church to align with his earlier Hyde Park Barracks, constructed in 1817–19. The two buildings have similar proportions, pilasters and gables and together constitute an important example of town-planning.

Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts such as songwriter but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition. - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission.

It is frequently a freelance profession. - The middle class is a class of people in the middle of a social hierarchy. In Weberian socio-economic terms, the middle class is the broad group of people in contemporary society who fall socio-economically between the working class and upper class. The common measures of what constitutes middle class vary significantly among cultures. A sizable and healthy middle-class can be viewed as a characteristic of a healthy society. - A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program.

The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - About Elly (translit. \\"Dar bre-ye Elly\\") is a 2009 Iranian psychological drama film directed by Asghar Farhadi.

You are presented with the question \\"Which of the following can decrease stamina?\\" and the following answer choices: - toxins - smallpox - Dehydration - liver cancer - Weight - hypothyroidism - Cigarettes - uncontrolled Now knowing that smoking tobacco decreases stamina and tobacco is most commonly smoked in cigarettes, choose the best answer. Answer:","completion":"Cigarettes. Cigarettes can significantly decrease stamina, as they contain tobacco and other harmful substances that negatively affect various aspects of physical health, particularly the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Smoking cigarettes causes the narrowing of blood vessels, reducing the amount of oxygen transported to the muscles and other tissues during physical activities; this leads to fatigue and shortness of breath. Furthermore, tobacco smoke includes potentially toxic chemicals such as carbon monoxide, tar, nicotine, and various carcinogens. These substances can damage lung function, lower the overall oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, and contribute to the development of respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. As a result, individuals who smoke cigarettes may experience a notable decline in their stamina, endurance, and overall physical fitness. While other factors, such as toxins, smallpox, dehydration, liver cancer, weight, hypothyroidism, and uncontrolled health conditions, can also impact stamina, cigarettes are the most appropriate answer given the context of the question and the fact that smoking tobacco is known to cause a direct and substantial decrease in stamina. It is essential to recognize that smoking cessation can improve an individual's stamina and overall health. Quitting smoking reduces the risk of developing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, increases oxygen levels in the blood, and promotes better lung function. Consequently, individuals who quit smoking often experience a significant improvement in their stamina, physical fitness, and quality of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac).

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Available choices: [A]. no [B]. yes","completion":"[A]. no These two questions are not asking about the same information, although they are related. The first question is about the difference between data analytics and machine learning, while the second concerns the distinctions between data warehousing, data mining, and big data analytics. Let's delve into each topic to provide a better understanding of the concepts covered in both questions. 1. Difference between data analytics and machine learning Data analytics is the qualitative and quantitative process of analyzing raw data to extract useful insights, primarily concerning past events and current situations. By collecting, interpreting, and organizing data, businesses can make informed decisions and predict future trends. Data analytics employs various techniques, including data mining, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling. Machine learning, on the other hand, is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that automates the process of learning from data. In other words, it allows systems to identify patterns and make decisions without human intervention. Machine learning algorithms help identify correlations and make predictions based on available data sets. Unlike data analytics, it emphasizes continuous improvement, enabling models to adapt and improve their accuracy in response to new data inputs. While both data analytics and machine learning involve working with data, the key difference is the approach: data analytics uncovers insights by parsing and interpreting historical data, whereas machine learning automates the learning process to make predictions or take actions based on data inputs. 2. Difference between data warehousing, data mining, and big data analytics Data Warehousing: A data warehouse refers to a central repository where an organization's historical and current data is stored. This data is collected from various sources such as transactional databases, spreadsheets, or external third-party data sources. Data warehousing enables organizations to process large volumes of structured and semi-structured data efficiently and consistently. A data warehouse stores this information securely and allows for quick querying and reporting, thereby facilitating effective decision-making. Data Mining: Data mining is the process of extracting useful information, patterns, or trends from large data sets. By employing techniques such as clustering, classification, regression, and association rule learning, data mining identifies relationships between variables and unveils hidden patterns within complex data systems. This information can then be used to inform strategic decision-making, reveal customer behaviors, or identify new opportunities. Data mining is a part of data analytics and can be applied in various contexts, including finance, marketing, healthcare, and more. Big Data Analytics: Big data analytics involves processing and analyzing vast volumes of complex and unstructured data sets in real-time or near-real-time to reveal insights, trends, and patterns. Unlike traditional data analysis, big data analytics can handle data originating from multiple sources, such as social media, IoT devices, and customer interactions, which are challenging for traditional data tools to process. Big data analytics employs advanced analytics techniques, such as machine learning, text analytics, and predictive modeling, to enable organizations to quickly identify and act on new opportunities or threats in the rapidly evolving business landscape. In summary, these two questions inquire about different but related information. The first question differentiates between data analytics, focused on analyzing historical data, and machine learning, which automates the learning process to make predictions based on data inputs. The second question distinguishes between data warehousing, the centralized repository for data storage; data mining, the extraction of patterns and information from large data sets; and big data analytics, the real-time analysis of vast volumes of complex and unstructured data."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Goal: To make ground beef tacos, Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"You have mentioned a goal of making ground beef tacos but have not provided specific methods to choose from. However, I will present to you two common methods for preparing ground beef tacos and discuss which one may be more reasonable for accomplishing your goal. Method 1: Stovetop Preparation This method involves cooking ground beef in a skillet on the stovetop and seasoning it with taco spices. Here's the detailed cooking process: Ingredients: - 1 lb ground beef - 1 small onion, finely chopped - 2-3 cloves garlic, minced - 1 packet taco seasoning or homemade taco seasoning mix (a blend of chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, onion powder, salt, and pepper) - 1/2 cup water - Taco shells (hard or soft) - Desired taco toppings (lettuce, tomato, cheese, sour cream, salsa, etc.) Instructions: 1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 2. Add the ground beef to the skillet and use a spatula or wooden spoon to break it up into smaller pieces. 3. Cook the ground beef, stirring occasionally, until it's browned and cooked through. 4. Drain any excess grease. 5. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet with the cooked beef. 6. Cook for a few more minutes, until the onion is softened and translucent. 7. Stir in the taco seasoning mix and water. 8. Simmer the mixture for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally until the liquid is mostly absorbed and the flavors are well-blended. 9. Warm the taco shells in the oven or microwave, according to package instructions. 10. Spoon the prepared ground beef mixture into the taco shells and top with your choice of toppings. 11. Serve and enjoy. Method 2: Slow Cooker Preparation This method involves cooking the ground beef in a slow cooker, which takes longer but can be more convenient for some situations. Ingredients: - 1 lb ground beef - 1 small onion, finely chopped - 2-3 cloves garlic, minced - 1 packet taco seasoning or homemade taco seasoning mix - 1/2 cup water or beef broth - Taco shells (hard or soft) - Desired taco toppings (lettuce, tomato, cheese, sour cream, salsa, etc.) Instructions: 1. In a skillet, brown the ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat. 2. Drain any excess grease. 3. Transfer the cooked ground beef mixture to a slow cooker. 4. Add the taco seasoning mix and water or beef broth to the slow cooker. 5. Stir to ensure the seasoning mix is well-dispersed. 6. Cook the ground beef mixture on low for 4-6 hours or on high for 2-3 hours. 7. Warm the taco shells in the oven or microwave, according to package instructions. 8. Spoon the prepared ground beef mixture into the taco shells and top with your choice of toppings. 9. Serve and enjoy. Now, to determine which method is more reasonable for accomplishing your goal of making ground beef tacos, it depends on your personal preferences, the time you have available, and your cooking equipment. If you are short on time and prefer a quicker method, the stovetop preparation method is more reasonable, as it takes about 30 minutes from start to finish. This method also gives you more control over the cooking process, allowing you to adjust seasoning and monitor the consistency as needed. On the other hand, if you have extra time and want a more hands-off approach, the slow cooker method is more reasonable. This method takes longer to cook but requires less attention, freeing you to focus on other tasks or activities. The slow-cooking process also allows for deeper flavors to develop, making the resulting taco filling potentially more flavorful. Ultimately, both methods can be reasonable for making delicious ground beef tacos, and the choice really depends on your personal preferences, constraints, and priorities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - South Dakota is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a significant portion of the population and historically dominated the entire territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city. - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity. - The Sioux are groups of Native American tribes and First Nations peoples in North America. The term can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation's many language dialects. The Sioux comprise three major divisions based on language divisions: the Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota. - The Territory of Dakota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 2, 1861, until November 2, 1889, when the final extent of the reduced territory was split and admitted to the Union as the states of North and South Dakota. - The South Dakota Department of Transportation is a state government organization in charge of maintaining public roadways of the U.S. state of South Dakota . South Dakota has 82,447 miles of highways , roads and streets ; 5,905 bridges . The SD DOT is responsible for 7,830 miles of the roadway system .

There were many problems with a world map, however, for the rapid increase in information coming from exploration of the Earth meant that maps rapidly became outdated. Make this lower case","completion":"there were many problems with a world map, however, for the rapid increase in information coming from exploration of the earth meant that maps rapidly became outdated. The transformation of world maps through time can be attributed to the continuous exploration and discovery of new territories, which rendered older maps obsolete. This process of cartographic evolution was a result of various factors, including the advancements in navigation and surveying technologies, the increase in global trade and travel, and the thirst for knowledge regarding the unknown territories. In the early stages of map making, the data collected was often limited and, at times, faulty. This was primarily due to the lack of reliable tools and methods for navigation, measurement, and representation of the earth's surface. Mariners and explorers of the time relied heavily on lunar and stellar observations, rudimentary compasses, and the accounts of other travelers. As a result, early maps were relatively inaccurate, often depicting exaggerated landmasses, misplaced locations, and an overabundance of speculative details. In some instances, these early maps even displayed a distorted view of the world, such as the notorious misconceptions that the earth was flat or that it was made up of multiple concentric spheres. However, with the dawn of the Age of Exploration in the 15th century, the demand for accurate and updated maps grew rapidly. New territories, such as the Americas and parts of Asia, were being discovered, and existing knowledge of the world needed to be expanded and refined. This period saw a flurry of advancements in navigation and surveying techniques, which played a significant role in the improvement of cartography. Instruments like the astrolabe, quadrant, and later the sextant were developed to aid in celestial navigation, while trigonometry and plane table surveying techniques were introduced as a means of creating more accurate land surveys. Furthermore, the invention of the printing press allowed for the wider dissemination of maps and travel accounts, contributing to a better understanding and documentation of the earth's surface. During this era of exploration, prominent cartographers, like Gerardus Mercator, Abraham Ortelius, and Martin Waldseemüller, among others, emerged to create some of the most influential maps in history. Unfortunately, despite their significant contributions to the field, these maps still contained elements of distortion and inaccuracies due to the challenges posed by the vast and complex nature of the earth's surface. As time went on, the scientific measurement and mapping methods continued to improve, and cartographers were able to create increasingly accurate maps. The development of nautical charts, geodetic surveying techniques, and even satellite imaging have allowed for more precise representation of the earth's geography. Yet, it should be noted that even with these advancements, no map can be perfect, as the three-dimensional nature of the earth's surface will always present challenges when attempting to represent it on a two-dimensional plane. In conclusion, the rapid increase in information coming from the exploration of the earth has historically posed a challenge for the creation and updating of world maps. Early maps were plagued by limited data and incorrect assumptions, but with the advent of new technologies and methodologies, cartography experienced significant progress. As mapping techniques continue to evolve, cartographers strive to overcome the inherent challenges of representing our ever-changing world on a map."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bagge , a student of Werner Heisenberg for his doctorate and Habilitation , was engaged in German Atomic Energy research and the German nuclear energy project during the Second World War . He worked as an Assistant at the Kaiser - Wilhelm - Institut für Physik in Berlin . Bagge , who became associated professor at the University of Hamburg in 1948 , was in particular involved in the usage of nuclear power for trading vessels , and he was one of the founders of the Society for the Usage of Nuclear Energy in Ship - Building and Seafare . The first German nuclear vessel , the \`\` NS Otto Hahn '' , was launched in 1962 . A research reactor was installed in Geesthacht near Hamburg at about the same time which has over the years formed into a center for materials research with neutrons . - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Quantum mechanics (QM; also known as quantum physics or quantum theory), including quantum field theory, is a branch of physics which is the fundamental theory of nature at small scales and low energies of atoms and subatomic particles. Classical physics, the physics existing before quantum mechanics, derives from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid only at large (macroscopic) scales. Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum and other quantities are often restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), and there are limits to the precision with which quantities can be known (Uncertainty principle). - In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, nuclear fission is either a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts (lighter nuclei). The fission process often produces free neutrons and gamma photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay. - Habilitation is a post-doctoral qualification or academic degree at some European and Central Asian, North African, and Latin American universities. It is conferred for a habilitation thesis based on independent scholarship, which was reviewed by and successfully defended before an academic committee in a process similar to that of a doctoral dissertation. In some countries, a habilitation degree is a required formal qualification to independently teach and examine a designated subject at the university level. - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic. Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built. - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Werner Karl Heisenberg (5 December 1901 1 February 1976) was a German theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics. He published his work in 1925 in a breakthrough paper. In the subsequent series of papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, during the same year, this matrix formulation of quantum mechanics was substantially elaborated. In 1927 he published his uncertainty principle, upon which he built his philosophy and for which he is best known. Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 \\"for the creation of quantum mechanics\\". - Coburg is a town located on the Itz river in the Upper Franconia region of Bavaria, Germany. Long part of one of the Thuringian states of the Wettin line, it joined Bavaria by popular vote only in 1920. Until the revolution of 1918, it was one of the capitals of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Through successful dynastic policies, the ruling princely family married into several of the royal families of Europe, most notably in the person of Prince Albert, who married Queen Victoria in 1840. As a result of these close links with the royal houses of Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Coburg was frequently visited by the crowned heads of Europe and their families. - The European Plain or Great European Plain is a plain in Europe and is a major feature of one of four major topographical units of Europe - the \\"Central and Interior Lowlands\\". It is the largest mountain-free landform in Europe, although a number of highlands are identified within it. - Max Born (11 December 1882 5 January 1970) was a German physicist and mathematician who was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics. He also made contributions to solid-state physics and optics and supervised the work of a number of notable physicists in the 1920s and 1930s. Born won the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics for his \\"fundamental research in Quantum Mechanics, especially in the statistical interpretation of the wave function\\". - A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English. - Ernst Pascual Jordan (18 October 1902 31 July 1980) was a theoretical and mathematical physicist who made significant contributions to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. He contributed much to the mathematical form of matrix mechanics, and developed canonical anticommutation relations for fermions. While the Jordan algebra is employed for and is still used in studying the mathematical and conceptual foundations of quantum theory, it has found other mathematical applications. - Neustadt bei Coburg (also written \\"Neustadt b. Coburg\\") is a town in the district of Coburg in northern Bavaria, Germany. It is situated 15 km northeast of Coburg, as its name indicates. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. - Otto Hahn, , (8 March 1879 28 July 1968) was a German chemist and pioneer in the fields of radioactivity and radiochemistry. He was exclusively awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1944 for the discovery and the radiochemical proof of nuclear fission. He is referred to as the father of nuclear chemistry. - The Nobel Prize in Chemistry is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields of chemistry. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895, awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.

Lecter, his younger sister, Mischa, and his parents escape to the family's hunting lodge in the woods to elude the advancing German troops. Back at Lecter Castle, six Lithuanian militiamen (Grutas, Dortlich, Grentz, Kolnas, Milko, and Pot Watcher) request to join the Waffen-SS. The SS commander orders them to kill the Lecters' Jewish cook who was left behind, to which they gleefully comply.A Soviet tank stops at the Lecters' lodge looking for water, and forces everyone out of the house. However, the tank is then spotted by a German Stuka bomber, which sparks a firefight. The bomber is shot down by the tank, but subsequently crashes into it and the ensuing explosion kills everyone, except Hannibal and Mischa. The SS militiamen then loot Lecter Castle. Seeing their wounded SS commander, Grutas shoots him and takes his Iron Cross. However, the impending Russian advance forces them to hide out in the woods where they locate the Lecter lodge. The SS militiamen storm and take over the lodge. Finding no other food in the bitterly cold Baltic winter, the men look menacingly at Hannibal and Mischa.The movie then cuts to a scene eight years later inside Lecter Castle, which has been turned into a Soviet-run orphanage. A bully harasses Lecter, who has been rendered mute by his experiences, about not singing the orphanage anthem. The bully attacks his head, but Lecter blocks his swing with a fork, impaling the bully's hand. That evening, Lecter experiences a flashback about Mischa screaming in his sleep, which angers the youth commander, who locks him in a dungeon. However, Lecter escapes from the castle orphanage to Paris to live with his widowed aunt, the Lady Murasaki-Lecter.

Please answer a question about the following article about Religion in ancient Rome: Funeral and commemorative rites varied according to wealth, status and religious context. In Cicero's time, the better-off sacrificed a sow at the funeral pyre before cremation. The dead consumed their portion in the flames of the pyre, Ceres her portion through the flame of her altar, and the family at the site of the cremation. For the less well-off, inhumation with \\"a libation of wine, incense, and fruit or crops was sufficient\\". Ceres functioned as an intermediary between the realms of the living and the dead: the deceased had not yet fully passed to the world of the dead and could share a last meal with the living. The ashes (or body) were entombed or buried. On the eighth day of mourning, the family offered further sacrifice, this time on the ground; the shade of the departed was assumed to have passed entirely into the underworld. They had become one of the di Manes, who were collectively celebrated and appeased at the Parentalia, a multi-day festival of remembrance in February. What goddess was an intermediary between the dead and the living?","completion":"The goddess who served as an intermediary between the dead and the living in ancient Rome was Ceres. Ceres was a Roman goddess of agriculture, grain, and the love a mother bears for her child. Her role as an intermediary was significant as it functioned during funeral and commemorative rites when the deceased had not yet fully transitioned to the world of the dead. She allowed the dead to share a last meal with the living as a way to facilitate their passage and maintain a connection between the two realms. Additionally, the rites and offerings dedicated to Ceres played an important part in the overall process of mourning and honoring the deceased in ancient Roman society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: yeah they've they've got plenty of problems without the Iraqi problem Sentence 2: The Iraqi problem is one of their many problems. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Yes, the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true. Both sentences convey the same general idea, which is that the entity being discussed is facing various problems, and the Iraqi problem is just one among the several issues they are dealing with. The first sentence – \\"yeah they've they've got plenty of problems without the Iraqi problem\\" – uses informal language, and it implies that even without considering the Iraqi problem, the entity already has numerous problems. The repetition of \\"they've\\" could either be a typo or emphasis on the point that the subject has multiple issues. The second sentence – \\"The Iraqi problem is one of their many problems.\\" – conveys the same notion in a concise and formal manner. It explicitly states that the Iraqi problem is part of the various problems the entity is facing. In summary, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence is also true because both sentences signify that the entity is struggling with multiple problems, including the Iraqi issue. By acknowledging this common underlying theme, it can be concluded that the truth of the first sentence supports the truth of the second sentence as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Topics have included the interesting mathematics of the one-seventh area triangle, a classic geometric puzzle. In his weekly commentary, Randi often gives examples of what he considers the nonsense that he deals with every day. Beginning in 2003, the JREF annually hosted The Amaz!ng Meeting, a gathering of scientists, skeptics, and atheists. The last meeting was in 2015, coinciding with Randi's retirement from the JREF. James Randi began a series of conferences known as \\"The Amazing Meeting\\" - TAM - which quickly became the largest gathering of skeptics in the world, drawing audiences from Asia, Europe, South America, and the UK. It also attracted large percentage of younger folks. Randi has been regularly featured on many podcasts, including The Skeptics Society's official podcast Skepticality and the Center for Inquiry's official podcast Point of Inquiry. From September 2006 onwards, he has occasionally contributed to The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast with a column titled \\"Randi Speaks.\\" In addition, The Amazing Show is a podcast in which Randi shares various anecdotes in an interview format. In 2014 Part2Filmworks released An Honest Liar, a feature film documentary, written by Tyler Measom and Greg O'Toole, and directed and produced by Measom and Justin Weinstein. The film, which was funded through Kickstarter, focuses on Randi's life, his investigations, and his relationship with longtime partner Jose Alvarez, a.k.a. Deyvi Pena. The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, at Toronto's Hot Docs film festival, and at the June 2014 AFI Docs Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland and Washington, D.C., where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature. It has since been captioned in ten different languages, shown worldwide, and was also positively received by critics.

Lured by his music, a young Czech flower seller talks to him about his songs. Delighted to learn that he repairs hoovers, she insists that he fix her broken hoover. The next day she returns with her broken hoover and tells him that she is also a musician. At a music store where the Czech woman regularly plays piano, the man teaches her one of his songs (\\"Falling Slowly\\"); they sing and play together.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Use information from the paragraph to answer the question. Question: Rupert is evaluating the impact of factories on the natural resources of developing nations. If Nation X added 100 new factories, it will decrease or increase demands on their natural resources? Paragraph : Developing nations will also increase demands on natural resources as they build more factories. The answer to this question is:","completion":"If Nation X added 100 new factories, it will increase demands on their natural resources. According to the given information in the paragraph, as developing nations build more factories, it leads to increased demands on natural resources. This is because factories typically require raw materials, energy, and water to produce goods. When a developing nation adds new factories, these facilities inevitably consume resources that are derived from the environment, such as minerals, fossil fuels, timber, water, and other essential inputs. In the context of Nation X, as it adds 100 new factories, it means that these facilities would need natural resources to be used for the manufacturing processes and to operate their machines. As production increases, it puts a higher demand on these natural resources which leads to larger extraction, consumption, and depletion of the country's resources. Another aspect to consider is the indirect impact of increased industrialization on natural resources. When a country expands its industrial sector, this often drives urbanization and increases demand for housing, infrastructure, and transportation. All these translate to a higher consumption of natural resources, such as the land being converted for infrastructure development and the resources required for the construction of housing and transportation networks. In summary, Nation X's addition of 100 new factories will definitely increase its demands on natural resources, directly through the manufacturing processes as well as indirectly through other socio-economic changes driven by industrialization. It is crucial for Nation X to manage its natural resources efficiently and promote sustainable practices in its industrial sector to minimize the negative consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Background Paragraph: Boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 13 should get 9 mg of iron every day. Girls between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 15 mg of iron every day. Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day. Pregnant women need the most iron—27 mg daily. Good sources of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters. Red meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes. Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortification. Some good sources of iron are listed below ( Table below ). Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body can absorb. Story: David works as a nutritionist with the public health department.

Here are possible answers to this question: - england - living less expensively - city - town - inside car I believe the correct choice is \\"england\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"England, and here is a detailed explanation why: The question specifically mentions two key elements: row houses and red phone booths. Let's analyze both of these elements to understand why England is the most suitable answer among the given options. 1. Row Houses: Row houses, also known as terraced houses or townhouses, are a type of residential architecture that originated in Europe. These houses are designed to be built in rows, with each house sharing a sidewall with the neighboring house on either side. This style of housing gained popularity in the United Kingdom during the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly in the Georgian and Victorian eras. Many British cities, such as London, Manchester, Birmingham, and Liverpool, are known for their iconic rows of terraces. 2. Red Phone Booths: The classic red phone booth, also known as the red telephone box or kiosk, is an iconic symbol of the United Kingdom. These booths, designed by the architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, were first introduced in the 1920s and have since become an internationally recognized symbol of British culture. The color red was chosen to make them easily visible, and for many years, they were the primary means of public communication in the UK before the widespread adoption of mobile phones. Now, let's evaluate the other options presented: - Living less expensively: This is not a location; it is a description of a lifestyle or living situation. This answer does not provide any information about where the row houses and red phone booths might be located. - City: This option is too vague and non-specific. Many cities around the world feature row houses and might even have red phone booths, but the combination of these two elements and their historical significance points to a specific country – England. - Town: Similar to the option \\"city,\\" this choice is non-specific and does not give a precise location or connection between the row houses and red phone booths. - Inside car: This option is not relevant, as it suggests a situation rather than a location. Row houses and red phone booths cannot be found inside a car. In conclusion, the most accurate and logical answer to the question among the given options is England. The presence of both row houses and red phone booths, as well as their cultural and historical significance, strongly suggests a typical British setting. Furthermore, none of the other suggested options provide a specific or logical location to associate with the combination of row houses and red phone booths."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: FERGUSON • The Aug. 9 fatal shooting here that sparked three months of protests and calls for change from around the world happened in less than 90 seconds, interviews and an analysis of police and EMS records shows. The records, obtained by the Post-Dispatch via Missouri's Sunshine Law, provide the best timeline yet for the events surrounding the shooting of Michael Brown Jr., 18. Also released were police station surveillance videos that provide the most recent images of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, who has stayed out of the public eye since the shooting. Wilson left the police station for the hospital two hours after the shooting, accompanied by other officers and his union lawyer. They returned about two and one-half hours later. Shortly after Brown's death, a grand jury began hearing evidence to determine whether Wilson should be indicted in the killing. The grand jury's decision is expected any day. A FATAL ENCOUNTER At 11:29 a.m. on Aug. 9, a dispatcher asked Wilson to help other officers search for a man who had reportedly threatened to kill a woman. At 11:47 a.m., Wilson said he would respond to a call for a 2-month-old with breathing problems. Wilson drove his police SUV from the west side of West Florissant Avenue to Glenark Drive, east of Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court, where the fatal encounter would soon occur. At 11:53 a.m., a dispatcher reported a \\"stealing in progress\\" at the Ferguson Market. The 911 operator was still talking to the caller in the background. In a second broadcast, 19 seconds later, the dispatcher says the suspect is a black male in a white T-shirt running toward QuikTrip, and had stolen a box of Swisher cigars. About four minutes later, there's more detail: the suspect is wearing a red Cardinals hat, a white T-shirt, yellow socks and khaki shorts, and is accompanied by another man. At noon, Wilson reports that he’s back in service from the sick-baby call. He then asks the officers searching for the thieves -- units 25 and 22 -- if they need him. Seven seconds later, an unidentified officer broadcasts that the suspects had disappeared. At 12:02 p.m., Wilson says, \\"21. Put me on Canfield with two. And send me another car.\\" His call triggered at least two officers to head his way, including one who said he was close to Wilson. Sources have told the Post-Dispatch that Wilson has told authorities that before the radio call he had stopped to tell Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, 22, to quit walking down the middle of the street. They kept walking, and he then realized that Brown matched the description of the suspect in the stealing call. Wilson then asked dispatch for backup and backed up his SUV next to Brown and Johnson. Wilson said Brown attacked him, sources said, and that they struggled over the officer's gun before Wilson was able to fire twice, hitting Brown once. Brown ran away. Wilson has told authorities that he called, \\"Shots fired, send all cars,\\" on his radio, but during the struggle his radio had been jarred and the channel changed. The Post-Dispatch reviewed radio calls made during that period on all St. Louis County police channels, the fire channel used by Ferguson and other channels publicly archived online and could not locate the call. At least one channel on the Ferguson police radio is \\"receive-only,\\" meaning that the call may not have been broadcast. After the call, Wilson pursued Brown on foot. According to sources, Wilson has said that Brown turned and charged, and that Wilson then fired once, paused when Brown appeared to flinch and fired again, multiple times. He said he then radioed for an ambulance. Witnesses' accounts vary widely. Most saw only part of the encounter. Johnson said that Wilson grabbed Brown by the throat, and, later, tried to pull him into the SUV. Johnson also said that Wilson's fatal shot came after Brown turned around and was getting to the ground with his hands in the air. Other witnesses have said that Brown stood still or walked, staggered, stumbled or fell toward Wilson before he was killed. Some witnesses said Brown's hands were up; others said they were not. HELP ARRIVES Forty-one seconds after Wilson's call, unit 25 reported that he was about to arrive at Wilson's location, saying he was \\"going out on Canfield\\" and accompanied by the sound of his racing engine. Forty-eight seconds later, another officer had arrived or was about to, announcing, \\"22's out.\\" At 12:03 p.m., an eyewitness to the shooting Tweeted: I JUST SAW SOMEONE DIE OMFG — TheeavageEP (@TheePharoah) August 9, 2014 If his smartphone's clock, or Twitter's, agreed with the clock on dispatch records, Brown was killed less than 61 seconds after the dispatcher acknowledged that Wilson had stopped two men. At one minute, 13 seconds after Wilson's call, an unidentified officer has arrived and asks, “Where's the other one?” referring to Johnson. Eleven seconds later, there's a brief burst of static and an unintelligible bit of speech. A dispatcher responds, “10-4 on Canfield.” Twenty seconds later, unit 25 called in to ask if the dispatcher could send a supervisor to Canfield and Copper Creek Court. At 12:05, a dispatcher called for an ambulance, erroneously reporting that someone had been hit with a Taser. By 12:07 p.m., a woman wailed in the background as an officer called over his radio: “Get us several more units over here. There's gonna be a problem.” BROWN FAMILY LAWYERS RESPOND Lawyers for the Brown family issued a statement Saturday saying that from the beginning the Ferguson Police Department has sought to “vilify the victim and put the shooter on a pedestal.” The statement also said, “the audio clearly demonstrates that the initial interaction with the officer and Brown had nothing to do with the incident at the convenience store.” Christine Byers of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report. ||||| A call for backup that a police officer claims to have made seconds before he killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, reportedly cannot be found in police recordings. The officer blames the problem on his radio. Darren Wilson has told investigators he radioed “shots fired, send all cars” after a struggle at his SUV with Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, following the officer’s stop of Brown and a friend for jaywalking in Ferguson on 9 August, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Yet a set of recordings released to the newspaper by police did not include the call. Wilson is reported to have stated that “during the struggle his radio had been jarred and the channel changed”, meaning it was not broadcast to his fellow officers in the St Louis suburb. “At least one channel on the Ferguson police radio is ‘receive-only,’ meaning that the call may not have been broadcast,” the newspaper said in its report on Friday evening. Wilson shot Brown repeatedly soon after allegedly making the request for assistance. A series of witnesses told media in the days after the shooting that Brown had surrendered to the officer after fleeing and may have had his hands up. Wilson is said to have told investigators the 18-year-old had in fact turned and charged towards him. The killing of Brown, who was African American, by a white officer led to nights of protests. Police clashed repeatedly with demonstrators, firing teargas and rubber bullets and making dozens of arrests. Ferguson is anxiously awaiting the decision of a grand jury on whether Wilson should face criminal charges for the shooting. There was confusion over Wilson’s future on Saturday, after Ferguson’s police chief, Thomas Jackson, initially told a local TV news channel the officer would be able to return to duty if not indicted by the grand jury, before later saying the department had not decided whether to allow this. Ferguson’s mayor, James Knowles, also appeared to dismiss Jackson’s earlier claim. “Nothing has been decided as to the fate of Wilson,” the mayor told the Wall Street Journal, adding that “it is an oversimplification of the issue to say he immediately returns”. The new details of the day Brown died emerged in material released by police in response to an open records request. The recordings, the first of Wilson’s voice to be made public, trace the 28-year-old officer’s movements from a separate incident to his encounter with Brown. After a robbery of cigars from a grocery store was reported over the radio, Wilson – identified as car 21 – asked colleagues dealing with it if he could assist around noon. “Twenty-one to 25 and 22 – do you guys need me?” he asked. About two minutes later, he said over his radio: “Put me on Canfield with two. And send me another car.” Canfield Drive is the street on which Brown was shot dead. While it is unclear from the recording, Wilson has reportedly testified that at this point he asked Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, to get out of the road, and then realised that Brown matched the description given for one of the grocery store robbers. During the next minute a rapper going by the name Thee Pharoah tweeted that he had witnessed the killing. In remarks to the media in August, Ferguson’s police chief, Thomas Jackson, initially suggested Wilson had stopped Brown for this reason. Within hours he said the stop was not linked to the robbery, then finally said Wilson had made the connection during the encounter. Police have said Brown assaulted Wilson at the car and injured his face. The alleged injuries to Wilson’s face were not clearly visible in video footage also released by the police on Friday. Wilson leaving the police station The recordings show Wilson leaving the Ferguson police department headquarters for a hospital about two hours after the shooting and returning two and a half hours later. Wilson was accompanied by a lawyer and other officers. ||||| The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public. ||||| Summary:","completion":"An analysis of police records and interviews reveal that the fatal shooting of Michael Brown Jr. in Ferguson, which sparked protests and calls for change, occurred in less than 90 seconds.

Bill poured the entire bag of Spinach into the mixing bowl until the","completion":"mountain of green leaves threatened to overflow onto the kitchen counter. With a half-smile playing on his lips, Bill couldn't help but chuckle at the thought of his friends’ reactions when they tasted his culinary creation. He had decided to host a dinner for his closest friends – a decision that originally stemmed from a friendly wager on who could prepare the most delectable dish using unexpected ingredients. Bill had chosen spinach as his secret weapon, determined to dispel the old myth that healthy food couldn't possibly taste good. He had contemplated various ways to incorporate the leafy vegetable into a delicious and unique meal, and finally decided upon a dish that was sure to leave a lasting impression: Spinach and Artichoke Stuffed Chicken Breasts. He began by preheating the oven to 375°F, knowing that maintaining a consistent temperature was crucial to the success of the dish. He then turned his attention back to the mixing bowl, where the spinach awaited its transformation. Gently, Bill began to massage the leaves with a drizzle of olive oil, ensuring that each one glistened with a oily sheen. He then seasoned the spinach with salt, pepper, and a medley of dried Italian herbs before setting it aside. Next, Bill prepared the artichokes. He had carefully selected a jar of marinated artichoke hearts, which would provide a delightful tang to the dish while also cutting down on preparation time. He drained the jar and chopped the artichokes into smaller pieces, their fragrance mingling with the scent of herbs wafting from the seasoned spinach. With a skilled hand, he mixed the artichokes into the spinach, along with a generous helping of grated parmesan cheese and a dollop of cream cheese. The chicken breasts, meanwhile, had been sitting patiently, as if anticipating their moment in the culinary spotlight. Bill had already taken the time to trim any excess fat from the meat and had sliced a deep, horizontal pocket into each breast, careful not to cut all the way through. He knew that this step was essential for both housing and containing the savory filling. Now came the moment of truth. Bill delicately filled each pocket with the spinach and artichoke mixture, taking care to stuff the chicken breasts as full as possible without compromising their structural integrity. Once satisfied with the generously-stuffed chicken, Bill wrapped each breast with two slices of prosciutto – a thin, Italian-style ham that would not only serve to lock in moisture but also lend a salty, savory depth to the meal. With the chicken now ready for cooking, he carefully transferred the stuffed breasts onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, allowing for easy clean-up and a perfectly cooked final product. He slid the baking sheet into the preheated oven, set the timer for 25 minutes, and allowed the enticing aroma of the cooking meat to fill his kitchen. As Bill cleaned up his workspace and prepared for his guests' arrival, he couldn't help but grow increasingly excited for the culinary experience that awaited them. He had put great thought and effort into crafting this extraordinary meal, and he knew that their taste buds were in for one unforgettable adventure. Once the buzzer signaled the completion of the baking time, Bill removed the chicken from the oven and allowed it to rest for a few minutes, enabling the juices to redistribute evenly throughout the meat. He then plated each spinach and artichoke-stuffed chicken breast, accompanied by a light salad and a glass of crisp white wine. As his friends took their first flavorful bites, the satisfaction on their faces told him everything he needed to know – his unique and delicious dish was a resounding success, proving that healthy ingredients could indeed create a truly mouthwatering meal."},{"prompt":"Q: Kai ate their fill during the only meal of the day.

Movie title: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Movie plot: The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher. He decides that creating the perfect smell will prove his worth.Upon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of the naive Laura Richis (Rachel...

Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts.

You are given two options and you need to select the one that best connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. Indicate your answer by 'Option 1' if the first option is correct, otherwise 'Option 2'. The incorrect option will change the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences is no longer consistent with the story.

Option 1: She was stuck in the mall with her friends. Option 2: She was already outside the restroom. Output:","completion":"Option 1 Reasoning: The first sentence shows Julia's need of going to a bathroom. In Option 1, she is stuck in a mall with friends which indicates that she will try to find the closest washroom herself as suggested in sentence 3. Option 2 contradicts sentence 3 which says that she 'tried' to find the closest one, meaning she wasn't there yet. In Option 2 when she is mentioned as being outside the restroom already, there is no need to 'try to find' the restroom. Also, Option 1 perfectly set the stage for the incident of accidently entering the men's restroom, since malls generally have both restrooms in close vicinity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

People who are amusic are born without the ability to enjoy musical notes. Amusic people often cannot tell the differences between two songs. As a result, songs sound like noise to an amusic. Many amuics compare the sound of music to pieces of metal hitting each other. Life can be hard for amusics. In fact, most people cannot begin to understand what it feels like to be an amusic. Just going to a restaurant or a shopping center can be uncomfortable or even painful. That is why many amusics have to stay away from places where there is music. However, this can result in social loneliness. \\"I used to hate parties,\\" says Margaret, a seventy-year-old woman who only recently discovered that she was amusic. By studying people like Margaret, scientists are finally learning how to identify this unusual condition. Scientists say that the brains of amusics are different from those of people who can enjoy music. The difference is complex , and it is not connected with poor hearing. Amusics can understand other non-musical sounds well. They also have no problems understanding common speech. Scientists compare amusics to people who just can't see certain colors.

There are gifts to give this month for Christmas, Hanukkah and the African American celebration of Kwanzaa. The traditional shopping season began last Friday, after Thanksgiving Day. Personal spending represents two-thirds of the economy, so holiday sales are especially important. Reports on November results have just come out. Wal-Mart is the biggest seller in the world. The company had expected growth of two to four percent in November, fueled by sales on \\"Black Friday.\\" The day after Thanksgiving is called that. Storekeepers used to record profits in black ink and losses in red ink. A day in the black means a return to profit. The National Retail Federation estimated in September that holiday sales would increase four and one-half percent this year. Holiday sales increased five percent last year, after poor sales the year before. The business group estimated that Americans will spend 220,000 million dollars this season. It says they spent just over 10 percent of that last weekend. Also, it says more Americans for the first time this season plan to use a debit card than a credit card for purchases. A debit card, also called a check card, is linked to the money that a person has in a bank. In other words, users must have the money before they can spend it. About thirty - five percent of shoppers said they would mainly use debit cards, compared to 30 percent for credit cards.

Arab history in the United States goes back to the late 1800's when large numbers of Arab immigrants first began making their journey to a land known simply as\\"Amreeka\\". Historians generally describe Arab immigration to America in two waves.The first wave took place between 1860 and 1924.The first wave consisted of Lebanese and Syrian,and some Egyptian immigrants.These new immigrants,who were mostly Christian,came to America in search of better opportunities.Even the doomed Titanic,which set sail for America in 1912,had close to a hundred Arab passengers aboard.The majority of Arab-Americans today are descendents of the first wave of immigrants;they are the third or more generation Americans. The second wave of immigrants followed after World War II,caused by political unrest in the Middle East.This second wave of immigrants consists of mainly Arab Muslims and continues to this day. Arab-Americans make up 3 million of the population in the United States,according to demographers.And quite different from popular belief,64 percent of them are American-born.Eighty-two percent of Arab-Americans are US citizens.

Possible answers: + yes. + it is not possible to tell. + no.","completion":"Yes, the hypothesis \\"The last Ice Age ended approximately 10,000 years ago\\" can be considered true based on the given premise. The premise states that ancient glaciers eroded many valleys and created space for lakes as they melted at the end of the last Ice Age, which occurred around 8,000 B.C. If we convert 8,000 B.C. to years ago, we get: 2022 A.D. (the current year) - 8000 B.C. = 10,022 years So, the statement that the last Ice Age ended approximately 10,000 years ago is accurate, as it is close to the actual number of years ago (10,022 years) when the last Ice Age ended, according to the given premise. This hypothesis generally aligns with most scientific estimates as well, which place the end of the last Ice Age between 11,700 and 12,000 years ago. During the last Ice Age, large ice sheets and glaciers covered the northern continents, including North America, Europe, and Asia. As temperatures began to rise and the Earth's climate changed, these colossal ice masses started melting, resulting in the formation of massive lakes and causing sea levels to rise significantly. The retreat of the glaciers not only shaped the valleys and created space for lakes but also significantly transformed the Earth's landscape. As the ice melted, it deposited layers of sediment, forming fertile soil in some areas and less fertile soil in others. The melting of ice also affected the Earth's weather patterns and distribution of plant and animal species. As newly exposed land became available for colonization, many species that were adapted to the cold conditions began to decline, while others flourished in the rapidly changing environment. The end of the last Ice Age has left a lasting impact on the structure and composition of the Earth's ecosystems, as well as on human civilizations. It shaped the way ancient societies developed, influenced agriculture, and drove the dispersal of human populations across the planet. Given this understanding and the fact that the premise aligns with the hypothesis \\"The last Ice Age ended approximately 10,000 years ago,\\" it can be considered true. However, it is important to note that scientific understanding and knowledge about the Ice Ages are continually evolving based on new discoveries and research, so this approximation may be subject to change in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Leaflet called Death Penalty? said: 'The death sentence is the only way this immoral crime can be erased from corrupting society' Article:","completion":"Title: The First Prosecution for Inciting Hatred on the Grounds of Sexual Orientation: A Closer Look at the Case of Kabir Ahmed and His Co-defendants In a landmark legal scenario, five individuals, including 28-year-old Kabir Ahmed, are facing the first prosecution for inciting hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation since the introduction of this law. Ahmed has openly voiced his belief, stating that he couldn't \\"just stand by and watch somebody commit a sin.\\" This case has shone a spotlight on the pressing issue of discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community and the role the law plays in curbing such instances of hatred. The leaflet that has brought this case to the forefront of public attention is titled \\"Death Penalty?\\" and contains the controversial statement: \\"The death sentence is the only way this immoral crime can be erased from corrupting society.\\" This bold claim has raised widespread concerns about the propagation of violent sentiments towards a section of the society based solely on sexual orientation. Kabir Ahmed, along with his four co-defendants (whose identities have not been revealed), are being tried under the offense of incitement to hatred, a crime that only came into existence recently. This law is a direct reflection of the efforts taken by the authorities to address the growing problem of discrimination and hostility against marginalized communities. One may wonder what could have possibly driven Kabir Ahmed and his associates to such an extreme stance. Preliminary investigations into the case have revealed that the accused individuals have a deep and abiding belief in the teachings of their faith that have shaped their negative and hostile reactions towards those who identify as LGBTQ+. However, it is vital to recognize that such interpretations of religious teachings often stem from a distorted understanding of sacred texts and do not represent the essence of the faith itself. It is crucial to address the dangers that such beliefs pose, as they can easily escalate and lead to tragedy. In a world where hate crimes, queerphobia, and violent attacks towards the LGBTQ+ community are not unheard of, it is our collective responsibility as a society to reject and condemn such ideologies that fan the flames of hatred. At the same time, it is equally important to educate ourselves and work on promoting a more compassionate understanding of diverse communities. Education and advocacy are key to fostering empathy and breaking down the barriers of prejudice. By raising awareness and initiating thoughtful conversations, we can begin to tackle the root cause of hate and discrimination and build solidarity in our diverse societies. The trial of Kabir Ahmed and his co-defendants will serve as an eye-opener for many, demonstrating that the law does not condone any form of incitement to hatred or discrimination based on sexual orientation. As the case unfolds, it will also reveal how deep-rooted prejudices can be challenged and confronted in the court of law. As we observe this landmark case, we must not forget the larger struggle to end prejudice and intolerance based on sexual orientation. The lessons learned from this case must be used as a resource for promoting understanding, fostering dialogue, and ensuring that every member of our society is treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation.

Alright — if there was any doubt in your mind that a 4'9\\" gymnast from the United States owned the 2016 Olympics, you can safely put that doubt to rest. Simone Biles, in all of her petite, air-defying athleticism, was the ultimate breakout star of the 2016 Olympics. And on Sunday night, during the closing ceremony, it seemed every top athlete from around the world wanted a slice — er, a selfie — with Biles. Biles had the honor of carrying the American flag during the closing ceremony on Sunday. But as luck (and fame) would have it, other top athletes from various countries kept stopping Biles during the ceremony to take the perfect selfie with her. As one NBC commentator put it, \\"they're trying to get a Biles smile.\\" Biles may have made history when she won five medals at her very first Olympics (four gold and one bronze), but she was still a little nervous about carrying a flag that was about twice her size. \\"I'm afraid the flag is going to be too heavy for me,\\" Biles told reporters during a press conference ahead of the closing ceremony. \\"Because Michael Phelps is so much taller and he seemed to carry it so easily and I'm very short so I'm a little worried about that part but I think they'll guide me through it.\\" RELATED: Simone Biles Olympic profile So many people were trying to take a selfie with Biles that it was almost as if a \\"conga line,\\" was forming around her. Twitter users also didn't hesitate to praise Biles on not just her sportsmanship, but also her innate ability to keep on smiling. This has turned out to be one heck of an Olympics for the 19-year-old.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"To determine if these two sentences are paraphrases of each other, let's compare their structures, vocabulary, and meanings step-by-step. Step 1: Compare the structures: The structures of both sentences are very similar. They both follow the pattern of presenting the name \\"Lars Elinderson,\\" mentioning his birth year \\"1949,\\" and describing his political affiliation as a moderate politician of the Swedish party. Step 2: Compare the vocabulary: Both sentences use mostly the same words, including the name \\"Lars Elinderson,\\" the year \\"1949,\\" the term \\"politician,\\" and the mention of the \\"Swedish Party.\\" The only difference is the capitalization of the word \\"Moderate\\" in the second sentence, which gives a sense that it's referring to a specific party rather than just a political stance. Step 3: Compare the meanings: The meanings of the two sentences are generally the same. They both convey the information that Lars Elinderson is a moderate politician and a member of the Swedish Party, and he was born in 1949. The only slight difference in meaning is that the first sentence seems to describe his political stance as \\"moderate\\" while the second sentence could be read as referring to his membership in the \\"Moderate Party.\\" Conclusion: Based on the comparisons in structure, vocabulary, and meaning, it can be concluded that these two sentences are paraphrases of each other with only a slight difference in the capitalization of the word \\"Moderate.\\" However, the core information conveyed by both sentences is essentially the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Question: When people travel they usually don't have to worry about medical emergencies because hospitals are where? Options: - people are - military base - every state - major city - urban area Explain why a human would choose \\"every state\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","completion":"A human would choose \\"every state\\" as the answer to this question because it implies that hospitals are available in all states, regardless of whether these states are urban or rural, large or small. This reassuring fact means that travelers can generally expect to find medical care facilities no matter where they are within a country. There are a few reasons for this answer being the most accurate. Firstly, as states are the administrative and geographic units of a country, having hospitals distributed in every state is a more comprehensive way of ensuring that people have access to medical facilities while traveling. States are large enough to encompass both urban and rural areas, and thus, hospitals will be accessible to more people regardless of where they are coming from or heading to. Secondly, both \\"major city\\" and \\"urban area\\" options are limiting, as they provide coverage only to people who travel to or within cities. Many people who travel might visit rural or remote areas and still require access to medical facilities. Answering \\"every state\\" covers the need for healthcare services in both urban and non-urban regions. Lastly, \\"people are\\" and \\"military base\\" answers are too broad and an inaccurate representation of the locations where hospitals are found. Not all places where people are present will have hospitals, and military bases are specific facilities that are not meant to cater to the general public's medical needs. In summary, a human would choose \\"every state\\" as the answer because it acknowledges the fact that hospitals are distributed across the entire country, allowing travelers to have access to medical care no matter where their journey takes them. This answer covers various travel scenarios and provides confidence to those concerned about medical emergencies while traveling."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Serbian-Montenegrin authorities have given an order for members of the armed forces to detain any war crimes suspects who are currently present within the military institution. In addition, they have instructed the military personnel to share any and all information they have regarding individuals who are being sought by the United Nations tribunal. This order likely aims to promote accountability and transparency in addressing past war crimes and ensuring that those responsible face the appropriate legal consequences. The involvement of the UN court implies that many of the suspected war criminals may have participated in atrocities during times of conflict or have been involved in gross human rights violations. Sharing the information about these individuals with the international tribunal can significantly help in their pursuit of justice and closure for the victims and their families. Such collaboration between national and international authorities is essential because it assists in upholding the rule of law and preventing impunity. By taking responsibility for their roles in war crimes, military personnel will be deterred from repeating such actions in the future. Collaboration also portrays the Serbian-Montenegrin authorities' commitment to international humanitarian standards and their willingness to work cooperatively with global organizations to address complex issues. Moreover, this order could serve as an example for other countries grappling with similar war crimes issues. It demonstrates that asserting control over military forces and fully cooperating with international legal bodies is a viable approach to addressing these concerns and ensuring justice prevails. In conclusion, Serbian-Montenegrin authorities' order to armed force members to detain war crimes suspects within the army and provide all the information they have on individuals sought after by the UN court is an essential step towards accountability and transparency.

Embracing Spain's second city, Barcelona, Catalonia is one of the country's richest regions. Separatist sentiment has built into a mass movement over the past five years, promoting a distinct Catalan identity which goes back centuries.

Answer:","completion":"It is essential to understand that everyone's journey through life and relationships is unique. Based on the context provided, Remy has decided to stop dating after three years, likely due to personal reasons or past experiences that were not fulfilling or enjoyable. Therefore, it is crucial to consider that the future outcome for Remy could vary significantly, depending on preferences, circumstances, and potential life changes. However, it is possible to outline likely scenarios that could occur in Remy's life after this decision. 1. Personal growth and self-discovery: Following the decision to stop dating, Remy may take time to explore his feelings, values, and aspirations independently. This period of self-reflection could lead to better understanding of personal strengths, weaknesses, and boundaries. Focusing on oneself can allow Remy to determine the qualities he wants in a potential partner or the type of relationship he desires, should he decide to pursue romantic connections in the future. 2. Developing deep friendships: While Remy may not be interested in dating, it does not exclude the possibility of forming strong bonds with others. He could focus on nurturing relationships with friends, family, and acquaintances who share similar interests, values, or goals. By fostering these connections, Remy could find a strong sense of belonging, community, and support without the pressures of a romantic relationship. 3. Exploring alternative forms of relationships: Remy's decision to stop dating could lead him to explore nontraditional relationship dynamics. This could include platonic, non-monogamous, or long-distance relationships that better align with his preferences and expectations. Engaging in such arrangements can offer Remy an opportunity to experience deep connections with others without the traditional constraints of dating or committing to a single partner. 4. Embracing solitude and independence: It is possible that Remy may find satisfaction and contentment in leading a solitary life without pursuing romance or intimate partnerships. Being self-reliant and independent can provide him with a sense of stability and confidence in decision-making, personal growth, and pursuing goals. 5. Future changes in perspective: Remy's decision to stop dating may not be permanent. As he grows older or encounters new life experiences, his opinions and choices may change, leading to a renewed interest in pursuing romantic relationships. It is important to acknowledge that people change over time, and Remy could potentially decide to reenter the dating world when he feels more comfortable or better equipped for it. In conclusion, Remy's future after deciding to stop dating depends on various factors, including personal growth, relationships, and life experiences. While his decision to discontinue dating may initially seem limiting, it can open doors for self-discovery, deep friendships, exploration of alternative relationships, and personal independence. Additionally, Remy's outlook might change with time, and he may choose to reevaluate his decision based on internal growth and new experiences. Ultimately, it is up to Remy to invest in creating a fulfilling life that aligns with his values and priorities while remaining open to change and growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On a flight home from a business trip, the Narrator meets and interacts with soap salesman Tyler Durden. The Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion.

If \\"A baby is laying in a hospital bassinet.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A toddler is standing\\"?","completion":"No, it does not logically follow that \\"A toddler is standing\\" if \\"A baby is laying in a hospital bassinet\\". The two statements are unrelated, and one does not provide any information to deduce the status of the other. To understand why these statements don't logically follow, let's break down each statement and examine the logical connections between them. Statement 1: \\"A baby is laying in a hospital bassinet.\\" This statement provides information about the whereabouts and current position of a baby, presumably a newborn or infant. It tells us that this particular baby is in a horizontal resting position in a hospital bassinet, which is a small bed designed for newborns and infants. The statement does not provide any information about the age of the baby, or the existence or actions of any other individuals, such as toddlers. Statement 2: \\"A toddler is standing.\\" This statement refers to the physical position of a toddler, who is a young child usually between one to three years old. It tells us that this toddler is in an upright position, supporting themselves on their legs and feet. Logical Connection: Upon analyzing the two statements, there is no logical connection between them. The first statement focuses on a baby's position in a hospital bassinet, while the second statement discusses a toddler's position. The two subjects – a baby and a toddler – are different and separate individuals. Furthermore, babies and toddlers are at different stages of development, with the latter being older, more mobile, and capable of standing and walking. Therefore, there is no logical connection or causality between the two events described in the statements. One does not influence or determine the other. It is entirely possible that a baby could be laying in a hospital bassinet while simultaneously, a toddler may be standing, sitting, or engaging in any other action. On the other hand, both events could also occur separately, and the situation of one does not provide any information about the other's state. In conclusion, the statement \\"A baby is laying in a hospital bassinet\\" does not logically follow that \\"A toddler is standing,\\" as the two statements are about different individuals and are not connected logically or causally. The situation of the baby in the hospital bassinet provides no information or inference on the state of a toddler, and vice versa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here we go! 6404 - 455 = 5949 Now, our equation looks like this: -5949 = 582*q + 1617 Next, we are going to subtract 1617 from both sides of the equation. Let's do that! -5949 - 1617 = -7566 Now the equation is: -7566 = 582*q Now, we need to find what number \\"q\\" should be. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 582. -7566 ÷ 582 = -13 So, the answer is: q = -13 And there you go! The solution to the problem is q = -13.

Electricity, like clean water, is a resource that's often taken for granted. But last summer, when blackouts struck much of the northeastern US, Ontario and Rome, consumers on two continents were given a painful reminder of just how easily broken electricity supplies can be. The massive disorder stranded commuters, stopped freezers, shut down businesses and refocused attention on where most of the planet's power comes from:oil-and-gas-fired generators and nuclear plants, These sources not only pollute the environment but also make many consumers feel unacceptable health risks. Companies are trying to offer an alternative, clean energy from renewable resources that's plentiful and portable. Lifton's Medis Technologies, as well as companies like Hydrogenics and Nanosys, is tapping into fuel cells and dolor panels to give people power whenever and wherever they want it, free from dependence on local grids . The search for alternative energy is nothing new, but the current trend of innovators is focusing on the goal of making clean and sustainable power a mainstream commodity. For example, the fuel cell, which produces electricity from the chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen, has been around for about 150 years, though its commercial development did not begin until the 1960s and then only as part of NASA spacecraft. Today this technology is coming down to Earth in places like Tokyo; in nine European cities, from Stockholm to Porto, each operating three hydrogen-fuel-cell buses; and in Iceland, which is trying to create the first fuel free hydrogen economy by 2030. When hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine, the reaction produces heat and water. Fuel cells use this reaction to generate electricity. With the cell phone and gadget market in mind, Medis has developed a fuel cell with cheap components that produces little heat and effortlessly reduces waste water without turning to energy consuming pumps. Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage? A) Lifton's Medis Technologies is tapping into fuel cells and solar panels. B) The fuel cell has been around for about 150 years. C) The fuel cell's commercial development did not begin until the 1960s.

On the other hand, in place B, the organism didn't have beneficial mutation. and a hint : Some mutations have a positive effect on the organism in which they occur. They are called beneficial mutations . They lead to new versions of proteins that help organisms adapt to changes in their environment. Beneficial mutations are essential for evolution to occur. They increase an organism’s changes of surviving or reproducing, so they are likely to become more common over time. There are several well-known examples of beneficial mutations. Here are just two: Please answer this question : In which place the organism would less likely develop proteins to adapt in their habitat, place A or place B? The answer is:","completion":"The organism would be less likely to develop proteins to adapt in their habitat in place B. This is because, as mentioned in the given information, place A had beneficial mutations due to the radiation exposure, leading to the development of new versions of proteins that help the organisms adapt to changes in their environment. On the other hand, in place B, the organism did not have beneficial mutations, which suggests that it would be less likely to develop the necessary proteins to adapt to its habitat. Therefore, the organism's chances of surviving or reproducing might be lower in place B compared to place A, where the beneficial mutations aid in the organism's adaptation and evolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who wanted to start the tour right away? ? In a letter to his friend and landlord Johann Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), a prominent Salzburg merchant, written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \\"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently...

Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world. - The Habsburg Monarchy or Empire, occasionally also styled as the Danubian Monarchy (\\"Donaumonarchie\\"), is an unofficial appellation among historians for the countries and provinces that were ruled by the between 1521 and 1780 and then by the successor branch of Habsburg-Lorraine until 1918. The Monarchy was a composite state composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire, united only in the person of the monarch. The dynastic capital was Vienna, except from 1583 to 1611, when it was moved to Prague. From 1804 to 1867 the Habsburg Monarchy was formally unified as the Austrian Empire, and from 1867 to 1918 as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. - The Austrian Empire (modern spelling \\"\\") was an empire in Central Europe created out of the realms of the Habsburgs by proclamation in 1804. It was a multinational empire and one of Europe's great powers. Geographically it was the second largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire (621,538 square kilometres [239,977 sq mi]). It was also the third most populous after Russia and France, as well as the largest and strongest country in the German Confederation. Proclaimed in response to the First French Empire, it overlapped with the Holy Roman Empire until the latter's dissolution in 1806. The \\"Ausgleich\\" of 1867 elevated Hungary's status. It became a separate entity from the Empire entirely, joining with it in the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. - Solomon Judah Löb HaKohen Rapoport ( June 1 , 1786 -- October 15 , 1867 ) ( Hebrew : ) , was a Galician rabbi and Jewish scholar . He was born in Lemberg , Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria . He married in 1810 Franziska Freide Heller , the daughter of the well - known Aryeh Leib Heller , and was instrumental in publishing the work Avnei Miluim of his father in law . He wrote both the index , sources and numerous comments . After various experiences in business , Rapoport became rabbi of Tarnopol ( 1837 ) and of Prague ( 1840 ) . He was one of the founders of the new Wissenschaft des Judentums movement . His chief work was the first part of an ( unfinished ) encyclopaedia ( Erekh Millin , 1852 ) . Equally notable were his biographies of Saadia Gaon , Nathan ( author of the Arukh ) , Hai Gaon , Eleazar Kalir and others . Thrown upon his own resources about 1817 , Rapoport became the collector of the meat - tax on farmers . He had already given evidence of marked critical ability , though his writings previously published were of a light character -- poems and translations . His critical talent , however , soon revealed itself . In 1824 he wrote an article for Bikkure ha - ' Ittim on the independent Jewish tribes of Arabia and Abyssinia . Though this article gained him some recognition , a more permanent impression was made by his work on Saadia Gaon and his times ( published in the same journal in 1829 ) , the first of a series of biographical works on the medieval Jewish sages . Because of this work he received recognition in the scholarly world and gained many enthusiastic friends , especially S. D. Luzzatto . After the fashion in rabbinic circles , Rapoport was known by an acronym \`\` Shir '' , formed by the initial letters of his Hebrew name Shelomo Yehuda Rapoport ( Shir literally means \`\` song '' in Hebrew ) - The First Partition of Poland took place in 1772 as the first of three partitions that ended the existence of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by 1795. Growth in the Russian Empire's power, threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire, was the primary motive behind this first partition. Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighborsAustria, Russia and Prussiaso as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries. With Poland unable to effectively defend itself, and with foreign troops already inside the country, the Polish parliament (Sejm) ratified the partition in 1773 during the Partition Sejm convened by the three powers. - The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, formally the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation, of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned some and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million. The union was formalized by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a de-facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King \\"jure uxoris\\" Wadysaw II Jagieo of Poland. The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the nation's size and the Commonwealth disappeared as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. - The Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, also known as Galicia or Austrian Poland, became a crownland of the Habsburg Monarchy as a result of the First Partition of Poland in 1772, when it became a Kingdom under Habsburg rule. From 1804 to 1918 it was a crownland of the Austrian Empire. After the reforms of 1867, it became an ethnic Pole-administered autonomous unit under the Austrian crown. The country was carved from the entire south-western part of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. Among the many ceremonial titles of the princes of Hungary was \\"ruler of Galicia and Lodomeria\\". - Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south. Bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine and Belarus to the east; and the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) and Lithuania to the north.

Picture book: A picture book is an excellent choice to see a sloth that is not real. Picture books often contain illustrations and photographs of various animals, including sloths. Since these images are a representation of the animal rather than the actual animal, the sloth seen in a picture book is, in essence, not real. This is a more accessible and tangible option to see a sloth that is not real compared to other choices. C. Another place: This option is quite vague and could refer to any physical or imaginary location. While it is possible that one might find a representation of a sloth that is not real in another place, it does not provide a specific or reliable source to see such a sloth. D. Universe: The term universe encompasses everything that exists, including the space we live in. The possibility of witnessing a sloth that is not real in the universe is minimal and vague. The vastness of the universe and the lack of specificity in this option make it a weak choice. E. Zoo: A zoo represents a location where animals are kept and exhibited to the public. It contains real living animals, including sloths.

Hypothesis: Sylvestris Ochagavia lived in southern Chile.","completion":"Based on the provided context, we can deduce several pieces of information but not entirely draw the hypothesis that Sylvestris Ochagavia lived in southern Chile. From the context, we can establish the following facts: 1. Ochagavia is a genus of the botanical family Bromeliaceae, subfamily Bromelioideae. 2. The genus is named after Sylvestris Ochagavia, who was the Chilean minister of education. 3. The genus is endemic to southern and central Chile, including the Juan Fernández Islands. 4. There are four accepted species within this genus. The context suggests a connection between Sylvestris Ochagavia and the Ochagavia genus; that is, the genus was named in his honor due to his position as the Chilean minister of education. This tells us that Sylvestris Ochagavia was influential and held a significant position in Chile. This information, however, does not directly indicate his place of residence within Chile. Moreover, although the Ochagavia genus is endemic to southern and central Chile, it does not necessarily imply that Sylvestris Ochagavia lived in that area. The plants could have been named in his honor for various reasons unrelated to his place of residence, such as his contributions to the country's education, botanical research, or conservation efforts, among other possibilities. In conclusion, while the context offers essential information about the Ochagavia genus and its connection to Sylvestris Ochagavia, it does not provide direct evidence to conclude that Sylvestris Ochagavia lived in southern Chile. For that hypothesis to be accurate, more information and supporting evidence about his life, work, and the reasons behind the naming of the genus would be required."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Which comic theorist began studying comics after the start of the 21st century?\\" is in \\"European comics studies began with Töpffer's theories of his own work in the 1840s, which emphasized panel transitions and the visual–verbal combination. No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed \\"closure\\". In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or \\"multiframe\\", to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées\\" (or \\"drawn literatures\\"). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound \\"grammars\\" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.\\".

Plot: The movie starts in the bustling city of New York where our protagonist, Jake Donovan - a genius, yet somewhat carefree, coder working in a booming tech startup, is busy writing code lines for their really ambitious AR (Augmented Reality) project. Jake's life is casual, involving coding during the day, frequent banter with his colleagues, countless cups of coffee, and occasional card games in the evening at their favorite hangout place. One day, Jake's company is tasked by renowned and wealthy tech entrepreneur, Maxwell Sinclair, with a highly secretive project - The Final Table. The project stirs up interest within the tech community due to Sinclair's cryptic remarks about how it will change the world. Jake's team is chosen for the project, with a shattering deadline just 11 days away at 5 A.M. The plot thickens as Jake and his team dive headfirst into the project. Each day, they encounter hurdles and experience moments of breakthrough. The movie encapsulates these chaotic days and sleepless nights fabulously while also building up each character, their motivations, and internal dynamics. Throughout this, Jake becomes particularly engrossed in the complexity of The Final Table. Despite initial delays and disagreements, they all push their limits to meet the deadline, only to discover that The Final Table is much more than a tech project. It's a doomsday device capable of inducing realistic mass hallucinations through AR, effectively capable of controlling the entire human population. Sinclair's corporative image is just a façade to his nefarious plan of global dominance. The team is shocked and utterly torn between their morally correct path and their professional obligation towards the project. The climax builds up as Jake decides not to let Sinclair implement his dystopian plan. While simultaneously working on the project, Jake and his associates stealthily work on an antithesis to the device. With the deadline approaching, tension grows as both Sinclair and Jake race against time - one to take over the world, and one to save it, all leading up to the unforgettable 5 A.M. As the deadline arrives, Sinclair, who has been monitoring the team's progress, is ready to activate The Final Table. But right as he is about to start it, Jake and his team activate the antithesis device, which hijacks Sinclair's system and sends it into a destructive loop. Just when Sinclair realizes what transpires, it's too late. The Final Table crashes and falls apart even before it starts. Sinclair is arrested as the evidence against his malicious intent surfaces, and Jake and his team are hailed as unsung heroes. The film culminates in an emotional climax as Jake submits the project report of The Final Table to his boss with, ironically, the remark \\"Project Completed\\". The movie ends there, leaving audiences with a feeling of closure and a lingering thought about the misuse of technology in wrong hands.

Hand prefers the bed, and Barbarella agrees. Hand's vessel makes long loops around Barbarella's crashed vessel while the two have sex, and when it finally comes to a stop, Barbarella is blissfully humming. After Hand repairs her ship, Barbarella departs and promises to return, agreeing that doing things the old-fashioned way is occasionally best. Barbarella's ship burrows through the planet and comes out next to a vast labyrinth. Upon emerging from her ship, she is knocked unconscious by a rockslide. She is found by a blind angel named Pygar, who states he is the last of the ornithanthropes and has lost the will to fly. Barbarella discovers the labyrinth is a prison for people cast out of Sogo, the City of Night. Pygar introduces her to Professor Ping, who offers to repair her ship. Ping also notes that Pygar is capable of flight but merely lacks the will. After Pygar rescues her from the Black Guards, Barbarella has sex with him, and he regains his will to fly.

He was told he had bruised ribs and was discharged but died the following day. From 2005 to 2009, there were between 400 and 1,200 more deaths than would have been expected at the hospital. The inquest at Leicester Coroner's Court heard that the telecommunications engineer's condition was assessed by a paramedic as being life-threatening before his arrival at hospital. Giving evidence, Dr Girish Sharma said he would have had regard to the views of the paramedic but admitted the hour and 10 minutes it took to see his patient was too long. Conceding that his notes about Mr Moore-Robinson did not reveal the full extent of his examination of the patient, Dr Sharma said: \\"There are a lot of things that are not in the documentation.\\" Dr Sharma, who ruled out bone fractures by ordering chest and pelvic X-rays but did not ask for a CT-scan, added: \\"I did carry out a full examination. \\"At that point in time I wasn't aware of delayed rupture of the spleen.

Given the below context: Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 – 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting. Guess a valid title for it!

Premise: \\"But as Johnny Shannon's gaze flitted from Topham to the Kentuckian, Drew was once more aware that, whatever he might outwardly seem, Johnny Shannon was no boy.\\" The premise suggests that Johnny Shannon may outwardly appear like a young boy, but Drew comes to realize that he is not just a boy. This could mean that Johnny Shannon possesses qualities, skills, knowledge, or experiences that go beyond his boyish appearance and make him stand out as a more mature individual. Hypothesis: \\"Drew knew that Johnny Shannon was no man.\\" The hypothesis makes a different statement, claiming that Drew knows Johnny Shannon is not a man. This statement could imply that Drew considers Johnny Shannon to be something other than a man, maybe a young boy or some other categorization. Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. The available options are: I. yes; II. it is not possible to tell; III. no; Comparing the information in the premise and the hypothesis, the premise primarily focuses on Johnny Shannon not being a mere boy, while the hypothesis revolves around whether Johnny Shannon is a man or not. Even though both pieces of information refer to the characterization of Johnny Shannon, they do not provide a direct link to conclude the truth of the hypothesis based on the premise.

Aug 25, 2015 2:44 PM Aug 25, 2015 2:44 PM For eight seasons, Jerry Seinfeld’s television persona dealt with the fictional “Newman,” his neighbor and arch-nemesis. Mr. Seinfeld, a part-time East Hampton resident, dealt with a real-life meddling neighbor last Tuesday afternoon, August 18, when his family’s lemonade stand on Egypt Lane in the village was shut down following complaints. Mr. Seinfeld’s wife, Jessica, posted a photo on Instagram of Mr. Seinfeld, their son, Julian, and two friends with their hands on top of their heads in surrender. An East Hampton Village Police car could clearly be seen in the back right corner of the photo. “Lemonade dreams crushed by local neighbor, but not before raising lots of money for @loverecycled,” wrote Ms. Seinfeld in the caption. “Thanks to all of our customers and big tippers! Thanks, Xander and Jaden, for crushing it today with Julian and Jerry.” East Hampton Village Police Chief Jerry Larsen said police received a complaint about illegally parked vehicles at the location of the lemonade stand. At the scene, an officer advised the Seinfeld family that village code does not permit lemonade stands on village property. The village prohibits all forms of peddling on its property. While the money was ultimately raised for Ms. Seinfeld’s charity, Baby Buggy, many of Ms. Seinfeld’s Instagram followers expressed their disdain over the neighbor’s complaint and strict policies about lemonade stands in the area. “People always talk about how kids today need to get back to the basics, and when they do, they change their mind,” PamB2001 commented in an Instagram post. Tom Keaney, Mr. Seinfeld’s publicist, said he could not add anything beyond what was posted on Instagram. Ms. Seinfeld founded Baby Buggy in 2001. The organization focuses on providing families under financial strain with clothing, gear and services, and has donated 16 million items since its formation. Its motto is “Love Recycled,” hence its Instagram handle. ||||| Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) It’s “No lemonade for you!” in East Hampton, where a sourpuss neighbor put the squeeze on the drink stand Jerry Seinfeld and his family had set up for charity, resulting in this goofy “arrest.” The roadside business was selling cold drinks on hot days to benefit the group Baby Buggy, before it was shut down for violating a village prohibition on peddling. “Lemonade dreams crushed by local neighbor but not before raising lots of money for @loverecycled.

Mr. Hoffman, a former ambassador to Portugal, has donated millions to Republican candidates and causes over the years, including more than 1 million to Right to Rise, a “super PAC” that supported Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign in 2016. A critic of President Trump, Mr. Hoffman has continued to donate heavily to other Republicans. Alluding to past mass killings, Mr. Hoffman argued in his email that future gun massacres were inevitable without government intervention: “If we go from Orlando to Las Vegas, and now Parkland, you just have to know that there are others around the country just dreaming about staging another mass murder.” Republican elected officials in Washington and Florida have shown no significant interest in considering new gun restrictions after the Florida school shooting. The party, which has full control of both the state and federal government, has traditionally opposed virtually all new limitations on firearms. Mr. Scott has resisted pressure to back new gun regulations after the killing of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Broward County on Wednesday, though he said “everything’s on the table” in a television interview. And Senator Marco Rubio of Florida voiced resistance to discussing gun control in a speech after the massacre, arguing in the Senate that a person determined to carry out an attack would find the weaponry to do it regardless of government regulations. His comments provoked outrage among some students who survived the shooting. Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A previous federal assault weapons ban, enacted in 1994 under a Democratic president and Congress, lapsed in 2004 while Republicans had full control of Washington. Mr. Hoffman acknowledged it was “not likely” that he would succeed in making the party more open to an assault weapons ban, and said Republicans were too beholden to the National Rifle Association. He has urged Republicans in the past to support certain firearms restrictions, without effect, but has not previously issued such a blunt threat. One of the recipients of Mr. Hoffman’s Saturday message, Mel Sembler, another former ambassador and ally of the Bush family, suggested he did not intend to join the proposed donation boycott. “I don’t plan on getting into this debate,” Mr. Sembler, who also lives in Florida, said in a brief email. Peter S. Rummell, a Jacksonville-based donor who gave 125,000 to Jeb Bush’s “super PAC” in 2016, said he was on board with Mr. Hoffman’s plan and would only contribute to candidates supportive of banning assault weapons. He said the Parkland shooting was a turning point: “It has to start somewhere,” Mr. Rummell said, of controlling guns.

He said he would close his checkbook to that group and others like it, and would encourage others to do the same in the absence of action on guns. Mr. Hoffman said he would also be open to backing fiscally conservative Democrats who favor certain gun restrictions. “I’m going to email every single donor I know in the Republican Party and try to get them on board,” he said. “We’ve really got to start a little movement here.” ||||| One of the students who survived Wednesday’s deadly shooting at a Florida high school called for stricter gun regulations and took aim at President Donald Trump and other Republicans for their inaction on the matter on Saturday. “If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and how it should never have happened and maintain telling us how nothing is going to be done about it,” Emma Gonzalez said, “I’m going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association.” Gonzalez delivered an impassioned speech at a gun control rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Saturday. “Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seated funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have ever been done to prevent this, we call BS,” she said. “They say that tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS. They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS. They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars. We call BS. No, they say that no laws could have been able to prevent the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS.” A 19-year-old former student, Nikolas Cruz, has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder after killing 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, with Gonzalez attends, on Wednesday. He was armed with an AR-15 rifle, which he used to carry out the rampage. The massacre, among the deadliest school shootings in modern US history, has yet again sparked debate about US gun laws and lawmakers’ continued inaction on gun control. President Trump traveled on Friday to visit shooting victims, survivors, and first responders. He also wrote in a tweet that there were “so many signs” that Cruz was mentally disturbed, and seemed to cast blame on those around him for not reporting him. “Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem,” he wrote. “Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!” So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2018 The FBI had been tipped off that Cruz might be dangerous but failed to act, which it admitted in a statement on Friday. Gonzalez on Saturday addressed Trump’s tweet directly, saying they had alerted the authorities about Cruz time and time again and that for students who had known him over the years, “it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter.” She continued: We need to pay attention to the fact that this isn’t just a mental health issue. He wouldn’t have harmed that many students with a knife. How about we stop blaming the victims for something that was the shooter’s fault? The fault of the people who let him buy the guns in the first place, those at the gun shows, the people who encouraged him to buy accessories for his guns to make them fully automatic, the people who didn’t take them away from him when they knew that he expressed homicidal tendencies, and I am not talking about the FBI. I am talking about the people that he lived with; I’m talking about the neighbors who saw him outside holding guns. If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and how it should never have happened and maintain telling us how nothing is going to be done about it, I’m going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association. “To every politician taking donations from the NRA, shame on you,” Gonzalez said. During her impassioned speech, she also declared, “This will be the last mass shooting.” As US lawmakers remain essentially paralyzed on gun control, the sad thing is that it very probably won’t be. ||||| Fort Lauderdale (United States) (AFP) - A student survivor of the Parkland school shooting called out US President Donald Trump on Saturday over his ties to the powerful National Rifle Association, in a poignant address to an anti-gun rally in Florida. \\"To every politician taking donations from the NRA, shame on you!\\" said Emma Gonzalez, assailing Trump over the multi-million-dollar support his campaign received from the gun lobby -- and prompting the crowd to chant in turn: \\"Shame on you!\\" Wednesday's massacre, which claimed 17 lives at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, has fueled urgent calls for an end to the national deadlock over gun control -- with a string of shooting survivors rallying behind the cause. The gunman, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, was able to legally buy an assault rifle despite a history of troubling and violent behavior. In Washington, however, the political response has made clear that the powerful NRA pro-gun lobby remains formidable, while Trump himself suggested the root cause of mass shootings was a crisis of mental health -- making no mention of gun control. \\"If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and... how nothing is going to be done about it, I'm going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association,\\" said Gonzalez. \\"It doesn't matter because I already know. Thirty million,\\" she told the rally attended by fellow students, parents and local officials, citing the sum spent by the NRA to support Trump's election bid and defeat Hillary Clinton. Dividing that sum by the number of shooting victims in the United States so far this year, Gonzalez asked: \\"Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump?\\" The young woman's powerful address immediately went viral, with her name a top trending topic on Twitter. The US leader also tweeted a day after the massacre that that neighbors and fellow students had failed to flag Cruz to the authorities. \\"We did,\\" Gonzalez said, her shaking with emotion. \\"Time and time again. Since he was in middle school. It was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter.\\" US authorities have come under mounting scrutiny for failing to act on a series of warning signs. The FBI admitted Friday it received a chilling warning in January from a tipster who said Cruz could be planning a mass shooting, but that agents failed to follow up. Cruz was also known to local police after his mother repeatedly called them over his violent outbursts, while records obtained by the South Florida Sun Sentinel show welfare services investigated Cruz after he cut his arms and said he wanted to buy a gun. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A man named Mr. Hoffman, who used to be an ambassador to Portugal, has given a lot of money to the Republican party and its candidates for office in the past.
