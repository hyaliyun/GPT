Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him. Any last words could be terribly important. \\"Jerusalem,\\" he mumbled. \\"Towers - golden. Gates of pearl.

He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter, is the chairman of the English department and thus Grady's boss. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending - the book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana.His students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Tripp's large house, is attracted to Tripp, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on.During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal.

In 1993, he set out to climb K2, the world's second highest mountain. But Greg never made it to the top. After five days, he stumbled into the village of Korphe in northern Pakistan, injured and hungry. The kind villagers there looked after him for several days.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: One of the more surprising objects in the Getty Villa’s newly reinstalled gallery of later Roman sculpture is a marble bust of a youth leaning out of a circular frame, mounted high on the gallery wall. J. Paul Getty originally acquired this particular sculpture in 1973, but it has been off view for many years. The recent reinstallation of the Getty Museum’s antiquities collection at the Villa provided the opportunity to resurrect many such objects from storage and put them on display. Bringing this strange object back to the public eye enabled us to ask—and answer—several questions about it. Who—if anyone—does it represent? When was it carved? Where was it made, and how did it end up in Los Angeles? In preparation for its display, we researched and reinterpreted the object, exploring both its ancient function and modern history. In its new display, this object is fittingly surrounded by other examples of late Roman sculpture from the third and fourth centuries. Its inclusion in this gallery was not always a given, however, as the figure was long misidentified as a portrait of young Caracalla, who at ten years old became joint emperor with his father in A.D. 198.(1) But recent scholarship questioned the Caracalla identification and the object’s date, suggesting it was carved at least a hundred years later.(2) In light of this research, curator Jens Daehner pushed to reexamine the sculpture and consider including it in the reinstallation. In early 2015, the Antiquities Department brought this tondo and many other potential objects for the new galleries out of storage for viewing, providing curators, conservators, mount makers, preps, and registrars a chance to approve and prepare artworks for possible display. After the storage viewing and subsequent research, we updated the object record to conform with what scholars had suggested: this is not a second-century portrait of Caracalla but a fourth-century bust of a youth or divinity. To answer our next question of who the tondo represents, we then had to take a... Where was the marble portrait first displayed?

Article: Gauri Nanda sees a wearable computer as a handbag -- one that's built out of four-inch squares and triangles of fiber, with tiny computer chips embedded in it. It looks, feels and weighs like your typical leather purse. That's where similarities end: This bag can wirelessly keep track of your belongings and remind you, just as you're about to leave the house, to take your wallet. It can review the weather report and suggest that you grab an umbrella. This purse can even upload your favorite songs onto your scarf. Sure, a computing purse and scarf set may seem like the stuff of science fiction. But these devices, part of next generation of wearable computers, could become commonplace within a few years. DuPont created new super strong fibers that can conduct electricity and can be woven into ordinary-looking clothes. And the chipmaker developed chip packaging allowing wearable computers to be washed, even in the heavy-duty cycle. As a result, these new wearable devices are different from the heavy and downright silly versions of the recent past, which often required users to be wrapped in wires and type on their stomachs. Unlike their predecessors, these new wearable computers also make economic sense. When her bag becomes commercially available in two to three years, Nanda expects it will cost around 150, which is the price of an average leather purse. Here's how the bag works: You place a special radio-signal-transmitting chip on to your wallet. A similar radio in your purse picks up the signal and notifies you that you've forgotten to take your wallet. In turn, sensors on your purse's handles will notify the computer that you've picked up the purse and are ready to go. _ Indeed, more people will want to cross that bridge in the coming years -- making for a booming market for wearable computers that don't like something out of science fiction.

Context: Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

During an attack one day, the maintenance man, Mr. Han, comes to Dre's aid, revealing himself as an ancient kung fu master.

Consequently, Skylar would likely opt for an alternative recreational activity that could be completed within her remaining available time. In this situation, Skylar might be interested in exploring these following options: A. Head to a party: If there's a party nearby and Skylar is interested in attending, this could be a viable option. Going to a party would provide Skylar with an opportunity to socialize, dance, and enjoy herself while staying within her time constraints. She could make a brief appearance, have some fun, and still be home before her curfew. B. Engage in a shorter activity: Since watching the movie is off the table, Skylar may want to engage in a different recreational activity that requires less time. This could include going to a nearby coffee shop or café, taking a walk in the park, browsing a book shop, or even just spending some time chatting with Aubrey. These activities would still allow Skylar to enjoy her time without fretting about her curfew. C. Head home early to avoid problems: Considering the potential consequences of breaking her curfew, Skylar might choose to spend the rest of her available time completing personal tasks or chores before heading home. This choice demonstrates responsibility and respect for her parents' rules, which could result in a more lenient curfew in the future or fewer restrictions on her social life. D. Reschedule the movie outing: Circumstances permitting, Skylar could suggest rescheduling the movie outing with Aubrey to a time when her curfew would not be an issue. This way, they can both enjoy the movie without worrying about the time constraints and make plans for a future date that works for both of them.

Journey is an American rock band that formed in San Francisco in 1973, composed of former members of Santana and Frumious Bandersnatch. The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \\"Open Arms\\". With Cain on board, the band began writing material that would eventually lead up to Journey's biggest studio album, \\"Escape\\". Recording sessions began in April 1981, and lasted until the middle of June. Escape was released on July 31, 1981, and immediately the album became a mainstream success. The album, which has thus far sold nine times platinum, went to number one on the album charts later that year, and included three top-ten hits: \\"Who's Cryin' Now\\", \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" and \\"Open Arms\\". The last is Journey's highest-charting single to date, staying at No. 2 for six consecutive weeks and ranking at No.34 on Billboard's 1982 year-end Hot 100. MTV videotaped one of their two sold-out shows in Houston on November 6, 1981, in front of over 20,000 fans. Capitalizing on their success, the band recorded radio commercials for Budweiser and sold rights to their likenesses and music for use in two video games: the Journey arcade game by Bally/Midway and Journey Escape by Data Age for the Atari 2600. This success was met with criticism. The 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide gave each of the band's albums only one star, with Dave Marsh writing that \\"Journey was a dead end for San Francisco area rock.\\" Marsh later would anoint Escape as one of the worst number-one albums of all time. Journey's next album, Frontiers (1983), continued their commercial success, reaching No. 2 on the album charts, selling nearly six million copies. The album generated four Top 40 hits, \\"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\\", which reached No. 8, \\"Faithfully\\", which reached No. 12, \\"Send Her My Love\\" and \\"After the Fall\\", both of which reached No. 23. By this time, Journey had become one of the top touring and recording bands in the world. During the subsequent stadium tour, the band contracted with NFL Films to record a video documentary of their life on the road, Frontiers and Beyond.

The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820. Physiologist and painter Carl Gustav Carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrich's life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including Chalk Cliffs on Rügen—painted after his honeymoon—display a new sense of levity, while his palette is brighter and less austere. Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that \\"the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art.\\"Around this time, he found support from two sources in Russia. In 1820, the Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich, at the behest of his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, visited Friedrich's studio and returned to Saint Petersburg with a number of his paintings, an exchange that began a patronage that continued for many years. Not long thereafter, the poet Vasily Zhukovsky, tutor to Alexander II, met Friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit. For decades Zhukovsky helped Friedrich both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family; his assistance toward the end of Friedrich's career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist. Zhukovsky remarked that his friend's paintings \\"please us by their precision, each of them awakening a memory in our mind.\\"Friedrich was acquainted with Philipp Otto Runge, another leading German painter of the Romantic period.

Write down the polynomial equation using the list of weights. Here, with the given weights, the polynomial equation is: 7x^2 + 6x + 5. 3. Substitute the given value of x (in this case, x = 6) into the polynomial equation and calculate the result. Here's how to use these guidelines step-by-step to find the answer: 1. We have x = 6 and equation weights = [7, 6, 5]. 2. The polynomial equation is: 7x^2 + 6x + 5. 3. Now, substitute x = 6 into the equation: 7(6)^2 + 6(6) + 5 = 7(36) + 36 + 5 = 252 + 36 + 5 = 293 So, the result of the polynomial expression with x = 6 and equation weights = [7, 6, 5] is 293."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door. They were tough opponents and even tougher fans - they took from the lab and carried away with them several flasks and some equipment, as it turned out - to set up their own game station in pit number 5.

Arrived at Visé, Louis decided not to lay siege to Maastricht but only to occupy the surrounding forts of Tongeren, Maaseik and Valkenburg so its garrison stayed bottled up. Moving along the Rhine, Rheinberg, Wesel, Burick and Orsoy were taken. Turenne then took Nijmegen , with 4,000 infantry and 400 cavalry, and from there Fort Crèvecœur near 's-Hertogenbosch, which fell after only two days. In view of these defeats, the Dutch public panicked and rioted. Leading politicians Johan and Cornelis de Witt were lynched by an angry Orangist mob, following rumours that they were planning the assassination of William of Nassau . On 4 July, William was acclaimed stadtholder. As the French had promised the major cities of Holland to the English, they were in no hurry to capture them. The French tried to gain sixteen million guilders from the Dutch in exchange for a separate peace. This demand and other conditions posed by the French stiffened Dutch resistance. Negotiations gave the Republic time to finish the inundations along the Dutch Water Line, started on 22 June 1672. Luxembourg laid siege to Groningen but failed to take it. An attempt was made to invade the Republic by sea; this was thwarted by Admiral Michiel de Ruyter in four strategic victories against the combined Anglo-French fleet . The first of these naval victories was the Battle of Solebay.

The sentence has a negative connotation due to the terms used within it. Here is a breakdown of the sentence and its components which contribute to its negative sentiment. 1. \\"has nothing going for it\\" - This phrase implies that the subject being discussed is lacking positive or beneficial qualities. The word \\"nothing\\" is an explicitly negative term, suggesting that there are no redeeming factors about the subject. This contributes significantly to the overall negative sentiment of the sentence. 2. \\"other than\\" - This is a conjunction that connects the preceding negative statement with another point, which is meant to stand in contrast. In this sentence, however, the following point further supports the negativity of the overall sentiment. 3. \\"exploitive\\" - This adjective has a strong negative connotation as it often refers to taking unfair advantage of a situation or people. It suggests that whatever is being discussed is using an unscrupulous approach to achieve its goals or desired outcome. 4. \\"array of obligatory cheap\\" - This phrase implies that the subject being discussed is of poor quality or relies on cheap tactics to attract attention. The word \\"obligatory\\" also adds a sense of the forced nature of these cheap elements. The combination of \\"cheap\\" and \\"obligatory\\" further enhances the negative sentiment in the sentence.

Write a title for this article: Among these is a handful of ladies (and no, copy editors, you may not change “ladies” to “women”) who strive daily to keep Washington’s name and legacy in the dimming lights of history. Unheralded and largely unknown, they deserve recognition for their valiant and extravagant efforts to preserve one of America’s most valuable assets, including the original ruminations of its greatest thinkers. These would be the members of the Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association, who volunteer their time and talents — and open their wallets — to maintain Washington’s home on the Potomac. These efforts have been shepherded the past 30 years by one brave and hearty James Rees (think of having a couple dozen powerful women as your boss), who, like Washington, is also reserved and humble of spirit. To everyone’s dismay, Rees, 60, recently retired as CEO, owing to a debilitating illness that has taken him too soon from his venerable toils. During his 30 years at Mount Vernon, Rees helped lead its transformation from a historic house to a major national attraction, increasing its endowment from just 4 million in 1984 to more than 125 million today, and recently oversaw the groundbreaking for the estate’s newest project — a presidential library that will offer fellowships to scholars in residence as well as safeguard Washington’s books and papers. Latest to the collection is Washington’s original copy of the “Acts of Congress,” a 106-page volume that contains his personal copy of the Constitution, a draft of the Bill of Rights, and other documents pertaining to early acts of the new Congress. Washington’s own handwritten scribbles are penciled in the margins. The Mount Vernon ladies captured the book in a Christie’s bidding war using private funds. Unbeknown to most visitors to Mount Vernon — and certainly the millions who don’t know it exists — Washington’s home was saved and is maintained without a penny of public funds. (Disclosure: I serve on the Mount Vernon advisory board, a collection of private citizens who meet twice a year to offer advice, which the ladies are utterly free to ignore.) The ladies’ association is a lesson in volunteerism worthy of its own chapter. The association was formed in 1853 by South Carolina native Ann Pamela Cunningham, whose mother had noticed a large, dilapidated house perched on a hill along the Potomac River and was outraged to learn it was Washington’s home. Inspired by her mother, Cunningham reached out to Southern women to raise funds to buy the estate and, in 1860, open it to the public, thus beginning a 152-year-old tradition. Since then, more than 80 million have visited the house and grounds, which include an underground museum (so as not to mar the landscape), gardens, a slave burial ground, and the final resting place of George and Martha Washington. Even the opposite shore of the Potomac has been preserved so that visitors can enjoy the same view that Washington did. The Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington, named for its most generous donor, is an overdue addition to Washington’s home. In a time of self-reverential politicians and presidential libraries erected as monuments to ego, it is odd, if also characteristic, that the first president had none. Just as he resisted becoming the nation’s first president, feeling himself unworthy, he would have found a library in his honor, indulging today’s vernacular, “over the top.” Washington no doubt would be disappointed by the boastful tenor and dishonest content of today’s political debate, though he was surely familiar with the rowdy passions that drive it. Thanks to the ladies of Mount Vernon — and to the lovely James Rees — Americans can revisit those passions on the very grounds Washington paced, and perhaps find inspiration there to engage in a more civil discourse, surely not the least among Washington’s legacies.

Charles Krauthammer (; born March 13, 1950) is an American syndicated columnist, author, political commentator, and former physician whose weekly column is syndicated to more than 400 publications worldwide. While in his first year studying at Harvard Medical School, Krauthammer became permanently paralyzed from the neck down after a diving accident, severing the spinal cord at C5. After spending 14 months recovering in a hospital, he returned to medical school, graduating to become a psychiatrist involved in the creation of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III, and later developing a career as a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer. He was a weekly panelist on PBS news program Inside Washington from 1990 until it ceased production in December 2013. Krauthammer criticized President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to succeed Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. He called the nomination of Miers a \\"mistake\\" on several occasions. He noted her lack of constitutional experience as the main obstacle to her nomination. On October 21, 2005, Krauthammer published \\"Miers: The Only Exit Strategy\\", in which he explained that all of Miers's relevant constitutional writings are protected by both attorney-client privilege and executive privilege, which presented a unique face-saving solution to the mistake: \\"Miers withdraws out of respect for both the Senate and the executive's prerogatives.\\" Six days later, Miers withdrew, employing that argument: \\"As I stated in my acceptance remarks in the Oval Office, the strength and independence of our three branches of government are critical to the continued success of this great Nation.

Kayla grew their nails longer than Jennifer, because","completion":"Kayla had always admired the elegance of long nails. She noticed how they seemed to make every gesture more graceful, adding a touch of sophistication to even the simplest tasks. Therefore, she decided to embark on her own journey of growing her nails to achieve this mystifying beauty. Split ends, snags, and the occasional chip no longer bothered Kayla, as she diligently cared for her nails. She kept a meticulous maintenance schedule: moisturizing her cuticles with nourishing oils and hand creams, filing them regularly to avoid any rough edges, and applying protective nail polishes and treatments that promoted nail strength and growth. Kayla's goal was not only to outgrow Jennifer but to achieve a certain grace and elegance that she perceived was linked to the length of one’s nails. Jennifer, on the other hand, had a more pragmatic view of long nails. She appreciated their appearance but understood that her choice of career and lifestyle limited her own ability to grow her nails too long—lest they be more trouble than they were worth. Jennifer's job as a veterinarian often involved hands-on tasks such as handling animals and performing medical procedures that were difficult with long nails. As such, she prioritized the practicality and hygiene concerns over the aesthetics of having lengthy nails. Kayla's persistence and dedication started to pay off, and her nails gradually grew longer, surpassing Jennifer's relatively short and more manageable nails. Every time they met for lunch or a casual chat, the topic of nails inevitably came up, and Kayla would proudly flaunt her progress. Jennifer would playfully roll her eyes, secretly impressed by her friend's determination in pursuit of her goal. As Kayla's nails grew longer, people around her began to notice and comment on her unique style. Some admired her for her dedication, while others viewed her nails as an expression of vanity and a testament to the importance she placed on her appearance. Yet, Kayla was unperturbed by these various opinions, as she continued to refine her nail care regimen in an attempt to bring them to the absolute pinnacle of elegance. Finally, Kayla reached a point where she was undeniably proud of her nails. They were glossy, well-manicured, and significantly longer than Jennifer's. However, Kayla had noticed that the longer her nails got, the more challenging it became for her to engage in many everyday tasks. Things like typing on her laptop and phone, fastening a necklace or a bracelet, and even preparing a meal had become considerably more difficult. Nevertheless, the sense of accomplishment from achieving her goal was gratifying, but she now understood Jennifer's perspective better. Kayla started to recognize that growing out her nails beyond their current length would be impractical and so she resolved to maintain her nails at a length that balanced elegance and functionality. Jennifer and Kayla's friendship flourished through these shared experiences, their bond strengthening in spite of their slightly competitive nature. They both realized that long nails are a matter of personal preference and priorities. While Kayla grew her nails out for elegance, she came to acknowledge the importance of functionality. Jennifer found an admiration in Kayla's dedication and artistic pursuit, which made her appreciate the beauty of long nails even more. In the end, their quest for the perfect nail length taught them that it was not about outdoing each other, but finding a balance that suited each woman's unique lifestyle and desires."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: Housing costs, such as rent and fuel, were top of the expenditure list, ahead of transport costs. The amount spent per household rose from £501 in 2012, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. But average household spending stood at £539.80 in 2006, after taking the rising cost of living into account. The Family Spending Survey is compiled every year by the ONS. It shows that £74.40 a week was spent on average on housing, fuel and power in 2013. This equates to 14% of household spending. However, this figure excludes mortgage interest payments, British council tax or domestic rates in Northern Ireland. A rise in gas and electricity prices pushed this category to the top of the household spending list in 2013, the ONS said. A previous big hit for family finances was transport, which was second on the list last year at £70.40. Nearly half of this was the cost of running a car, namely petrol, diesel, repairs and servicing. Transport remained a significant expense for families in rural areas of the UK. In these areas, it cost £85.50 a week. Overall, average weekly household spending for households in rural areas was £550.50, compared with £481.70 in urban areas from 2011 to 2013. There was also evidence in the ONS figures of a north-south divide in spending. In 2011 to 2013, families in the South East of England spent the most per week (£585.40), followed by households in London (£579.60), the East of England (£523.40) and the South West of England (£518.20). All four were above the UK average. Families in the the North East of England spent the least at £424.60 per week, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber (£431.10) and Wales (£438.80). The divide between rich and poor is also clear, with the lowest-earning 10% of households spending an average of £189.80 a week. This compared with an average of £1,119.50 a week for the 10% of highest-earning households in the UK. £58.80 a week on average £15.60 on meat and fish £4.30 on fresh veg £3.30 on fresh fruit £4.90 on non-alcoholic drinks Major areas of spending for households in general were recreation and culture (£63.90 a week). This category includes spending on TVs, computers, newspapers, books and package holidays. The figures suggest that recreation takes a bigger chunk of family income than grocery bills. Average weekly spending on food and non-alcoholic drinks in 2013 stood at £58.80, of which £15.60 a week was spent on meat and fish.

On average, households spent £74.40 per week, or 14% of their spending, on housing, fuel and power in 2013. This figure, however, does not include mortgage interest payments, British council tax or domestic rates in Northern Ireland. A surge in gas and electricity prices pushed housing costs to the top of the list that year. Previously, transport was the most significant family expense, costing £70.40, with nearly half of this attributed to car maintenance such as petrol, diesel, repairs and servicing. Weekly household spending for rural households was higher at £550.50 compared to £481.70 in urban areas from 2011 to 2013. The data also revealed a north-south divide in spending, with families in the South East of England spending the highest amount per week at £585.40, followed by London at £579.60, the East of England at £523.40 and the South West at £518.20. All these regions surpassed the UK average. In contrast, families in the North East of England spent the lowest amount at £424.60 per week, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber at £431.10 and Wales at £438.80. The gap between rich and poor is evident, as the lowest-earning 10% of households spent an average of £189.80 per week, compared to the highest-earning 10% of households, which spent an average of £1,119.50 per week. Major spending areas for households involved recreation and culture at £63.90 per week, including expenses on TVs, computers, newspaper and package holidays. This category took up a larger portion of family income than grocery bills, where average weekly spending on food and non-alcoholic drinks in 2013 was £58.80, including £15.60 a week on meat and fish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -489*h - 10043 = -840*h + 456*h - 1328 for h.","completion":"To solve the equation -489*h - 10043 = -840*h + 456*h - 1328 for h, first we need to combine the terms with h on both sides of the equation, and then isolate the variable h. Follow the steps below: Step 1: Combine the terms with h on the right side of the equation. -840*h + 456*h = -384*h This is because -840 + 456 equals -384. So our equation becomes: -489*h - 10043 = -384*h - 1328 Step 2: Add 384*h to both sides of the equation to move the h terms to the left side. -489*h + 384*h - 10043 = -1328 This simplifies to: -105*h - 10043 = -1328 Step 3: Add 10043 to both sides of the equation to isolate the h term. -105*h = 8715 This is because -1328 + 10043 equals 8715. Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by -105 to solve for h. h = 8715 / -105 h = -83 So the solution to the equation -489*h - 10043 = -840*h + 456*h - 1328 is h = -83."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. To understand this, let's analyze each sentence and their relationship to each other. Sentence 1: 'Well then.' This sentence typically serves as a transitional phrase in conversation, indicating that the speaker is acknowledging a statement or situation before proceeding to the next point. It does not convey any specific or definitive information about the speaker's opinions or intentions. As a standalone sentence, it leaves the topic or context open for interpretation. Sentence 2: 'Absolutely not.' This statement expresses a clear and emphatic rejection, disagreement, or denial of something. It involves a strong conviction or belief, suggesting that a particular option or idea has been considered and rejected. The relationship between the two sentences is unclear. They may be part of a larger conversation or address different topics entirely. An entailment occurs when the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another sentence, given the content and logical structure of both sentences. In this case, the first sentence ('Well then.') does not provide any information, affirmation, or negation that would guarantee the truth of the second sentence ('Absolutely not.'). There is no clear logical connection or causality between the two statements. To put it simply, just because someone says 'Well then,' it does not directly imply that their next statement would be 'Absolutely not,' or vice versa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Associated Press. and Daily Mail Reporter. The mommy blogger who is accused of fatally poisoning her 5-year-old son with salt is on suicide watch in a New York jail while she awaits trial. At a hearing on Wednesday, Lacey Spears' lawyer asked the public to 'keep and open mind' about the charges. Spears 'looks forward to her day in court and the opportunity to challenge the allegations,' attorney Stephen Riebling said after a brief court session. 'We continue to trust the people will keep an open mind and not judge Lacey or the facts of this case based on what's been reported,' he said. 'The defense of this case will be focused on the relevant facts, not fiction.' Scroll down for video. Lacey Spears (pictured here in May) is 'devastated' by her son's death and is currently on suicide watch, her lawyer revealed. He would not elaborate. Spears, 26, was not in court on Wednesday. Riebling would not comment on how she is doing behind bars except to say that she is 'devastated' by her son's death. A sister, Rebecca Spears, was in court but would not comment afterward. Lacey Spears, of Scottsville, Kentucky, pleaded not guilty last month on charges of depraved murder and manslaughter in the death of Garnett-Paul Spears. The boy died in January at the Westchester Medical Center when, prosecutors say, his sodium levels rose to an extremely dangerous level with no medical explanation. Spears, then living in Chestnut Ridge, New York, was sharing her son's hospital room - he had been brought there after suffering seizures - and doctors thought she might be harming him. Prosecutors believe she administered sodium through a feeding tube in his stomach. Garnett-Paul Spears died in a New York hospital from unexplained sodium poisoning. Prosecutors say his mother slipped it into his feeding tube. Spears, who is originally from Decatur, Alabama, for years had chronicled on social media what she said were the boy's various medical crises. The depraved murder charge alleges extreme recklessness rather than intentional killing. It carries the same maximum sentence, 25 years to life in prison. Spears' lawyers have not yet filed the paperwork that would be required if they plan to offer a psychiatric defense. They would not comment Wednesday on whether that was being contemplated. Acting state Supreme Court Judge Robert Neary gave the defense until September to file motions. He set October 13 for the next court date.

This phrase is often used in colloquial speech when someone wants to encourage or motivate others to take action and approach a certain task or challenge with enthusiasm and determination. Just like in English, motivational phrases such as these can help promote a positive and proactive atmosphere among people, whether in a group setting or between just a few individuals. Czech, a West Slavic language, is spoken primarily in the Czech Republic, which is located in Central Europe. It is closely related to the Slovak language, which is spoken in neighboring Slovakia. Both languages belong to the larger family of Slavic languages, which also includes Russian, Polish, Ukrainian, and others. Like many other languages, Czech has unique idiomatic expressions and phrases that can be challenging for learners or translators to interpret. For example, \\"Jde se na to!\\" is a phrase that, when translated word-for-word, may not immediately convey its intended meaning to non-Czech speakers. However, once familiar with the meaning, one can easily understand that in the context of certain situations, this phrase can be a powerful and inspirational expression that encourages individuals to take action and embrace challenge. In conclusion, the Czech phrase \\"Jde se na to!\\" is an idiomatic expression that translates to \\"Let's go for it!\\" or \\"Let's do it!\\" in English.

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities.

Two teams studied two types of animals: team A studied predators, while team B studied grazers. They learned a lot from this experience. Hint: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. The answer to this question is:","completion":"To answer the question, let's analyze the information in the paragraph step-by-step: 1. We know that team A studied predators, while team B studied grazers. 2. The paragraph mentions that predators play an important role in an ecosystem. 3.

Since team A studied predators, and wolves are an example of predators, team A learned about wolves. On the other hand, team B studied grazers, which are not mentioned to be related to wolves in the paragraph. Therefore, team B learned less about wolves than team A.

Background: William Miller Edwards (June 21, 1905 - June 12, 1987) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Western Reserve University, Vanderbilt University and Wittenberg University in a career lasting more than 30 years, compiling a win-loss-tie record of 168-45-8. Edwards also coached the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL) from 1941 to 1942, tallying a 4-9-1 record, and served as an assistant coach for the NFL's Cleveland Browns in the late 1940s. Raised near Massillon, Ohio, Edwards was the son of an immigrant from Wales who worked in the area's coal mines. Context: Edwards resigned from coaching in 1969, when he was 63 years old, although he continued to work at Wittenberg as the school's athletic director. Dave Maurer, his long-time assistant, took over as the school's coach. By the end of his career, Edwards's 168-45-8 overall college record gave him the second-best winning percentage in the country among active coaches with at least 100 wins. Edwards was given a commendation by President Richard Nixon for his achievements as a coach and won a Football Writers Association of America award for contributions to the game. \\"His retirement is Wittenberg's loss, but more than that, it is college football's loss,\\" University of Alabama coach Bear Bryant said at the time. Edwards retired in February 1973 after 39 years as a coach and administrator and said he would concentrate on hunting and fishing. He was inducted into the Ohio Football Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1979, Wittenberg's Athletics Hall of Honor in 1985 and into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1986. He was also inducted into the Western Reserve Hall of Fame and the Vanderbilt Hall of Fame in 1986. Edwards died in 1987. He and his wife Dorothy had three children. The tough but compassionate approach to coaching Edwards espoused influenced many men who worked under him, including Maurer, who led Wittenberg to a 129-23-3 record between 1969 and 1983. Wittenberg's football stadium is named Edwards-Maurer Field in honor of both head coaches. The winner of the Wittenberg-Case Western Reserve football game receives the Bill Edwards Trophy. Edwards was also close with Steve Belichick, who played for him at Western Reserve and for the Detroit Lions and later served as an assistant under him at Vanderbilt and North Carolina. Belichick's son Bill was named after Edwards, who was also Bill's godfather. Bill Belichick later became an assistant coach in the NFL and is the head coach of the New England Patriots as of 2018. At what is now known as Case Western Reserve University, the football stadium, DiSanto Field, hosts its distinguished guests inside the Coach Bill Edwards President's Suite. Question: what was his impact while the school's athletic director? Answer:","completion":"William Miller Edwards had a significant impact during his tenure as the school's athletic director at Wittenberg University. As a respected and successful football coach with an overall collegiate win-loss-tie record of 168-45-8, Edwards brought a wealth of knowledge, experience, and leadership to the athletic department. His accomplishments as a football coach earned him recognition at the highest levels of the sport, and he was able to leverage this to benefit the school and its athletic programs during his time as athletic director. As athletic director, Edwards played a crucial role in shaping and improving Wittenberg's athletic department by promoting a competitive and successful environment for all sports. He oversaw the development and growth of various athletic programs, ensuring that they received the necessary resources and support to excel. More than merely benefiting the football program, Edwards extended his influence to advance other sports at Wittenberg, which broadened the school's athletic accomplishments. As the athletic director, Edwards was responsible for attracting and retaining top coaching talent across all sports at the university. His personal coaching success and reputation made it possible to bring in other successful coaches to the school's athletic programs. In particular, his long-time assistant and successor as the football coach, Dave Maurer, went on to have a remarkable 129-23-3 record during his time at Wittenberg. This continuation of success demonstrates the impressive legacy that Edwards left behind through his work as a coach, mentor, and athletic director. Edwards was also instrumental in fostering a culture of excellence and sportsmanship among Wittenberg's student-athletes. The tough but compassionate approach to coaching that he advocated had a lasting impact on generations of athletes and coaches at the university. He emphasized the importance of character, dedication, teamwork, and perseverance – qualities that extended beyond the football field and into the lives of the student-athletes he helped shape. Consequently, his approach to coaching and guidance went on to influence other coaches, like Steve Belichick, who in turn passed these values onto their players, including Bill Belichick, the head coach of the New England Patriots. In summary, William Miller Edwards' impact as the athletic director at Wittenberg University was multifaceted and far-reaching. He strengthened the athletic department through his leadership, influence, and success across various sports programs, while also attracting top-tier coaching talent during his tenure. His dedication to building a culture of excellence and sportsmanship resonates through generations of athletes and coaches, ensuring that his legacy continues to shape the world of college sports long after his retirement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While the design may be basic and utilize readily available resources such as timber, these cabins still offer a pleasant and functional living space. Here's a breakdown of the elements that promote comfort in the described log cabins: 1. Four walls and a roof: The basic structure of a log cabin consists of sturdy walls and a roof. This design provides shelter from the elements, such as rain, wind, and excessive sun exposure, allowing for some degree of comfort within the cabin. 2. Concrete floor: The inclusion of a concrete floor indicates that this log cabin has a stable and durable foundation. Concrete is easy to clean and maintain and adds an extra layer of insulation, which can be crucial for maintaining a comfortable internal temperature. 3. Picnic table: A picnic table within the cabin provides a dedicated space for eating, socializing, and various other activities, adding a layer of convenience and functionality to the area and contributing to the overall comfort of the shelter. 4. Ceiling fan: The presence of a ceiling fan suggests an emphasis on indoor climate control. A fan can help regulate the cabin's temperature by circulating air throughout the space, improving overall comfort during both hot and cold weather. 5. Screened windows: Log cabins with screened windows offer better ventilation and protect the inhabitants from insects and other outdoor pests. These screens provide a balanced blend of fresh air and protection, enhancing the level of comfort within the cabin.

Measure the rice.\\"","completion":"Title: The Art of Mastering Rice Cookery: Selecting The Right Saucepan and Measuring Techniques Introduction Rice is a staple food enjoyed by millions of people across the globe – a versatile ingredient that can define a variety of cuisines, from Asian to Latin American. It is more than just a side dish; it can transform a meal's flavor and texture profile. Nevertheless, the secret to a flawlessly cooked rice begins with the right saucepan and accurate measuring techniques. In this article, we will discuss the crucial steps to meticulously choose the perfect saucepan, properly measure rice, and guide you through the fundamental steps to elevate your meals by cooking impeccable, irresistible rice. Section 1: Selecting the Right Saucepan 1.1 Saucepan Material When selecting a saucepan to cook rice, consider the material and how evenly it distributes heat. The ideal choices are those made from stainless steel, aluminum, or non-stick materials. Stainless steel, with its even heat distribution, is a popular choice. Aluminum, while lightweight, can conduct heat well, while non-stick pans provide the convenience of hassle-free cleaning. Enamel-coated cast iron saucepans are also a suitable option to maintain consistent heat throughout the cooking process. 1.2 Size Matters Rice expands as it cooks, so make sure that your saucepan has enough space to accommodate this expansion. A three quart saucepan with a capacity of around 12 cups is a wise choice for most situations. This size will enable you to cook various types of rice in varying amounts without worrying about it overflowing during the cooking process. 1.3 The Lid The saucepan lid plays an essential role in rice cooking. A tight-fitting lid will keep the steam trapped inside the saucepan, which is crucial for perfectly steamed rice. Glass lids offer the advantage of monitoring the rice's progress without lifting the lid and releasing steam, but well-fitted stainless steel or aluminum lids will also do the job. Section 2: Measuring Rice 2.1 Rice-to-Water Ratio The rice-to-water ratio is essential in ensuring well-cooked rice. Different types of rice generally require varying amounts of water: - White Rice (Short or Medium-Grain): 1 cup of rice to 1.5 cups of water. - White Rice (Long-Grain): 1 cup of rice to 1.75 cups of water. - Brown Rice (Short or Medium-Grain): 1 cup of rice to 2 cups of water. - Brown Rice (Long-Grain): 1 cup of rice to 2.25 cups of water. - Basmati or Jasmine Rice: 1 cup of rice to 1.5 cups of water. 2.2 Techniques for Measuring To measure rice, use a standard measuring cup to scoop the rice from its container. Level the rice in the measuring cup by sliding a straight-edged utensil, such as a butter knife or a flat spatula, over the top. This method will ensure that you have precisely the intended amount for your recipe. Make sure to adjust the amount according to your desired serving sizes. Section 3: Cooking Rice Perfectly 3.1 Rinsing Rice Prior to cooking, rinse the rice under cold running water in a fine-mesh sieve or strainer to remove excess starch and debris. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear to avoid clumped or gummy rice. 3.2 Proper Cooking Methods Once you've selected the proper saucepan, measured your rice and water, and rinsed the rice, you can proceed with the actual cooking process: - Start by heating your saucepan on medium and add some butter or oil if desired, then add the rice and cook for a few minutes. - Pour the measured amount of water into the saucepan, stirring to ensure the rice is evenly distributed along the bottom. - Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan with its tight-fitting lid. - Allow the rice to steam, avoiding opening the lid, until it absorbs the water and becomes tender. The cooking time varies depending on the type of rice (White Rice: 15-20 minutes, Brown Rice: 45-50 minutes, Basmati or Jasmine Rice: 15-20 minutes). - Let the rice sit, covered, for at least 5 minutes after being removed from heat. This additional resting time will make the rice fluffier. - Finally, use a fork to fluff the rice, gently separating the grains before serving. Conclusion Rice is a beloved part of countless dishes around the world. By selecting the right saucepan, measuring your rice accurately, and employing proper cooking methods, you'll be well on your way to perfecting the art of rice cookery. Follow these simple steps to elevate your dishes and satisfy your palate each and every time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

They appreciate the design, finding it convenient for getting into spice jar lids, and have expressed an interest in buying a pair that were accurately calibrated. However, the user clearly states that the measurements of the spoons are off by 25-50%, except for the teaspoon measure. This is a serious flaw, particularly for a product whose primary function is to give accurate measurements for cooking or baking purposes. Taking this into consideration, it can be inferred that the user would likely not recommend this product in its current state to other potential consumers, as the inaccuracies present may lead to potential issues in recipes that require precise measurement. However, the user appears to be open to the possibility of recommending a future version of the product, should the manufacturer rectify the issue mentioned. So to answer your question, the most suitable selection from the options (1).No and (2).Yes, would be (1).No because the user sees a serious flaw in the incorrect calibration which results in poor performance of the product.

The lyrics for \\"My Happiness\\" were written by Bernard Fanning, Powderfinger's lead singer and songwriter. The rest of the band are co-credited with Fanning for composing the track. The song describes feelings of love and separation; Sain's Pennie Dennison said it described \\"the pining feeling you experience when you spend time away from the one you love\\". Fanning called it \\"a sad story of touring and the absence loneliness that comes with it\\". The extensive time spent touring took its toll on the band, and it was on the back of this that Fanning wrote \\"My Happiness\\". Thus, he expressed confusion at its being considered a romantic song. \\"My Happiness\\" was attacked by some fans as being \\"like Lauryn Hill, bland and boring Top 40 bullshit\\"; guitarist Ian Haug rebutted by pointing out that the song was an example of the new emotional level on which Powderfinger made music, while Fanning was more aggressive in his defence of the song. In response to being dubbed \\"Mr Miserable\\" by The Sun-Herald's Peter Holmes for the lyrics of \\"My Happiness\\" and \\"These Days\\", Fanning pointed out that the songs could be construed either as melancholy, or as part of \\"the most hopeful record ... in a long time\\". Much of Fanning's writing is inspired by non-rock music, and \\"My Happiness\\" is no exception. Gospel and soul music that is \\"unashamedly about love and how good it makes you feel\\" was common during the Odyssey Number Five recording sessions. Powderfinger worked hard in those sessions to ensure a more polished work than Internationalist; guitarist Darren Middleton concluded that \\"My Happiness\\", \\"The Metre\\", and \\"Up & Down & Back Again\\" were more \\"complete\\" because of the band's efforts. The lighter elements of \\"My Happiness\\" in comparison to some of the band's earlier work saw Fanning reveal his passion for several other musicians, such as James Taylor--something that \\"five years ago ... would have been an embarrassing thing to say\\". Answer this question \\"Besides music any other sources of inspiration for \\"My Happiness\\"?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Besides music, another source of inspiration for \\"My Happiness\\" was the extensive time spent touring by the band, which took its toll on them and led to feelings of absence and loneliness.

Rachel, unlike Katrina, tries to avoid confrontation as they get very upset.","completion":"Rachel, unlike Katrina, tries to avoid confrontation as they get very upset. This stems from Rachel's inherent aversion to conflict and her highly empathetic nature. Whenever faced with a potential confrontation, Rachel's first step is to assess the situation carefully and identify the root of the issue. She believes that by understanding the source of the disagreement, she is better equipped to address it in a calm and non-aggressive manner. After identifying the root issue, Rachel's second step is to put herself in the other person's shoes and try to understand their perspective. She finds that by empathizing with others and validating their feelings, she can amicably resolve issues without causing further emotional distress. This approach not only enables Rachel to defuse tense situations but also helps in maintaining positive relationships with others, something she deeply cherishes. One of Rachel's key tactics in avoiding confrontation is active listening. Instead of trying to impose her point of view, she focuses on listening to others and finding common ground. This allows Rachel to facilitate a more productive conversation and work towards a mutually agreeable solution. In situations where confrontation seems inevitable, Rachel's strategy is to take a step back and give herself time to process and reflect on the situation. By doing this, she can approach the issue with a clearer mind and renewed emotional reserves. Consequently, this enables her to communicate her thoughts and feelings assertively, yet respectfully, helping her maintain a healthy balance between self-preservation and conflict resolution. Overall, Rachel's approach to avoiding confrontation demonstrates her commitment to fostering dialogue and understanding in her interactions with others, prioritizing harmony and empathy over aggression and discord."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Reuters Holdings PLC said Michael Reupke resigned as general manager to pursue unspecified interests, a move the news organization termed an \\"amicable separation.\\" Mr. Reupke, 52 years old and a 27-year Reuters veteran, had been the information-services company's general manager for only six months. His appointment to that post, which has senior administrative, staff and policy responsibilities, followed a several-year tenure as Reuters's editor in chief. No successor was named, and Mr. Reupke's duties will be split among three other senior Reuters executives, the company said. In a telephone interview, Mr. Reupke said his departure was for \\"personal reasons,\\" which he declined to specify. \\"There is no business reason for my departure,\\" nor any disagreement over policy, he added. He also rejected reports that his departure stemmed from disappointment the general manager's post hadn't also led to a board directorship at the London-based news organization. Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuters's eight-person executive committee who didn't also serve on the company's board of directors. \\"If I were choosing the people of tomorrow, I would have chosen the people who are now on the board,\\" he said. A Reuters spokesman said the departure reflects \\"no change in strategy or profits.\\" Mark Shepperd, an analyst at UBS Philips & Drew in London, said, \\"I suspect (the departure) will be fairly irrelevant for the company. I would be very surprised if his departure signals any change in strategy or change in profit expectations.\\" On London's Stock Exchange, Reuters shares rose five pence to 913 pence (14.43). In the U.S. over-the-counter market, American depositary shares for Reuters, each representing three shares in the London market, closed unchanged at 43.875. The senior of the three executives who will assume Mr. Reupke's duties is Nigel Judah, 58, finance director and a Reuters board director.

Today, he has three samples of molecule in front of him, sample A, sample B, and sample C. Sample A is a straight-chain molecule; sample B is a branched-chain molecule; and sample C is a cyclic molecule. Mark's job is to determine the characteristics of each sample. But I can use this background: A) In a straight-chain molecule, all the carbon atoms are lined up in a row like cars of a train. The carbon atoms form the “backbone” of the molecule. B) In a branched-chain molecule, at least one of the carbon atoms branches off from the backbone. C) In a cyclic molecule, the chain of carbon atoms is joined at the two ends to form a ring. Each ring usually contains just five or six carbon atoms, but rings can join together to form larger molecules. A cyclic molecule generally has higher boiling and melting points than straight-chain and branched-chain molecules. What is an answer for this question: Which sample would have higher boiling point, sample A or sample C? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, sample C, which is a cyclic molecule, would generally have a higher boiling point than sample A, a straight-chain molecule. This can be attributed to the structure and properties of cyclic molecules in comparison to straight-chain molecules. Cyclic molecules have carbon atoms arranged in rings, which often contain five or six carbon atoms. These rings can also join together to form larger molecules, resulting in more compact and rigid structures. On the other hand, straight-chain molecules consist of carbon atoms that form a linear \\"backbone,\\" resulting in a more flexible and less compact structure. The structural differences between these types of molecules impact their boiling points. In cyclic molecules, the compact and rigid arrangement of carbon atoms typically creates stronger intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals interactions and, in some cases, aromatic stacking interactions. These stronger forces generally require more energy to break, leading to a higher boiling point for cyclic molecules. In contrast, straight-chain molecules have weaker intermolecular forces due to their more flexible and less compact structures. As a result, these molecules generally require less energy to overcome the forces holding them together, resulting in lower boiling points compared to cyclic molecules. Therefore, in this case, sample C (cyclic molecule) is expected to have a higher boiling point than sample A (straight-chain molecule)."},{"prompt":"Q:M: Yes. Sometimes. I've got to be honest.

At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the Sunni branch) are found throughout the country whereas Albanian Orthodox Christians as well as Bektashis are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country. The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania. The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990. Question: \\"Historically, Albania enjoyed a general freedom of religion for how many centuries prior to Communism?\\" Answer: \\"9\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct.

News article: Dr. Benjamin Carson, the famed Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon, apologized Friday for his \\"choice of words\\" and use of examples in discussing gay marriage on Fox News earlier in the week. During Sean Hannity's show on Tuesday, when asked about the matter before the Supreme Court, Carson said, \\"Marriage is between a man and a woman. No group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality, it doesn't matter what they are. They don't get to change the definition.\\" The comparison of gays to members of the North American Boy/Man Love Association and those who engage in bestiality set off a backlash of criticism in the media, online and on campus. There is now a petition circulating at Johns Hopkins Medical to have Carson removed as commencement speaker in May at the School of Medicine. \\"I think people have completely taken the wrong meaning out of what I was saying,\\" the 61-year-old surgeon said in a telephone interview Friday. \\"First of all, I certainly believe gay people should have all the rights that anybody else has. What I was basically saying is that as far as marriage is concerned that has traditionally been between a man and a woman and nobody should be able to change that.\\" \\"Now perhaps the examples were not the best choice of words, and I certainly apologize if I offended anyone,\\" he added. \\"But the point that I was making was that no group of individuals, whoever they are, whatever their belief systems, gets to change traditional definitions. The reason I believe the way I do, I will readily confess, is because I am a Christian who believes in The Bible.\\" The Bible, he explained, \\"...says we have an obligation to love our fellow man as ourselves, and I love everybody the same -- all homosexuals. Everybody who knows me knows I would never say anything to intentionally hurt someone.\\" Given the \\"if I offended anyone\\" tone and language of the apology, it will be interesting to see how it's received. I hope readers will weigh in here. The Sun has also obtained a copy of the petition aimed at getting Carson, who is on the eve of retirement this spring, removed as a speaker at the School of Medicine graduation ceremonies in May. \\"At the time of his nomination, Dr. Carson was known to most of us as a world-class neurosurgeon and passionate advocate for education,\\" the petition says. \\"Many of us had read his books and looked up to him as a role model in our careers. Since then, however, several public events have cast serious doubt on the appropriateness of having Dr. Carson speak at our graduation. If you believe he is an inappropriate choice of speaker at a ceremony intended to celebrate the achievements of our class please complete the petition below.\\" When asked about the petition Friday, Carson told the Sun, \\"I've caught wind of it and I've sent back a message that this is their graduation, their big day, and if they think me being there is going to be a problem, I am happy to withdraw.\\" Speaking of his retirement plans, Carson said he has been speaking with several TV outlets about a career in media. In response to a direct question as to whether he is in discussions with Fox News, where he has been regularly featured since his appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast in February, he said, \\"I would simply say that there is more than one station that has asked if I would have any interest, and I am in the process of considering these things.\\" Carson expressed a \\"hope\\" that \\"we can get to a level where we can actually have an intelligent discussion without hysteria\\" on such issues as gay marriage. Good luck with that on highly partisan cable TV channels like Fox News and MSNBC. ||||| Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Ever since I joined the bonfire around Ben Carson's interview on Hannity—the one with the NAMBLA gaffe, you remember it—the occasional critic has told me to look back at the substance of the comment. Carson was making a typical slippery slope argument, asking where people would stop once they started redefining marriage. And, yes, Justice Sotomayor asked a question about this at Tuesday's oral argument. It's probably worth it to excerpt that exchange. David Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Olson, the bottom line that you're being asked -- and -- and it is one that I'm interested in the answer: If you say that marriage is a fundamental right, what State restrictions could ever exist? Meaning, what State restrictions with respect to the number of people, with respect to -- that could get married -- the incest laws, the mother and child, assuming that they are the age -- I can -- I can accept that the State has probably an overbearing interest on -- on protecting a child until they're of age to marry, but what's left? MR. OLSON: Well, you've said -- you've said in the cases decided by this Court that the polygamy issue, multiple marriages raises questions about exploitation, abuse, patriarchy, issues with respect to taxes, inheritance, child custody, it is an entirely different thing. And if you -- if a State prohibits polygamy, it's prohibiting conduct. If it prohibits gay and lesbian citizens from getting married, it is prohibiting their exercise of a right based upon their status. It's selecting them as a class, as you described in the Romer case and as you described in the Lawrence case and in other cases, you're picking out a group of individuals to deny them the freedom that you've said is fundamental, important and vital in this society, and it has status and stature, as you pointed out in the VMI case. Advertisement Right: The question is whether you accept some social science. One difference between a guy who wants to have six sister wives and a guy who's always been attracted to guys? The available research suggests that the second couple will raise well-adjusted children. The current thinking on pedophilia (to get back to Carson's NAMBLA) rereference is that, like homosexuality, it's innate. But that leads you to the question of child-rearing and other norms, and the homosexuality-pedophilia comparison withers away. Sotomayor and Olson tried to reason this out. Carson just sort of assumes the worst. In his book—which is actually competing with Sotomayor's on the bestseller list—he suggests that the effort to \\"redefine marriage as between two men or two women or any other way based on social pressures\\" played a part in the \\"dramatic fall of the Roman Empire.\\" That's just ahistorical: gay marriage was a legal deviance in the pagan era, banned by Constantius and Constans more than 100 years before the fall. Look: Being very good, world-historically good, at one thing does not make you a cross-platform expert. Donald Trump is very good at hosting TV shows in which celebrities humiliate themselves, but doesn't seem to know much about public policy. Carson's a brilliant neurosurgeon and a political dilletente. And that's okay! But this fact hurt him after one too many soft-focus Fox News interviews. ||||| Neurosurgeon Ben Carson apologized Friday for comments he made about gay marriage on Sean Hannity’s TV show earlier this week. “I think in terms of what was said on Sean Hannity’s show, that was taken completely out of context and completely misunderstood in terms of what I was trying to say,” Carson told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell. “As a Christian, I have a duty to love all people and that includes people who have other sexual orientations, and I certainly do, and never had any intention of offending anyone… If anyone was offended, I apologize to you.” Text Size - + reset TOP 5 ways to apologize in politics The John Hopkins doctor came under scrutiny when he appeared to liken homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality, sparking the outrage of the LGBT community. “My thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It’s a well-established fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality, it doesn’t matter what they are, they don’t get to change the definition,” the doctor, who is the director of pediatric neurosurgery, said on Hannity’s show Tuesday. His comments also led to a petition by students at Johns Hopkins University, who want him to be removed as commencement speaker, as was initially planned. Students, colleagues and the media alike have harshly criticized Carson for his choice of words. (Also on POLITICO: Ben Carson '16? Incredibly slim chance) “They make him look nasty, petty, and ill-informed. It doesn’t tell us anything about his amazing abilities as a surgeon,” Professor Todd Shepard, co-director of the university’s Program for the Study of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, said in a statement to Media Matters. “It does remind us, however, that those abilities do not mean we should listen to what he says in any other domain.” Carson said that he would “absolutely” withdraw as commencement speaker if necessary, saying the “last thing” he would want to do is “rain on their parade.” However, the doctor remained firmly rooted in his belief that the term “marriage” should not be extended to same-sex couples, although he said the couples should be treated “kindly” and have whatever legal agreements they desire in order to transfer property and have visitation rights, among other rights. (Also on POLITICO: Conservative pundits split on gay marriage) “Marriage is a very sacred thing and we need to maintain it as a sacred thing. When I say we don’t want to change it or degrade it by calling everything marriage, that’s not aimed at any particular group,” he said. “But the fact of the matter is, the Bible and God have set very specific standards. It’s very clear what’s being said. God doesn’t change, man changes. Our duty is to allow for that change and to still love them and in terms of what happens with them, that’s a decision that’s up to God, that’s not our decision.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Dr. Benjamin Carson, a renowned Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon, apologized for his choice of words and examples when discussing gay marriage on Fox News.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who opposed the inclusion in the 1991 draft of the Constitution of Belarus? , can you please find it? The term Belorussia (Russian: Белору́ссия, the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from Росси́я, Russia) first rose in the days of the Russian Empire, and the Russian Tsar was usually styled \\"the Tsar of All the Russias\\", as Russia or the Russian Empire was formed by three parts of Russia—the Great, Little, and White. This asserted that the territories are all Russian and all the peoples are also Russian; in the case of the Belarusians, they were variants of the Russian people.After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the term \\"White Russia\\" caused some confusion, as it was also the name of the military force that opposed the red Bolsheviks. During the period of the Byelorussian SSR, the term Byelorussia was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In western Belarus under Polish control, Byelorussia became commonly used in the regions of Białystok and Grodno during the interwar period.The term Byelorussia (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially until 1991, when the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called Republic of Belarus (Республика Беларусь spelled in Russian), and that its abridged form should be \\"Belarus\\". The law decreed that all the forms of the new term should be transliterated into other languages from their Belarusian language forms. The use of Byelorussian SSR and any abbreviations thereof were allowed from 1991 to 1993. Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the Constitution of Belarus.Accordingly, the name Byelorussia was replaced by Belarus in English. Likewise, the adjective Belorussian or Byelorussian was replaced by Belarusian in English. Belarusian is closer to the original Belarusian term of bielaruski. Belarusian intelligentsia in the Stalin era attempted to change the name from Byelorussia to a form of Krivia because of the supposed connection... The answer is:","completion":"Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus opposed the inclusion of the name change from Byelorussia to Belarus in the 1991 draft of the Constitution of Belarus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

There are not very many people who seriously read a newspaper every day. Most people read only the sports pages, the advice or the gossip columns, the comics, and perhaps the classified advertisements. Most people don't take the time to read the real news. They attempt to catch the reader's interest with pictures and exciting headlines. These techniques are used on the front page because it is the first thing you see when you pick up the paper. The first page attracts attention and encourages the reader to look through the rest of the paper. This is why editors always look for a good first page story and headline to make them stop and look. If the headline is horrible enough or frightening enough or wild enough, perhaps they will go on to read the front page anymore. They may read the headlines, but that is all, then they turn to the sports page, or comics, or advertisements. It seems that people do not want the news from a newspaper anymore. They say they get the news on the television now. More people watch television news because it is easier and more interesting than reading a newspaper. What about you?

Hypothesis: The hats are black. .Multi-select problem: Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true? Choices: * yes. * it is not possible to tell. * no.","completion":"Based on the information provided in the premise, we can analyze and provide a detailed answer to the multi-select problem concerning the hypothesis about the black hats. The premise states that two priests are wearing white robes and black hats, are clasping their hands, and appear to be leading a church service. Our task is to determine whether we can conclude that the hypothesis (the hats are black) is true if the premise is true. The hypothesis clearly states that the hats are black. According to the premise, the two priests are indeed wearing black hats. Since the hypothesis is derived directly from the information provided in the premise, we can safely ascertain the following: Yes - We can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The reasoning behind this conclusion is based on the fact that both the premise and the hypothesis indicate that the priests are wearing black hats. There is a clear consistency between the premise and the hypothesis in terms of the details about the hats' color. As a result, if the premise is deemed to be true, the hypothesis stating that the hats are black would be true as well. It is important to note that the answer is derived specifically from the premise being true and may not apply if the premise were to be altered or proven false. The other choices can be disregarded in this instance because: * It is not possible to tell - This choice can be dismissed as we have sufficient evidence and a clear connection between the premise and the hypothesis that allows us to reach a conclusion. * No - This choice can also be dismissed, as there is no contradiction or discrepancy between the premise and the hypothesis. The information given about the hats' color in both the premise and the hypothesis aligns accurately, leading to a consistent and definitive answer. In conclusion, based on the provided premise, we can ascertain that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The correlation between the premise and the hypothesis concerning the color of the priests' hats allows us to reach this result with confidence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Specific humidity (or moisture content) is the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the total mass of the moist air parcel.[13] Specific humidity is approximately equal to the mixing ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the mass of water vapor in an air parcel to the mass of dry air for the same parcel. As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases. As the temperature of a parcel of air becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass.

The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy. In 1939 military theorist Basil Liddell-Hart predicted that 250,000 deaths and injuries in Britain could occur in the first week of war.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose research at St. Helens formed the basis for his doctoral dissertation?, using the article: Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958 – June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist. He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \\"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches.

Context: New England went on the road to face division rival New York in the latest meeting between the two teams at the New Meadowlands Stadium. The Jets had lost their opener to the Baltimore Ravens the previous week. The Patriots droved 51 yards in seven-and-a-half minutes to the Jets 14, but after a false-start penalty, Gostkowski missed a 37-yard field goal. After a Jets three-and-out, the Patriots went on a 15 play, 75-yard marathon, taking over eight minutes off the clock, scoring on a 6-yard touchdown pass to Welker early in the second quarter. After accruing no passing yards during the first quarter, the Jets marched 73 yards in 12 plays, taking just under 7 minutes off the clock, scoring on a 10-yard touchdown pass from Mark Sanchez to Braylon Edwards. Two possessions later, after two incomplete passes, Brady hit Hernandez for a 46-yard catch-and-run, then hit Moss for a 34-yard touchdown pass on an incredible one-handed catch, beating the vaunted Darrelle Revis, re-taking a 14-7 lead. The Jets answered, marching to the Patriots 31, and Nick Folk was good on a 49-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 14-10 at halftime. After a Jets punt, the Patriots drove to the Jets 47, but Antonio Cromartie intercepted his pass attempt for Moss at the 3. The Jets raced to the Patriots 17, and Folk was good on a 36-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to just 14-13. The Jets cashed in after a Patriots three-and-out, racing 70 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jerricho Cotchery (with a successful 2-point conversion), taking a 21-14 lead. On the second play of the Patriots next drive, Cromartie intercepted another pass attempt for Moss at the Jets 41, but couldn't move the ball. After forcing the Patriots to punt, the Jets marched 63 yards in 8 plays, aided by a 23-yard pass interference penalty on Darius Butler, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown toss to Dustin Keller, widening the lead to 28-14 midway through the fourth quarter. The Patriots drove to the Jets 16, but Brady was strip-sacked by Jason Taylor with David Harris returning it 16 yards to the Jets 41. A 3-yard run by LaDanian Tomlinson on 4th-and-1 allowed the Jets ran out the rest of the clock to win the game. With the loss, the Patriots fell to 1-1. The Jets good defense forced the Patriots into three turnovers, two Brady interceptions. Question: Who kicked the longest field goal? Answer:","completion":"Nick Folk kicked the longest field goal, which was a 49-yard field goal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. feeling happy B. get hungry C. learning D. grow up E. injury Answer:","completion":"B. get hungry When Jimmy and Tim like playing together, they enjoy engaging in various activities that may include games, sports, or other forms of physical and mental exercise. These shared experiences serve a crucial role in fostering camaraderie, enhancing interpersonal relationships, and contributing to their overall well-being. Playing together for an extended period can be physically and mentally demanding, and such an engagement requires energy. As they participate in these activities, their bodies consume energy, which can lead to feelings of hunger. This natural response is primarily due to the body's need to obtain essential nutrients and fuel to continue functioning efficiently. Moreover, taking a break to eat and replenish their energy reserves allows their bodies to recuperate from the exertions experienced during playtime. Beyond merely satisfying hunger, the consumption of healthy meals also provides the necessary vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients that support various critical bodily functions, further emphasizing the importance of addressing hunger symptoms adequately. In conclusion, the most suitable option to answer the question is Option B, get hungry. This choice accurately reflects the biological response of needing nourishment after engaging in prolonged periods of play or physical exertion.

Article: You can completely submerge yourself in any body of water that is higher than you are tall, or that will cover your head when sitting (or even lying down, such as in a wading pool). The most important factor to consider for picking a spot is to observe your surroundings. Always approach holding your breath underwater with caution, especially in a crowded public pool where people are engaged in many different activities and not paying attention to others. If you want to sink to the bottom of a pool, you may think choosing a spot near the wall is safest. But, remember that people will be entering the water around all edges of a pool. It may be better to find a relatively isolated place, away from where people may be entering the water and away from large groups. Also, keep your distance from the pool drain, which can exert hundreds of pounds of suction and can cause injury and death.Have a friend keep an eye out for you while you’re below the surface. If you’re swimming underwater, keep an eye out for traffic and remember that other swimmers will not necessarily be looking out for you. Ideally you can chart a clear path ahead of you to the other side, one that will stay clear until you get there. If you're in the shallow side of the pool, you will likely be standing. If you're in a part of the pool where the water is higher than you are tall, your body will assume a vertical position with ease as, generally, your lower body will be heavier than your upper body. Do not hyperventilate. Taking several fast breaths in a row before submerging yourself is known as DUBB, \\"dangerous underwater breath-holding behaviors\\" and can cause hypoxic blackout, which can lead to brain damage, fainting, and death. Pull your knees in and hold them close to your chest by wrapping your arms around them. This tucked position changes the amount of space you're taking up in the water and will allow you to fall deeper into the water and to more easily remain underwater. Objects, and bodies, sink in water if they have a higher density than the body of water. An object's density depends on its mass and volume--the amount of space it takes up. As such, taking up less space in the water will help you sink. Release air bubbles slowly through your nose. You can let them out of your mouth as well and they can be bigger, but you'll sink faster. You may also do both and let out small bits of air, puffing your cheeks between blowing air out. Let your head and body sink into the water. When your feet hit the bottom of the pool, sit in a comfortable position, such as cross-legged or holding on to your knees in front of you. When you’re ready or running out of breath, look up to make sure nothing and no one is in your way to the pool’s surface. Whether seated or standing, press firmly into your feet and stretch your arms skyward to shoot or swim upwards. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is as follows: When submerging yourself in water, choose a safe and isolated spot away from people and pool drains. Have a friend monitor your safety, and be cautious of other swimmers when underwater. Avoid hyperventilating or engaging in dangerous breath-holding behaviors.

Daffy explains that he and other travelers settled there in secret several years earlier, but difficulties arose and he chose to leave. Daffy commits suicide, leaving Richard a map to the island. Richard convinces a young French couple, FranÃ§oise and Ãtienne, to accompany him to the island, and the three travel to Ko Samui. Richard meets two Americans who have heard rumors of the island, including that huge amounts of cannabis supposedly grow there. Before departing, Richard leaves them a copy of the map.

Avoiding detection, they make their way across the island and are welcomed into the secret beach settlement.

However, it doesn't provide enough evidence to conclude that it directly entails the hypothesis \\"I like the open air during the spring mostly.\\" To analyze this further, let's break down the components of the premise and hypothesis. Premise: 1. The person enjoys being outdoors and experiencing the open air. 2. The person prefers a specific range of weather conditions, i.e., weather not too hot, not raining, or other unfavorable conditions. Hypothesis: 1. The person likes the open air primarily during the spring season. Now, let's try to connect these components. The premise tells us that the individual likes to spend time in the open air and prefers particular weather conditions that are neither too hot nor rainy. From this statement, we can infer that their preference for open-air activities possibly lies within a specific range of temperature and moisture levels. It is thus reasonable to assume that they enjoy spending time outdoors when the conditions are favorable, which often includes balanced temperatures and moderate levels of precipitation or humidity. The given hypothesis asserts that the person likes the open air mostly during the spring season. Spring typically encompasses mild temperatures and moderate precipitation, which aligns with the preference detailed in the premise. However, there are other seasons where the weather conditions might also suit the person's preferences, such as in the mild days of autumn or even during early summer, depending on the local climate. That said, the premise doesn't explicitly mention any seasonal preferences, nor does it identify spring as the preferred time for outdoor activities. While it is true that spring generally exhibits weather conditions that meet the criteria described in the premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is inherently entailed by the premise. There might be other seasons which still fall within the favorable conditions mentioned in the premise. In summary, the premise gives us an insight into the person's preferences surrounding weather conditions for open-air activities, but it does not provide enough information to ascertain if spring is their favorite and primary season for outdoor ventures. However, we can acknowledge that the spring season aligns with their preferences, but there can be other seasons that might fit their preference as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers.

Title: The Rocketeer Movie plot: In 1938 Los Angeles, two gangsters in Eddie Valentine's gang steal a rocket pack from Howard Hughes. During their escape, they find themselves on an airfield, where they hide the rocket pack, ending in an auto-airplane accident while escaping, with the police in hot pursuit. Stunt pilot Cliff Secord, whose Gee Bee racer was totaled during the accident, and airplane mechanic Peevy later find the rocket pack hidden in a bi-plane cockpit. Meanwhile, well-known actor Neville Sinclair, who hired Valentine's gang to steal the rocket pack, sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver, who tells him that the rocket pack is at the airfield. Cliff's aspiring actress girlfriend, Jenny Blake, has a bit part in the latest Neville Sinclair film. On the set, Sinclair overhears Cliff attempting to tell Jenny about the rocket pack, so he invites her to dinner. Afterward, at a local air show, Cliff uses the rocket pack (and Peevy's newly designed face-hiding finned helmet) to rescue his friend Malcolm, who is drunkenly piloting a bi-plane. Having been seen by the newsreel press in the airshow audience (and Valentine's gangsters), \\"The Rocketeer\\" becomes a media sensation. Sinclair sends Lothar to Cliff and Peevy's home to find the rocket pack. The FBI arrives, but Cliff and Peevy escape, while Lothar steals its detailed schematics drawn up by Peevy. Later, at the airfield diner, Cliff and Peevy, trapped by several Valentine mobsters, learn that Jenny had a date with Sinclair, and of the actor's involvement in the hunt for the rocket pack. The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, while a bullet ricochet punctures the rocket's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with Cliff's chewing gum.[Note 1] At Sinclair's home, Jenny discovers that he is a Nazi secret agent, and Jenny knocks him out. She is later detained and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring the rocket pack to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life. Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Howard Hughes,... A:","completion":"Neville Sinclair"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Information: - The Northern Hemisphere is the half of Earth that is north of the equator. For other planets in the Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North pole. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March Equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice (typically June 21 UTC) through to the September equinox (typically September 23 UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year. - Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. Bears are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails. - Claudius Ptolemy (\\"Klaúdios Ptolemaîos\\", ; ) was a Greek writer, known as a mathematician, astronomer, geographer, astrologer, and poet of a single epigram in the Greek Anthology. He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, wrote in Koine Greek, and held Roman citizenship. Beyond that, few reliable details of his life are known. His birthplace has been given as Ptolemais Hermiou in the Thebaid in an uncorroborated statement by the 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes. This is a very late attestation, however, and there is no other reason to suppose that he ever lived anywhere else than Alexandria, where he died around AD 168. - Ursa Major (also known as the Great Bear) is a constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. One of the 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy (second century AD), it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It can be visible throughout the year in most of the northern hemisphere. Its name, Latin for \\"the greater (or larger) she-bear\\", stands as a reference to and in direct contrast with Ursa Minor, \\"the lesser she-bear\\", with which it is frequently associated in mythology and amateur astronomy. The constellation's most recognizable asterism, a group of seven relatively bright stars commonly known as the \\"Big Dipper\\", \\"the Wagon\\" or \\"the Plough\\" (among others), both mimics the shape of the lesser bear (the \\"Little Dipper\\") and is commonly used as a navigational pointer towards the current northern pole star, Polaris in Ursa Minor. The Big Dipper and the constellation as a whole have mythological significance in numerous world cultures, usually as a symbol of the north. - Polaris, designated Alpha Ursae Minoris (Ursae Minoris, abbreviated Alpha UMi, UMi), commonly the North Star or Pole Star, is the brightest star in the constellation of Ursa Minor. It is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star. The revised Hipparcos parallax gives a distance to Polaris of about 433 light-years (133 parsecs), while calculations by other methods derive distances around 30% closer. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Ursa Minor (Latin: \\"lesser-Bear\\", contrasting with Ursa Major), also known as the Little Bear, is a constellation in the Northern Sky. Like the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the North American name, Little Dipper: seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the Big Dipper. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation, particularly by mariners, because of Polaris being the North Star. - In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with Earth. All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances are unknown or unimportant. - In modern astronomy, the sky (celestial sphere) is divided into 88 regions called constellations, generally based on the asterisms (which are also called \\"constellations\\") of Greek and Roman mythology. Those along the ecliptic are the constellations of the zodiac. - Amateur astronomy is a hobby whose participants enjoy watching the sky, and the abundance of objects found in it with the unaided eye, binoculars, or telescopes. Even though scientific research is not their main goal, many amateur astronomers make a contribution to astronomy by monitoring variable stars, tracking asteroids and discovering transient objects, such as comets and novae. - The International Astronomical Union (IAU UAI) is an international association of professional astronomers, at the PhD level and beyond, active in professional research and education in astronomy. Among other activities, it acts as the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, etc.) and any surface features on them. - NGC 4194 , the Medusa merger , is a pair of interacting galaxies in the constellation Ursa Major . A region of extreme star formation 500 ly ( 150 pc ) across exists in the center of the Eye of Medusa , the central gas - rich region . - A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names. - The Big Dipper (US) or Plough (UK) is an asterism consisting of the seven brightest stars of the constellation Ursa Major; six of them are of second magnitude and one, Megrez (), of third magnitude. Four define a \\"bowl\\" or \\"body\\" and three define a \\"handle\\" or \\"head\\". It is recognized as a distinct grouping in many cultures.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who was influenced by Slayer? As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music.... The answer to this question is:","completion":"The last name of the person who was influenced by Slayer is Åkerfeldt.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What element of Revolver did Klaus Voorman design? Almost as soon as they returned home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave. \\"Christianity will go,\\" Lennon had said. \\"It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. ... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.\\" The comment went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine Datebook printed it five months later – on the eve of the group's August US tour – it sparked a controversy with Christians in the American \\"Bible Belt\\". The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon's words out of context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, \\"If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it.\\" Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: \\"If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry.\\"As preparations were made for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling to compete with the volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last.

Information: - George Dilboy ( Americanized transliteration of Greek name : ) , ( February 5 , 1896 -- July 18 , 1918 ) , Private First Class , U.S. Army , Company H , 103d Infantry , 26th Division is thought to be the first Greek - American to receive the Medal of Honor during World War I. He led an attack on a machine gun position and continued to fire at the enemy despite being seriously wounded , killing two of the enemy and dispersing the remainder of the gun crew . General John Pershing listed George Dilboy as \`\` one of the ten great heroes '' who \`\` died in the battlefield of France with super-human heroism and valor . '' Dilboy is buried in Section 18 of Arlington National Cemetery . - Arlington National Cemetery is a United States military cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., in whose the dead of the nation's conflicts have been buried, beginning with the American Civil War, as well as reinterred dead from earlier wars. The United States Department of the Army, a component of the United States Department of Defense, controls the cemetery. - A battle rifle is a military service rifle that fires a full-power rifle cartridge, such as 7.62×51mm NATO, 7.62×54mmR, 7.92x57mm Mauser, .303 British, or .30-06 Springfield. Compared to assault rifles and their intermediate cartridges, the higher-caliber rounds provide greater power and range, though they have greater weight and produce stronger recoil, making them less than ideal for fully automatic fire. - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags - Genocide is intentional action to destroy a people (usually defined as an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group) in whole or in part. The hybrid word \\"genocide\\" is a combination of the Greek word \\"génos\\" (\\"race, people\\") and the Latin suffix \\"-cide\\" (\\"act of killing\\"). The United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as \\"acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group\\". - The Department of the Army (DA) is one of the three military departments within the Department of Defense of the United States of America. The Department of the Army is the Federal Government agency within which the United States Army is organized, and it is led by the Secretary of the Army who has statutory authority to conduct its affairs and to prescribe regulations for its government, subject to the limits of the law, and the directions of the Secretary of Defense and the President. - A machine gun is a fully automatic mounted or portable firearm, designed to fire bullets in quick succession from an ammunition belt or magazine, typically at a rate of 300 to 1800 rounds per minute. Fully automatic firearms are generally categorized as submachine guns, assault rifles, battle rifles, automatic shotguns, machine guns, or autocannons. Machine guns with multiple rotating barrels are referred to as \\"rotary machine guns\\". - The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions. - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing. - An autocannon or automatic cannon is a large, fully automatic, rapid-fire projectile weapon that fires armour-piercing or explosive shells, as opposed to the bullet fired by a machine gun. Autocannons often have a larger calibre than a machine gun (e.g., 20 mm or greater), but are usually smaller than a field gun or other artillery. When used on its own, the word \\"autocannon\\" indicates a single-barrel weapon. When multiple rotating barrels are involved, the word \\"rotary\\" is added, and such a weapon is referred to as a \\"rotary autocannon.\\" Modern autocannons are typically not single soldier-portable or stand-alone units, rather they are usually vehicle-mounted, aircraft-mounted, or boat-mounted, or even remote-operated as in some naval applications. As such, ammunition is typically fed from a belt to reduce reloading or for a faster rate of fire, but a magazine remains an option. They can use a variety of ammunition: common shells include high-explosive dual-purpose types (HEDP), any variety of armour-piercing (AP) types, such as composite rigid (APCR) or discarding sabot types (APDS). - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - A submachine gun (SMG) is an air-cooled, magazine-fed, automatic carbine designed to fire pistol cartridges. The term \\"submachine gun\\" was coined by John T. Thompson, the inventor of the Thompson submachine gun. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. - The word bullet is a firearm term. A bullet is a projectile expelled from the barrel of a firearm. The term is from Middle French and originated as the diminutive of the word boulle (boullet) which means \\"small ball.\\" Bullets are made of a variety of materials. They are available singly as they would be used in muzzle loading and cap and ball firearms, as part of a paper cartridge, and much more commonly as a component of metallic cartridges. Bullets are made in a large numbers of styles and constructions depending on how they will be used. Many bullets have specialized functions, such as hunting, target shooting, training, defense, and warfare. - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch.

Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS. Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \\"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

Write highlights for this article: Surfing was virtually non-existent in Iran when Easkey Britton first traveled to the 'ultra-conservative' country in 2010. The Irish surfer expected to face anger and disapproval in the Muslim nation where televising female sports is forbidden. Just last year, a woman was jailed simply for watching a men's volleyball match. But the 29-year-old was shocked to discover a welcoming country as eager to learn the sport as she was to teach them. Overwhelmed by the reaction she returned three years later with filmmaker Marion Poizeau and two female Iranian athletes - professional snowboarder Mona Seraji and diver Shahla Yasini. Marion's documentary 'Into the Sea' charts their incredible journey to the shores of Baluchistan, an area considered so deadly 'even Iranians don't go there'. Scroll down for video. First lesson: Easkey Britton (centre) teaches professional snowboarder Mona Seraji (left) and diver Shahla Yasini (right) how to surf. Acceptance: Men, women and children gathered on Baluchistan's beach to watch Easkey (centre) surf. Letting go: The director of 'Into the Sea' Marion Poizeau told MailOnline: 'A lot of them (children) were very shy at first, but by the time we got into the water, that was gone' Baby steps: Professional surfer Easkey (right) believes young Baluchi girls like this 'are no longer on the sidelines' Making waves: One of Easkey's students Shahla Yasini (pictures) prepares for another ride in Baluchistan. Eager to learn: Easkey (right) teaches a group of young Baluchi boys about surfing as professional snowboarder Mona (left) translates. Champion: Easkey Britton (pictured) was introduced to surfing by her father at the tender age of four and won the Irish National Surfing Championships four consecutive times by 2008. Marion told MailOnline: 'In Tehran, people were saying you're crazy to go to Baluchistan because it's considered a very dangerous place. 'So when I screened my film in the capital, people were saying we didn't know you could go to Baluchistan and come back alive.' Despite its fearsome reputation as a site of brutal secular fighting between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, there is little alternative to the region's 60-mile stretch of sand and five foot waves. For the country's surf-obsessed, it is becoming a necessary pilgrimage. A large crowd began to gather during Mona and Shahla's first lesson under Easkey's expert guidance. They predicted some opposition in the remote section of a largely male-dominated country, but the locals in Chabahar were simply intrigued. Women are allowed to wear bathing suits in Iran's female-only swimming pools and baths, but traditional head-coverings are mandatory on public beaches where men are present. Hundreds stormed the beach to watch the three women riding the waves in their wet-suits and hijabs. And soon the Baluchi locals were begging to take part themselves. The growth of the sport means 'Baluchi girls and women are no longer on the sidelines' according to Easkey, a five-time national champion in her native Ireland. She added: 'Fathers are asking me to take their daughters surfing. 'What is most inspiring is the enthusiasm and vision of young people here, with the young women playing an important change-making role, leading the way in a new frontier sport, writing a new narrative full of possibility despite being ignored by the world outside and limited by the constraints of their own country.' Parting gift: Easkey (pictured) presented her surfboard to local lawmaker Yaqoub Jadgal, who said: 'It (sport) is not just for men, women can do sports too with the hijab and female instructors' Causing a stir: Hundreds of local Baluchi people gathered for a surfing lesson from Easkey Britton. Leading the way: Easkey Britton (pictured) said: 'What is most inspiring is the enthusiasm and vision of young people here' Going pro: Diver Shahla Yasini rides a wave on the beach in Baluchistan, considered one of the most dangerous places in Iran. Iranian hospitality: Easkey Britton (top right) and her two students Mona Seraji (centre) and diver Shahla Yasini (left) were invited to dine with a local Baluchi family. But her first surf with Mona and Shahla caused quite a stir and when the village elders and a 'powerful' member of parliament requested to meet them Easkey expected the worst. She was again overwhelmed by the tolerance shown by Yaqoub Jadgal, who said: 'Islam recommends sports, which are beneficial both physically and spiritually. It is not just for men, women can do sports too with the hijab and female instructors. 'We will ask female instructors to teach women this sport so they can benefit from this art.' The 'thumbs up' from the community's senior figures mirrored the government's acceptance when they allowed for Marion's film to be screened at the Tehran Film Festival last year. It had such a wide-reaching impact she's now involved in a bid to launch the country's first female surfing federation. She said: 'Hopefully we can organise an international event in the future and convince more Iranians to come with us... but we don't know when it's going to happen because the administration is tricky.' The sport's growing popularity has surprised Easkey, who 'never could have imagined' a religiously devout nation could adopt such a progressive sport into their hearts. Big hit: Marion's film 'Into the Sea' (pictured) was screened at the Tehran Documentary Festival last year. Change: The film was received wonderfully by critics after being screened in a country where even televising female sports is forbidden. She says during 'Into the Sea': 'I came here three years ago and there was nobody surfing and now look at it. More and more people are on the beach every day - boys, girls, everyone joining in. 'People say surfing is a selfish pursuit, it becomes kind of like an addiction and all you care about is finding the next perfect wave, but I really don't believe that anymore. 'I think the most powerful thing about surfing is being able to share that passion and connecting people. This is unbelievable.' Marion added: 'It was very exciting the last day, half the village came to watch the girls surf and the kids were very enthusiastic. 'A lot of them were very shy at first, but by the time we got into the water, that was gone. 'It really breaks down the barriers when we go into the water, it's totally different from the beach. It makes people forget about the rules.' Inspired by their own success, Easkey and Marion also set up the non-profit organisationWaves of Freedom. In its own words, the charity 'uses surfing as a medium for empowerment, transforming the most vulnerable and marginalised members of society, especially women and girls'. Through their first project Surf Seeds, they are trying to establish surfing in Baluchistan through the donation of equipment, formal lessons and workshops on how to build and create surfboards. The two women also created the 'We Surf in Iran' group within the local community in Baluchistan. Now, Iranians travel from all over the country to get lessons in the region they were once afraid of. You can watch the film's trailer HERE.

I remember waiting anxiously as my teacher Mr. Right passed out our papers one by one. It was a rather difficult test. I heard my classmates groaning , and I could tell by the groans that the scores weren't looking good. Mr. Right put my paper on my desk. There in big red numbers, circled to draw attention, was my score, 55! I lowered my head, and covered the score up quickly. A 55 is not something that you wanted your classmates to see. \\"The scores were not very good, none of you passed,\\" Mr. Right said. \\"The highest score in the class was a 55.\\" A 55. That's me! Suddenly my sad look didn't look so bad. I had the highest score. I felt a lot better. I walked home alone that day with the low but high score. My father knew that I had a big test that day and asked me as soon as I got home, \\"How did you do in your test?\\" \\"I made a 55,\\" I said. A frown now stood on my father's face.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases. Now, I have a new situation: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors. Answer this question please: Which student read more about reactant particles being heated? Answer:","completion":"Sean read more about reactant particles being heated. This is because his study focused on the influence of temperature on chemical reactions, which directly relates to the heating of reactant particles and how it affects reaction rates.

Sentence 2: Type-3 worksharing is when the mailer decides something is influenced by something other than the size of discount or his cost of work. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Both sentences describe Type-3 worksharing, but they provide slightly different perspectives on the concept. The first sentence focuses more on the decision-making process of the mailer and the factors that influence it, whereas the second sentence simplifies the concept into a more general definition. In order to assess the truth of the second sentence based on the first sentence, let's analyze both sentences in detail. Sentence 1: Type-3 worksharing is where the mailer's decision, whether or not he turns the mail over to a competitor, is influenced by factors other than the size of the discount and his cost of doing the work. This sentence explains that Type-3 worksharing involves a mailer's decision-making process, in which the mailer must decide whether or not to hand over mail to a competitor. The factors that influence this decision do not revolve solely around the size of the discount or the mailer's cost of doing the work, suggesting that there are other variables at play. Sentence 2: Type-3 worksharing is when the mailer decides something is influenced by something other than the size of discount or his cost of work. This sentence offers a more simplified explanation of Type-3 worksharing. It states that the mailer's decision is influenced by factors other than the size of the discount and the cost of work, which aligns with the idea presented in the first sentence. However, it doesn't specifically mention the context of turning mail over to a competitor. Instead, it offers a more generalized idea of what factors influence the mailer's decision. Comparing both sentences, we can conclude that the second sentence is indeed true, as it captures the essence of Type-3 worksharing—that a mailer's decision is affected by factors other than the size of the discount and the cost of work. However, it is important to note that while the second sentence is true, it is less detailed and specific compared to the first sentence that provides context in terms of turning the mail over to a competitor. So, it can be said that the second sentence is true, but it offers a less comprehensive understanding of Type-3 worksharing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Deep house's origins can be traced to Chicago producer Mr Fingers's relatively jazzy, soulful recordings \\"Mystery of Love\\" (1985) and \\"Can You Feel It?\\" (1986). According to author Richie Unterberger, it moved house music away from its \\"posthuman tendencies back towards the lush\\" soulful sound of early disco music.Acid house arose from Chicago artists' experiments with the squelchy Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer, and the style's origins on vinyl is generally cited as Phuture's \\"Acid Tracks\\" (1987). Phuture, a group founded by Nathan \\"DJ Pierre\\" Jones, Earl \\"Spanky\\" Smith Jr., and Herbert \\"Herb J\\" Jackson, is credited with having been the first to use the TB-303 in the house music context. The group's 12-minute \\"Acid Tracks\\" was recorded to tape and was played by DJ Ron Hardy at the Music Box, where Hardy was resident DJ. Hardy once played it four times over the course of an evening until the crowd responded favorably. The track also utilized a Roland TR-707 drum machine. Club play of house tracks by pioneering Chicago DJs such as Hardy and Lil Louis, local dance music record shops such as Importes Etc., State Street Records, Loop Records, Gramaphone Records and the popular Hot Mix 5 shows on radio station WBMX-FM helped popularize house music in Chicago. Later, visiting DJs and producers from Detroit fell into the genre. Trax Records and DJ International Records, Chicago labels with wider distribution, helped popularize house music inside and outside of Chicago. One 1986 house tune called \\"Move Your Body\\" by Marshall Jefferson, taken from the appropriately titled \\"The House Music Anthem\\" EP, became a big hit in Chicago and eventually worldwide. By 1986, UK labels were releasing house music by Chicago acts, and by 1987 house tracks by Chicago DJs and producers were appearing on and topping the UK music chart. By this time, house music released by Chicago-based labels was considered a must-play in clubs.

The Holy Roman Empire was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806. The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany, though it also came to include the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of Burgundy, the Kingdom of Italy, and numerous other territories. On 25 December 800, Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as Emperor, reviving the title in Western Europe, more than three centuries after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The title continued in the Carolingian family until 888 and from 896 to 899, after which it was contested by the rulers of Italy in a series of civil wars until the death of the last Italian claimant, Berengar, in 924. The title was revived in 962 when Otto I was crowned emperor, fashioning himself as the successor of Charlemagne and beginning a continuous existence of the empire for over eight centuries. Some historians refer to the coronation of Charlemagne as the origin of the empire, while others prefer the coronation of Otto I as its beginning.

Kulwicki grew up in Greenfield, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee known for its Polish-American neighborhoods, near the Milwaukee Mile racetrack. After his mother died, his family moved in with his grandmother, who died when Kulwicki was in seventh grade. A year later, his only brother died of a hemophilia-related illness. Kulwicki attended Pius XI High School, a Roman Catholic high school in Milwaukee, and received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1977. Kulwicki began his racing career as a 13-year-old kart racer. His father built engines as the crew chief for Norm Nelson and Roger McCluskey's United States Automobile Club (USAC) racecars. Because his work involved travel, Kulwicki's father was unable to help his son at most kart races, so Kulwicki's resourcefulness was often tested trying to find someone to transport his kart to the track. Even when Kulwicki asked his father for advice, he typically ended up doing most of the work himself. \\"I showed him how\\", Gerry Kulwicki said. \\"And he said: 'Why don't you do it? You can do it better.' And I said, 'Well, if you do it for a while, you can do it better.'\\" Many local-level American racetracks host their own season championships. In Wisconsin, numerous locations held dirt and asphalt short track racing. Kulwicki started driving stock cars at the local level at the Hales Corners Speedway and Cedarburg Speedway dirt oval tracks. In 1973, he won the rookie of the year award at Hales Corners Speedway in the Milwaukee suburb of Franklin, and the next year started racing late models - the fastest and most complicated type of stock cars raced at the local level - at the same track. That season, he won his first feature race, at Leo's Speedway in Oshkosh. Kulwicki moved from dirt tracks to paved tracks in 1977. He also teamed up with racecar builder Greg Krieger to research, model, engineer, and construct an innovative car with far more torsional stiffness than other late models. The increased stiffness allowed the car to handle better in the corners, which increased its speed. Racing at Slinger Super Speedway, he won the track championship in 1977. In 1978, Kulwicki returned to Slinger; that same year he started racing a late model at Wisconsin International Raceway (WIR), finishing third in points in his rookie season at the track. In 1979 and 1980, he won the WIR late model track championships. In 1979, Kulwicki began competing in regional to national level events sanctioned by the USAC Stock Car series and the American Speed Association (ASA), while remaining an amateur racer through 1980. When Kulwicki raced against future NASCAR champion Rusty Wallace in the ASA series, the two became friends. Kulwicki's highest finish in the ASA season points championship was third place, which he accomplished in both 1982 and 1985, with five career victories and twelve pole positions. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"What was Kulwicki's highest finish in the ASA season points championship and how many career victories and pole positions did he have?"},{"prompt":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: When a friend tells you she has wild roses blooming everywhere, it’s not hard to imagine where the conversation headed to next… to turning them into rose petal jam, of course. My friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour’s drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey. It wasn’t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees — little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack. With the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona’s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources — Pellegrino Artusi’s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice’s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns. The secret, other than having beautiful, small and fragrant roses to begin with, is in massaging the petals with a bit of the sugar and the lemon juice until almost a pulp to release the essential oils.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable.

Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said.

But recent price comparisons have shown identical items are often priced more than 20 per cent higher in Canada than in the U.S. Retailers have defended their prices, saying the price difference is linked to high shipping costs and inventory acquired before the dollar hit parity. Last week, two of Canada's biggest retailers â Wal-Mart and Zellers â announced they were dropping prices on some goods to reflect the loonie's rise.Â Eleanor Friedland, vice-president of the Consumers Council of Canada, said Tuesday consumers should continue to push for lower prices, and she urged retailers to respond. \\"Sometimes for good public relations the retailer is doing it, they may call it a sale, or a special day or what have you, but they are doing it,\\" she said. \\"Consumers keep those voices heard.\\" Friedland also noted that prices will only fall if manufacturers act first. \\"I'd like to see Mr. Flaherty take a very strong hand, but I understand the retailers' argument,\\" she said Monday. \\"I want to see Mr. Flaherty speaking to the manufacturers and pushing them. Once he does that, you'll see it come pushing through, and I think it will be across the board.\\"","completion":"Canadian retailers argue that Federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty's efforts to align Canadian and American prices are misdirected, as he should instead focus on pressuring manufacturers to reduce prices in Canada. Diane Brisebois, President of the Retail Council of Canada, claims that manufacturers continue to mark up prices in the country by 20-50%, which makes it difficult for retailers to offer any significant savings to customers. The price difference is also said to be due to high shipping costs and pre-dollar parity inventory. Despite this, retailers such as Wal-Mart and Zellers have started to drop prices on some items as a result of the rising value of the Canadian dollar."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The lighting was dim, and the tables and floors were noticeably dirty. One would expect better hygiene, especially in a dining establishment. The service was extremely slow, with the waitstaff rarely checking on us and taking way too long to take our order. Throughout the meal, we had to ask for refills multiple times as our glasses sat empty. As for the food, I was even more let down. The lobster, which should have been the star of the meal, was overcooked and dry, lacking any flavor or moisture. Additionally, the side dishes were bland and under-seasoned, making for an utterly forgettable dining experience. Overall, I cannot recommend The Lazy Lobster, as its lackluster atmosphere, poor service, and subpar food left us wanting more – and not in a good way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As he arrives, a young woman named Felina (Karina Lombard) crosses the street, catching Smith's eye. Moments later, a group of Irish mobsters, led by Finn (Patrick Kilpatrick), surround Smith's car. They warn him against staring at \\"Doyle's property\\" and puncture his tires and smash his windshield. Smith leaves his car in the street and goes to speak with Sheriff Ed Galt (Bruce Dern). Sheriff Galt doesn't bother to conceal his cowardice or corruption, saying he won't act against Doyle's gang and advises Smith to wait for his car to be repaired and to leave town. Instead, Smith walks to the town hotel, run by Joe Monday (William Sanderson) where Smith orders a drink, books himself a room, and arms himself before announcing his intention to petition Finn for damages. Smith enters Doyle's building, finds Finn, and asks him to pay for the damages to his car. Finn mocks him and threatens to shoot Smith. Smith and Finn get in a gunfight, which Smith wins with alarming speed. Smith departs, leaves the remaining gangsters alive as witnesses, and returns to the hotel bar, much to the surprise of Jericho's residents. Following Finn's death, Fredo Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg), the head of Jericho's Italian gang, offers Smith a job in his outfit. Strozzi predicts a gang war between his and Doyle's gang, and is hiring as many skilled soldiers as he can. Smith accepts the job and sits down to dinner with the Strozzi gang where he meets Giorgio Carmonte (Michael Imperioli), son of a prominent Chicago mobster who is monitoring Strozzi's activities in Jericho.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging. Question: What is probably true about John?

Dr Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said that people should then go on to reduce their meat consumption even further. Pachauri, who was re-elected the panel's chairman for a second six-year term last week, said diet change was important because of the huge greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental problems associated with raising cattle and other animals. \\"It was relatively easy to change eating habits compared to changing means of transport,\\" he said. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation has estimated that meat production accounts for nearly a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions. These are produced during the production. For example, ruminants , particularly cows, give off a gas called methane, which is 23 times more effective as a global warming agent than CO2. Pachauri can expect some opposite responses from the food industry to his advice, though last night he was given unexpected support by Masterchef presenter and restaurateur John Torode. \\"I have a little bit and enjoy it,\\" said Torode. \\"Too much for any person is bad. But there's a bigger issue here: where the meat comes from. If we all bought British and stopped buying imported food, we'd save a huge amount of carbon emissions.\\" Professor Robert Watson, the chief scientific adviser for the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, said government could help educate people about the benefits of eating less meat, but it should not regulate. \\"Eating less meat would help, there's no question about that,\\" Watson said.

Supreme Court ruled in his favour, backing previous Appeal Court ruling. Employers now cannot ask about certain minor or old convictions. Article:","completion":"Title: Supreme Court Ruling Supports Privacy of Minor Convictions in Employment Screening Introduction: In a recent Supreme Court case, the justices ruled in favor of a man, identified only as 'T', who was forced to disclose minor cautions to new employers. This decision has significant implications for job seekers and employers, as this ruling now prevents businesses from asking about certain minor or old convictions during the hiring process. Step 1: Present the issue: The issue at the heart of this case involved 'T', who complained that being forced to reveal past cautions to new employers breached his human rights. Before the Supreme Court's ruling, companies could inquire about an applicant's criminal history, regardless of the seriousness or age of the convictions. Step 2: Explain the Supreme Court decision: The Supreme Court's ruling supported a previous Appeal Court decision, backing 'T' in his claim that mandatory disclosure of past offences violated his human rights. Justices acknowledged that while businesses have legitimate reasons to ensure the integrity and safety of their workforce, this should not come at the cost of unfairly stigmatizing individuals with minor offences in their past. Step 3: Detail changes to the employment screening process: As a result of this ruling, employers are now prohibited from inquiring about certain minor or old convictions during the hiring process. This change is driven by the belief that individuals should not be continually punished for past mistakes that have already been paid for, provided they have demonstrated rehabilitation and growth. Step 4: Explain potential benefits for job seekers and employers: This ruling is expected to benefit job seekers who have been held back due to the stigma attached to criminal records, especially among those with minor or old convictions. It also promotes fairness in the job market, as all applicants are now granted an equal opportunity to demonstrate their skills and qualifications without the weight of past mistakes. Moreover, employers can benefit from a more diverse and inclusive workforce. Step 5: Provide a conclusion: In conclusion, the Supreme Court's ruling on the matter of disclosing past offences to new employers has created a more equitable environment in the job market. By preventing companies from asking about minor and old convictions, the court has recognized the importance of granting individuals with criminal records a second chance, protecting their human rights, and demonstrating compassion and understanding for those who have demonstrated personal growth and rehabilitation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The continued rush to purchase firearms in Colorado has overwhelmed the system businesses use to track background check wait times and left thousands of would-be gun buyers on wait-lists that are now many days long. While staff at the Colorado Bureau of Investigation continue to track the time manually, the information is no longer readily available to gun dealers. The result is that would-be customers no longer know how long they will have to wait to see if a background check clears. Thousands of customers remain on the wait list at least 100 hours long. And with a major gun show coming to metro Denver this weekend, those expecting to walk away with a new firearm that day may be in for a surprise. The uncharted territory in which the state's gun sellers now find themselves stems from unprecedented interest in guns and CBI's online wait-time clock, which tops out at 99 hours and 59 minutes. Weeks ago, the background-check process took minutes to complete. Now, CBI's processing time has moved beyond that 99-hour-and-59 minute threshold. This news comes as one of Colorado's largest and longest-running gun shows heads into town. The Tanner Gun Show will be held at the Denver Merchandise Mart this weekend. \\"This is new,\\" said Ty Blount, co-owner of the show. \\"The process usually take hours to half a day.\\" Advertisement Blount said the situation means that dealers will either mail a patron's gun or agree to meet them another time once their background check has cleared. While he realizes some may be frustrated by the change, it is important a background check be run on every person attempting to buy a gun, he said. Background checks at gun shows in some other states aren't required — leading to the national call to close the so-called \\"gun show loophole\\" — but in Colorado, that loophole was closed following the Columbine High School shooting. \\"It's the same whether you're going to a gun show or to Cabela's,\\" Blount said. While gun buyers flooded CBI with requests for background checks on Black Friday, the latest surge follows the Dec. 14 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre and an outcry for more stringent gun-control laws. Since that time, the bureau has expanded its hours of operation from 6 a.m. to midnight, said spokeswoman Susan Medina. About 3,000 checks are being submitted a day — \\"these are unprecedented numbers,\\" Medina said on Sunday. For perspective, on Dec. 15, there were 573 background checks for firearm purchases in the CBI queue, Medina said. Wait times were just over 15 minutes. Background checks are cross-referenced through federal and local law-enforcement databases. Checks to be processed will remain in the system until they are approved or denied, Medina said.

Moves Up Its Gun Buyback Program in Wake of the Newtown Shootings Mall parking lots were packed with after-Christmas shoppers. But nowhere were the lines longer than at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and the Van Nuys Masonic Temple, where thousands of people came to exchange their guns for Ralphs gift cards. Cars queued up for blocks at the drive-through events, with the city giving cards worth up to 100 for handguns, shotguns and rifles, and up to 200 for assault weapons. There was a bit of haggling involved, but the guns were all taken. \\"What do you got?\\" an officer in Van Nuys asked a man in his late twenties as he pulled up in a green Mazda. Photos: L.A. gun buyback \\"Just one handgun, I've had it since high school,\\" the man replied. \\"Will you take 50 for this?\\" \\"Sure.\\" Many came bearing more than one gun. They pulled 22 pistols from the trunk of one white Honda, a haul that earned the driver 1,000. Two men in a pickup truck with two children in the back seat handed over a rifle, a pistol and a MAC-12, altered with a silencer. Organizers and some participants credited collective outrage and anguish over the gun rampage in Newtown, Conn., for the turnout. But motivations were often a bit more complicated. \\"That young guy shot up all the kids and they blamed the mama because the mama had the weapons in the house,\\" Valerie Butler said, in explaining why she was waiting in line two hours in South Los Angeles to get rid of an old handgun. Yet Butler, 50, said she was not getting rid of both of her guns. \\"Just one,\\" she said, and laughed. \\"There's a bunch of nuts out here, and they're coming in when you're sleeping. You got to protect yourself.\\" Cities across the nation, grasping for ways to react to a series of mass shootings this year, have organized gun buybacks to get weapons off the street. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa pushed the city's annual event from Mother's Day to Wednesday in reaction to the killing Dec. 14 of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. By the afternoon, the event had already surpassed the 1,673 guns collected last year, and officials were scrambling to get more gift cards, which were donated by Ralphs. Many of the drivers said they were turning in their guns because they rarely used them and were eager to snag grocery cards. \\"If I could get 100 of free groceries, it's worth it,\\" said Charles Edwards, 60, waiting in line next to his old .22 revolver after driving to Los Angeles from Fontana. \\"I wouldn't do it for 40. That's why people are here. They feel bad about all that's happening, but times are tough.\\" He still has a shotgun at home. \\"That's all I need,\\" he said. Edwards said authorities needed to better organize the buyback so the lines weren't so long. He watched numerous people sit in line for a spell, then just drive away, he said. \\"I thought I could just drop this thing off. They need to have this move faster.\\" Most of the weapons recovered were \\"mom and pop guns,\\" police said — hunting rifles, shotguns — but they got a few dozen assault weapons as well. They checked to make sure the guns were empty, and double-checked by pulling the triggers in clearing barrels — metal rubbish containers filled with sand. Then they put them into trash containers like bundles of sticks after a windstorm. \\"I had a question, one after another: 'Do we really need this? Does this really make us safer?' \\" Villaraigosa said at a news conference at the Sports Arena. \\"I say, 'Look, the Police Department is here because they believe in this program.' \\" He said the buyback program had taken in 8,000 guns since it began in 2009 and was just one part of a comprehensive police strategy that has reduced violent crime in recent years. Police Chief Charlie Beck said it was a critical component. One of the first guns collected was a camouflage Bushmaster XM-15, the same kind of gun used at Sandy Hook Elementary. But this was one of the rarities. Loretta, 50, from South Los Angeles was bringing in her great-grandfather's antique rifle — one of them anyway. \\"I got the other well-hidden,\\" she said. Alex Reyes, 47, rode his bike to the Sports Arena from East L.A. with a 68-year-old, six-shot .38 revolver and a .22 target pistol. He said he came in to do \\"a good deed\\" after the Newtown shooting, getting rid of all of his weapons. \\"Just me and Jesus Christ,\\" he said. Sandra Lefall, 38, came to the site with Newtown heavy in her heart. She had been thinking about coming since she first heard the awful news. \\"I'm bringing in a 9-millimeter handgun because I want to get it out of the house because I have teenage children. I would hate for them to do what that guy in Connecticut did.\\" By 2 p.m. in Van Nuys, the police began telling people they were out of gift cards. \\"I'm not giving this away for free,\\" said Sam Ferrell of Reseda as he took a drag of his cigarette in his truck. Ferrell said he was hoping to sell his stepson's handgun. \\"There are too many kids being killed by these things,\\" he said. He said he didn't plan to turn in any of his own guns, but that he was glad his stepson didn't have his. \\"I need my gun, but not everyone who has one needs one,\\" he said. joe.mozingo@latimes.com wesley.lowery@latimes.com ||||| Before 20 small children were massacred at school by a gunman in Newtown, Connecticut, Luke Schuster, 6, was shot to death in New Town, North Dakota.

(Associated Press) Veronica Moser-Sullivan, 6, died in a mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, while 6-year-old Kammia Perry was slain by her father outside her Cleveland home, according to an Associated Press review of 2012 media reports. Yet there was no gunman on the loose when Julio Segura-McIntosh died in Tacoma, Washington. The 3-year-old accidentally shot himself in the head while playing with a gun he found inside a car. As he mourned with the families of Newtown, President Barack Obama said the U.S. cannot accept such violent deaths of children as routine. But hundreds of young child deaths by gunfire _ whether intentional or accidental _ suggest it might already have. Between 2006 and 2010, 561 children age 12 and under were killed by firearms, according to the FBI's most recent Uniform Crime Reports. The numbers each year are consistent: 120 in 2006; 115 in 2007; 116 in 2008, 114 in 2009 and 96 in 2010. The FBI's count does not include gun-related child deaths that authorities have ruled accidental. \\"This happens on way too regular a basis and it affects families and communities _ not at once, so we don't see it and we don't understand it as part of our national experience,\\" said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. The true number of small children who died by gunfire in 2012 will not be known for a couple of years, when official reports are collected and dumped into a database and analyzed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects to release its 2011 count in the spring. In response to what happened in Newtown, the National Rifle Association, the nation's largest gun lobby, suggested shielding children from gun violence by putting an armed police officer in every school by the time classes resume in January. \\"Politicians pass laws for gun-free school zones ... They post signs advertising them and in doing so they tell every insane killer in America that schools are the safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk,\\" said NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre. Webster said children are more likely to die by gunfire at home or in the street. They tend to be safer when they are in school, he said. None of the 61 deaths reviewed by The Associated Press happened at school. Children die by many other methods as well: violent stabbings or throat slashings, drowning, beating and strangulation. But the gruesome recounts of gun deaths, sometimes just a few paragraphs in a newspaper or on a website, a few minutes on television or radio, bear witness that firearms too, are cutting short many youngsters' lives. One week before the Newtown slayings, Alyssa Celaya, 8, bled to death after being shot by her father with a .38-caliber gun at the Tule River Indian Reservation in California. Her grandmother and two brothers also were killed, a younger sister and brother were shot and wounded. The father shot and killed himself amid a hail of gunfire from officers. Delric Miller's life ended at 9 months and Angel Mauro Cortez Nava's at 14 months. Delric was in the living room of a home on Detroit's west side Feb. 20 when someone sprayed it with gunfire from an AK-47. Other children in the home at the time were not injured. Angel was cradled in his father's arms on a sidewalk near their home in Los Angeles when a bicyclist rode by on June 4 and opened fire, killing the infant. Most media reports do not include information on the type of gun used, sometimes because police withhold it for investigation purposes. Gun violence and the toll it is taking on children has been an issue raised for years in minority communities. The NAACP, a civil rights group, failed in its attempt to hold gun makers accountable through a lawsuit filed in 1999. Some in the community raised the issue during the campaign and asked Obama after he was re-elected to make reducing gun violence, particularly as a cause of death for young children, part of his second-term agenda. \\"Now that it's clear that no community in this country is invulnerable from gun violence, from its children being stolen ... we can finally have the national conversation we all need to have,\\" said Ben Jealous, president of the NAACP. This year's gun deaths reviewed by the AP show the problem is not confined to the inner city or is simply the result of gang or drug violence, as often is the perception. Faith Ehlen, 22 months, Autumn Cochran, 10, and Alyssa Cochran, 11, all died Sept. 6. Their mother killed them with the shotgun before turning it on herself. Police said she had written a goodbye email to her boyfriend before killing the children in DeSoto, Missouri, a community of about 6,300. In Dundee, Oregon, Randall Engels used a gun to kill his estranged wife Amy Engels and son Jackson, 11, as they ate pizza on the Fourth of July. An older sibling of Jackson's also was killed. Engels then committed suicide. The town of more than 5,000 people boasts on its website that it is a semirural town with \\"the cultural panache of a big city.\\" Many of the children who died in 2012 were shot with guns that belonged to their parents, relatives or baby sitters, or were simply in the home. Webster said children's accidental deaths by guns have fallen since states passed laws requiring that guns be locked away from youths or have safeties to keep them from firing. But even people trained in gun use slip up _ and the mistakes are costly. A Springville, Utah, police officer had a non-service gun in his home that officials said did not have external safeties. His 2-year-old son found the gun and shot himself on Sept. 11. The names of the father and son were not released at the time of the shooting. Obama has tapped Vice President Joe Biden to shape the administration's response to the Newtown massacre. The administration will push to tighten gun laws, many that have faced resistance in Congress for years. The solutions may include reinstating a ban on assault-style rifles, closing gun buying background check loopholes and restricting high-capacity magazines. Those may have limited effect for children like Amari Markel-Purrel Perkins, of Clinton, Maryland. He shot himself in the chest on April 9 with a gun that an adult had stashed inside a Spiderman backpack. Like most of the child victims at Newtown, Amari was 6. ___ Follow Suzanne Gamboa at http://www.twitter.com/APsgamboa Follow Monika Mathur at http://www.twiter.com/@monikamathur ||||| Arizona’s top law enforcement official wants to allow one staffer in each of the state’s schools to carry a gun, a proposal pitched as a “golden mean” between allowing all teachers to carry weapons and doing nothing. Attorney General Tom Horne, a Republican elected in 2010 with the motto “Defending Arizona,” has proposed a voluntary program in which every school could nominate one person to receive free firearms training provided by local sheriffs and the attorney general’s office. The individual would be allowed to keep a weapon in a locked place somewhere on campus. Text Size - + reset “The ideal solution would be to have an armed Police Officer in each school,” Horne said in a statement on Wednesday. “…It may not be possible to afford a Police Officer in every school. In that case, the next best solution is to have one person in the school trained to handle firearms, to handle emergency situations, and possessing a firearm in a secure location. This proposal is analogous to arming pilots on planes.” Republican state lawmakers throughout the country have proposed allowing concealed carry on school grounds or arming some teachers in the wake of the Newtown Massacre, which left 20 children dead at a Connecticut elementary school. But teachers’ unions have aggressively fought such proposals, with two top national unions saying the focus should be on “ways to keep all guns off school property.” The NRA has proposed placing an armed guard in every school in the country. Arizona has some of the nation’s weakest gun laws. It is one of only two states — the other is neighboring Utah — with scores of zero from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. A press release announcing the plan argues it represents a “golden mean” between “doing nothing” and allowing another massacre and arming all teachers, “which could create more dangers than it prevents.” Ariz. House Majority Leader David Gowan will introduce the proposal in the legislature, according to the press release, which also said Horne’s plan had the cooperation of three county sheriffs. Horne previously served as the state’s schools Superintendent from 2003 to 2011. ||||| Classroom teachers could stop school shootings by carrying concealed weapons, say gun-rights advocates who plan to offer the required training Thursday for 200 Utah teachers. The Utah Shooting Sports Council said it would waive its 50 fee for concealed-weapons training for the teachers. Instruction featuring plastic guns is set to begin at noon Thursday inside a conference room at Maverick Center, a hockey arena in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Valley. It's an idea gaining traction in the aftermath of the Connecticut school shooting. In Ohio, the Buckeye Firearms Association said it was launching a test program in tactical firearms training for 24 teachers initially. \\"Schools are some of the safest places in the world, but I think teachers understand that something has changed _ the sanctity of schools has changed,\\" said Clark Aposhian, one of Utah's leading gun instructors. \\"Mass shootings may still be rare, but that doesn't help you when the monster comes in.\\" Gun-rights advocates say teachers can act more quickly than law enforcement in the critical first few minutes to protect children from the kind of shooting that left 20 children and six adults dead Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. In Arizona, Attorney General Tom Horne has proposed amending state law to allow one educator in each school to carry a gun. Educators say Utah legislators left them with no choice but to accept some guns in schools. State law forbids schools, districts or college campuses from trying to impose their own gun restrictions. \\"We're not suggesting that teachers roam the halls\\" for an armed intruder, said Aposhian, chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, the state's leading gun lobby. \\"They should lock down the classroom. But a gun is one more option if the shooter\\" breaks into a classroom. A major emphasis of the safety training is that people facing deadly threats should announce they have a gun and retreat or take cover before trying to shoot, he said. Utah is among few states that let people carry licensed concealed weapons into public schools without exception, the National Conference of State Legislatures says in a 2012 compendium of state gun laws. Utah educators say they would ban guns if they could and have no way of knowing how many teachers are armed. Gun-rights advocates estimate that 1 percent of Utah teachers or 240 are licensed to carry concealed weapons. It's not known how many pack guns at school. \\"It's a terrible idea,\\" said Carol Lear, a chief lawyer for the Utah Office of Education, who argues teachers could be overpowered for their guns or misfire or cause an accidental shooting. \\"It's a horrible, terrible, no-good, rotten idea.\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"The rush to purchase firearms in Colorado has overwhelmed the system used to track background check wait times, leaving thousands of potential gun buyers on wait-lists that are now several days long. The background-check process, which previously took minutes to complete, now takes over 100 hours, due to the unprecedented interest in gun purchases and the capacity limit of the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's online wait-time clock. Gun shows in the state, such as the Tanner Gun Show in Denver, are adapting by having dealers either mail patrons' guns or agree to meet them another time once their background check has cleared."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the release of the new AHA guidelines, what is going to happen to the author's patients?

However, the Philippines, a predominantly Roman Catholic country, does not celebrate Carnival anymore since the dissolution of the Manila Carnival after 1939, the last carnival in the country. In historically Lutheran countries, the celebration is known as Fastelavn, and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans and Methodists, pre-Lenten celebrations, along with penitential observances, occur on Shrove Tuesday. In Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent. In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.).

Lina Stauffenberg stood on a corner outside the U.S. Supreme Court on a brilliant but unseasonably chilly early spring day and defined marriage as that between a man and a woman. \\"A father and a mother is best for children,\\" she said. Laura De Nardis and Deborah Smith stood arm-in-arm near the same spot. \\"We want equality under the law,\\" De Nardis said unequivocally as she wrapped an arm around her partner. 5 things we learned from the justices. Stauffenberg, De Nardis and Smith not only stood apart literally, but also sharply illustrated the divide making history inside the high court -- the question of whether same-sex marriage can be prohibited under the law. As the justices weighed legal arguments over an appeal of California's same-sex marriage ban, demonstrators packed sidewalks around the ornate Supreme Court building. They were jammed shoulder to shoulder as speeches rang out from a makeshift stage. Demonstrators from both sides pumped their fists waved homemade signs. Some broke into chants while others led a small parade that snaked between the crowd. The mood was festive overall. Police cleared the roads and maintained access to the court but otherwise kept a low profile. Grass ringing the court grounds was trampled to mud, which covered the sidewalk. Shoeprints were everywhere. The public sentiment outside the marble court seemed to mirror recent polling showing a growing awareness around the issue, and stronger support for same-sex marriage specifically. A decision that could change America. According to the CNN/ORC International survey, 57% say they have a family member or close friend who is gay or lesbian, up 12 points from 2007. Also, the number of Americans who support same-sex marriage has risen by almost the same amount over the same period - from 40% in 2007 to 53%. \\"It's time that gay and lesbian couples have the same rights as straight couples,\\" says said Olga Liapis-Muzzy, who was outside the court with her partner of three years, Emily Gosnell.

Same-sex marriage opponents were vocal, too. Hear and read the arguments in full. Chris Simon of Maryland owns a detailing company, and held a sign that read: \\"Say No to Same-Sex Marriage.\\" \\"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. This is the way God planned it.

He then stood on the edge of the crowd. \\"I am out here to stand with the institution of marriage between one man and one woman,\\" he said. \\"Gay rights and civil rights are not the same thing,\\" he added later. As he spoke, however, supporters for same-sex marriage continue to wave signs and cheer. Across the street music starts to play from a boom box and some of the younger supporters of same-sex marriage begin to dance.

In some countries, because the man realizes that the traveler is tired and eager to reach his destination , he will politely say \\"Just down the road.\\" He thinks this is more encouraging, gentler, and therefore the wanted answer. So the American drives through the night, getting more and more angry, feeling \\"being tricked\\". He thinks the man on purpose lied to him, for obviously he must have known the distance quite well. Had conditions been reversed , the American would have felt he was \\"cheating\\" the driver if he had said the next town was not too far, and if he would be sorry to the weary driver, he would say \\"You have a good way to go yet, it is at least fifteen miles.\\" The driver might be disappointed, but he would know what to expect.

Along the way, the stagecoach he is riding in is attacked by a gang of robbers. When the driver and guard are both killed, McQueen kills or drives off the remaining gunmen, earning the gratitude of the other passengers, dreamer Fred Winslow and his daughter Julie Ann. Winslow has bought a ranch sight unseen and looks forward to making his fortune. McQueen arrives at the ghost town of Todos Santos, where Reno Blake and Duke Harris are waiting for him, along with Reno's part-Indian girlfriend, Colorado Carson. After looking them over (and not liking what he sees), he heads off to a nearby town to meet an ailing Rickard, who asks McQueen to pull off one last big train robbery so they can both retire.

Article: Think you're too busy to learn another language? Well, you're not the CEO of a 205 billion company, and apparently, even this rather demanding job leaves plenty of time to learn some serious Mandarin. Case in point: the – video that Mark Zuckerberg just posted to, yes, Facebook. It shows off his 30-minute Q&A at Tsinghua University in Beijing in which he answered every question exclusively in Chinese. I don't know Mandarin, so I can't say how well he spoke. But the audience was decidedly thrilled. The crowd gasped and applauded as soon as he started speaking, and the good vibes appeared to last throughout the chat. Of course, the 21st century's most fabled boy-genius entrepreneur could probably speak to business school students in pig Latin and still get a rapturous response. Zuckerberg's proficiency would appear to be the positive result of one of his annual self-improvement challenges. Every year, Zuckerberg picks a skill or a goal to pursue with extreme focus. This year, the plan was to write one thoughtful thank-you note every day. In 2010, his aim was to learn Mandarin. The effort seems to have paid off in a whole lot of good will from his audience at Tsinghua, where he said he also just joined the board of the university's School of Economics and Management. But the ultimate purpose of Zuckerberg's charm offensive is probably much more ambitious. Right now, Facebook is still banned in China. Maybe next year, his goal will be to get it unblocked. Maybe he can promise the Chinese government a nice thank-you note—written in Mandarin. ||||| In case you were wondering if there is anything Zuck can’t do, there’s seemingly not. Beyond donating more than 50% of his wealth to charity and rocking a hoodie, the billionaire computer programmer just proved he can speak Chinese. Facebook FB, +0.24% CEO Mark Zuckerberg did his first ever public Q&A in Mandarin on Wednesday at Tsinghua University in Beijing, according to his Facebook page. Zuckerberg studied Chinese in order to please his wife’s grandmother who doesn’t speak English, according to a 2011 report from China.org. In case you don’t know Chinese, Zuckerberg wrote that he “discussed connecting the world, Internet.org, innovation and the early days of Facebook” in the video. But just how good is Zuckerberg’s Chinese? Even if his accent indeed is not great, most people agree the Q&A was still pretty impressive. ||||| Whether part of a bid to get Facebook unblocked or, as he professes, because he “wants to study Chinese culture,” founder Mark Zuckerberg awed the internet on Wednesday (Oct 22) with a 30-minute interview at Beijing’s Tsinghua University—in Mandarin. “Mark Zuckerberg nails a Q&A in Chinese like it’s no big deal,” gushed the Silicon Valley Business Journal, observing that he “slayed the crowd.” The Facebook clip of the interview—posted without subtitles—elicited like upon like from adoring fans, noting how “impressive” he was. Behold the first two minutes: Zuckerberg’s aplomb is indeed impressive. And for someone of his Mandarin level, speaking for 30 minutes and fielding questions isn’t easy. But those blown away by Zuck’s Chinese chinwag might want to know that though he’s clearly memorized a lot of relevant words, those were still shoehorned into a distinctly American-English grammatical order. Pronunciation is also a problem: He showed a plucky disregard for the tones that Mandarin has—one tonal slip-up had him saying that Facebook boasts eleven mobile users instead of 1 billion—and his enunciation was roughly on par with the clarity possible when someone’s stepping on your face. That said, Zuckerberg didn’t shy away from some tougher topics—and he even tried a few jokes. And regardless of the slip-ups, his audience clearly loved the fact that he made an effort. Here are the most insightful nuggets from Zuckerberg’s interview: The internet is very important: “The majority of people who don’t have internet, don’t have the internet because they don’t know why they want to use the internet. If you asked me—sorry, if I asked you—if you didn’t have a phone, computer or internet and I asked you, ‘Do you want to use internet?’ You maybe would ask me, ‘Why do I want internet?’ So a lot of problems. But… internet creates work opportunities and economic development. Very important.” His three reasons for studying Chinese: 1) to speak with his grandma-in-law and other inlaws; 2) China is a great country, and he wants to study its culture; 3) Chinese is hard, and he loves challenges. The next big things in tech: “Facebook is 10 years old this year. So if I ask 10 years from now, what should we develop? I decided we should develop three things. First, we need to connect the entire world. We need everybody to use the internet. Second, we want to develop (in English) artificial intelligence. I think 10 years from now computers will be better than humans at reading, listening, talking, and other things. So we are developing this. Third, when everyone is using mobile phones, I believe the next platform will be (in English) virtual reality. Oculus is the first product, but we hope there will be many products. Those three things.” Advice to entrepreneurs: If it fails, try again. “I feel that the best companies are started not because the founder wanted a company but because the founder wanted to change the world…. If you decide you want to found a company you maybe start to develop your first idea. And hire lots of workers. But you maybe have lots of ideas and you don’t know which one is best. If the first idea isn’t good, then your company isn’t good. But if you decide to change the world you should try to develop more ideas. If any idea is very good later you found the company.” Facebook’s plan in China: “We’re already in China. We help Chinese companies grow their customers abroad. They use Facebook ads to find more customers. For example, Lenovo used Facebook ads to sell its new phone. In China I also see economic growth. We admire it. (in English) It’s, it’s…amazing. We want to help other parts of the world connect to China, such as large cities, national parks, (in English) um, yeah.” His favorite color: “I can’t choose red or green, because Facebook is blue!” Advice to founders: don’t give up. “I think the best thing to do is not give up. Founding a company is hard. Most of it isn’t smooth. You’ll have to make very hard decisions. You have to fire a few people. Therefore, if you don’t believe in your mission giving up is easy. The majority of founders give up. But the best founders don’t give up. Therefore, believe in your mission and don’t give up—very important.” Is his Chinese better than his (Chinese-Vietnamese-American) wife Priscilla’s? “In Chinese, I know more words. But she also speaks Cantonese. Her listening is better than mine. Mine is really awful. One day I asked her why my listening was so bad and she said ‘your listening is bad in English, too.'” Here’s the full 30-minute interview: ||||| Add a location to your Tweets When you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

Learn more ||||| The filmmaker Laura Poitras is concerned with the human effects of surveillance. She wants to understand what pervasive and sometimes aggressive American intelligence gathering does to people. And she wants to understand the human beings who have created it, run it, and become disillusioned by it -- men who now find themselves at war with the system. In her new film, Citizenfour, we get unprecedentedly close to the human source -- Edward Snowden -- of revelations that have rewritten the way that large parts of the world understand the nature of American intelligence, surveillance, and power. And then Poitras pulls us back. Poitras, a journalist and documentary filmmaker, is one of the foremost chroniclers of the U.S. war on terror, and Citizenfour is the third in a trilogy of movies examining the human costs of that conflict. (Its title refers to Snowden's moniker when he first contacted Poitras.) Poitras now lives in Berlin, where she is part of a growing expat community working on digital privacy issues. Together with Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist, she serves as the primary conduit for Snowden leaks. It bears saying that the former NSA contractor indicted in the United States under the Espionage Act chose Poitras, whose work he admired -- particularly her short video for the New York Times -- and knew she had some facility with technical encryption. As someone who has written about Snowden since he first appeared in the summer of 2013, I think the choice of Poitras as an interlocutor was the best of all his wildly successful gambits. Snowden and Poitras first had contact with one another in January 2013; it can be easy to forget how incredible it is that they weren't caught by the NSA. That's a technical feat for which Poitras deserves much of the credit. Citizenfour is the most complete account of how their relationship developed. It is a story of great daring, one that dabbles in a conspiracy theorist's paranoia and indeed provides a more human portrayal of Snowden. It is not a neutral film in the old-fashioned, journalistic sense of the word -- and that's not a bad thing. It can be divided into three parts: before Snowden, with Snowden, and after Snowden. B.S. features Bill Binney -- the legendary NSA crypto-mathematician turned whistleblower -- and Greenwald, who argues about civil liberties from his home in Brazil. It also features the Internet activist and hacker Jacob Appelbaum, one of the film's more interesting characters, teaching left-wing activists about electronic surveillance. Then Snowden appears, much like a bolt of lightning. And with his arrival, Poitras must negotiate her role as a character in her own film. This is a very serious problem for Poitras, for whom appearing in her own work is anathema. Poitras is deeply aware of the observational problem of documentary filmmaking, of the way that the camera's presence alters the reality or truth being filmed. It's a conundrum with an analog in quantum mechanics: The measurement problem. That she has authored multiple, award-winning articles based on Snowden-provided material further complicates Poitras's entanglement with Snowden. Snowden, then, is someone whom she has to protect as a source and expose as a subject. That's something of a filmic quandary. Poitras's solution is acting as a semi-passive observer, having the camera at her hip, not blocking her face. \\"The camera doesn't have to be a barrier,\\" she told the New Yorker. \\"It's a witness.\\" In Citizenfour, she appears most as a disembodied voice, reading eerie messages she received from Snowden via encrypted channels. By my count, Poitras makes one visual appearance in the film: When Greenwald and Poitras first meet Snowden in a Hong Kong hotel, she is caught briefly in a mirror reflection. That moment comes just as the audience meets the source, Snowden, for the first time. He sits on a bed, disheveled, a little dazed, and obviously nervous. The effect is like a shock of the new: This thing that we thought we knew completely presented at a moment just prior to his (public) birth. He has no idea what's coming. It's an incredible piece of footage, which also captures the intimacy of Poitras's cinematic technique. The movie's high point comes when it's just Poitras and her subject in a hotel room. A talking head on BBC argues in the background that Snowden could have been pulled out of a book by the spy novelist John le Carré. Snowden walks around the room in a black suit jacket and black pants. He tries to get his hair to stay in place with some gel. It doesn't go well. He holds up a green umbrella before a mirror, considering his disguise for escaping the hotel. Too much, he decides. It's a lovingly shot scene. Poitras sees Snowden as a human being. For a moment it's not Snowden \\"the leaker,\\" Snowden \\"the whistleblower,\\" Snowden \\"the traitor.\\" Instead, just a goofy guy, one far removed from the world of le Carré. And then, just as abruptly as he arrived, Snowden goes underground to seek asylum and, eventually, with the help of WikiLeaks, lands in Moscow. With the protagonist gone, the film sags a bit. Snowden reappears via encrypted chat. But he is distant, more removed. Greenwald moves to the forefront. His testimony to Brazilian lawmakers on U.S. surveillance is of a different register than the poetic footage from Hong Kong. One lives again the drama of the Snowden revelations as they played out on cable television. It's less riveting footage than meditations on Snowden's psyche in Hong Kong's neon dreamscape. Perhaps as a result, the portrait of Snowden ends up feeling incomplete. The film ends back in Moscow -- after Snowden has secured asylum and the aftermath of his revelations has been documented on screen -- with a meeting between Snowden and Greenwald, who reveals that he has acquired a new source high up in the U.S. intelligence bureaucracy. And so it becomes a film with an easy moral message: Snowden did this for pure purposes at immense risk to himself, and it has resulted in more like him stepping forward. That may very well be true, but it's so unmessy that it's almost unbelievable. The more complicated aspects of Snowden's personality come as a footnote. We get a brief shot, filmed with a long lens so it feels like they are surveilled, of Snowden and his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, cooking dinner together. That Mills traveled to Moscow to be with Snowden is the film's only real revelation, but she never appears in the movie as a subject. Mills was reportedly willing to go on camera but Poitras turned her down out of an apparent desire to keep the film focused on Snowden and, one senses, the \\"issues.\\" When Snowden appears in Hong Kong chatting with his girlfriend on his laptop, Poitras retreats. We don't know what they say to one another. Therein lies the point at which Poitras retreats from her subject, perhaps to protect him. And, sure, it would be invasive to ask Snowden to tell us what he's typing out to his girlfriend. But these are the conundrums of trying to establish interiority in a documentary film. And given Poitras's humanistic commitments, it's surprising that she didn't explore this relationship further. Perhaps more surprising is her unwillingness to more directly confront a bigger question hanging over Snowden: whether the use of illiberal means can ever be justified as a defense of the liberal state. Unmentioned in the film are the Chinese and Russian intelligence services, which move through its background. These organizations have similar, if not as expansive, capabilities as their counterparts in the United States, to say nothing of their ability to imprison political opponents and use physical violence against detainees with impunity. And some of Snowden's revelations did not just deal with the gathering of intelligence against Americans but also with operations against countries such as Iran and Pakistan, both of which have deplorable human rights records and sponsor or condone violence outside their own borders. And therein lie the questions about Snowden that Poitras -- perhaps too close to the man -- cannot answer. Snowden, as he was presented to the public, remains so uncomplicated that he feels flat. Some of America's intelligence work is indeed deplorable, but so are the intelligence operations of other countries. What the film lacks is how Snowden grappled with the question of how one deplorable thing differs from another. And in the absence of a more rounded portrait of him, conspiracies flourish. Circumstantial arguments are made about how he is a Russian agent and was recruited long ago. The wild theories don't quite add up -- which is in part why they thrive -- but his defenders don't have a lot of material at their disposal to rebut them either.

The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea.

But sometimes it is important to wear the right thing. Many British people don't think about clothes very much. When they go out to enjoy themselves, they can wear almost anything. At theatres , cinemas and concerts you can put on anything you like: from beautiful suits and dresses to jeans and sweaters. Anything goes, as long as you look clean and tidy. But in Britain, as well as in the US, men in offices usually wear suits and ties and women wear dresses or skirts (not trousers). Doctors and business people always wear quite formal clothes. And in some hotels and restaurants men have to wear ties and women have to wear tidy dresses. In many ways, Americans are less formal than British people, but they are more careful with their clothes. At home, most Americans wear informal or sports clothes. But when they go out in the evening, they like to look nice. In good hotels and restaurants, men have to wear jackets and ties, and women have to wear pretty clothes. It is difficult to say exactly what people wear in Britain and the US, because everyone is different. If you are not sure what to wear, watch what other people do and then do the same.

He cryptically promises his father he will \\"bring him home.\\" Rama joins a heavily armed 20-man elite police squad, including Officers Bowo and Dagu, Sergeant Jaka, and Lieutenant Wahyu, for a raid on a high-rise apartment block in Jakarta's slums. The team intends to capture crime lord Tama Riyadi, who, along with his two lieutenants Andi and Mad Dog, owns the block and lets criminals around the city rent rooms under his protection. Arriving undetected, the team sweeps the first floors and subdues various criminal tenants; they also temporarily detain an innocent, law-abiding tenant delivering medicine to his sick wife in apartment #726. Continuing undetected to the sixth floor, the team is spotted by a young lookout, who passes on the message to another adolescent lookout just before he is shot dead by Wahyu; but the latter youth raises the alarm. Tama calls down reinforcements and the SWAT team are brutally attacked. Thugs snipe two officers guarding the perimeter, eliminate two more in the SWAT van, and ambush several officers patrolling the first five floors.

The outlaws have stolen the father's grey horse with a double SS brand. Max sets out to avenge their deaths and uses this clue to trail the men. During his travels in the desert, Max uncovers an old and rusty gun. When he comes upon Jonas Cord, Sr, a traveling gunsmith, he tries to rob him. Cord, recognizing that Max's revolver is not loaded and is useless, convinces Max that his plan has failed. Max tells Cord of his vengeful journey. Cord takes pity on him, takes him in, feeds him and teaches him how to shoot. Max hunts the killers, who have separated. He tracks down Jesse Coe to Abilene, Texas. With the help of dancehall girl Neesa, a woman from the same tribe as his mother, he confronts him in a salon. Coe escapes and a knife fight ensues in a nearby corral. Coe is killed but Max is severely wounded. Neesa takes him to her tribe's camp, where she nurses him back to health. They become lovers. Once he recovers, Max leaves Neesa to continue his pursuit. He reads that Bowdre is in a prison camp in Louisiana for a failed bank robbery. He commits a bank robbery, deliberately gets caught, and is sent to the same prison where Bowdre is serving time. Bowdre does not recognize Max whose plan is to convince Bowdre to join him in an escape attempt and kill him in the swamp. Pilar, a local Cajun girl working in the rice fields near the convicts' camp, gives Max comfort. She knows nothing about Max's plan to kill Bowdre but knows her way around the swamp. She finds a boat and joins the escape. The boat capsizes early on and Pilar is bitten by a snake. Max kills Bowdre and Pilar dies of the snakebite. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose parents deaths were being avenged?, what is it ? A:","completion":"The full name of the person whose parents' deaths were being avenged in the article is Max Sand. He embarked on a journey to avenge the death of his white father and Indian mother who were brutally killed by a trio of outlaws. These outlaws were Bill Bowdre, Jesse Coe, and Tom Fitch. After their brutal act, the outlaws also stole the grey horse with a double SS brand belonging to Max's father. This horse served as a major clue to Max in his vengeful journey as he trailed the outlaws who had separated after their crime. During his journey, Max came across an old, rusty gun that was, however, not loaded and thus useless. His path crossed with a traveling gunsmith named Jonas Cord, Sr, whom he initially intended to rob. Cord, quickly noticing the situation with Max's gun, managed to bring Max to reason, and upon hearing Max's turmoil and his vengeful pursuit, took him in and nurtured him back to health, while teaching him how to shoot. Max's journey continued as he tracked down Jesse Coe to Abilene, Texas where he, with the help of a dancehall girl named Neesa from the same tribe as his mother, managed to confront Coe. Even though Coe initially escaped and a knife fight ensued between the two, Max ended up mortally wounding Coe. However, in this fight, Max himself was severely injured but was taken care of by Neesa, and the two developed a romantic relationship. After recovering, Max, in his consistent pursuit of revenge, left Neesa and learned about Bowdre's presence in a prison camp in Louisiana. He strategically committed a bank robbery and got caught on purpose just so he could be sent to the same prison where Bowdre was incarcerated. Bowdre didn't recognize Max and was unaware of Max's plan to escape and kill him in the swamp. In prison, Max found comfort in Pilar, a local Cajun girl. Despite knowing nothing about Max's plans, Pilar helped in their escape attempt that led to Bowdre's death and, unfortunately, her own death due to a snakebite.

Question: Who did Blue also incriminate while being led away? Title: Sucker Punch Movie plot: In the 1950s,[10] a 20-year-old woman[10] nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is institutionalized by her widowed stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) at the Lennox House for the Mentally Insane after she is blamed for the death of her younger sister. The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), one of the asylum's orderlies, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. At the moment she is lobotomized, Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster. She befriends four other dancers Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rocket's sister and \\"star of the show\\", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Dr. Gorski is envisioned as the girls' dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as the High Roller (Jon Hamm), who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform the lobotomy.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"the air isnt able to be filtered\\" happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case states that \\"the air isn't able to be filtered.\\" If this scenario were to occur, it could significantly impact the process of oxygen being brought into the body. The filtration of air is crucial for removing harmful particles, allergens, and pathogens, as well as ensuring that adequate levels of oxygen reach the lungs for proper oxygenation of the blood. If the air isn't filtered, several potential issues could arise: 1. Airborne contaminants could enter the respiratory system, leading to respiratory infections, illness, and inflammation. This may, in turn, compromise the lungs' ability to effectively absorb oxygen and remove carbon dioxide, indirectly affecting the overall oxygen availability for the body. 2. The presence of unfiltered air might also interfere with the natural process of gas exchange. If harmful particles and irritants are present due to the lack of filtration, the delicate surfaces of the alveoli in the lungs may be damaged, preventing optimal gas exchange and reducing the amount of oxygen that can be absorbed and delivered to the body. 3. Additionally, the immune system's response to heightened levels of contaminants could lead to inflammation and a reduced ability to take in oxygen, creating further difficulties in oxygenating the body. In summary, the perturbation of \\"the air isn't able to be filtered\\" could have significant indirect effects on the process of bringing more oxygen into the body.

In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. Two countries used different methods to produce their energy. Albania used fossil fuels, while Croatia used Nuclear fission. Which country caused more acid rain?","completion":"Based on the information provided, we can determine that Albania, which used fossil fuels to produce energy, likely caused more acid rain than Croatia, which used nuclear fission. Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are known to release various pollutants into the atmosphere when burned to generate electricity. One of the primary pollutants emitted is sulfur dioxide (SO2). When sulfur dioxide combines with water vapor and other substances in the atmosphere, it forms sulfuric acid, a primary component of acid rain. Acid rain can have numerous harmful effects on ecosystems, soil, and water sources. On the other hand, nuclear fission is a relatively clean process in terms of air pollution and acid rain. Nuclear power plants do not emit sulfur dioxide or other harmful substances that would contribute to the formation of acid rain. Instead, they produce electricity by splitting the nucleus of radioactive elements, such as uranium or plutonium. While nuclear fission does produce radioactive waste, which presents its own set of environmental and health concerns, it does not directly contribute to acid rain. As a result, we can deduce that Albania, which relied on fossil fuels to meet its energy needs, likely caused more acid rain than Croatia, which utilized nuclear fission for energy production."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Sudden Impact tends to be treated as Eastwood's artistic failure at a point in his career when he had established a good reputation as a director. The reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism which it seems to support. In some places it actually owes more to Death Wish than the original Dirty Harry film. One might argue if that is so- at the end of the day it's a film about guilt, justice and retribution. For me, at the end of the day it's more empathy than sympathy. However, in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film. Forget the \\"Go ahead punk, make my day scene\\", that's iconic but not original. But look at the views of San Fransisco taken from the air, zooming in on the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. Or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where Sondra Locke's character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital. Eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces. So all in all Sudden Impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature Eastwood is as a director. And if I remember correctly it was actually the first time Eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology. Also, I think this is the first well paced film Eastwood directed. Although Eastwood has enormous talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see Play Misty for me, Breezy etc.) Thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story. The only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive. The reviewer points out some flaws and debatable aspects of the film, but overall, they appreciate the film's visuals, direction, and pacing. They also highlight some memorable scenes and recognize Clint Eastwood's maturity as a director."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Hypothesis: Elizabeth Stride was born around the time of year that Thanksgiving takes place. Step 1: Identify relevant information from the premise. - Elizabeth Stride's birthdate is 27 November 1843. Step 2: Compare the relevant information to the hypothesis. - The hypothesis claims that Elizabeth Stride was born around the time of year that Thanksgiving takes place. - Thanksgiving is an American holiday that usually falls on the fourth Thursday of November. In 1843, it would have been celebrated on November 30th, according to historical accounts. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. - Elizabeth Stride was born on November 27, 1843, which is close to the time of year when Thanksgiving was celebrated in 1843 (November 30th). Based on the steps above, since the hypothesis statement is supported by the information provided in the premise, the answer is Entailment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ashkelon was formally granted to Israel in the 1949 Armistice Agreements. Re-population of the recently vacated Arab dwellings by Jews had been official policy since at least December 1948, but the process began slowly. The Israeli national plan of June 1949 designated al-Majdal as the site for a regional Urban area of 20,000 people. From July 1949, new immigrants and demobilization soldiers moved to the new town, increasing the Jewish population to 2,500 within six months. These early immigrants were mostly from Yemen, North Africa, and Europe. During 1949, the town was renamed Migdal Gaza, and then Migdal Gad. Soon afterwards it became Migdal Ashkelon. The city began to expand as the population grew. In 1951, the neighborhood of Afridar was established for Jewish immigrants from South Africa, and in 1953 it was incorporated into the city. The current name Ashkelon was adopted and the town was granted Local council (Israel) status in 1953. In 1955, Ashkelon had more than 16,000 residents. By 1961, Ashkelon ranked 18th among Israeli urban centers with a population of 24,000. This grew to 43,000 in 1972 and 53,000 in 1983. In 2005, the population was more than 106,000.

Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country.\\" Trump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \\"zero tolerence\\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children.

Stimuloitu emissio Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"\\"Stimuloitu emissio\\" is a Finnish term that translates to \\"stimulated emission\\" in English. Stimulated emission is a quantum mechanical process in which a particle, such as an electron or an atom, is induced to emit radiation by external factors, such as the interaction with electromagnetic fields. This process is a significant aspect of lasers (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) and masers (Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) technologies. In these devices, a population of particles is excited to a higher energy level through various methods, such as illumination with light or electrical pumping. When an incoming photon interacts with an excited particle (atom or molecule), the particle may be stimulated to emit an additional photon with the same energy (wavelength), phase, and direction as the incoming photon. This process of photon-induced emission is called stimulated emission. As more emitted photons interact with other excited particles, a chain reaction occurs, and the process continues, amplifying the intensity of light or electromagnetic radiation. The concept of stimulated emission was first proposed by Albert Einstein in 1917, but it wasn't until the 1950s and 1960s that it led to the development of masers and lasers. Lasers have diverse applications in various fields, including medicine, telecommunications, entertainment, military, and scientific research. In summary, \\"stimuloitu emissio\\" translates to \\"stimulated emission\\" in English, a fundamental principle in the functioning of lasers and masers, which contribute significantly to technology and advancements in numerous fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Tiger Woods has been clubbed into the long grass by EA Sports after the games manufacturer ended its association with the world's most famous golfer. Woods, 37, won the last of his 14 major titles back in 2008, but this year returned to world No.1 after replacing Rory McIlroy at the top of the rankings. There were 14 editions of the video game bearing his name, which was played by millions of golf fans across the world. Writing on EA's official website, the company's vice-president and general manager Daryl Holt commented: \\"EA Sports and Tiger Woods have made a mutual decision to end our partnership, which includes Tiger's named PGA Tour golf game. We've always been big fans of Tiger and we wish him continued success in all his future endeavors. \\"EA Sports golf fans have always loved authentic courses and players, but they've also asked for more choice and customization in how and where they play.\\" EA had previously stuck with Woods through his acrimonious divorce in August 2010 at a time where several other sponsors severed ties with the American. Gatorade, AT&T and Accenture and Tag Heuer all withdrew sponsorship or did not renew their deals following the revelations of Woods' infidelity and subsequent divorce from Elin Nordegren -- costing him 20 million in earnings. From the endorsements he held in 2009, just two remain: Nike, which teamed up with Woods when he turned professional in 1996; and NetJets, a plane ownership-sharing company. \\"For most mortal sportsmen, losing the EA deal would constitute a real body blow. At an estimated 6.2 million a year, it's a very significant chunk of change,\\" Sami McCabe, CEO of Clarity PR, told CNN. \\"However, Tiger Woods is in a unique category in terms of earning potential from sponsorship deals -- particularly from his sportswear sponsor Nike, which ensures he dwarfs the majority of his peers -- in any sport. \\"So I don't see this news being a source of sleepless nights from a financial perspective. However, it might be the cause of concern for the longevity and sustainability of 'Brand Tiger.' \\" According to market tracking company NPD Group, EA sold 771 million worth of games boasting the Tiger Woods name. DFC Intelligence, a consulting firm which deals with the gaming market, states that EA made 3.79 billion last year -- with its Battlefield and Madden NFL games the top sellers. But while the loss of the EA partnership should not cause major damage to the Woods brand, McCabe does believe the move remains significant. \\"Losing a marquee sponsorship deal says two things: first, he's no longer the force he once was on the golf course; and secondly, EA will no doubt be replacing him with someone else,\\" he said. \\"Rory McIlroy would seem the most obvious choice -- assuming his form picks up. So this might be perceived as the first major step in a changing of the guard. \\"Losing EA Games won't make much of a dent on Tiger's bank balance, but it does make a dent on his ubiquity. \\"And that ubiquity is the single biggest reason why he's able to command such astronomical sponsorship deals. \\"That said, a couple of major wins would surely turn the tide back in his favor.\\" EA started making golf simulation games back in 1990, with PGA Tour golf coming out on PC, Amiga and the Sega Megadrive. In 1998 it produced the \\"Tiger Woods PGA Tour 99\\" which became a huge hit on Playstation and blazed the trail for further success. But in recent years EA has begun to take a step back, with the 2010 cover of the game the first to feature another golfer alongside Woods -- Northern Ireland's rising star McIlroy. A few months later on a newer version it simply showed Augusta, home of the Masters, with no trace of Woods on the cover. Rickie Fowler joined Woods on the front of \\"Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13\\" in the U.S., while Arnold Palmer was used in the latest version.","completion":"1.

The military called it its final \\"tactical road march.\\" A series of 110 heavily armored, hulking trucks and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles carrying about 500 soldiers streamed slowly but steadily out of the combat zone. A few minutes before 8 a.m., the metal gate behind the last MRAP closed. With it came to an end a deadly and divisive war that lasted almost nine years, its enormous cost calculated in blood and billions. The quiet American exit, shrouded in secrecy until it occurred, closes a war that was contentious from the start and cost the nation more than 800 billion. The decision to invade Iraq was met with both support and opposition, but as the years went on and casualties mounted, the war's true costs became increasingly apparent. The conflict resulted in the deaths of over 4,400 American soldiers, tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians, and the displacement of millions more. The human toll, combined with the financial burden and the region's ongoing instability, has left many questioning whether the sacrifice was worthwhile. Throughout the course of the war, the U.S. faced numerous challenges, including managing a complex and evolving insurgency, addressing serious sectarian strife within the country, and attempting to promote stability and democratic governance in a region plagued by constant upheaval. The training and equipping of Iraqi security forces was often a slow and arduous process. Additionally, strained relations with the Iraqi government and an increasing war-weariness among the American public significantly contributed to the pressure on the U.S. military to withdraw. As the final American convoy exited Iraq, the remaining troops reflected on their experiences and sacrifices. Many expressed mixed emotions about leaving, with some highlighting concerns that the country might not yet be prepared to handle the daunting task of maintaining its own stability and security without international assistance. At the same time, many soldiers expressed a sense of relief and accomplishment, having played a role in toppling a brutal regime and giving the Iraqi people a chance to rebuild their nation. The withdrawal marked the end of an era in American military operations and a contentious period in U.S. foreign policy. The consequences and lasting effects of the war will undoubtedly continue to be debated for years to come. As soldiers return home to reunite with their loved ones, the legacy of the war will remain ever-present in the lives of those who fought, those who lost, and those who were forever changed by the conflict. In the years following the withdrawal, the U.S. has continued to grapple with the repercussions of its actions in Iraq. The rise of ISIS and the continued instability in the region have underscored the ongoing challenges of crafting effective policies in an increasingly interconnected and volatile world. The lessons learned from the conflict in Iraq will undoubtedly continue to inform and shape American foreign policy, with the true consequences of the war still unfolding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: After eating foods high in salt most of their lives, how are people most likely to be (statistically speaking): === The answer to the above question is - Fans of macaroni and cheese.; - Overweight or obese.; - not enough information; - University researchers.; Answer:","completion":"Overweight or obese."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The Mavs entered the 2011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miamis \\"Big Three\\" coming together during the course of the 2010–11 NBA Playoffs. After dropping game one in Miami by a score of 92–84, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88–73, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0–2 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22–5 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88–86. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112–103, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first ever NBA title with a 105–95 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation.

Step 2: Identify the major highways in Maine and Kansas. - Major highways in Maine: - I-95 (Interstate 95): This is a major north-south route that runs from Miami, Florida to Houlton, Maine near the Canadian border. - I-295 (Interstate 295): This is a shorter auxiliary route that connects Portland and other areas along the coast. - Major highways in Kansas: - I-70 (Interstate 70): This is a major east-west route that runs from Cove Fort, Utah to Baltimore, Maryland. - I-35 (Interstate 35): This is a major north-south route that runs from Laredo, Texas to Duluth, Minnesota. Step 3: Compare the major highways in California with those in Maine and Kansas. - Comparing California and Maine: - California has more major interstate highways (3 vs 1). - California's highways cover larger distances and connect more states compared to Maine's highways. - Both states have a coastal route; California has US-101, while Maine has I-295. - Comparing California and Kansas: - Both states have comparable numbers of major interstates (California has 3 major interstates, while Kansas has 2). - California's highways cover larger distances compared to Kansas's highways. - California has coastal routes (I-5 and US-101), while Kansas does not have any coastal highways. Step 4: Determine if the answers to the two questions are the same or different based on the comparison. - The answers to the two questions are different because the comparisons between California and Maine major highways and California and Kansas major highways have distinct attributes. The number of major interstates and the presence of coastal routes are different between the two comparisons.

The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago. I believe people deserve a second chance, but of course this is a very controversial matter. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Who were those placed on stretchers? Options: - not enough information - Two policemen who later died - Private doctors - The nurses A:","completion":"Based on the context given, the correct answer to the question \\"Who were those placed on stretchers?\\" is \\"Two policemen who later died\\".

It is not possible to tell. In the given premise, the speaker mentions guarding a person (presumably a woman) from a group of people. However, there is no direct information regarding the emotional state (i.e., being livid) of that group. It does mention that a glib-tongued scoundrel comes along, but that doesn't automatically imply that the group the speaker guarded her from was livid. Additionally, while the speaker claims to have successfully guarded the woman from the group, we do not know the motives behind the speaker's actions to protect her. Although it could be deduced that there was some possible harm or threat involved in the situation that made it necessary for the speaker to provide protection, we still lack information about the reasons for this perceived danger. Furthermore, the information provided in the premise is limited, and we cannot derive any more substantial conclusions from the small window we are given into the situation unfolding with these characters. In summary, while the hypothesis might seem plausible, there isn't enough information in the given premise to either confirm or refute the assertion that the speaker protected the woman from the group because they were livid.

Question: What chemical causes emeralds to be green? Is Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content. a good answer to this question?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content.\\" is a good answer to the question. However, to provide a more detailed and long answer, you can add more information on how chromium influences the color, the composition of emeralds, and other factors that can contribute to the green color. Emeralds are a variety of the mineral beryl (Be3Al2Si6O18), which in its pure form is colorless. The green color in emeralds is primarily caused by trace amounts of chromium (Cr) and, in some cases, vanadium (V) ions replacing aluminum (Al) ions in the beryl crystal structure. This substitution causes the absorption of certain wavelengths of light, leading to the characteristic green coloration. When chromium ions replace aluminum, a phenomenon called intervalence charge transfer occurs. In this process, the chromium ions absorb light in the yellow-orange and blue-violet regions of the spectrum, effectively reflecting and transmitting the corresponding complementary color, which in this case is green. This occurs because energy in the form of light is transferred between two different oxidation states, Cr^3+ and Cr^2+, within the crystal structure. Vanadium can also cause a green color in emeralds, although they generally produce a more bluish-green hue compared to chromium-rich emeralds. Similar to chromium, vanadium ions replace aluminum ions in the beryl crystal lattice. The coloration caused by vanadium is due to the d-d electron transitions within the vanadium ions. These transitions lead to the selective absorption of light in the different regions, creating the appearance of green color. Another factor contributing to the green color of emeralds is the presence of iron (Fe) ions. Although iron's influence is usually minimal, it can contribute to the intensity and hue of the green color. Emeralds with higher iron content may appear more bluish-green, while those with lower iron content can exhibit a more saturated and pure green hue. It is important to note that the impurities and the concentration of chromium, vanadium, and iron, as well as the specific crystal lattice structure, will determine the exact shade and intensity of the green in emeralds. This variability in color can be seen in emeralds sourced from different regions across the world. In summary, the primary cause for the green color of emeralds is the presence of chromium ions replacing aluminum in the beryl crystal lattice. In some cases, vanadium ions and iron ions can also play a role in coloration. The specific shade and intensity of the green color depend on the impurity concentrations and crystal structure of an individual emerald."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Recruited into a fierce and all-female ISIS brigade, Khadija underwent extensive training to become a lethal weapon herself. This included learning how to clean, dismantle, and fire various guns and other weaponry. Through this training, she was indoctrinated into the ideology and tactics that ISIS employs to maintain its power and control. The female ISIS brigade's members were skilled and ruthless, carrying out punishments in line with the group's rigid and brutal interpretation of Islamic law. However, despite her training and commitment to the cause, Khadija could not turn a blind eye to the senseless brutality and destruction that ISIS wreaked upon innocent people. As time went by, she became disillusioned with the group's actions and ideology, causing an internal struggle between her loyalty to the brigade and her own conscience.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Paragraph: Triumph and Disaster: The 20th century saw a stupendous release of energies that had been pent up for the 250 years of Tokugawa isolation. By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war. Question: \\"What event allowed the zaibatsu conglomerates to take advantage of an economic upsurge?\\" Answer: \\"The Russian Revolution\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"No, the answer is not correct. The economic upsurge that the zaibatsu conglomerates took advantage of was not directly related to the Russian Revolution. The zaibatsu conglomerates thrived due to the rapid industrialization and expansion of Japan's economy during the early 20th century, including increased raw-material production, manufactured goods, and heavy industry development. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which spurred a construction boom, also contributed to this economic growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

President Donald Trump is shifting his focus back to domestic issues after returning late Tuesday from a 12-day trip to Asia. This week, Trump will resume pressing congressional Republicans to pass a tax reform measure to follow through on one of his key campaign promises. Trump appears to be working closely with Republican congressional leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. \\"We ran in 2016 on doing this tax reform,\\" Ryan told reporters at the Capitol. \\"The president ran on doing this tax cut and tax reform.

Problem:This movie stars Jay Leno as a Detroit cop, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a Tokyo cop sent to Detroit to retrieve a stolen prototype of a car motor. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit hoping to sell it to a up and coming car company ran by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately for him the men who were supposed to negotiate the deal killed him and took the prototype. An angry Derek Jarryd tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras who led the men. But Madras(played by Chris Sarandon) has none of it and threatens Jarryd forcing him to continue their partnership. Meanwhile in the same junk yard where the Japanese man had been killed, a friend of Tony Costas was also killed by the same men. Tony's friend had been watching the junk yard.Tony sets out to find the killer against his superior's order. Tony is on robbery while obviously homicide should investigate the case. While Tony is investigating the crime he runs into the Japanese cop and mistakingly he arrests him. Eventually they end up working together on the case. They make an odd pair and there are some genuinely amusing parts as well as some ridiculous scenes such as Pat Morita jumping and kicking right through a the windshield of a moving car and kicking Madras in the head. But it ends up being an enjoyable buddy cop movie, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is no actor, but he is likable in the role and Pat Morita is good as well.

Summarize this article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Almost 150 whales die in mass stranding A group of up to 145 pilot whales have died after becoming stranded on a beach on Stewart Island in New Zealand. The animals were discovered by a walker late on Saturday, strewn along the beach of Mason Bay. Authorities said half the whales had already died by then, while the other half were put down as it would have been too difficult to save them. In separate incidents, 12 pygmy whales and a sperm whale also beached in New Zealand over the weekend. 'A heart-breaking decision' The pilot whales were beached in two pods about 2km (1.2 miles) apart on a remote beach on Rakiura or Stewart Island off the coast of South Island. \\"Sadly, the likelihood of being able to successfully re-float the remaining whales was extremely low,\\" Ren Leppens of the regional Department of Conservation (DOC) said in a statement. \\"The remote location, lack of nearby personnel and the whales' deteriorating condition meant the most humane thing to do was to euthanise.\\" \\"However, it's always a heart-breaking decision to make.\\" The DOC said in a statement that whale strandings are not uncommon in New Zealand and that there are about 85 incidents a year. In most cases, though, it's just a single animal that is beached, not a whole pod. It's not fully known why whales or dolphins strand, the agency said. Possible reasons might be sickness, navigational errors, falling tides or being chased by a predator. Also over the weekend, 12 pygmy whales were found stranded at the northern tip of North Island. Four of them have died. There are hopes that the remaining eight can still be rescued and efforts are under way by local marine mammal charity Project Jonah. The group said it planned to re-float the whales on Tuesday and has asked for volunteers to help. On another North Island beach, a 15m (50ft) sperm whale died on Saturday morning. ||||| More than 140 pilot whales die in 'heartbreaking' New Zealand stranding More than 140 pilot whales have died on a remote New Zealand beach, the latest in a recent string of whale strandings and deaths in the country. On Saturday night the Department of Conservation [DoC] was informed of a mass whale stranding in Mason Bay on Stewart Island. A hiker camping in the remote location told authorities of the tragedy, with the number of whales equating to two pods. DOC Rakiura operations manager Ren Leppens said at least half of the whales were dead by the time staff arrived at the scene. Indonesia: dead whale had 1,000 pieces of plastic in stomach Read more “Sadly, the likelihood of being able to successfully refloat the remaining whales was extremely low. The remote location, lack of nearby personnel and the whales’ deteriorating condition meant the most humane thing to do was to euthanise,” said Leppens. “However, it’s always a heartbreaking decision to make.” The local Māori, tribe, Ngāi Tahu, is now working with DOC to bless the dead whales and make plans for burial of the bodies. Marine strandings are common in New Zealand, with the country a “hotspot”, according to DOC, who respond to about 85 incidents a year, usually of single animals. Since 1840, more than 5,000 strandings have been recorded around the New Zealand coastline. According to DOC the reasons for whale strandings are not fully understood, but contributing factors can include “sickness, navigational error, geographical features, a rapidly falling tide, being chased by a predator, or extreme weather”. Project Jonah, a whale rescue group says New Zealand has one of the highest rates of whale strandings in the world, with an average of 300 whales and dolphins beaching themselves every year. A series of whale strandings occurred over the weekend in New Zealand, but the incidents are so far thought to be unrelated. Eight pygmy whales remain stranded on 90 mile beach in Northland, with two others from the same pod euthanised over the weekend. A 15-metre male sperm whale beached and died at Doubtful Sound on Saturday, while a female pygmy sperm whale washed up dead at Ohiwa over the weekend. Last year more than 400 pilot whales were stranded in Golden Bay, the largest whale stranding in New Zealand’s history. Although hundreds of locals participated in a mass civilian rescue effort, more than 300 whales died. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A lot of whales got stuck on a beach on an island in New Zealand, and sadly, almost 150 of them died. People tried to help, but it was very difficult to save them. Whales sometimes get stuck on beaches, and nobody knows exactly why, but it could be because they are sick or having trouble finding their way. This happened to some other whales in New Zealand too, but these cases might not be related. People are trying their best to help the whales that are still alive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of both sentences to show how they have the same meaning: 1. In the first sentence, it starts with \\"In his memoirs,\\" which refers to Saavedra's memoirs, though it does not directly mention Saavedra's name. 2. The first sentence states \\"like popular historians such as Vicente Fidel López,\\" which sets up a comparison between the claim made in Saavedra's memoirs and the claims made by popular historians like Vicente Fidel López. 3. The first sentence concludes with \\"he claims that it was exclusively a product of the liberal initiative,\\" which specifically states the claim that both Saavedra and the popular historians hold. Now, let's examine the second sentence's components: 1. The second sentence begins with \\"Saavedra claims in his memoirs,\\" which also refers to Saavedra's memoirs, but this time directly states Saavedra's name upfront. 2. The second sentence states \\"as do popular historians like Vicente Fidel López,\\" which also sets up a comparison between Saavedra's claim and the claims of popular historians like Vicente Fidel López; however, this time, it uses a different phrasing. 3.

Q:- Rock begins as magma from a volcano - The magma cools - Crystals form and the magma become igneous rocks - The igneous rocks break down into sediment - Become sedimentary rocks - If subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity the sedimentary rocks become metamorphic rock - The metamorphic rocks melt What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"The last step of the rock cycle is the transformation of the metamorphic rocks back into magma, completing the cycle and starting the process anew. This occurs when the metamorphic rocks are subjected to extreme heat and pressure, typically due to subduction or geological events such as volcanic activity. In detail, when the metamorphic rocks are exposed to these high temperatures and pressures, they begin to melt and transform into a semi-molten or fully molten state. This molten material, now referred to as magma, will slowly rise towards the Earth's surface due to its lower density compared to the solid rocks surrounding it. As the magma continues to rise, it may be stored within chambers in the Earth's crust or upper mantle, where it could reside for thousands to millions of years. Over time, the conditions in these magma chambers may change, leading to the development of new magma compositions and the growth of various minerals. The magma will eventually reach the Earth's surface through volcanic eruptions, fissures, or other geological pathways. As the magma is released onto the Earth's surface as lava, it cools and solidifies, forming new igneous rocks. The newly-formed igneous rocks are then subjected to various processes of erosion and weathering, including wind, water, ice, and chemical reactions. Over time, these forces break down the igneous rocks into smaller fragments, known as sediments. These sediments are transported and then deposited in various environments, such as riverbeds, lakes, oceans, or deserts, where they eventually accumulate and lithify, transforming into sedimentary rocks. As the Earth's tectonic plates continue to move and interact, the sedimentary rocks may be buried, subjected to significant heat and pressure, and eventually transform into metamorphic rocks. These metamorphic rocks can then be remelted into magma, thus completing the rock cycle and allowing the process to begin once again. This cyclical nature of rock formation and transformation is a vital part of the Earth's geological history and helps shape the landscapes and environments we see today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jason wanted to sell the house.. (ii). Michael wanted to sell the house..","completion":"Jason had been a trusted contractor in the community for years, known greatly for his attention to detail and exceptional craftsmanship. When Michael had approached him about doing a bathroom renovation on his home, Jason was eager to take the project on and deliver exceptional results. Every tile, fixture, and finish was chosen with precision, and Michael was thrilled with the outcome. However, when it came time for Michael to sell the home, things took a turn for the worse. During a routine home inspection, the house failed to pass various requirements, and Michael was mortified. It turned out that there were several issues in the newly renovated bathroom, despite Jason's previous claim of expertise and adherence to codes and regulations. The first issue arose from an improper installation of the bathroom's electrical outlets. The outlets were not equipped with ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs), a potentially lethal oversight. This type of outlet is crucial in areas with water and functions to automatically cut off the power when a ground-fault is detected, helping to avoid disastrous outcomes, such as electrocution. Secondly, there appeared to be issues with the renovated bathroom's plumbing system. The inspector discovered improper sloping of the bathroom floor, which led to pooling water and raised concerns about the possibility of water damage and mold growth in the future. In addition to this, the plumbing beneath the sink was not up to code – trap arms were installed at incorrect angles, contributing to slow drainage and the risk of sewer gas infiltrating the house. Thirdly, poor ventilation had been flagged by the inspector as a significant concern in the renovated bathroom. The bathroom's internal humidity needs to be managed efficiently to prevent the development of harmful mold and mildew. Unfortunately, Jason had neglected to install a vent fan during the renovation, despite this being an important aspect of bathroom construction and code requirements. Among these infractions, the inspector also noted that the showerhead installed by Jason was not compliant with water-efficiency standards. As ecological consciousness and sustainability become increasingly integral to contemporary home construction and renovation, the non-compliant showerhead was an unwelcome surprise for Michael. Naturally, Michael was disillusioned and disappointed with Jason's work on his bathroom renovation. He confronted Jason about these shortcomings, feeling extremely betrayed by a man who had provided exceptional service to countless others in the community. Jason, in turn, was shocked that his work had failed inspection and felt tremendous remorse for the predicament he had put Michael in. Taking responsibility for his errors, Jason set out to rectify each issue in Michael's bathroom, ensuring everything is up to code and the house would pass the inspection. In the meantime, Michael had to temporarily postpone the sale of his home and inform potential buyers of the ongoing situation, which resulted in lost opportunities and mounting frustration. Once Jason had completed the necessary adjustments and repairs to the renovated bathroom, Michael was able to proceed with the sale of his house. Though this crisis had put a serious strain on their relationship, their shared experience ultimately led to a stronger understanding of each other's values and the importance of adhering to the highest possible standards in construction. Despite the challenges and setbacks, Michael was grateful for Jason's commitment to fixing the problem and taking responsibility for his actions. In the end, Michael sold his house, surpassing its original market value, and Jason emerged from the experience as a more conscientious and skilled contractor, dedicated to refining his craft and righting the wrongs that had arisen in Michael's bathroom renovation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This place was called a dockyard. Ships are big boats that can travel on water and carry people and things from one place to another. Many people work at dockyards to make sure the ships are built safely and can sail without any problems. One day, there was a group of special people called naval officers. They work for the Indian navy, which is a group of trained people who protect their country on the water. Naval officers are very important and have many responsibilities, like making sure ships are built correctly and being in charge of the people who work on them. Sadly, something went wrong while building a ship at the dockyard in Mumbai. An accident happened, and one of the naval officers was hurt so badly that he didn't survive. An accident is when something unplanned and not good happens, like tripping and falling or a glass breaking on the floor. Sometimes accidents happen even when people are very careful.

On March 19, 2002, Audioslave was confirmed for the seventh annual Ozzfest; despite, at that time, having neither an official name nor a release date for their debut album. A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience. Cornell's manager confirmed that the frontman had left the band, with no explanation given.Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.Meanwhile, 13 rough mixes of songs the band had created months previously were leaked to peer-to-peer filesharing networks in May 2002, under the name \\"Civilian\\" (or \\"The Civilian Project\\"). According to Morello, the songs were unfinished and, in some cases, \\"weren't even the same lyrics, guitar solos, performances of any kind.\\" To MTV, he described them as \\"inferior sketches of works-in-progress, sent to Seattle for Chris to work on. Someone at that studio helped themselves to a copy and, after eight months, it made its way to an Italian website. Then it went global and everyone thought they had the record, which was so frustrating.\\" Answer:","completion":"The name of the person who claimed to MTV that \\"someone at that studio helped themselves to a copy and, after eight months, it made its way to an Italian website\\" while describing the peer-to-peer filesharing leak is Tom Morello."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Given the background: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] and the situation: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns. Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks. Answer the following question: Which town had more cyclists riding in slippery conditions? Answer:","completion":"Given the provided background and situation, the town that would likely have more cyclists riding in slippery conditions is the town where Bob's bike repair shop is located. This is because Bob's town is described as having a hilly area with more precipitation. These conditions can lead to slippery surfaces, especially during or after precipitation. Furthermore, the town is full of bike trails which attract more cyclists. In contrast, Rob's town, located in the valley and near the parks, isn't specifically described as having such conditions. Therefore, based on the information provided, it's reasonable to infer that Bob's town had more cyclists riding in slippery conditions."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Pharaoh's Daughter Review: I thought the Pharaoh's Daughter was a good young adult book.

Write an article based on this summary: – Border agents are separating immigrants from their children—a plan once floated by the Trump administration—despite denials that the policy was underway, the New York Times reports. With Congress seeking official numbers on immigrant/child separation along the southwest border and officials refusing to provide it, the Times dug up federal data showing that over 700 children (100 of them under age 4) have been separated from adults in the past six months. The Department of Homeland Security eventually acknowledged the numbers but said it was to \\"protect the best interests of minor children crossing our borders\\" and not to deter illegal immigration. Such children torn from families are sheltered by nongovernmental organizations, which try to find a US guardian or relative to take the child—but if none emerge, the child can remain stuck in custody. Last year, as secretary of Homeland Security, John Kelly floated the idea of child/guardian separation at borders, telling CNN he was considering it \\"in order to deter more movement along this terribly dangerous network. ... They will be well cared for as we deal with their parents.\\" Indeed there have been fraud cases, with some migrants admitting they brought children only to be admitted into the US more easily. Now the ACLU has filed a lawsuit on behalf of immigrant parents trying to stop such border separations.","completion":"Title: Border Agents Separate Immigrant Children Despite Policy Denials: The Continuing Controversy Introduction: Amidst continuing controversies, border agents have been found to separate immigrant children from their families, a strategy previously considered by the Trump administration. Despite officials denying such a policy was in force, federal data revealed over 700 children have been separated from adults in the past six months, raising concerns about the well-being of these children and igniting a legal battle. Background on the policy: Last year, then-Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly suggested separating children from their guardians at borders as a possible way to discourage further illegal immigration. Kelly assured that children would be cared for, while dealing with the parents in question. However, reports of child/guardian separations have surfaced despite no official policy announcement, leading to questions about the border practices in place. Evidence of child/guardian separations: The New York Times found that over 700 children, 100 of them under age four, have been separated from adults along the southwest border in the past six months. As Congress sought official numbers on immigrant/child separations and faced refusal from officials, the Times' discovery of this federal data exposed the discrepancy between the official narrative and actual border practices. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) later acknowledged these numbers, but argued it was to protect children's best interests. Growing concerns and backlash: Such separated children are sheltered by nongovernmental organizations, which attempt to locate a US guardian or relative to care for the child. In cases where no suitable guardian emerges, children can remain in custody for extended periods. Critics argue that these practices cause unnecessary trauma to children and families, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit on behalf of immigrant parents, seeking to halt further separations. Conclusion: The issue of child/guardian separations at borders remains contentious and underreported. The existing system is challenged by the varying narratives provided by government agencies and the interests of immigrant families. As legal battles ensue, the future of separated children and the policy's influence on immigration remains unpredictable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What might be true of him ?","completion":"Based on the given information from the article, several potential interpretations and truths about the character can be inferred: 1. Emotional turmoil or struggle: The character's grip being described as \\"so tightly that his knuckles turned white\\" suggests that he might be experiencing strong emotions, which could include fear, anger, desperation, or stress. His determination to stay in control speaks to an ongoing struggle within him, heightening the implication that he is dealing with a difficult situation, both emotionally and mentally. 2. Holding onto something of great importance: The tight grip could also imply that the character is holding onto an object or person that is crucial to him at this specific moment. The urgency to stay in control could mean that losing that grip could result in disastrous consequences. 3. Possessing supernatural or extraordinary abilities: The description of the character's body \\"flickering with a purplish shimmer\\" implies that there might be something otherworldly or magical about him. This could mean that he is a supernatural being or a human with extraordinary powers. In this context, staying in control might refer to managing his powers to prevent any unintended harm to himself or others around him. 4. A critical situation: The combined description of his physical grip, the purplish shimmer, and the urgent need to stay in control could indicate that the character is in a high-stakes, potentially life-threatening situation. He may be trying to prevent a disastrous event, protect someone, or overcome a dangerous foe. 5. A pivotal character moment: The intense description of the character's actions and emotions might be highlighting a significant moment in the character's development. The struggle for control might represent his effort to rise above the challenges and problems he has faced up to this point. Overcoming this particular hurdle may ultimately lead to personal growth and transformation, impacting the remainder of his story. In conclusion, it is difficult to pinpoint a single, specific truth about the character based only on the provided excerpt. However, it can be inferred that he is experiencing a significant struggle, be it emotional, situational, or supernatural. The situation seems to be resulting from an intense, perhaps critical event, and his personal stakes are high.

Today, we're going to talk about a special bird called a cockatiel. These cute birds are super fun to have as pets, but just like any other animal, they might get scared or upset sometimes. If they feel scared, they might bite us. Ouch! But don't worry, we can learn how to be friends with them. I'll tell you some tips on what to do if a cockatiel bites and how to make the birdie feel calm and happy! 1. Staying Calm If a cockatiel bites us, it doesn't mean it doesn't like us. Maybe the little birdie is just scared or not feeling well. If this happens, it's essential to stay calm and not make any fast or loud movements. Just take a deep breath and slowly move your hand away. That way, our birdie friend will feel safer too. 2. No Punishments Even though it might hurt when a cockatiel bites us, we mustn't get angry or punish the bird. Remember: birds and animals don't understand punishment like we do. Instead of making the bird feel better, punishing it might make it even more scared or upset. We want to help our cockatiel friend feel happy and comfy around us. 3. Gently Petting the Cockatiel Cockatiels love being gently touched and petted on their head or neck. But we can only pet them if they're calm and relaxed. That means no sudden moves or loud noises! Just hold out your hand slowly and let the birdie come to you. If the cockatiel is calm and lets you touch it, you can gently give it a little pet. 4. Making the Birdie Happy To make sure our cockatiel friend stays happy and relaxed, we should spend time with it every day to play and talk. We can also give it yummy treats and toys to keep it busy. Remember, happy and healthy cockatiels are less likely to bite or feel scared. In conclusion, kids, it's crucial that we learn how to stay calm, not punish the bird, and only pet the cockatiel if it's relaxed to become friends with our lovely feathered pals.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? You can take her to lunch, or go for a walk somewhere you both enjoy. Research has shown that mildly depressed people’s moods improve when a task diverts attention to something external such as an activity. Being in a better mood can make it easier for you to be able to open up and talk about your feelings. If you're not in the mood to do an activity, don’t feel pressured to plan one. A conversation over a cup of tea at the kitchen table or on the couch can suffice. The best way to start is to tell her that you have something important you want to share, so she knows not to take your conversation lightly. If you don't know how to bring it up or feel uncomfortable, try saying something like, \\"Hey, I’ve been feeling kind of weird/down/upset lately. Do you think we could talk about it?\\" Make it clear from the beginning of the conversation whether you want her to listen and hear what you have to say, or want her opinion or suggestions. Be sure to let your friend know whether what you're telling them is private or if they are permitted to communicate your difficulties to other people on your behalf. Be as specific and direct as possible. Don't dance around what you need or what you're requesting. It's okay if you get a little tongue-tied and shaky as you talk. Just talking is the hardest part! If you’re having a hard time dealing with your emotions during the actual conversation, it’s okay to admit this to your friend. Letting them know how hard the conversation is for you might even be helpful to your friend to understand your state of mind and how serious the situation is. If you begin to feel overwhelmed at any point during the conversation, it’s okay to take a break, take a deep breath and gather your thoughts. If your friend seems uneasy, break the tension by thanking her for being there and listening, or apologizing for taking up her time or having a hard time talking about it (if that is true). Individuals with depression are sometimes prone to feeling guilty. Guilt can be persistent, but it can also be managed and minimized. If you feel guilty during your conversation, one useful way to manage this perceived guilt is to remember that guilty thoughts are not facts. You are not burdening your friend by sharing your feelings. Your friend is more likely to feel grateful that you trusted her with this information and eager to help your recovery than she is to feel the \\"burden\\" you envision. For your conversation to work, your friend needs to be listening to you completely. There are many ways to hold her attention, including making eye contact, using gesturing and body language (e.g., facing the person, not having your arms or legs crossed), speaking clearly, and avoiding outside distractions (e.g., background noise, people passing, cell phones ringing). Look for signs of active listening. When a person is listening closely, they are deeply focused, trying to understand what you're saying. Check for cues like eye contact, nodding, or meaningful responses to what you're saying (even \\"uh-huh\\" can be meaningful!). People also show that they understand a conversation with their contributions to that conversation. They might repeat or paraphrase what was said, ask follow-up questions, and otherwise be working to keep the conversation going. When people stop understanding or are at a loss for words, they may use filler words. Filler words are “go to” words and can vary from person to person. They may use the same phrases over and over again (e.g., “that is interesting”). They may also trail off (i.e., not finish sentences) or not be working to keep the conversation going. Be aware, however, that these responses can vary from person to person. For example, some people think more clearly when they aren't making eye contact and may deliberately avoid it in order to concentrate on what you are saying. Think about how your friend talks and how she acts when she's paying attention. \\" When a person (like your friend) wants to help, she wants to know what actions she can take. This is part of human psychology: we feel good when we do something for others. Helpful actions can also alleviate some of the guilt your friend might feel when she sees you in distress. You should talk about your feelings as much as you need to, but it helps to end the conversation with something concrete or specific your friend can help you with (such as letting you vent about your feelings for half an hour or taking you out to get your mind off your problems). Recall what you had decided to request or hope for when you were preparing for this conversation and tell your friend about that. Pay attention to your friend and how the conversation is going. When you feel it's time to move on, suggest a different topic or move to end the conversation by saying something like, “We should be getting home,” or, “I’ll let you go, I don’t want to take up too much of your time.” This move is mostly likely up to you, as your friend may feel uncomfortable ending the conversation. Summary:","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of engaging in an external activity or having a candid conversation with a friend to improve one's mood when feeling mildly depressed, offering practical tips for initiating and maintaining the discussion while being mindful of the listener's needs and comfort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One of the biggest factors in most students' graduate program evaluation is how each program ranks nationally. These rankings can give you a better idea of how a given program stacks up to other programs across the country, typically broken down into factors like graduation rate, internship opportunities, and cost of tuition. Choices: (1). Most certificates will cover basic analytical reasoning, or just written down in a way that the student can easily memorize. The academic rating rating for each program is very specific, and some programs do not have any assessment standards at all. (2). The most recent graduate on the rankings will usually major in a top-tier program. Since that ranking would be a relatively small percentage of students' success, the designation will be fairly secure. (3). Start by talking to friends, colleagues, and professors to find out what type of reputation a given school's program has. Read objective rankings online that compare programs across the country. (4). Many programs will not require an mba. Most programs in a graduate program will require that you have a 5-year degree, more frequent hours of practice and an experience with mba programs in addition to a brief course of study.","completion":"When choosing the right MBA program, it is essential to consider several key factors to ensure that the program aligns with your personal and professional goals. To make an informed decision, follow these steps: 1. Determine your goals and objectives: Clearly identify your short-term and long-term objectives, such as the industry you want to work in, the specific type of job, or whether you plan to start your own business. Your choice of MBA program should be aligned with these goals. 2. Research the program's academic ranking: As mentioned above, academic rankings are crucial when evaluating MBA programs. Utilize trustworthy ranking sources, such as US News & World Report, Financial Times, and Bloomberg Businessweek, to compare programs on factors like graduation rate, faculty credentials, and internship opportunities. 3. Examine the curriculum and specialization options: Ensure that the program offers coursework and areas of focus that align with your interests and career goals. Some MBA programs may have stronger focuses on certain industries, such as technology, healthcare, or finance. 4. Assess the reputation and network: Reaching out to friends, colleagues, and professors for their insights on different schools can provide valuable information about each program's reputation. Additionally, consider the strength and size of each program's alumni network, as connections can be invaluable for career advancement. 5. Calculate the return on investment (ROI): An MBA program is a significant investment, so there needs to be a balance between the cost, potential salary increases, and opportunities that the program will provide. Analyze factors such as tuition fees, living expenses, program duration, and post-graduation salary potential. 6. Consider the program format: MBA programs come in various formats, such as full-time, part-time, and online. Assess which type of program suits your needs based on your availability, work commitments, and personal preferences. 7. Visit the campus and attend information sessions: Touring the physical campus and attending information sessions, either in-person or virtually, can help you gain a better understanding of the learning environment, facilities, and campus culture. This can be an important factor for many students when choosing the right MBA program. 8. Evaluate faculty credentials: Research the backgrounds, educational experiences, and professional achievements of the faculty members. A strong team of professors with industry experience can enhance the learning experience for MBA students. 9. Focus on internship and job placement opportunities: A good MBA program should have strong connections with companies in various industries, providing students with valuable hands-on experience and job placement possibilities. Research the career services and networking events offered by each program. 10. Speak with current students and alumni: Reach out to current students and alumni to gather more insight into their experiences with a particular program. This will help you understand the program from their perspective, which can provide valuable information when making a decision. By considering these factors and doing thorough research, you will be well-equipped to choose the right MBA program that aligns with your goals, preferences, and professional aspirations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The situation is under control,” the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said at a news conference in Ottawa. Sgt Kevin Baillie of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the Prince Edward Island threat came via fax on Wednesday morning, and that schools on the normally sleepy island were notified within 10 minutes. “There’s been no threat found. Everybody is safe,” he told reporters. The threat was faxed to police in Canada’s capital of Ottawa, Baillie said. “The message stated that the bombs had been placed at a number of schools and would be detonated today,” he said. A senior police official said a “swatting”-style computer distributed a threat to jurisdictions across Canada and in the US and authorities were trying to locate the source. Swatting is when someone contacts emergency services to deceive officials and report a bogus threat so that emergency personnel go to a scene. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about the investigation. Police in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in the central part of Canada are also investigating a threat against the city’s largest school division that appears similar to the one on Prince Edward Island. Police say the Winnipeg school division received a faxed message about 8.30am that contained a threat to all schools within its jurisdiction. Schools were not evacuated or placed in lockdown. Students at more than 60 English language and French language schools in Prince Edward Island were taken to safe locations by staff outside the schools, where buses met them. Baillie said bomb threats were hard to evaluate for credibility, but said authorities like to err on the side of caution. “This disrupts a lot of lives,” he said. Parents and guardians were asked to wait for further instructions before picking up their children. Trudeau said he empathized with parents. “As a parent, I know how worrisome this type of situation can be. I know the affected parents must be having a difficult day,” Trudeau said. Parker Grimmer, the island’s director of public schools, said police had contacted the school system on Wednesday morning about “a threat that was of a significant nature” and asked for the evacuation of all schools. He said he expected all students to return to classes on Thursday. “This is new to us, so we are reacting in a new way,” Grimmer said. “But we have plans and procedures and I think we followed them.” At Holland College in the provincial capital of Charlottetown, a woman burst into the classroom to tell everyone to pick up their books and evacuate immediately, student Morgan McNeil said. Outside, everyone was in a panic and helicopters were flying overhead, he said. Baillie said similar threats had been made to schools and colleges in the nearby province of Nova Scotia, where the Nova Scotia Community College Marconi campus, Cape Breton University and the NSCC technology campus in Halifax were evacuated. At least one school in the US was also threatened, he said. It was not immediately clear which one was involved or if it was evacuated. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1. More than 19,000 students were evacuated from schools in Prince Edward Island, Canada, following a bomb threat received via fax by police. No threat was found after all schools in the province were searched by officers. 2. The threat was sent to the police in Ottawa and said that bombs had been placed at several schools to be detonated on the same day. 3. A similar threat was also received by Winnipeg's largest school division, but no evacuations or lockdowns were initiated. 4. Police suspect that this could be a case of \\"swatting\\", where a person falsely alerts the authorities about a non-existent threat. Investigations are ongoing to locate the source of these threats. 5. Students were moved to safe locations and parents were asked to wait for instructions before picking up their children. Justin Trudeau, the prime minister, empathized with parents in these anxious situations. 6. It was a new experience for the Island's director of public schools, Parker Grimmer, but he stated that the school system had plans and procedures in place which were followed. 7. Similar threats were also made to schools and colleges in the nearby province of Nova Scotia and at least one school in the US, which all led to evacuations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

'I Love You Pops' Carter Thicke said goodbye to his father Alan Thicke on Dec. 13, the man he regarded as his “best friend and idol.” On Tuesday evening, Carter was playing ice hockey with the Growing Pains actor when the 69-year-old suffered a heart attack, the Los Angeles Times reported. Not long after, Alan passed away. Hours after news broke that the Golden Globe-nominated actor had died, Carter, 19, took to social media to pay tribute to the father of three. “Today I lost my best friend and my idol, and the world lost one of it’s finest. You are a legend and I love you Pops. Until next time,” Carter tweeted alongside a photo of him standing next to his dad. Alan was born in Canada and enjoyed playing ice hockey — Canada’s most prevalent winter sport — with Carter. In July 2015, Alan shared a sweet photo of the father-son duo on the ice rink. “Like Father, like son. The Thicke apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. #CanadianAndProud #Hockey #TBT,” he captioned the picture of the two donning hockey uniforms. Following his father’s passing, Robin Thicke spoke to the Los Angeles Times about the man he greatly respected and loved. Robin, 39, told the newspaper that his father was “the greatest man I ever met” and said of Alan, “the good thing was that he was beloved and he had closure.” Although his death was unexpected, the musician told the Times that he recently spent time with his father, during which he shared his great love and respect for the Growing Pains actor. “I saw him a few days ago and told him how much I loved and respected him,” Robin said about seeing his dad just days prior to his death.

They provide information about the political affiliations of viewers for both Fox and CNN, but the information is not presented in a consistent manner, making direct comparisons difficult. The first sentence about Fox viewers offers a breakdown by party identification with percentages for Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. It states that 41% of Fox viewers describe themselves as Republicans, 24% as Democrats, and 30% as Independents. The second sentence about CNN viewers, however, provides information about two different dimensions. It combines party identification and political ideology without offering a clear breakdown by party. It states that 29% of CNN viewers said they were Republicans, and 36% called themselves conservatives. This information does not allow us to deduce the percentages of CNN viewers who describe themselves as Democrats or Independents. Similarly, we don't have information about the percentage of Fox viewers who identify as conservatives or liberals. In conclusion, the two sentences do not mean the same, as they present incomparable and incomplete information about the political affiliations of Fox and CNN viewers.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Paris Whitney Hilton (born February 17, 1981) is an American television personality and business woman. She is the great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels. Born in New York City and raised there and in Beverly Hills, California, Hilton began her modeling career as a teenager when she signed with New York-based modeling development agency Trump Model Management. Her lifestyle and rumored short-lived relationships made her a feature of entertainment news and tabloid magazines, and Hilton was proclaimed \\"New York's leading It girl\\" in 2001. Hilton was born in New York City. Her mother, Kathy Hilton (nee Kathleen Elizabeth Avanzino), is a socialite and former actress; her father, Richard Howard \\"Rick\\" Hilton, is a businessman. She was raised in the Catholic faith. Hilton is the oldest of four children; she has one sister, Nicholai Olivia \\"Nicky\\" Hilton (born 1983), and two brothers: Barron Nicholas Hilton II (born 1989) and Conrad Hughes Hilton III (born 1994). Her paternal great-grandfather was Conrad Hilton, who founded Hilton Hotels. Hilton has Norwegian, German, Italian, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. She moved frequently in her youth, living in a suite in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, Beverly Hills and the Hamptons. As a child, she was friends with other socialites, including Ivanka Trump, Nicole Richie and Kim Kardashian. Growing up in Los Angeles, Hilton attended the Buckley School and St. Paul the Apostle School, finishing elementary school in 1995. Her freshman year of high school (1995-96) was spent at the Marywood-Palm Valley School in Rancho Mirage, California. In 1996, Hilton and her family left California for the East Coast. At age 16, Hilton spent one year at the Provo Canyon School for emotionally troubled teens. She then attended the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut from fall 1998 to February 1999 (her junior year), where she was a member of the ice hockey team. In February 1999, Hilton was expelled from Canterbury for violating school rules, returning to the Dwight School before dropping out a few months later. She later earned a GED certification. Hilton began modeling as a child, originally at charity events. When she was 19, she signed with Donald Trump's modeling agency, T Management. Hilton said that she \\"wanted to model\\", Trump wanted her at his agency, and she was \\"loving\\" the work. While modeling, she became a daily feature of entertainment news for her partying; according to Vanity Fair, Cisco Adler (producer of Sweetie Pie, in which Hilton acted) called her \\"a young party girl who gets sucked into the L.A. party scene and grew up a little too fast\\". In 2001, Hilton developed a reputation as a socialite; she was called \\"New York's leading It Girl\\", whose fame was beginning to \\"extend beyond the New York tabloids\\". Around that time she made a cameo appearance in Zoolander and appeared on several magazine covers, including the UK's Tatler, Italy's Giola and the US' Vanity Fair and FHM. Hilton also appeared in Vincent Gallo's \\"Honey Bunny\\" video. In 2002, she played a lead role in the straight-to-video horror film, Nine Lives. According to Beyondhollywood.com, \\"Hilton's presence in the cast is the film's main marketing point, which is plainly obvious by the fact that she's front and center on the box art and is the only recognizable name in the cast\\". The website noted that her character was, basically, herself: \\"Hilton plays--what else?--a spoiled American socialite who shops on three continents in one day. The script is even clever enough to take a few jabs at Hilton's real-life social standing, even mentioning that she's been on the cover of a few sleaze rags in her day\\".

This transition is characterized by the completion of physical, mental, emotional, and social development from childhood to a mature stage. We can break this down further into several aspects that contribute to this transformation: 1. Physical growth: As the child continues to grow, their body undergoes various changes, such as increased height, weight, muscle mass, and bone density. Puberty is initiated during this stage, with the development of secondary sexual characteristics and the onset of the reproductive capacity. Physiological processes and organ systems also continue to mature, ultimately reaching optimal functionality in adulthood. 2. Cognitive development: The brain undergoes significant growth and development during childhood and adolescence. This period is characterized by improvements in various cognitive abilities, such as memory, problem-solving, decision-making, and abstract thinking. By the time an individual reaches adulthood, they possess the necessary intellectual skills to navigate complex tasks and responsibilities effectively. 3. Emotional development: Emotional maturity is also a critical aspect of the transition to adulthood. As children grow, they develop the ability to recognize, understand, and manage their emotions. They also learn to empathize with others and establish healthy social connections. By the time they reach adulthood, individuals should have a robust emotional understanding and awareness that allows them to maintain stable relationships and cope with life's challenges. 4. Social development: The development of social skills and interpersonal relationships plays a crucial role in the child becoming an adult. As children and adolescents interact with their peers, family members, teachers, and other individuals, they learn essential social skills such as communication, empathy, cooperation, and conflict resolution. By adulthood, they become fully integrated into society, actively participating in social, professional, and civic engagements. 5. Independence and responsibility: A significant hallmark of adulthood is the ability to be self-sufficient and take responsibility for one's actions. As children grow, they gradually learn to manage their time, finances, and other responsibilities. By the time they reach adulthood, individuals are expected to be capable of making informed decisions, fostering healthy relationships, and contributing to society meaningfully. In summary, the final step in this process involves a multitude of developmental changes that culminate in the child becoming a fully mature and functioning adult. This includes physical growth, cognitive and emotional development, social aptitude, and the ability to make responsible decisions and be self-sufficient in society. It is worth noting that everyone's journey to adulthood is unique, with individual experiences and influences shaping each person's path."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), one of the expedition's scientists, contacts the Earth ship. He states no assistance is required, warning the starship not to land; he cannot guarantee their safety. Commander John Adams (Leslie Nielsen) insists on landing co-ordinates. Adams, Lieutenant Jerry Farman (Jack Kelly), and Lieutenant \\"Doc\\" Ostrow (Warren Stevens) are met by Robby the Robot, who transports them to Morbius' residence. There, Morbius claims that an unknown \\"planetary force\\" killed nearly everyone and finally vaporized their starship, the Bellerophon, as the last survivors tried to lift off. Only Morbius, his wife (who later died of natural causes) and their daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) were somehow immune. Morbius fears that the Earthmen are in danger, and (silently) that Altaira is intrigued by them. The next day, Adams finds Farman educating Altaira on kissing; furious, he dismisses Farman and berates Altaira for her naivety and revealing clothes. Altaira is frustrated, but designs a new, more conservative dress to please Adams. That night, an invisible intruder sabotages equipment aboard the starship. Adams and Ostrow go to confront Morbius the following morning. Waiting for Morbius to exit his study, Adams steps outside, only to encounter Altaira wearing her new dress. Adams sincerely apologizes and Altaira notes that she tailored her dress for him. Realizing mutual affection, they kiss. Upon Morbius' appearance, Adams and Ostrow learn he has been studying the Krell, a highly advanced native race that mysteriously died out suddenly 200,000 years before.

A solution with a pH value of 1 is definitely or not considered to be basic? Answer:","completion":"A solution with a pH value of 1 is definitely not considered to be basic. In fact, it is considered to be highly acidic. To understand this concept, it is essential to learn about the pH scale and the properties of acidic and basic solutions. The pH scale is a logarithmic scale used to measure the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. It ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral (neither acidic nor basic). Solutions with pH values below 7 are considered acidic, whereas solutions with pH values above 7 are considered basic, or alkaline. The scale represents the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution. Acidic solutions have a higher concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) compared to basic solutions, which have a higher concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-). As the pH value decreases from 7 to 0, the acidity of the solution increases. Conversely, as the pH value increases from 7 to 14, the alkalinity of the solution increases. Now, considering a solution with a pH value of 1, it falls within the acidic range of the pH scale. Moreover, it is an extreme value, indicating that the solution is a very strong or highly acidic solution. Examples of such highly acidic solutions might come from strong inorganic acids like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In these cases, the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution is significantly high. On the other hand, a basic solution with pH values closer to 14 would be considered highly alkaline, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH) solutions. These solutions have a high concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) and a low concentration of hydrogen ions (H+). In conclusion, a solution with a pH value of 1 is definitely not considered to be basic. Rather, it is considered highly acidic, owing to its high concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) and its position on the lower end of the pH scale (well below the neutral value of 7)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"In 2012, the official currency of Croatia was the Croatian Kuna (HRK). The Croatian Kuna has been in use since May 30, 1994, when it replaced the Yugoslav Dinar (YUM) following Croatia's independence from the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The name \\"Kuna\\" translates to \\"marten\\" in English, which is a small mammal found in the region. The name originates from medieval times when the pelts of these animals were utilized as a standard unit of value in trading. The Kuna is further divided into 100 smaller units known as \\"lipa,\\" which translates to \\"linden tree\\" in English. This naming was influenced by the use of linden tree leaves for currency in ancient times. Both coins and banknotes are issued for the Croatian Kuna. Coin denominations available are 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 lipa, as well as 1, 2, and 5 Kuna coins. Banknotes are issued in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 Kuna. The design of the currency reflects Croatia's rich history, cultural identity, and pride, featuring images of notable Croatian individuals, landmarks, and animals. In 2013, Croatia became the 28th member of the European Union (EU). As a result, there have been discussions about the possibility of Croatia adopting the Euro (EUR) as its official currency in the future. This would replace the Kuna and place Croatia within the Eurozone, alongside other EU member countries who have adopted the Euro as their official currency. However, requirements such as meeting the Maastricht criteria for economic and monetary stability must be fulfilled before Croatia can join the Eurozone. Additionally, public sentiment and potential pre-referendum polls may influence the adoption of the Euro in Croatia. In summary, the Croatian currency in 2012 was the Croatian Kuna (HRK), featuring a range of coins and banknotes that celebrated the country's rich history and cultural identity. The possibility of adopting the Euro as Croatia's official currency remains on the horizon but is subject to various economic criteria, public sentiment, and political decisions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film opens in October 1944, in the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp. A small group of Sonderkommandos, prisoners assigned to dispose of the bodies of other dead prisoners, are plotting an insurrection that, they hope, will destroy at least one of the camp's four crematoria and gas chambers. They are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the menâs camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely tortured, but they don't reveal the plot. Meanwhile, a Hungarian-Jewish doctor, MiklÃ³s Nyiszli (Allan Corduner), who works for the Nazi scientist Josef Mengele in an experimental medical lab, has received permission from Mengele himself to visit his wife and daughter in the womenâs labor camp. Nyiszli is concerned about the safety of his family and believes that Mengeleâs orders will keep them from the gas chambers. A new trainload of Hungarian Jewish prisoners arrives, and all are immediately sent to the gas chambers.

This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen.

Article:","completion":"Title: How to Safely and Effectively Trim Your Guinea Pig's Nails Introduction Guinea pigs, also known as cavies, are small, friendly pets that require regular grooming to maintain their health and well-being. One essential aspect of their grooming routine is nail trimming, which, if neglected, can lead to painful ingrown nails, infections, and difficulty in walking. Trimming your guinea pig's nails can be a challenging task, especially if you're a beginner. However, with proper preparation, tools, and technique, you can quickly master this skill and ensure your furry buddy stays comfortable and healthy. This article will guide you through the steps necessary to safely and effectively trim your guinea pig's nails. Step 1: Gather the Necessary Supplies Before you begin, it's important to have the proper tools and supplies at hand. Here's a list of items you'll need for a successful nail trimming session: 1. Nail clippers: Choose a pair of nail clippers specifically designed for small animals, such as guinea pigs. Human nail clippers may not be suitable due to their size and shape. You can find small animal nail clippers at most pet stores or online. 2. Styptic powder or corn starch: In case you accidentally cut too short and cause the nail to bleed, you'll need a styptic powder or corn starch to stop the bleeding. These products help promote clotting and can be found at pet supply stores or in the first aid section of your local pharmacy. 3. Hand towel: A soft, clean hand towel or small blanket is useful for swaddling your guinea pig during the nail trimming process. This can help reduce stress and keep your pet still for easier nail trimming. 4. Treats: It's a good idea to have some of your guinea pig's favorite treats on hand to reward them after the task is done. This positive reinforcement will help build a good association with the nail trimming experience. Step 2: Prepare the Area for Nail Trimming Setting up a comfortable and secure area for nail trimming is crucial for a smooth experience. Follow these steps to prepare the area: 1. Find a quiet, calm space without any distractions, such as loud noises or other pets. This will help your guinea pig stay relaxed during the process. 2. Clean a flat surface, like a table or countertop, where you can comfortably sit and work with your guinea pig. Ensure the area is dry and slip-free to prevent any accidents. 3. Place the hand towel on the surface, then spread out all the supplies you gathered in step 1 within easy reach. Step 3: Safely Trim Your Guinea Pig's Nails With everything prepared, you are now ready to trim your guinea pig's nails. Follow these steps for a safe and successful nail trimming: 1. Gently wrap your guinea pig in the hand towel, leaving their head exposed for comfort. This swaddling method will help keep them calm and secure. 2. Hold your guinea pig with one hand, supporting their chest and hindquarters. With your other hand, gently extend each of your guinea pig's paws one at a time. 3. Using the small animal nail clippers, carefully trim each nail below the \\"quick,\\" which is the blood vessel that runs through the nail. The quick is easier to see in lighter nails and often appears as a pinkish area. If your guinea pig has dark nails, shine a flashlight on the nail from behind to help locate the quick. 4. Clip only a small portion of the nail tip at a time to avoid cutting the quick. If you happen to accidentally cut the quick, use the styptic powder or corn starch to stop the bleeding promptly. Apply pressure with a clean cloth or gauze to help with clotting. 5. Repeat the process for each nail, ensuring your guinea pig stays comfortable throughout. If they show signs of stress or discomfort, take a break and allow them to rest before continuing. Step 4: Post-Trimming Care and Reward Once you've successfully trimmed all of your guinea pig's nails, it's essential to reward them for their patience and cooperation. Offer their favorite treat as positive reinforcement, and place them back in their habitat to roam freely. In conclusion, trimming your guinea pig's nails is an essential aspect of their overall health and grooming care. With the proper tools, preparation, and attention to detail, you can create a stress-free and successful nail trimming experience for you and your furry companion. Remember to maintain a regular grooming routine and be patient with your guinea pig as they become accustomed to this process. Happy grooming!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: prefix = st1 /Gland, Switzerland - Rivers on every continent are drying out, threatening severe water shortages, according to a new WWF report. The report, World's Top Rivers at Risk, released ahead of World Water Day (22 March), lists the top ten rivers that are fast dying as a result of climate change, pollution and dams. \\"All the rivers in the report symbolize the current freshwater crisis, which we have been signalling for years,\\" says WWF Global Freshwater Programme Director Jamie Pittock. \\"Poor planning and inadequate protection of natural areas mean we can no longer assume that water will flow forever. Like the climate change crisis, which now has the attention of business and government, we want leaders to take notice of the emergency facing freshwater now not later.\\" Five of the ten rivers listed in the report are in Asia alone. They are the Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, Ganges and Indus. Europe's Danube, the America'sLa Plataand Rio Grande/Rio Bravo, Africa's Nile-Lake Victoria andAustralia's Murray-Darling also make the list.

Answer the following question: Process: - As the sweat evaporates the sweat sheds molecules into the air - The sweat changes into a gas - Heat is drawn from the sweat - This process draws heat from the body - The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body. Question: suppose the heating system breaks down happens, how will it affect the person does not sweat. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"Let us analyze the situation step by step: 1. The heating system breaks down, resulting in a possible decrease in ambient temperature. 2. A person not sweating has no sweat on their body. 3. Since there is no sweat on their body, the cooling effect caused by sweat evaporation, as mentioned in the process, does not occur for this person. Now, to answer the question, we need to determine how the breakdown of the heating system would affect a person who does not sweat: A. More: The person might be more affected as they don't have the cooling effect of sweat evaporation to counteract a potential drop in temperature. However, given that the heating system has broken down, it's not necessarily the case that the person would be more affected by a decrease in temperature. This option does not seem to be an ideal answer. B. Less: The person might be less affected as they don't have the cooling effect of sweat evaporation taking place, which might have intensified the decrease in temperature due to the broken heating system. However, the broken heating system might still cause a decrease in ambient temperature and, regardless of the absence of sweat, the person may still be affected. This option does not seem to be an ideal answer either. C. No effect: The person's ability to maintain their body temperature will not be affected by the absence of sweat and its cooling effect. The broken heating system might still cause a decrease in ambient temperature, but the effect on the person not sweating may not be much different from someone who does sweat. In this scenario, the absence of sweat does not play a significant role in how the person is affected by the broken heating system. Answer: C: no effect"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i 've ever seen in the many film","completion":"The phrase \\"the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i 've ever seen in the many film\\" can be considered as having both positive and negative aspects. We can analyze the sentiment by breaking it down into its constituent elements. 1. The phrase's subject is \\"uncle ralph.\\" In this context, it seems to be referring to a specific character in a film, rather than a real-life individual. This, in itself, is neutral. 2. The character is described as \\"evil.\\" This word carries a definite negative connotation. Evil characters typically engage in harmful or morally reprehensible actions, and are often viewed as antagonists or villains in a narrative. 3. The descriptor \\"subtle\\" suggests that the character's evil nature isn't immediately evident or overt. This subtlety can make the character more intriguing and complex, as it adds an element of depth to their portrayal. In this sense, it could be considered positive because it could imply that the character is well-crafted and the actor's performance is nuanced. 4. The word \\"complexly\\" serves to emphasize that the character's evil nature is multifaceted and intricate. This description could also be viewed as a positive aspect, as it suggests a well-developed and engaging character, rather than a one-dimensional portrayal often found in less skillfully crafted films. 5. The phrase \\"I've ever seen in the many film\\" indicates that the speaker has watched multiple movies, and among those, this specific portrayal of \\"uncle ralph\\" stands out as being particularly noteworthy in its subtlety and complexity. This is a positive statement, as it implies that the movie featuring this character has managed to surpass others in terms of quality and impact. In summary, the negative aspect of the phrase stems from the character being described as \\"evil,\\" which usually signifies malicious intent and actions. However, the positive aspect is derived from the intricate, subtle, and complex nature of the character and its portrayal, suggesting a well-developed and engaging narrative. Overall, it's a combination of both negative and positive aspects, depending primarily on which aspect an individual chooses to focus on: the character's malevolent nature or the creator's and actor's ability to present this evil trait in a subtle and complex manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise states, \\"This is the fourth rulemaking action which EPA has undertaken to implement the requirement contained in Section 211(l) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\\" From this statement, we can conclude that, at least, four rulemaking actions have been undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement the requirements of Section 211(l) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. However, the statement does not provide enough information to determine if there are any additional rulemaking actions. It is possible that there are more than four rulemaking actions, and the statement merely confirms the existence of at least four. The statement does not explicitly deny the possibility of there being a fifth rulemaking action. For instance, if we learned in a separate statement, \\"The EPA will be undertaking one more rulemaking action before the end of the year which will be the fifth,\\" it would support the hypothesis that there are five rulemaking actions.

The interviewer asks her why she thinks this happened to her and she says that he's really asking why bad things happen to good people. That she and her family didn't do anything wrong and didn't deserve what happened to them.We then jump to 1987 and Sarah is driving her son Matt (Kyle Gallner) home from the hospital where he has been undergoing cancer treatments. Sarah is praying out loud for his recovery when Matt wakes up and jokes with her that talking to herself is the first sign of madness. Sarah tells him that she is talking to God and he tells her that threatening the creator may not be the best idea. They laugh, and then Matt tells her to pull over, as he is about to be sick. Sarah pulls over and sits in the car as Matt vomits by the side of the road.The next morning Sarah is cooking breakfast amidst the chaos of her family. Her husband Peter (Martin Donovan) comes in and remarks that he didn't hear her come in the night before and asks her what time she got in. Sarah tells him that they got home at 4 am and he asks why the trip took them so long and she snaps that she didn't think he would want to know how many times they had to stop for Matt to be sick. She remarks that it would be a lot easier if they had a place to stay nearer the hospital and he asks how they could possibly afford that but tells her to see if she can find something.Sarah and Matt return to the hospital where Matt has been accepted into a trial of a new treatment.

My question: Why are Matt's fingers bloody? A:","completion":"Matt's fingers are bloody because he has been experiencing supernatural occurrences in the house that his family has moved into, which was previously a funeral home. These occurrences begin to take a physical toll on Matt's body. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the house has a dark and sinister history, with spirits that are not at rest. In \\"The Haunting in Connecticut,\\" Matt and his family move to this house to be closer to the hospital where he's receiving cancer treatments. Unknown to them at the time, the house was once a funeral home where séances were conducted, and the spirits that linger are restless and malevolent. As Matt becomes more entangled with the spirits, he begins to experience various forms of physical and emotional suffering. The bloody fingers are a manifestation of the torment that Matt is undergoing due to the disturbing spiritual activity in the house. Furthermore, the supernatural energies trapped within the house take advantage of Matt's weakened physical state due to his ongoing battle with cancer, making him more susceptible to their influence. Throughout the movie, the spirits become more powerful, causing Matt greater harm. His fingers being bloody symbolize this growing power, as well as the increased suffering he endures as a result of being the main target of the spirits inhabiting the house. This paranormal activity ultimately culminates in a terrifying final confrontation between Matt, his family, and the spirits that threaten to tear them apart."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Associated Press. The search for a missing Alaska family of four has expanded to a densely wooded forest near a jail close to the family's home, but officials said there has been no information to lead them to look in any specific location. Crews are using a helicopter and all-terrain vehicles to search for Rebecca Adams, 22; her daughters, Michelle Hundley, 5, and Jarraca Hundley, 3; and Adams' boyfriend, Brandon Jividen, 37. Investigators also asked the public for information on the family missing for two weeks from their home in Kenai, about 65 miles southwest of Anchorage. A desperate search is underway for Michelle Hundley, five, (pictured left) and her sister, three-year-old Jaracca (right) who went missing from their Alaska home with their mother and her boyfriend last month. 'Don't assume information isn't worthwhile; we want to hear anything that may help,' Police Chief Gus Sandahl said. Adams last had contact with relatives May 27, the day after Memorial Day. The latest physical evidence of a sighting for Adams, Sandahl said, was an appearance with her children on a video surveillance recording May 18 at a Kenai business. Local police received a call. from a neighbor on May 31 who reported that a backyard shed door was. lying open at the family's home. Five. days later on June 5, the same neighbor contacted the police to report. that the family home appeared to have been lying empty for days. Lanell. Adams, who flew to Alaska from Washington state to look for her sister,. said: 'I've called dozens of times. I'm scared more than anything.' Rebecca Adams, 22, (left) vanished last month from her apartment in. Kenai along with her partner Brandon Jividen (right) and her two young. daughters. Adams said the last contact she had with her sister was distressing. The two women talked on the phone on Memorial Day weekend. 'She. sounded very distressed,' Lanell Adams said. 'She just told me: ''Know. that I love you,'' and she had to get off the phone very quickly.' 'Growing. up we always had this thing, we say 'Thou shall not lie' and you. always have to tell the truth,' Lanell Adams said. 'I asked her, ''Thou. shall not lie, Becca, are you ok?' She said, ''Don't ask me that right. now. Just know that I love you.' Police began investigating last weekend, and the FBI joined in the search. The family lives in a four-plex near the Wildwood Correction Facility, but they failed to pay rent this month. Residents tell the Peninsula Clarion the neighborhood is quiet but has a transitory nature. 'We don't know everybody in our building, much less buildings down the street,' said Amy Murrell-Haunold, who lives on the same street as the missing family. The FBI are looking for the two sisters who went missing with their mother and her partner in rural Alaska. Jeff Pfile and Anna Haave manage the building where the family has lived for two years. They said it was unusual for the Adams and Jividen to be late with a rent payment. 'If I felt they were going out of town I would have been the first person they called because they are so responsible (for paying their rent on time),' Haave said. 'For them to not say anything is not normal.' Police say vehicles belonging to Jividen and Adams remain parked at the four-plex, and their cellphones have been turned off. The family's brown and white English springer spaniel named Sparks also is missing. The father of her two girls, Jaramiah Hundley, died in a motorcycle crash in May 2012. Besides local police and the FBI, fire officials, canine units and wilderness search groups from across Alaska have been brought to Kenai to help search. Alaska State Troopers provided a helicopter to help search from the air, and police have used all-terrain vehicles on trails in woods near the home. The search area has expanded to areas north of the correctional facility. Dog teams. and helicopters have been drafted in to search the area surrounding. Kenai. On the lookout: A massive search for a family of four in Alaska is focusing on nearby woods and the behavior of one of the missing, a mother of two young children. The family disappeared from their home in Kenai, Alaska last month after relatives said that the mother, Rebecca Adams was showing signs of distress. Lt. David Cook told ABC: 'At this point it’s not apparent where. they have gone or where they might be. 'The investigation. does not show that is foul play at this point, but we are very deep into. the investigation of the missing persons.' Lt. Cook added: 'The family has expressed some concern. with the behavior of their sister Rebecca and have some concerns within. her relationship [to Brandon].' A Facebook group called Seeking. Alaska's Missing shared a picture of the missing family and urged. anyone with information to contact the Kenai Police Department. The. poster claimed that the family went missing on May 27. Police say they receive new information about the missing family every day, but nothing that would lead to finding them or even a specific location to search. 'We remain optimistic we will be able to reunite them with their family,' Sandahl said. 'We want nothing more at this point and hope they are safe.' Family members have put up fliers of the missing family members in popular fishing areas the family frequented on the Kenai Peninsula, and police statewide have been alerted, Sandahl said. No detail about their possible whereabouts is insignificant, he said. Kenai, a rural fishing port in the Gulf of Alaska, has a population of around 7,000 people and is 160 miles from Anchorage.

Context: Over the course of Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts. A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th Century. Sultan Mehmet II ordered Georgios Amiroutzes, a Greek scholar from Trabzon, to translate and make available to Ottoman educational institutions the geography book of Ptolemy. Another example is Ali Qushji -an astronomer, mathematician and physicist originally from Samarkand- who became a professor in two madrasas, and influenced Ottoman circles as a result of his writings and the activities of his students, even though he only spent two or three years before his death in Istanbul.

Kamal Hamade, the well-known and loved Lebanese owner of Taverna du Liban, made sure every visitor to his restaurant had a piece of gooey cake on the house, and then some. On Saturday, the Taliban attacked the cozy Lebanese restaurant in Afghanistan's capital. One man detonated a suicide vest while two others stormed into the restaurant and fired at those inside, killing 21 people, 13 of them expatriates. One of them was Kamal. Taverna had a decent security routine in place: Visitors drove up and knocked. The Afghan guard slid open the peep hole to take a look. The patron was searched before being let in to the restaurant a short distance away from the metal-door entrance. In January 2011, a suicide bomber blew himself up in a supermarket popular with expatriates and middle-class","completion":"Afghan families, marking a shift in the insurgents' tactics toward targeting civilian spaces that were once considered relatively safe. The attack on the Finest supermarket that day shook the international community in Kabul, causing an unprecedented level of fear and uncertainty about the future. Security measures were tightened not just around embassies and official buildings, but also in restaurants, shopping centers, and other places where foreigners and affluent Afghans were known to frequent. Despite these increased security precautions, the attack on Taverna du Liban served as a stark reminder of the unpredictable and brutal nature of the Taliban's insurgency. Those who had once enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and delicious food at Kamal's restaurant now found themselves mourning the loss of a beloved community fixture. Friends and patrons from around the world expressed their heartfelt condolences on social media, sharing stories of their experiences at Taverna and cherishing the memories of Kamal's infectious smile and warm hospitality. The days following the attack saw a city enveloped in shock and grief. Families and friends of the victims held somber memorial services to honor their lost loved ones. Non-governmental organizations and foreign missions considered relocating their staff to safer locations or even leaving the country altogether. For both local residents and the expatriate community, the once-thriving social scene in Kabul had become yet another casualty of the ongoing conflict. But amidst all the pain and sorrow, there were also faint glimmers of hope and resilience. In the wake of the Taverna tragedy, Kabul's residents began to rally together, embracing a spirit of unity and defiance against the terror that had been inflicted upon their city. Vigils were held, and fundraising events were organized to support the families of those who had perished. International and Afghan artists came together to create murals, installations, and other works of art to commemorate the victims and symbolize the city's determination to rise above the violence. As life slowly started to regain some semblance of normalcy, the memories of Kamal and his famous chocolate cake continued to live on in the hearts and minds of those who had been fortunate enough to experience his generosity and warmth. People from all walks of life spoke of their resolve to keep his spirit alive by fostering a culture of camaraderie, openness, and friendship in the face of adversity. And so, while the tragic events of that fateful Saturday night in January 2011 may have cast a long shadow over Kabul, the enduring legacy of Kamal Hamade and Taverna du Liban serves as an inspiring testament to the power of community, compassion, and love in the darkest of times. The best chocolate cake in Kabul and its creator left a bittersweet taste that would forever remind the city and its people of all that they had lost, as well as all that they had gained in the process of healing and rebuilding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Golden Globe Awards are accolades bestowed by the 93 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association beginning in January 1944, recognizing excellence in film and television, both domestic and foreign. The annual ceremony at which the awards are presented is a major part of the film industry's awards season, which culminates each year in the Academy Awards. The 74th Golden Globe Awards, honoring the best in film and television in 2016, was broadcast live on January 8, 2017. Jimmy Fallon hosted the show. In 1943, a group of writers banded together to form the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, and by creating a generously distributed award called the Golden Globe Award, they now play a significant role in film marketing. The 1st Golden Globe Awards, honoring the best achievements in 1943 filmmaking, was held in January 1944, at the 20th Century-Fox studios. Subsequent ceremonies were held at various venues throughout the next decade, including the Beverly Hills Hotel, and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. In 1950, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association made the decision to establish a special honorary award to recognize outstanding contributions to the entertainment industry.

Information: - Dream Theater is an American progressive metal band formed in 1985 under the name Majesty by John Petrucci, John Myung, and Mike Portnoy while they attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010, when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for a drummer to replace Portnoy. Mike Mangini was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011. - Satan (\\"satan\\", meaning \\"enemy\\" or \\"adversary\\"; \\"shaitan\\", meaning; \\"astray\\", \\"distant\\", or sometimes \\"devil\\") is a figure appearing in the texts of the Abrahamic religions who brings evil and temptation, and is known as the deceiver who leads humanity astray. Some religious groups teach that he originated as an angel, or something of the like, who used to possess great piety and beauty, but fell because of hubris, seducing humanity into the ways of falsehood and sin, and has power in the fallen world. In the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, Satan is primarily an accuser and adversary, a decidedly malevolent entity, also called the devil, who possesses abhorrent qualities. Although Satan is generally viewed as having negative characteristics, some groups have very different beliefs. In Theistic Satanism, Satan is considered a deity who is either worshipped or revered. In LaVeyan Satanism, \\"Satan\\" is a symbol of virtuous characteristics and liberty. - Reign in Blood is the third studio album and the major-label debut by American thrash metal band Slayer. It was released on October 7, 1986, by Def Jam Recordings.

Alongside Anthrax's \\"Among the Living\\", Megadeth's \\"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\\" and Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"Reign in Blood\\" helped define the sound of the emerging US thrash metal scene in the mid-1980s, and has remained influential since then. - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos.

The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information. - Cannibal Corpse is an American death metal band from Buffalo, New York. Formed in December 1988, the band has released thirteen studio albums, two box sets, four video albums and two live albums.

Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - RED Distribution, LLC (formerly Relativity Entertainment Distribution) is a Sony Music Entertainment-owned sales and marketing division that handles releases for more than sixty independent record labels.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:We all know that the normal human daily cycle of activity is of some 7-8 hours' sleep alternating with some 16-17 hours' wakefulness and that the sleep normally coincides with the hours of darkness. Our present concern is with how easily and to what extent this cycle can be modified. The question is no mere academic one. The ease, for example, with which people can change from working in the day to working at night is a question of growing importance in industry where automation calls for round-the-clock working of machines. It normally takes from five days to one week for a person to adapt to a reversed routine of sleep and wakefulness, sleeping during the day and working at night. Unfortunately, it is often the case in industry that shifts are changed every week; a person may work from 12 midnight to 8 a.m. one week, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. the next, and 4 p.m. to 12 midnight the third and so on. This means that no sooner has he got used to one routine than he has to change to another, so that much of his time is spent neither working nor sleeping very efficiently. The only real solution appears to be to hand over the night shift to a number of permanent night workers. An interesting study of the domestic life and health of night-shift workers was carried out by Brown in 1957. She found a high incidence of disturbed sleep and other disorders among those on alternating day and night shifts, but no abnormal occurrence of these phenomena among those on permanent night work. This latter system then appears to be the best long-term policy, but meanwhile something may be done to relieve the pressure of alternate day and night work by selecting those people who can adapt most quickly to the changes of routine. One way of knowing when a person has adapted is by measuring his body temperature. People occupied in normal daytime work will have a high temperature during the hours of wakefulness and a low one at night; when they change to night work the pattern will only gradually go back to match the new routine and the... It is possible to find out if a person has adapted to the changes of routine by measuring his body temperature because _ . A) body temperature is higher when the cycle of sleep and wakefulness alternates B) body temperature changes when he changes to night shift or back C) the temperature reverses when the routine is changed D) people have higher temperatures when they are working efficiently A:","completion":"The answer is B) body temperature changes when he changes to night shift or back. This is because a person's body temperature tends to be higher during hours of wakefulness and lower during sleep. When they switch from day work to night work, it takes time for their body temperature pattern to adjust to the new sleep/wake cycle. By measuring body temperature, it's possible to determine if someone has successfully adapted to a change in their routine."},{"prompt":"Question: Given the question \\"Where does the conversation most likely take place?\\" and the answer \\"At a hospital.\\", write a conversation that might have happened.

This situation is most likely to occur in a hospital, where patients often rely on others to bring them personal items and may have limited food options. In a library, it would be more likely that the primary topic of conversation would be related to books and there wouldn't be a need to bring books or inquire about food preferences. In a restaurant, the primary focus would be on food, and the mention of bringing books from somewhere else wouldn't be relevant to the setting. Additionally, there wouldn't be a reason for the woman to request a hair brush at a restaurant, as it is not a typical item to ask for in such a setting."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Michigan will lose 2 million in federal funding and 600,000 in state funding to provide legal aid to the poor in 2003, according to Deierdre L. Weir, executive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's largest provider of legal services to the poor. Current federal funds of nearly 10.7 million from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) will drop to 8.7 million for next year, according to Weir. She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 census. LSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation, and according to the census, the state's poverty population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000. The state's legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some 600,000 of state funding. A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently 7.5 million in 2002 to 6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of poverty in the state. LAD will lose more than 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, nearly half of the state's total loss, said Weir. While difficult to measure, the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive significantly limited service. Cutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. \\"Local providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much service as we can with fewer dollars,\\" said Weir. \\"We will be providing more selfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal system on their own in routine matters, more assistance on the telephone, and less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters. Currently, Michigan has 13 legal aid agencies covering the state's 83 counties.

Select from: (a). no; (b). yes;","completion":"(a). no; The response is not factually correct because the paragraph does not mention firing their executives as a way to cope with the funding drops.

It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Noise rock is a style of experimental rock rooted in noise music. The genre, which gained prominence in the 1980s, makes use of the traditional instrumentation and iconography of rock music, but incorporates atonality and especially dissonance, and frequently discards typical songwriting conventions. Noise rock developed from early avant-garde music, sound art, and rock songs featuring extremely dissonant sounds and electronic feedback. The New York no wave scene, featuring such artists as Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks in the late 1970s, was an essential development in noise rock. - Memphis is a city in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Tennessee and the county seat of Shelby County.

Upon release , Washing Machine reached No. 58 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and No. 39 on the UK Albums Chart . Two songs from the album , \`\` The Diamond Sea '' and \`\` Little Trouble Girl '' , were released as singles . The album received generally positive reviews from music critics , who praised the band for exploring new challenges as well as the guitar playing between band members Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo . In 1996 , the album was ranked at No. 18 in The Village Voice ' s Pazz & Jop critics ' poll for 1995 . - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A hedgehog is any of the spiny mammals of the subfamily Erinaceinae, in the Eulipotyphlan family Erinaceidae. There are seventeen species of hedgehog in five genera, found through parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction. There are no hedgehogs native to Australia, and no living species native to the Americas (the extinct genus \\"Amphechinus\\" was once present in North America). Hedgehogs share distant ancestry with shrews (family Soricidae), with gymnures possibly being the intermediate link, and have changed little over the last 15 million years. Like many of the first mammals, they have adapted to a nocturnal way of life. Hedgehogs' spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated porcupines, which are rodents, and echidnas, a type of monotreme. - The gymnure, also called a hairy hedgehog or moonrat, is a type of mammal belonging to the subfamily Galericinae, in the family Erinaceidae and the order Eulipotyphla. Gymnures resemble rats but are not closely related as they are not rodents: they are instead closely related to hedgehogs. They are thought to have appeared in Eastern Asia before their closest relatives, and changed little from the original ancestor, which is thought to have been also the ancestor of the shrews. - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. - The is a third-generation home video game console that was manufactured by Sega. It was originally released in 1985 as the Sega Mark III in Japan. After being redesigned prior to its North American launch, the console was renamed Master System and released in 1986 in North America, 1987 in Europe, and 1989 in Brazil. The redesigned Master System was also released in Japan in 1987. Both the Mark III and the original Master System models could play with both cartridges (or \\"Mega Cartridges\\", as they were officially called) and the credit card-sized Sega Cards, which retailed at lower prices than cartridges but had lower storage capacity; the Master System II and later models did not have the card slot. The Master System also featured accessories such as a light gun and 3D glasses which were designed to work with a range of specially coded games. - Pince-nez is a style of glasses, popular in the 19th century, that are supported without earpieces, by pinching the bridge of the nose. The name comes from French \\"pincer\\", \\"to pinch\\", and \\"nez\\", \\"nose\\". - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - Amphechinus is an extinct genus of hedgehog of the family Erinaceidae, which lived in Asia and Europe during the Oligocene and in North America, Africa, Asia, and Europe during the Miocene. - A shrew or shrew mouse (family Soricidae) is a small mole-like mammal classified in the order Eulipotyphla. True shrews are also not to be confused with West Indies shrews, treeshrews, otter shrews, or elephant shrews, which belong to different families or orders. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Development of \\"Sonic 3\\" began shortly after the release of \\"Sonic 2\\" in November 1992. It was developed simultaneously with \\"Sonic & Knuckles\\"; as the games were originally developed as a single title until time constraints and cartridge costs later forced the team to split them in two projects. The \\"Sonic & Knuckles\\" cartridge features \\"lock-on\\" technology that allows it to be physically attached to the \\"Sonic 3\\" cartridge, creating a combined game, \\"Sonic 3 & Knuckles\\". - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Sunglasses or sun glasses are a form of protective eyewear designed primarily to prevent bright sunlight and high-energy visible light from damaging or discomforting the eyes. They can sometimes also function as a visual aid, as variously termed spectacles or glasses exist, featuring lenses that are colored, polarized or darkened. In the early 20th century, they were also known as sun cheaters (cheaters being an American slang term for glasses). - Echidnas , sometimes known as spiny anteaters, belong to the family Tachyglossidae in the monotreme order of egg-laying mammals. The four extant species, together with the platypus, are the only surviving members of the order Monotremata and are the only living mammals that lay eggs. The diet of some species consists of ants and termites, but they are not closely related to the true anteaters of the Americas. Echidnas live in Australia and New Guinea. - The biological family Canidae The cat-like feliforms and dog-like caniforms emerged within the Carnivoramorpha 43 million years before present. The caniforms included the fox-like \\"Leptocyon\\" genus whose various species existed from 34 million years before present before branching 11.9 million YBP into Vulpini (foxes) and Canini (canines). Canids are found on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived independently or accompanied human beings over extended periods of time. Canids vary in size from the 2-m-long (6 ft 7 in) gray wolf to the 24-cm-long (9.4 in) fennec fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of young is reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. They are very intelligent. One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today remains one of the most widely kept domestic animals. - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. - An egg is the organic vessel containing the zygote in which an animal embryo develops until it can survive on its own, at which point the animal hatches. An egg results from fertilization of an ovum. Most arthropods, vertebrates, and mollusks lay eggs, although some do not, such as scorpions and most mammals. - In main line of video games, Dr. Eggman is a rotund mad scientist who plans to conquer the world in order to build his own Eggman Empire. While he has gone through several major and minor appearance changes throughout the series, his in-game designs retain several basic characteristics, such as his egg-shaped body, red-black-yellow clothing, pince-nez sunglasses, and large mustache. Eggman possesses ability of creating machines and robots (including wide variety of Badniks), as notably in early games, he has served as a recurring boss in almost every level for piloting one of his created vehicles. - Foxes are small-to-medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. Foxes are slightly smaller than a medium-size domestic dog, with a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or \\"brush\\"). - Obsessive love is a hypothetical state in which one person feels an overwhelming obsessive desire to possess another person toward whom one feels a strong attraction, with an inability to accept failure or rejection. Although not categorized specifically under any specific mental diagnosis by the DSM-5, some people argue that obsessive love is considered to be a mental illness similar to attachment disorder, borderline personality disorder, and erotomania. Obsessive lovers may feel entirely unable to restrain themselves from extreme behaviors such as acts of violence toward themselves. They may be entirely convinced that their feelings are love, and may reject the idea that their severe obsession is not love. Obsessive love has been frequently used and/or exaggerated in mass media, often with a woman having such affections for a man in either a comical or terrifying fashion. - Mad scientist (also mad doctor or mad professor) is a caricature of a scientist who is described as \\"mad\\" or \\"insane\\" owing to a combination of unusual or unsettling personality traits and the unabashedly ambitious, taboo and/or hubristic nature of their experiments. As a motif in fiction, the mad scientist may be villainous (evil genius) or antagonistic, benign or neutral; may be insane, eccentric, or clumsy; and often works with fictional technology or fails to recognize or value common human objections to attempting to play God. Some may have benevolent or good-spirited intentions, even if their actions are dangerous or questionable, which can make them accidental villains. - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\"). Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - A snout is the protruding portion of an animal's face, consisting of its nose, mouth, and jaw. In many animals the equivalent structure is called a muzzle, rostrum or proboscis. The wet, naked surface around the nostrils of the nose of some animals is known as the rhinarium (colloquially this is the \\"cold wet nose\\" of some animals). The rhinarium is often associated with a stronger sense of olfaction. The snout is considered a weak point on most animals: because of its structure, an animal can be easily stunned, snapped or even knocked out by applying sufficient force. - Eulipotyphla (\\"truly fat and blind\\") is an order of mammals suggested by molecular methods of phylogenetic reconstruction, and includes the laurasiatherian members of the now-invalid polyphyletic order Lipotyphla, but not the afrotherian members (tenrecs and golden moles, now in their own order Afrosoricida). Lipotyphla in turn had been derived by removing a number of groups from Insectivora, the previously used wastebasket taxon. - The tail is the section at the rear end of an animal's body; in general, the term refers to a distinct, flexible appendage to the torso. It is the part of the body that corresponds roughly to the sacrum and coccyx in mammals, reptiles, and birds. While tails are primarily a feature of vertebrates, some invertebrates including scorpions and springtails, as well as snails and slugs, have tail-like appendages that are sometimes referred to as tails. Tailed objects are sometimes referred to as \\"caudate\\" and the part of the body associated with or proximal to the tail are given the adjective \\"caudal\\". - The Sonic the Hedgehog video game franchise began in 1991 with the game Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Genesis , which pitted a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic against a rotund human man named Doctor Eggman ( or Doctor Ivo Robotnik ) . The sequel , Sonic 2 , gave Sonic a fox friend named Tails . Shortly afterward , Sonic CD introduced Amy Rose , a female hedgehog with a persistent crush on Sonic , and Sonic 3 introduced Knuckles the Echidna , Sonic 's rival and , later , friend . All five of these have remained major characters and appeared in dozens of games . The series has introduced dozens of additional recurring characters over the years . These have ranged from anthropomorphic animal characters like Shadow the Hedgehog and Cream the Rabbit to robots created by Eggman like Metal Sonic and E- 123 Omega , as well as human characters like Eggman 's grandfather Gerald Robotnik . The series also features two fictional species : Chao , which have usually functioned as digital pets and minor gameplay and plot elements , and Wisps , which have been used as power - ups . The Sonic games keep a separate continuity from the Sonic the Hedgehog comics published by Archie Comics and other Sonic media and , as a result , feature a distinct yet overlapping array of characters . - Monotremes are basal mammals that lay eggs (Prototheria) instead of giving birth to live young like marsupials (Metatheria) and placental mammals (Eutheria). The only surviving examples of monotremes are all indigenous to Australia and New Guinea, although there is evidence that they were once more widespread. The existing monotreme species are the platypus and four species of echidnas. There is currently some debate regarding monotreme taxonomy. - , originally nicknamed Rosy the Rascal, is a fictional character in Sega's \\"Sonic the Hedgehog\\" series. She is a pink anthropomorphic hedgehog with a cheerful, competitive personality. Amy is known for her unrequited and obsessive love for the series' main character Sonic. They have saved each other's lives on a number of occasions, however, and are good friends. During the series' early years, her appearance changed several times. - The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917, and production of anime works in Japan has since continued to increase steadily. The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century, developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, by television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. It is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences. - Porcupines are rodentian mammals with a coat of sharp spines, or quills, that protect against predators. The term covers two families of animals, the Old World porcupines of family Hystricidae, and the New World porcupines of family Erethizontidae. Both families belong to the clade Hystricognathi within the profoundly diverse order Rodentia and display superficially similar coats of quills: despite this, the two groups are distinct from each other and are not closely related to each other within Hystricognathi. - Knuckles debuted as an antagonist in \\"Sonic the Hedgehog 3\\" in 1994; Doctor Eggman tricks him into opposing Sonic and Tails. He first became playable in \\"Sonic & Knuckles\\" later that year; he learns of Eggman's trickery and teams up with Sonic during that game's events. Since then he has appeared in dozens of playable and non-playable roles, as well as in several series of comic books, Western animated television, and Japanese anime. He is one of the series' most popular and recognizable characters. - In biological classification, a subfamily (Latin: ', plural ') is an auxiliary (intermediate) taxonomic rank, next below family but more inclusive than genus. Standard nomenclature rules end subfamily botanical names with \\"-oideae\\", and zoological names with \\"-inae\\". - Australasia, a region of Oceania, comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Charles de Brosses coined the term (as French \\"Australasie\\") in \\"Histoire des navigations aux terres australes\\" (1756). He derived it from the Latin for \\"south of Asia\\" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica). The bulk of Australasia sits on the Indo-Australian Plate, together with India. - The Sega Genesis, known as the in most regions outside North America, is a 16-bit home video game console which was developed and sold by Sega Enterprises, Ltd. The Genesis was Sega's third console and the successor to the Master System. Sega first released the console as the Mega Drive in Japan in 1988, followed by a North American debut under the Genesis moniker in 1989. In 1990, the console was distributed as the Mega Drive by Virgin Mastertronic in Europe, by Ozisoft in Australasia, and by Tec Toy in Brazil. In South Korea, the systems were distributed by Samsung and were known as the Super Gam*Boy, and later the Super Aladdin Boy.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To brown butter","completion":"Browning butter is a simple, yet transformative process that unlocks intense nutty and complex flavors from regular unsalted butter. When done right, brown butter can elevate various dishes, from sautés and pasta sauces to cookies and brownies. Here's a detailed guide to help you achieve perfectly browned butter: 1. Choose the right butter: It is essential to start with good-quality unsalted butter since the flavor of the final product greatly depends on it. Lower-quality butter might contain more water, which can affect the browning process. Unsalted butter is preferred as it allows you to control the salt content of your dish. 2. Prepare the tools: For optimal results, you'll need a light-colored pan with a heavy bottom, like stainless steel or enameled cast iron. The lighter color allows you to monitor the color change more easily, avoiding burning. Additionally, the thick bottom conducts heat more evenly, preventing the butter from scorching. You will also need a heat-resistant spatula or a wooden spoon for stirring and a bowl to collect the browned butter. 3. Cut the butter into small pieces: This ensures that the butter melts evenly and more quickly. It'll also help you to monitor the browning more effectively. 4. Heat the pan: Place the pan on the stove over medium heat and let it get warm. 5. Melt the butter: Add the butter to the pan and stir gently to promote even melting. Make sure to scrape the bottom and sides to prevent any butter from sticking and brown spots from forming. 6. Monitor the stages: Keep an eye on the color change and listen to the changes in sizzling sounds. It will go through three main phases: a. Foaming: In this first stage, the butter will foam up as the water content starts to evaporate. The sizzling will get louder and the foam will rise. Keep stirring, watching, and listening. b. Subsiding foam: The foam will begin to subside and the butter will start to smell nutty. At this point, the milk solids will separate and sink to the bottom, so keep stirring to prevent them from burning. c. Browning: The butter will reach a golden brown color, and the milk solids at the bottom will turn brown as well. The sizzling sound will subside, indicating that most of the water content has evaporated. 7. Keep a watchful eye: This is the critical stage when the milk solids can easily go from browned to burned. Make sure not to walk away and pay close attention to the smell, color, and sound. 8. Remove the pan from heat: As soon as the butter reaches a deep golden brown color and has a fragrant nutty smell, remove the pan from the heat. The residual heat will continue to cook the milk solids in the pan, so it is essential to remove it from the heat source at the right time. 9. Pour the browned butter into a bowl: To stop the cooking process and prevent the brown butter from burning, transfer it immediately to a heatproof bowl using the spatula or spoon to scrape every last bit. 10. Cool and store: Let the brown butter cool down before using it in your recipes. You can store it at room temperature for up to a week or refrigerate it in an airtight container for up to a month. If refrigerated, it will solidify and require gentle reheating before using it in your dishes. By following these steps and paying attention to the visual and audible cues, you'll be able to master the art of browning butter, which is sure to indulge your senses and enhance your culinary creations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"what happens to to \\"independent thinkers\\"?\\" Context: \\"Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body. The religion does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices; members who openly disagree with the religion's teachings are expelled and shunned. Witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body, reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of \\"God's organization\\". It also warns members to \\"avoid independent thinking\\", claiming such thinking \\"was introduced by Satan the Devil\\" and would \\"cause division\\". Those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as \\"apostates\\" who are \\"mentally diseased\\".\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In the context of Jehovah's Witnesses, independent thinkers are individuals who question or disagree with the established doctrines and practices set forth by the Governing Body. Such individuals may openly challenge or express doubt about the religion's teachings. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what happens to independent thinkers in this context: 1. Independent thinking is identified: When a person starts to question or express disagreement with the doctrines and practices of Jehovah's Witnesses, they are considered to be engaging in independent thinking. 2. Discouragement: Witness publications aim to suppress independent thinking, discouraging followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body. They emphasize the importance of trusting the organization as a part of \\"God's organization.\\" 3. Warning: Members are warned to avoid independent thinking, as it is said to be introduced by Satan the Devil. The religion teaches that independent thinking will cause division among its members. 4. Labeling dissenters: Those who continue to openly disagree with official teachings are labeled as \\"apostates,\\" which is a term used to describe someone who renounces a religious belief or principle. They are further condemned as being \\"mentally diseased.\\" 5. Expulsion and shunning: Members who refuse to conform and continue to openly challenge the religion's teachings are expelled from the organization. Once expelled, former members are shunned by the remaining members, including friends and family, in accordance with the organization's rules. In summary, independent thinkers in the context of Jehovah's Witnesses experience discouragement, warnings, condemnation, potential expulsion, and shunning from the organization due to their questioning or disagreement with established doctrines and practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He made a living by teaching the piano and publishing songs, piano pieces and orchestral suites, all in the popular style of the day. Prix de Rome winners were sometimes invited by the Opéra-Comique in Paris to compose a work for performance there. At Thomas's instigation, Massenet was commissioned to write a one-act opéra comique, La grand'tante, presented in April 1867. At around the same time he composed a Requiem, which has not survived. In 1868 he met Georges Hartmann, who became his publisher and was his mentor for twenty-five years; Hartmann's journalistic contacts did much to promote his protégé's reputation.In October 1866 Massenet and Ninon were married; their only child, Juliette, was born in 1868. Massenet's musical career was briefly interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, during which he served as a volunteer in the National Guard alongside his friend Bizet. He found the war so \\"utterly terrible\\" that he refused to write about it in his memoirs. He and his family were trapped in the Siege of Paris but managed to get out before the horrors of the Paris Commune began; the family stayed for some months in Bayonne, in southwestern France.After order was restored, Massenet returned to Paris where he completed his first large-scale stage work, an opéra comique in four acts, Don César de Bazan (Paris, 1872). It was a failure, but in 1873 he succeeded with his incidental music to Leconte de Lisle's tragedy Les Érinnyes and with the dramatic oratorio, Marie-Magdeleine, both of which were performed at the Théâtre de l'Odéon.

One day, he sees a news report about the arrest of Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), a young altar boy from Kentucky with a severe stutter, who is accused of brutally murdering the beloved Archbishop Rushman (Stanley Anderson). Vail jumps at the chance to represent the young man pro bono. During his meetings at the county jail with Aaron, Vail comes to believe that his client is innocent, much to the chagrin of the prosecutor (and Vail's former lover), Janet Venable (Laura Linney). As the murder trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt State's attorney John Shaughnessy (John Mahoney), have lost millions of dollars in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop on certain church lands. The Archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. Vail makes a search of the Archbishop's apartment and finds a videotape of Stampler being forced to perform in a sexual act with another altar boy and a girl named Linda (Azalea Davila). Vail is now in a bind: Introducing this evidence would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury, but it would also give his client a motive for the murder, which Venable is unable to establish.

A young lady in her early twenties and her husband pull up in their 1969 Ford Country Squire Station wagon to a lavish upstate New York home on a lake, near the town of Ilium, believed to be the fictional title for the actual city of Schenectady. She frantically knocks on the front door calling for her father and no response. She peers through all the windows of the lavish home and sees nothing. Then she lets herself in the back of the home in the utility room desperately searching for her father.In the basement of his home, Billy Pilgrim, a balding, bespectacled, mild-mannered, and passive man of 45 years of age is typing a letter to his local daily newspaper of his time travels and how he is uncontrollably traveling from one point of his life to the other, being \\"unstuck in time\\". While he is typing his letter, he finds himself at the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium in January 1945, at the age of 22 alone and running through the snow. He is not dressed as a soldier at all, no weapon, and wearing a stocking cap, overcoat, sweater, and pants that are nothing suggesting Army attire. He is kidnapped by two brash, uncouth, mean, and very stupid men of his age, fellow soldiers named Paul Lazzaro and Roland Weary. They immediately think he's a German, but he denies it and they soon forget about it, since there's an attack going on. The men's Corporal abandons them and Lazzaro swears revenge.Briefly, Billy finds himself back on planet Tralfamadore in the geodesic dome with beautiful, 20-something porn star queen, Montana Wildhack and she suspects he's time traveling again and wants to give him a kiss to help forget about it.

The question is: \\"Name something a grown woman might lie about but a young girl wouldn't.\\" Answer: A grown woman might lie about her age, but a young girl usually wouldn't. Reasoning: In many societies, there is a perceived pressure on women to look and feel younger, as youthfulness is often associated with beauty and vitality. As a result, a grown woman may feel the need to lie about her age to conform to society's expectations or her own personal desires. On the other hand, young girls typically do not experience this pressure yet, as they are often eager to grow up and feel more mature. Hence, they are less likely to lie about their age. This difference in perspective between grown women and young girls justifies the answer that a grown woman might lie about her age, while a young girl wouldn't."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To encourage men to get off the couch; (4). not enough information; Given those answer options, answer the question: Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period.

Article: The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) is an international organization that brings together zoos and aquariums to cooperate in efforts to advance the respectful, humane treatment of animals in our care, and to support the conservation of animals across the globe. WAZA was shocked and disappointed to learn of the inappropriate and damaging content in the new TV show Wonderful Friends, jointly produced by China's biggest zoo & circus company (Chimelong) and one of China's top TV companies (Hunan TV). The show dresses up chimpanzees in human clothes and markets them as \\"cute pets\\". The animals are placed in many stressful and harmful situations, in order to create \\"entertaining\\" story lines. It is disappointing to note that Chinese pop singer and actress Li Yuchun took part in this show, helping to popularize these misleading and inhumane practices. In one example, a young chimp bit an actress in the face right next to a zoo visitor, and then bit another actor leaving a wound on his hand. WAZA is strongly against practices and shows of this nature. Animals presented in such cruel and unnatural surroundings cannot contribute to serious conservation efforts. Presenting chimpanzees in unnatural and anthropomorphic settings suggests to viewers that they are not endangered and make great pets. Such shows are not only disrespectful to animals, they also lack any sort of conservation purpose. According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, chimpanzees are now considered endangered, and wild populations are declining rapidly. WAZA recognizes that the growing popularity of television programmes such as Wonderful Friends can only increase the already-huge existing demand for chimpanzees as pets. WAZA requests the following: (1) The immediate cancel of this programme and similar shows wherever they may take place; (2) That all animals held in captivity be provided with the highest level of care; (3) That under no circumstances should chimpanzees be imported from the wild just for entertainment purposes. Question: According to the passage, what is WAZA in favour of? Options: A: Stopping importing chimpanzees. B: Never dressing any animals in human clothes.

Tolkien's legendarium (see: \\"The History of Middle-earth\\"), Tol Eressëa was an island visited by the Anglo-Saxon traveller Ælfwine (in earlier versions, Eriol) which provided a framework for the tales that later became \\"The Silmarillion\\". The name is Quenya for \\"Lonely Island\\". In early versions, the Cottage of Lost Play is located in Kortirion, the island's main city, and it is here that Eriol the Mariner comes. There is an early poem by Tolkien, entitled \\"Kortirion\\", several versions of which can be found in \\"The Book of Lost Tales\\", Volume I. - Sindarin is a fictional language devised by J. R. R. Tolkien for use in his fantasy stories set in Arda (popularly called Middle-earth). Sindarin is one of the many languages spoken by the immortal Elves, called the \\"Eledhrim\\" or \\"Edhellim\\" in Sindarin. The word \\"Sindarin\\" is itself a Quenya form. The only known Sindarin word for this language is Eglathrin, a word probably only used in the First Age (see Eglath). - In the fictional universe, or legendarium, described in the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Vanyar are the fairest and most noble of the High Elves. They are the smallest of the three clans of the Eldar, and were the first to arrive in Aman. According to legend, the clan was founded by Imin, the first Elf to awake at Cuiviénen, with his wife Iminyë and their twelve companions. Ingwë was the Vanya Elf to travel with Oromë to Valinor, and became their king. The Vanyar speak a dialect of Quenya called Vanyarin. - Valinor (\\"Land of the Valar\\") is a fictional location in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, the realm of the Valar in Aman. It was also known as the Undying Lands, along with Tol Eressëa and the outliers of Aman. This latter name is somewhat misleading; the land itself, while blessed, did not cause mortals to live forever. However, only immortal beings were generally allowed to reside there. Exceptionally the surviving bearers of the One Ring were allowed to dwell there for a time Bilbo and Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee and perhaps Gimli son of Glóin who, it is said, accompanied his friend Legolas to Valinor. - In the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Teleri, \\"Those who come last\\" in Quenya (singular \\"Teler\\") were the third of the Elf clans who came to Aman. Those who came to Aman became known as the Falmari or \\"sea elves\\" and these are the Elves who are generally known as Teleri, though the term also includes their Middle-earth cousins the Sindar, Laiquendi, and Nandor of Middle-earth. - Middle-earth is the setting of much of J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. The term is equivalent to the term \\"Midgard\\" of Norse mythology, describing the human-inhabited world, i.e. the central continent of the Earth in Tolkien's imagined mythological past. Tolkien's most widely read works, \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", take place entirely in Middle-earth, and \\"Middle-earth\\" has also become a short-hand to refer to the legendarium or its \\"fictional universe\\". - In the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Noldor (also spelled Ñoldor, meaning \\"those with knowledge\\" in Quenya) are High Elves of the Second Clan who migrated to Valinor and lived in Eldamar. The Noldor are called \\"Golodhrim\\" or \\"Gódhellim\\" in Sindarin, and \\"Goldui\\" by Teleri of Tol Eressëa. The singular form of the Quenya noun is \\"Noldo\\" and the adjective is \\"Noldorin\\". They were the Second Clan of the Elves in both order and size, the other clans being the Vanyar and the Teleri. Like the Teleri, they typically had grey eyes and dark hair (except for those who had Vanyarin blood, most prominently the members of the House of Finarfin). - Aman is a fictional place in J. R. R. Tolkien 's legendarium , also known as the Undying Lands or Blessed Realm , it is the home of the Valar , and three kindreds of Elves : the Vanyar , some of the Noldor , and some of the Teleri .

Sir Henry Joseph Wood (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms. He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -2576 = -729*c + 841*c for c.","completion":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step. We have this equation: -2576 = -729*c + 841*c First, we need to combine the terms with \\"c\\" in them. To do that, think of -729 candies and you add 841 candies. -729*c + 841*c = (-729 + 841) * c = 112*c So now, our equation is: -2576 = 112*c Now we need to find the value of \\"c\\". To do that, imagine you have 112 groups of candies totaling -2576 candies, and you want to find out how many candies are in each group. All you need to do is to divide -2576 by 112. c = -2576 / 112 c = -23 So the solution is: c = -23"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Evans' third studio album, Born to Fly, was released on October 10, 2000. She insisted on hiring Seattle-based rock drummer Matt Chamberlain (The Wallflowers, Edie Brickell), who brought a different sound to her music. The album's title track (\\"Born to Fly\\"), which was released as the lead single, was a Number One hit on the Hot Country Songs chart. Three more singles were released from the album (\\"I Could Not Ask for More,\\" \\"I Keep Looking,\\" and \\"Saints & Angels\\"), the first two reaching the Top 10, and the latter becoming a Top 20 hit. Born to Fly was eventually certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA in 2004.

It was recognised as the Royal County of Berkshire because of the presence of Windsor Castle by the Queen in 1957 and letters patent issued in 1974. Berkshire is a county of historic origin and is a home county, a ceremonial county and a non-metropolitan county without a county council. Berkshire County Council was the main county governance from 1889 to 1998 except for the separately administered County Borough of Reading. - Gentry (from Old French \\"genterie\\", from \\"gentil\\", \\"high-born, noble\\") are \\"well-born, genteel and well-bred people\\" of high social class, especially in the past. \\"Gentry\\", in its widest connotation, refers to people of good social position connected to landed estates (see manorialism), upper levels of the clergy, and \\"gentle\\" families of long descent who never obtained the official right to bear a coat of arms. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Maidenhead is a large town and unparished area in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, in Berkshire, England. It lies south of the River Thames, but at Maidenhead, the river runs north-south and so the town is in fact on its west bank. The town has a population in 2011 of 67,404. Its urban area (including the adjoining suburban villages of Bray, Holyport, Pinkneys Green, Taplow (Buckinghamshire) Cox Green, White Waltham and Woodlands Park) has a population of just under 90,000. The mainline railway station was set to be the terminus of the Crossrail line until the announcement was made that Reading was to be the new terminus. - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries. - Letters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president, or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices, or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \\"practice\\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use. - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial based on feudal responsibilities and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court. - In England, an unparished area is an area that is not covered by a civil parish (a small administrative division of local government, not to be confused with an ecclesiastical parish). Most urbanised districts of England are either entirely or partly unparished. Many towns and some cities in otherwise rural districts are also unparished areas and therefore no longer have a town council or city council. Some cities and towns which are unparished areas in larger districts (i.e. not districts of themselves) have charter trustees to maintain a historic charter, such as city status (an example being in Bath) or simply the mayoralty of a town. - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority.

Ockwells was then owned by Sir John 's uncle , Sir Thomas Fettiplace . It passed through the Fettiplace family , before being owned by the Day family . - White Waltham is a village and civil parish, west of Maidenhead, in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire, England.

It sits on the left bank of the River Thames, facing Maidenhead in the neighbouring county of Berkshire, and is roughly west of Burnham and west of Charing Cross in London. - A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor. The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system; within its great hall were held the lord's manorial courts, communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets. The term is today loosely applied to various country houses, frequently dating from the late medieval era, which formerly housed the gentry. - Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the English county of Berkshire. It is notable for its long association with the English and later British royal family and for its architecture. The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I, it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. The castle's lavish early 19th-century State Apartments were described by the art historian Hugh Roberts as \\"a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste\\". Inside the castle walls is the 15th-century St George's Chapel, considered by the historian John Martin Robinson to be \\"one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic\\" design. - Buckinghamshire (or ), abbreviated Bucks, is a county in South East England which borders Greater London to the south east, Berkshire to the south, Oxfordshire to the west, Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire to the north east and Hertfordshire to the east. - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount). - A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\". - Pinkneys Green is a village within the north-western bounds of the town of Maidenhead in the English county of Berkshire.

Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive.

Just like when you don't want anyone peeking while you're playing with your toys, right? So, to know if someone might be a stalker, we can look for some clues: 1. They keep showing up in places you go, even when it's a surprise! It's like playing hide and seek, but they always find you super fast. 2. They send you too many messages, like asking \\"What are you doing?\\" all the time, even when it's not fun anymore. 3. They might try to find out a lot about you, like what you like and don't like, where you live, or where you go to school. That's like someone who keeps asking you questions about your favorite cartoons or snacks, and they don't stop. If you see these clues and you don't feel safe or happy, it's important to tell a grown-up, like your mom, dad, or teacher, to help you.

A:","completion":"A: The oldest signer of the Declaration of Independence was Benjamin Franklin. Born on January 17, 1706, in Boston, Massachusetts, he was 70 years old when the Declaration was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. Benjamin Franklin was a polymath, who contributed significantly to the fields of science, writing, and politics. Among his many accomplishments, he is best known for his experiments with electricity, his role in drafting the U.S. Constitution, and his influence as a founding father of the United States. His inventions, such as the lightning rod and the bifocals, greatly impacted society at that time and even today. In 1729, Franklin moved to Philadelphia, where he started a printing business and eventually published the well-known \\"Poor Richard's Almanack.\\" He also founded several civic organizations, such as the Library Company of Philadelphia (America's first lending library) and the American Philosophical Society. He dedicated much of his life to public service, holding multiple positions such as Postmaster General of the colonies and the President of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. Franklin was an early and passionate advocate for colonial unity and independence. As a member of the Continental Congress, he was among the five individuals (including Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston) appointed to the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence in 1776. From 1776 to 1785, Franklin served as the U.S. envoy to France, where he played a significant role in building French support for the American Revolution. He helped negotiate the Treaty of Alliance (1778) and the Treaty of Paris (1783) that ended the war. Upon returning to the U.S., Franklin was elected as a member of the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and played a crucial role in shaping the U.S. Constitution. He took initiative in advancing the procedures of the Great Compromise, which focused on balancing representation between large and small states. Although Benjamin Franklin did not hold formal political office by the end of his life, his influence and contributions as a statesman, scientist, and writer left a lasting impact on the development of the United States. His advanced age during the signing of the Declaration of Independence affirmed his long-standing commitment to the cause of freedom and the birth of a new nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Additionally, it mentions that in some states, the attorney general serves as the head of a state department of justice, with responsibilities similar to those of the United States Department of Justice.

In an incident that authorities are describing as a stroke of luck, a helicopter pilot has managed to walk away unscathed from a serious crash in Northern California. The accident occurred between San Francisco and Sacramento, with the helicopter going down near Byron Airport, which is situated south of the crash site. The brave pilot, whose identity has not yet been disclosed, is being lauded for his navigational skills, allowing him to land the aircraft in a relatively safe area and avoid further damage or injury. Emergency services were quick to respond to the scene, providing immediate assistance and ensuring that there were no fires or other hazards as a result of the accident. Fire officials, who are coordinating the response to the crash, took the opportunity to emphasize how extremely lucky the pilot is to have survived the accident. \\"Helicopter accidents of this nature typically result in severe injuries or even fatalities. The fact that the pilot was able to walk away is nothing short of miraculous,\\" a spokesperson stated. Witnesses on the ground reported seeing the helicopter descending rapidly, and many feared the worst as they observed the crash. However, those fears were quickly allayed as the pilot was seen safely disembarking from the wreckage. The cause of the helicopter crash is currently under investigation, as authorities seek to ascertain the events leading up to the accident. Officials are expected to closely scrutinize the pilot's actions, as well as the mechanical and structural integrity of the aircraft itself. Byron Airport, a public-use airport located in Contra Costa County near the town of Byron, attracts both general aviation pilots and cargo companies, and has a reputation for safety and professionalism. The management at the airport were quick to express relief that the accident had not resulted in any fatalities or major injuries. The incident comes amidst an overall decline in aviation accidents in the United States. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, 2019 saw a significant reduction in the number of fatal general aviation accidents, continuing a downward trend observed over several years. While the outcome of this particular accident was undeniably fortunate, the event serves as a reminder of the inherent risks associated with aviation in general. Air travel, despite its impressive safety record compared to other modes of transportation, is not without its dangers. As investigators continue to probe the circumstances surrounding this helicopter crash, one fact remains abundantly clear: the pilot's remarkable escape has become a testament to both his skill and the role that luck can sometimes play in the most harrowing situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Stewart Armstrong Copeland was born in Alexandria, Virginia on July 16, 1952, the youngest of four children of CIA officer Miles Copeland, Jr. and Scottish archaeologist Lorraine Adie. The family moved to Cairo, Egypt, a few months after his birth, and Copeland spent his formative years in the Middle East. In 1957, his family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, and Copeland attended the American Community School there. He started taking drum lessons at age 12 and was playing drums for school dances within a year. Context: In late 1976, Copeland founded the Police with lead singer-bass guitarist Sting and guitarist Henry Padovani (who was soon replaced by Andy Summers), and they became one of the top bands of the 1980s. The Police's early track list was mostly made of Copeland's compositions, including the band's first single \\"Fall Out\\" (Illegal Records, 1977) and the B side \\"Nothing Achieving\\". Though Copeland's songwriting contribution was reduced to a couple of songs per album as Sting started writing more material, he continued to co-arrange all the Police's songs with his two bandmates. Amongst Copeland's most notable songs are \\"On Any Other Day\\" (where he sang lead vocals too), \\"Does Everyone Stare\\" (later to be used as the title of his documentary on the band Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out), \\"Contact\\", \\"Bombs Away\\", \\"Darkness\\" and \\"Miss Gradenko\\". Copeland also co-wrote a number of songs with Sting, including \\"Peanuts\\", \\"Landlord\\", \\"It's Alright for You\\" and \\"Re-Humanize Yourself\\". Copeland also recorded under the pseudonym Klark Kent, releasing several UK singles in 1978 with one (\\"Don't Care\\") entering the UK Singles Chart that year, along with an eponymously titled 10-inch album on green vinyl released in 1980. Recorded at Nigel Gray's Surrey Sound Studio, Copeland played all the instruments and sang the lead vocals himself. Kent's \\"Don't Care\\", which peaked at #48 UK in August 1978, actually predates the first chart single by the Police by several months (\\"Can't Stand Losing You\\", issued in October 1978) as \\"Don't Care\\" was released in early June 1978. In 1982 Copeland was involved in the production of a WOMAD benefit album called Music and Rhythm. Copeland's score for Rumble Fish secured him a Golden Globe nomination in 1983. The film, directed and produced by Francis Ford Coppola from the S. E. Hinton novel, also had a song released to radio on A&M Records \\"Don't Box Me In\\" (UK Singles Chart n. 91)--a collaboration between Copeland and singer/songwriter Stan Ridgway, leader of the band Wall of Voodoo--that received significant airplay upon release of the film that year. The Police stopped touring in 1984, and during this brief hiatus he released a solo album, The Rhythmatist. The record was the result of a pilgrimage to Africa and its people, and it features local drums and percussion, with more drums, percussion, other musical instruments and occasional lead vocals added by Copeland. The album was the official soundtrack to the movie of the same name, which was co-written by Stewart. He also starred in the film, which is \\"A musical odyssey through the heart of Africa in search of the roots of rock & roll.\\" (Copeland is seen playing the drums in a cage with lions surrounding him.) The band attempted a reunion in 1986, but the project fell apart. Question: Were the songs successfull?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, many of the songs by the Police and Stewart Copeland were successful. The Police became one of the top bands of the 1980s, and their singles like \\"Don't Care\\" and \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\" entered the UK Singles Chart. They had many popular songs, and Stewart Copeland's solo album, The Rhythmatist, was also the official soundtrack for a movie.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Navy vs. the Night Monsters Context: A group of scientists with Operation Deep Freeze discover frozen prehistoric trees and other specimens in the Antarctic dating back to the first Ice Age. They collect samples of each for further study and load them aboard their C-47 military transport. The dull, workaday life at the Navy weather station base on Gow Island in the South Pacific is interrupted by that very same C-47 transport aircraft. On a routine approach for refueling, the transport experiences unusual trouble and suddenly crash lands on the island's single airstrip, destroying its control tower and the island's only two-way radio. The stricken aircraft also blocks the runway, preventing its further use. Lieutenant Charles Brown (Eisley) is in command of Gow's weather station. He, Navy nurse Nora Hall (Van Doren), and biologist Arthur Beecham (Walter Sande) reach the wreck only to find that seven scientists and crew aboard the cargo aircraft when it left Antarctica are now mysteriously missing. The only one found aboard is the transport's pilot, who is traumatized and in a state of shock, unable to speak. Unloading the prehistoric cargo from the crashed C-47, Dr. Beecham recommends planting the trees to ensure their survival in the island's tropical conditions. Somewhat later, Gow Island's bird population becomes disturbed by something unknown. At the same time, the weather station's scientists try to figure out a connection between this event and a corrosive residue that begins turning up at various island locations. It slowly becomes clear that the planted prehistoric trees have quickly grown into acid-secreting, carnivorous monsters that move about Gow Island at night, at will. They reproduce fast and eventually cut off the island with their growing numbers and nocturnal assaults on Gow's native islanders. Brown has to hold together his dwindling Navy personnel and the coterie of scientists and civilians while figuing out a way to stop this prehistoric menace. The Navy personnel's only available weapons prove largely ineffective against...

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

Breaking down the translation: - \\"We would not like\\" is translated as \\"Nous ne souhaiterions pas\\", where \\"nous\\" refers to \\"we\\", \\"ne...pas\\" is the negation, and \\"souhaiterions\\" is the conditional form of the verb \\"souhaiter\\", meaning \\"to wish\\" or \\"to like\\". - \\"to take responsibility\\" is translated as \\"assumer la responsabilité\\". \\"Assumer\\" means \\"to take\\" or \\"to accept\\" and \\"responsabilité\\" means \\"responsibility\\". - \\"for the failure\\" is translated as \\"de l'échec\\", where \\"de\\" means \\"of\\" or \\"for\\" and \\"l'échec\\" means \\"the failure\\". - \\"of something\\" is translated as \\"de quelque chose\\". \\"Quelque chose\\" means \\"something\\" in French. - \\"that we desire\\" is translated as \\"que nous désirons\\". \\"Que\\" is a relative pronoun that is equivalent to \\"that\\" in this context, \\"nous\\" refers to \\"we\\", and \\"désirons\\" is the present form of the verb \\"désirer\\", meaning \\"to desire\\".

College student Sarah Foster is found by the police, as she is sleepwalking in her nightgown on the road. Since the suicide of her husband Jonathon, who worked as a novelist, she is suffering from sleep disorder. A few days later, she talks to Dr Cooper, whose student she was, about the sleepwalking and a recurring nightmare, in which she is attacked by an unknown man. Cooper sends her to a therapy in a sleep laboratory. During a walk on a cemetery, Sarah talks about it with her room mate Dawn, who shows a personal interest in her professor Owen. Then an attractive man gets out of a black car and Sarah imagines him being a single. At the evening in the sleep laboratory, Dr. Koslov explains to her that her neuronal activity will be observed during the night. He also introduces her to Dr. Scott White, the director of the lab. It is the man whom Sarah has seen at the cemetery. He tells her, that a student was buried and he was there with a colleague. Sarah confides to him that she loved her husband, but not his work as a novelist. The next morning she wakes up in a different room after a silent, dreamless night. White takes her case.

We are trying to find the value of 'b' in the equation: 0 = -1885 * b - 14726 - 13549 1. First, let's add 14726 and 13549 together: 14726 + 13549 = 28275 Now our equation looks like this: 0 = -1885 * b - 28275 2.

Finally, let's divide both sides of the equation by -1885 to find the value of 'b': 28275 ÷ -1885 = (-1885 * b) ÷ -1885 -15 = b So the answer is b = -15."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Having become established in European universities, this usage spread around the world. Contracted \`\`Dr'' or \`\`Dr.'', it is used as a designation for a person who has obtained a Doctorate (e.g. PhD).

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, these two questions are essentially paraphrases of each other, as they both aim to understand the reason behind people's self-centered nature. Self-centeredness, also referred to as egocentrism or narcissism, is the tendency to focus on oneself and one's interests, needs, and emotions. People display self-centeredness to varying degrees, and there are numerous factors that contribute to this behavior. Some primary reasons for self-centeredness include: 1. Psychological Factors: - Low self-esteem: Individuals with low self-esteem may become overly self-centered as a defense mechanism to protect themselves from feelings of inadequacy or insecurity. - Lack of empathy: People who lack empathy may have difficulties understanding and appreciating the perspective of others, which may contribute to a self-centered approach to life. - Narcissistic personality disorder: This is a mental health condition characterized by an excessive need for admiration, lack of empathy, and an inflated sense of self-importance. People with narcissistic personality disorder are typically highly self-centered. 2. Social Factors: - Parenting styles: Overindulgent or overly protective parents may inadvertently create self-centered children who grow up believing the world revolves around them. - Cultural norms: In some societies, individualism and personal achievement are highly valued, which can encourage self-centered tendencies. - Social media: The digital age has enabled personalized experiences, where social media platforms allow people to project an idealized version of themselves, sometimes fostering self-absorption. 3. Evolutionary Factors: - Self-preservation: From an evolutionary standpoint, it is advantageous for individuals to prioritize their own needs, ensuring survival and procreation. - Competition: In the context of scarce resources, being self-centered can be beneficial for achieving success, outdoing rivals, and maximizing individual gains. 4. Cognitive Factors: - Egocentrism: During some developmental stages, particularly in early childhood, people tend to believe that their perspective is the only one that matters. Although most people outgrow this phase, some may continue to feel and act as if the world revolves around them. - Confirmation bias: People tend to seek information that confirms their existing beliefs, which could reinforce their tendency to focus on themselves and their experiences. It is crucial to recognize that self-centeredness can exist on a spectrum, and individuals may exhibit these traits to varying extents. In some cases, moderate self-centeredness can be beneficial, enabling individuals to protect their own well-being, set boundaries, and pursue personal goals. However, excessive self-centeredness can damage relationships, hinder collaboration, and result in a lack of social support. Understanding the multifaceted nature of self-centeredness can foster awareness, empathy, and improved communication among individuals."},{"prompt":"Q:A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

To find a vet that works with frogs, contact local veterinary schools or look online for lists of veterinarians that work with amphibians. For example, you can look at the website of the Association of Reptilian and Amphibian Veterinarians. If there are several vets in your area who work with amphibians, make sure the vet you choose is the one that has the most experience with tree frogs. It's a good idea to find a vet before your frog is actually sick. Having an established relationship with a veterinarian that treats tree frogs will make it easier to get your pet quick care when it needs it. It is best to have your frog checked out by a veterinarian if you see a symptom of illness. While you may end up bringing your pet in for a problem that is non-existent, it is better to be safe than sorry. Some diseases require quick treatment in order to be eliminated. If you suspect that your tree frog is sick but you are unsure about bringing it in to be seen by a vet, at least call the veterinary office and talk to them. Tell them about your pet's symptoms and ask them if they think your frog needs treatment. If your tree frog is indeed ill, your veterinarian will begin its treatment and will give you instructions on how to continue treatment at home. Follow these directions and be sure to continue treatment for as long as your veterinarian suggests, even if your tree frog seems completely healed. If treatment is not minimizing your frog's symptoms or they are getting worse, contact your vet once again. It may be that your frog needs a different type or amount of treatment. Summary:","completion":"To ensure proper care for your tree frog, establish a relationship with an experienced amphibian veterinarian found through local schools or the Association of Reptilian and Amphibian Veterinarians, seek prompt care for potential illnesses, and follow treatment instructions closely."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now, a team of scientists in Sweden has proved that these birds fly for tremendously long periods of time. They affixed data loggers onto a total of 19 of the master fliers in 2013 and 2014, and recaptured the birds months or years later. Researchers found that the birds can spend almost their entire 10-month nonbreeding period on the wing. The data loggers gathered information on acceleration and flight activity, and those installed in 2014 also included light trackers for geolocation. The results were astonishing. For example, according to research published in Current Biology, one of the birds stopped for just four nights in February in 2014 — and the next year it stopped for only two hours. Other birds stopped for longer periods of time. But \\"even when swifts settle to roost,\\" the researchers say, \\"the amount of time not flying is very small.\\" The birds are known to travel from Europe to sub-Saharan Africa — but they apparently don't touch down there, as National Geographic reports. Researchers say they have never found roosting sites in sub-Saharan Africa. The scientists say that the rarity of the stops during nonbreeding season suggests that the bird may only take a pause because of bad weather. The fact that some birds fly continuously during nonbreeding periods indicates that the species may not actually need to land for sleep. In fact, it's unclear \\"when and to what extent swifts need to sleep,\\" the paper states. \\"They feed in the air, they mate in the air, they get nest material in the air,\\" researcher Susanne Åkesson from Lund University in Sweden tells National Geographic. \\"They can land on nest boxes, branches, or houses, but they can't really land on the ground.\\" The birds' shape contributes to this finding; their \\"wings are too long and their legs are too short to take off from a flat surface,\\" the magazine reports. The researchers suggest that one driving force behind the bird's incredibly long flights could be its diet. \\"[S]pecializing in high-altitude aerial insects as a main food source requires the suite of adaptations for efficient flight shown by swifts, ... which compromises terrestrial locomotion and make swifts vulnerable to predators and parasites had they been landing more often,\\" the paper states. This may remind some eagle-eyed readers of another species with extraordinary flight habits: the frigatebird. As NPR's Christopher Joyce recently reported, those aquatic birds can \\"stay aloft for weeks at a time,\\" and fly to heights thousands of meters above the sea. And in a recent study, \\"one of the tagged birds soared 40 miles without a wing-flap.\\" ||||| Every July, young common swifts leave their European roosts and migrate to western and central Africa. They’ll only be back in the following June, and they’ll spend the intervening 10 months almost continuously in the air. They might travel to Africa, but their feet never meet African soil. “They feed in the air, they mate in the air, they get nest material in the air,” says Susanne Åkesson from Lund University in Sweden. “They can land on nest boxes, branches, or houses, but they can’t really land on the ground.” That's because their wings are too long and their legs are too short to take off from a flat surface. View Images Common swifts soar in Merseyside, England. Photograph by Alan Williams, Nature Picture Library As a result, common swifts are among nature’s greatest aeronauts, superbly adapted for a life spent largely in the skies. People have long suspected that swifts stay airborne for long stretches of time, but no one could confirm it. Åkesson and her husband, Anders Hedenström, both from Lund University, did so by fitting 19 of the birds with lightweight data loggers in 2013, and recapturing them one or two years later. The loggers had regularly recorded local light levels, which the duo could use to pinpoint the birds’ global position. And they had recorded the swifts’ acceleration, activity, and body positions, which revealed if they were flying or resting. The data revealed that some swifts were almost never inactive during their long migrations. For example, between September 2013 and April 2014, one of the birds rested for just four nights in February. The following year, it never rested for a full night; over the same period, it stopped for just two hours. View Images A common swift (Apus apus) at the Budapest Zoo Photograph by Joel Sartore, National Geographic Photo Ark A few other swifts did rest more often. Åkesson and Hedenström suspect that this was because they hadn’t finished replacing their wing and tail feathers during their annual molt. The old feathers might have compromised their ability to stay permanently aloft, or their inability to molt fully might reflect some underlying health problem that affected their flight. Either way, it’s not like they were actually grounded. If they rested, it was just for a few hours. At most, they spent just 0.64 percent of their migration on terra firma. Other scientists have found similar results. In 2013, Felix Liechti from the Swiss Ornithological Institute used similar data loggers to show that three alpine swifts probably flew nonstop for 200 days, on their long migration from Switzerland to Africa and back again. That was especially surprising because alpine swifts are twice the size of common swifts, with wingspans of up to 22 inches. Such long nonstop flights imply that swifts must be able to sleep while flying. This August, Niels Rattenborg of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany proved that frigate birds—large seabirds with piratical tendencies—do the same. He fitted brainwave sensors to 15 frigatebirds and showed that they sleep mid-flight, for about 40 minutes a day and just a few seconds at a time. There’s no brain sensor small enough to record their mental activity of a flying swift, but they surely must be taking midair naps too. Maybe they do what dolphins do, sending one half of their brains to sleep at a time so they can stay continuously alert. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A team of scientists from Sweden have proven that the common swift bird has the ability to remain in the air for strikingly long periods of time during their annual migration.

Even when they seem to be at rest, the time they spend not flying is minor. These birds travel from Europe to sub-Saharan Africa without touching the ground. The swifts' long wings and short legs, which hinder take-off from flat surfaces, explain their mostly airborne lifestyle. While it's still unclear to what extent swifts need to sleep, the research suggests that these birds are capable of taking midair naps. Their diet of high-altitude insects could also be driving the extended flight periods. Scientists suggest that their efficient flight prevents them from becoming prey to predators and parasites that would threaten them if they were on the ground more often.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) was the first senator to publicly call on her colleague, Al Franken, to resign after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. No one in Congress is more associated with the Me Too movement than Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). Long before Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer became infamous creeps, Gillibrand was focusing her attention on sexual assault and harassment in the military, on college campuses and in the workplace. But the two-term senator cemented her prominence in the movement last year when she called out members of her own party. In November, she said that Bill Clinton should have resigned the presidency over his affair with Monica Lewinsky. And then the following month, she became the first Democratic senator to publicly call on then-Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) to go after multiple women accused him of engaging in sexual misconduct. Franken announced his resignation the following day. Speaking out has consequences. Women who come forward about the abuse they’ve faced are often barred from further job opportunities. And even someone in power like Gillibrand who tries to be an advocate for victims can find themselves facing a negative response from a previously friendly community. Eight women accused Franken of groping them. Yet he remains beloved by many Democrats, who say he was one of the party’s strongest champions on progressive issues. His questioning in Senate hearings landed both Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in hot water, and if he were still around, he’d no doubt play a big role in taking on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. His defenders say he was pushed out too early for transgressions that, while unfortunate, didn’t rise to the level of what some members of the GOP have done and didn’t make him a threat who needed to leave immediately. Gillibrand wasn’t the only senator to publicly call on Franken to step down, but she was the first (but only by minutes) in a wave of female senators ― who were eventually joined by many of their male colleagues on the same day, Dec. 6 ― to do so. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), however, reportedly told Franken in private that he needed to go beforehand. But Gillibrand has received the brunt of the blame for what happened, with many of her detractors saying the reason she came out against Franken was that she’s an “opportunist” who was positioning herself for a presidential run in 2020. Some Democratic Party donors have been reconsidering whether they would support her in a primary. Most prominently, Gillibrand has attracted the ire of billionaire George Soros, who has long funded Democratic candidates and causes. Soros recently said he wasn’t sure whom he was supporting for 2020, but that it absolutely wouldn’t be Gillibrand. He accused her of going after Franken, “whom I admire,” to “improve her chances” for president. “If standing up for women who have been wronged makes George Soros mad, that’s on him,” Gillibrand said in a statement to HuffPost. “But I won’t hesitate to always do what I think is right. For nearly a year, we have seen countless acts of courage as women and men have spoken hard truths about sexual assault and sexual harassment and demanded accountability.” “I stand with them in this new watershed moment of important change in our society on what we deem as acceptable,” she added. “It is clear that we must put our morals and the valuing of women ahead of party loyalty. When someone does something wrong, you have to speak up and be counted, whether it’s President Trump, or a Democratic colleague.” ‘I Think It Was A Big Mistake’ HuffPost spoke to dozens of elite donors who contributed significant amounts of money to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Gillibrand, at one time, was part of the tight, loyal Clinton world. The Clintons were early supporters of hers and Hillary wrote the foreword to Gillibrand’s book. Many of these donors said that either they were unhappy with Gillibrand or knew plenty of people who were. The 2020 race is still years away, but as donors start to shop around, her comments on Clinton and Franken could be a factor. “I viewed it as self-serving, as opportunistic ― unforgivable in my view,” said Rosalind Fink, a New York donor. “Since then, I have not purposely attended any fundraiser where she was there. And there is absolutely no way I will support her.” Fink said she condemned Franken’s behavior, but she believed the Senate should have investigated the allegations thoroughly before forcing him out. “I think it was a big mistake,” said Irene Finel Honigman, another Clinton donor from New York, adding, “I was not that impressed with her to begin with. I think she certainly had potential, but as for many people, this kind of sealed the deal.” Another donor, who like many others asked to remain anonymous in order to speak candidly, called Gillibrand a “ruthless opportunist.” “That’s the knock on her, and that’s what this proved,” he said. “She saw an opportunity to be out front, and regardless of the ramifications, she took it.” Susie Tompkins Buell, a major Democratic Party donor who has championed female politicians, also said she was reconsidering her support for senators who called for Franken to resign. On social media, it’s easy to find anti-Gillibrand posts. No matter the issue, Gillibrand has detractors who circle back to what she did to Franken. Hope Kirsten Gillibrand is happy with her handiwork. https://t.co/vg6Dmpko9B — Bruce Bartlett (@BruceBartlett) July 31, 2018 Because of Al Franken, I will never in a million years vote for Kristen Gillibrand. — Burke Omalley (@burke_omalley) June 17, 2018 So maybe all the women Senators who were so fucking threatened by Al Franken in the Senate need to God Damn find out where the thousand girls are ... like now Looking at you Gillibrand https://t.co/PZyveKjept — NTXProgressive (@NTXProgressive) June 17, 2018 There’s also a theory, readily found on social media, that Franken was the target of a right-wing hit job centered around Leeann Tweeden, the first woman to accuse Franken of groping her without her consent, who appears to be conservative-leaning. But besides Tweeden, there were seven other women who said Franken harassed them, and four of them were on the record. Several of the incidents also occurred while he was either in office or running for office. Part of the reason Franken faced so much pressure to resign was that there was a heated campaign to win the U.S. Senate race in Alabama underway. Franken’s problems were a distraction at a time the party was hammering Republican Roy Moore, who was facing allegations of pursuing teenage girls while he was an adult. The senator resigning without a fight was no doubt, in part, an acknowledgment to the politics of the moment. Jill Farber Bramson, a Democratic donor and activist in Michigan, said she knew a number of women ― who tended to be older ― who were deeply disappointed when Gillibrand spoke out against Franken. “They had always really liked Kirsten Gillibrand very much,” she said. “They really respected her. ... They were just devastated that she pushed, they felt, all too hard and all too soon to have him resign.” ‘Why Are We Making This About Her?’ Gillibrand still has plenty of supporters ― including some former Clinton donors ― and many of them are standing by her even more fiercely since she faced the Franken attacks. They are deeply worried about the damage her principled stand may have done to her political future. “Why are we blaming Sen. Gillibrand for what Sen. Franken did?” asked Risa Levine, a New York donor who is friends with the senator. “Why are we making this about her? It’s not about her.” “She’s not the one who put her hand on all those women’s asses and boobs. She didn’t do that,” added another donor. “Why does she have to sacrifice her career, her brand, her authenticity, for the sake of Franken?” Gillibrand, after all, isn’t a newcomer on the issue of sexual misconduct. In addition to her work on women in the military and on college campuses, she has an organization devoted to promoting women running for office and introduced the Me Too Congress Act in the Senate, legislation devoted to combating sexual harassment in Congress. In fact, if she hadn’t spoken out, she likely would have lost credibility with her core group of supporters for deciding to suddenly be silent when it came to one of her colleagues. It seemed like no matter what she did, she couldn’t win. “She’s either a shrew with no power who’s just trying to make a name for herself, or she’s so all-powerful that her saying one thing made a man who has made decisions for himself for 60 years crumble like a cheap suit,” said a Democratic activist, summing up the way Gillibrand has been characterized. There’s a good chance Gillibrand would have been attacked if she had remained silent on Franken. In Minnesota, a GOP-aligned group sent out a mailer attacking state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the Democratic minority leader in the House, for signing a November statement expressing support for the senator after four women had come forward. Hortman, too, has been outspoken in her support for women’s rights. HuffPost A mailer by the GOP-aligned group Minnesota Jobs Coalition went after a Minnesota lawmaker for supporting Al Franken. Gillibrand isn’t the only woman to face a backlash for the Franken resignation. In November, Lindsey Port, then a Democratic candidate for the state legislature, accused state Sen. Dan Schoen (D) of sexual harassment. Schoen resigned, and Port initially received an outpouring of support. But after Franken announced he was leaving the Senate, the tide turned. Port lost financial support for her campaign and her nonprofit, with some people alleging that she “softened the ground” for Franken’s resignation by speaking out about the sexual harassment she faced at the hands of a totally different man. Others even wondered if she was secretly a conservative operative. Many Democrats say they see the split on Gillibrand and Franken as generational, with younger voters ― both men and women ― more likely to support Gillibrand, or at least be sympathetic to what she did. In June, Gillibrand spoke at the Washington, D.C., chapter of The Wing, an all-female social club that attracts a younger crowd, and she addressed the reason she spoke out on Franken. An attendee said the audience was supportive of her answer and applauded her. Gillibrand has also had other discussions in the wake of the matter, including calling some other prominent Democratic women in the San Francisco area who are friends with Tompkins Buell. According to someone with knowledge of the situation, the senator reached out to them to explain why she believed Franken needed to go, and she’s been willing to talk about her views with people who are skeptical and have questions. “Times change, and this is time changing for the better. This is about sexual harassment and sexual assault. Are we for that?” said a Democratic donor. “People just have to get over it. They should expect people to speak up and take a position on it.” “Did she do it because she wanted to position herself for president? Gee, I’m shocked. People do that all the time. Why is this issue a no-go? Is Bernie [Sanders] taking advantage of single-payer and putting people in an uncomfortable position by being so aggressive about that? We say it’s not the same, but it is the same. It’s getting a different frame because it’s squeezing the old-boy network.” ||||| Nearly a year after Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand led the charge in calling for former Sen. Al Franken's resignation, the anger is fresh on the minds of major donors. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images 2020 Election Franken scandal haunts Gillibrand’s 2020 chances ‘Let me tell you how strongly I felt about it — I didn’t even vote for her in the recent election. I left it blank,’ said one top donor. Just a month after Al Franken formally resigned from the Senate amid sexual misconduct allegations, the former senator met with an intimate group of Bay Area supporters at the home of major Democratic Party financiers Mary and Steve Swig. As Franken and his wife, Franni Bryson, made the rounds, thanking supporters in the philanthropists’ San Francisco home at the February 2018 event, the conversation broke off into another subject: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. The New York Democrat had, in their opinion, pulled the rug out from under Franken, a Minnesota Democrat beloved by the group, forcing him out without any real vetting of the allegations facing him. Story Continued Below “It was said not in front of Al to impress him; it was said privately in a corner. A group of us were standing there talking about it. He was one of our best weapons against this administration, his presence on these committees. [Gillibrand] did the damage that Republicans could not do themselves,” one of the attendees told POLITICO. “There were other people at this event who were saying the same thing. They said, ‘Absolutely, I will never do anything for her.’” Today, nearly a year after Gillibrand led the charge in calling for Franken’s resignation, the anger is fresh on the minds of major donors across the country. More than a dozen prominent West Coast, New York and national donors and bundlers — many of them women — said they would never again donate to or fundraise for Gillibrand or would do so only if she ended up as the Democratic presidential nominee.

Gillibrand has defended her approach by insisting she placed deeply held personal values over party loyalty. But the still-burning resentment among the donor class now confronts Gillibrand as she explores a presidential bid, cutting her off from influential and deep-pocketed contributors and their networks at a time when an expansive 2020 field will compete for their dollars. Among those donors is Susie Tompkins Buell, a prominent Democratic fundraiser and co-founder of Esprit and the North Face clothing brands, who said the matter remains fresh in her mind and among those in her circles. The episode, she said, “stained [Gillibrand’s] reputation as a fair player.” “I do hear people refer to Kirsten Gillibrand as ‘opportunistic’ and shrewd at the expense of others to advance herself, and it seems to have been demonstrated in her rapid treatment of her colleague Al Franken,” she said. “I heard her referred to as ‘She would eat her own,’ and she seems to have demonstrated that. I know [Gillibrand] thought she was doing the right thing, but I think she will be remembered by this rush to judgment. I have heard [that] some of her women colleagues regret joining her.” The anger is at least in part a testament to donors’ fondness for Franken, a comedian who rose to fame as a “Saturday Night Live” cast member and remains in the eyes of his supporters one the Senate’s greatest champions for women — even after his resignation. Several of those who talked to POLITICO also spoke of an inner-party struggle to keep Franken from resigning, fearing he was swept up in a panic at the time. A Change.org petition opposing Franken’s resignation had 75,000 signatures. Some blamed the media for rushing to publish allegations without a full vetting. “I could stay on the phone all afternoon talking about this,” said a Manhattan-based member of the ‘Majority Trust’ of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, an elite group of top donors, who has donated to Gillibrand in the past. “Let me tell you how strongly I felt about it — I didn’t even vote for her in the recent election. I left it blank.” Another major Manhattan-based donor said the episode raised suspicions that it was a craven political move by Gillibrand. “I thought she was duplicitous,” the donor said. “Once the whole thing happened with Al Franken, it was confirmed 1 billion percent that she’s not to be trusted. I think that she hurt the Democratic Party. I think that she hurt the Senate. I think that what she did for women in politics was dreadful.” The Franken accusations came in the weeks after a parade of powerful men were toppled by the #MeToo movement; among them Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer, Louis C.K. and Garrison Keillor. The wounds over Franken’s ouster were reopened, some Democrats say, during confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, who faced sexual misconduct allegations but still was seated on the Supreme Court. One major national Democratic fundraiser told POLITICO the level of residual anger runs the gamut, but it’s still very much present. “I know Kirsten well, and I know Al well. ... It’s tragic what happened to Al, and a lot of my donors feel anywhere from strongly to adamantly about anger at Kirsten for what she did. Others see that it was a way to kind of grab the high ground with no ambiguity,” the fundraiser said. “Personally, I lean towards I think Kirsten overdid it. It’s such a shame that Al couldn’t just go through the process and be reprimanded, or censured. At the moment it happened, it was understandable.” Gillibrand has stood her ground, never publicly backing down from the criticism, even when it came from the Democratic Party’s most prolific donor, George Soros. In June, he told The Washington Post he blamed Gillibrand for cornering Franken into resigning, accusing her of doing so “in order to improve her chances” in 2020. In August, Gillibrand responded specifically to Soros, telling HuffPost in a statement : “If standing up for women who have been wronged makes George Soros mad, that’s on him.” Gillibrand’s campaign recently pushed back against the criticism, asserting that the senator did the right thing by speaking up. “Leadership means standing up for your values when it's hard. Kirsten has never been afraid to stand up for what she believes in and never will be. You can disagree with her views, but holding her accountable for someone else's behavior towards women is wrong, and her values aren't for sale,” Gillibrand spokesperson Glen Caplin said in a statement to POLITICO. “One year later, after the special election in Alabama, the Kavanaugh hearings and the historic number of women who took back the House in the midterms, there is just no case to be made the Democratic Party would have been better off with a different outcome. We have to put our morals and the valuing of women ahead of party loyalty.” On Monday, Gillibrand herself sounded off on Twitter. “Silencing women for the powerful, or for your friends, or for convenience, is neither acceptable, nor just,” she wrote above a link to this POLITICO story. NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue said “history will laud” Gillibrand for her actions. On its face, the revolt against Gillibrand seems counterintuitive. At a key moment in the “#MeToo” movement, Gillibrand stood up to a revered colleague in her own party. She led the call for Franken’s resignation after he was accused of groping or trying to forcibly kiss more than half a dozen women. A chorus of senators quickly followed her. It raised Gillibrand’s national profile, almost immediately branding her as a fierce female leader who told the establishment that when it comes to sexual harassment, “enough is enough.” It’s unclear whether or to what extent a donor backlash could debilitate Gillibrand’s possible 2020 campaign. In the era of small-donor, digital fundraising, major donors arguably don’t hold as much sway — but that’s typically true only for candidates who catch fire, like Sen. Bernie Sanders or Rep. Beto O’Rourke. From 2013 through this year, Gillibrand’s campaign committee raised nearly 18 million for her 2018 reelection bid. Almost 60 percent of that amount came from high-dollar donors, but Gillibrand also raised nearly 6.5 million, or about 30 percent of her total, from small-dollar donors who gave less than 200. Ana Maria Archila, co-executive director for the Center for Popular Democracy, called Gillibrand’s response “important and courageous.” “It probably made her more enemies than friends,” said Archila, who famously confronted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in a congressional elevator this summer during the Kavanaugh hearings. If Gillibrand is unpopular with a certain subset of the Democratic donor class, it didn’t hurt her in her most recent reelection bid in New York in November, when she won roughly two-thirds of the vote against her Republican opponent and garnered 3.73 million votes — the most for any candidate in New York in this election cycle. She earned almost 400,000 more votes than Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is sometimes mentioned as a possible 2020 Democratic contender himself. In 2012, when she was running for her first full Senate term, she garnered 350,000 more votes than President Barack Obama, who led the Democratic ticket, received in New York. Franken, who declined to comment for this story, posted on Facebook over the Thanksgiving holiday thanking supporters for well wishes over the past year — and offered a reflection. “I’ve also spent a lot of time over this past year thinking about the broader conversation we’ve been having about the experience of women in this country. I know that, for so many people, this issue raises a lot of powerful and painful feelings,” Franken wrote. “This conversation can also be incredibly complicated. I don’t think it’s my place to weigh in on all the debates — but I will continue to listen and learn.” Carla Marinucci contributed to this report. |||||","completion":"Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), a major advocate for the Me Too movement, faces criticisms and potential loss of support from some Democratic Party donors after her calls for the resignation of then-Senator Al Franken (D-Minn) due to multiple sexual misconduct allegations against him.

In the equation, there are two terms involving g: -63*g and -6*g. Combine these two terms. -63g - 6g = -69g There are also two constant terms: 880 and -121. Combine these two terms. 880 - 121 = 759 Now the simplified equation is: -69g + 759 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable g. To do this, subtract 759 from both sides of the equation. -69g + 759 - 759 = 0 - 759 -69g = -759. Step 3: Solve for g. To find the value of g, divide both sides of the equation by -69. g = -759 / -69 g ≈ 11 The solution to the equation is g ≈ 11."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Negative influence of celebrities and role models: The writer believes that the statement made by a celebrity or role model has had an adverse impact on the youth, leading them to indulge in promiscuous acts. By referring to this specific incident, the writer demonstrates their belief that celebrities and role models have the power to influence young people's decisions and actions in a detrimental manner. 2. Lack of positive values: By stating that role models and celebrities do not play any part in instilling values in people today, the writer implies that the media's focus is more on sensationalism and entertainment rather than fostering positive values and behavior. This lack of emphasis on teaching values can contribute to young people making wrong decisions, as they are not receiving positive guidance from the people they look up to. 3. Amplification of negative incidents: The writer believes that the media plays a considerable role in amplifying the negative incidents involving celebrities and role models. By providing extensive coverage of such incidents, the media inadvertently promotes and reinforces undesirable behavior, making it more likely for young people to follow them. 4. Absence of personal responsibility: The writer suggests that young people are using the media's portrayal of celebrities as an excuse for their actions, rather than taking personal responsibility for their behaviors and choices. This situation demonstrates that young people are heavily reliant on the media for guidance, further reinforcing the negative impact of the media on young people's lives. 5. The power of social reinforcement: The article implies that the media not only influences young people individually but also contributes to a collective mindset. This social reinforcement of negative behaviors makes it more challenging for young people to resist these influences, as they might feel pressured to conform to the behaviors widely accepted by their peers. In summary, the writer feels negatively about the effect of the media on young people because they believe that the media plays a significant role in promoting undesirable behaviors and attitudes among the youth. Instead of instilling positive values and providing constructive guidance, the media's portrayal of celebrities and role models contributes to a culture that amplifies negative incidents and fosters a climate of irresponsibility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - injury - beauty - late - mistakes - annoyed Explain why a human would choose \\"late\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human would choose \\"late\\" as the answer to the question above because it most accurately reflects the potential consequences of a grooming appointment taking longer than expected. The other options, while they may be relevant in some situations, do not directly address the impact on the next appointment. Let's analyze them one by one: 1. Injury: While it's possible that an injury could occur during a grooming session, it wouldn't be the natural consequence for the next appointment if the current grooming appointment runs late. The injury would primarily concern the individual involved and the groomer. 2. Beauty: Beauty could be a positive outcome of an excellent grooming session, but it doesn't address the effect on the next appointment when a grooming session takes longer than planned. 3. Late: When a grooming appointment runs longer than expected, it can cause a domino effect on the other scheduled appointments. As a result, the next appointment would likely be delayed, causing the clients to experience a late start to their sessions. Furthermore, this can lead to a backlog throughout the day with each subsequent appointment starting later than anticipated. 4. Mistakes: While mistakes can happen during a grooming session, they don't inherently cause the next appointment to be affected. If mistakes were made in the current appointment, the groomer would likely need to address and fix the issues on hand. However, mistakes don't necessarily lead to an extension in appointment duration, and even if they do, it doesn't directly connect to the effect on the next appointment. 5. Annoyed: Clients might become annoyed if their appointment is delayed or if they have to wait for an extended period. This emotional response might be a consequence of the next appointment being late, but it doesn't thoroughly explain the direct impact on the appointment scheduling. Therefore, a human would choose \\"late\\" as the most logical and fitting answer, as it directly correlates with the consequences of the next appointment when a grooming session takes longer than expected. A late appointment can lead to a variety of issues, such as dissatisfaction among clients, inefficiency in the grooming service, and potential loss of clientele due to chronic lateness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were the categories that Radiohead received nominations for at the 59th Grammy Awards? ? Radiohead began work on their ninth studio album in September 2014, joined again by Godrich. In 2015 they resumed work in the La Fabrique studio near Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France. The sessions were marred by the death of Godrich's father, and Yorke's separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. In the same year, Yorke contributed a soundtrack, Subterranea, to The Panic Office, an installation of Radiohead artwork in Sydney, Australia, and Junun, a collaboration between Greenwood, Godrich, Israeli composer Shye Ben Tzur and Indian musicians, was released, accompanied by a documentary directed by Anderson. On Christmas Day 2015, Radiohead released a new song, \\"Spectre\\", on the audio streaming site SoundCloud. It had been commissioned for the 2015 James Bond film Spectre, but was rejected by the film producers as \\"too dark\\".Radiohead's ninth studio album, A Moon Shaped Pool, was released in May 2016 on Radiohead's website and online music stores, followed by retail versions in June via XL Recordings. It was promoted with music videos for the singles \\"Burn the Witch\\" and \\"Daydreaming\\", the latter directed by Anderson. The album includes several songs written years earlier, including \\"True Love Waits\\", and strings and choral vocals arranged by Jonny Greenwood and performed the London Contemporary Orchestra. It was Radiohead's sixth UK number-one album and reached number three in the US. It was the fifth Radiohead album nominated for the Mercury Prize, making Radiohead the most shortlisted act in the award's history, and was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rock Song (for \\"Burn the Witch\\") at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.

Article: While drunken driving may be on the decline, traffic safety experts remain puzzled over how to deal with another alcohol related danger: drunken pedestrains. Pedestrians struck and killed by cars often are extremely drunk. In fact, they are intoxicated more frequently and with higher blood alcohol levels than drunken drivers who are killed in accidents, various studies have shown. Forty percent of adult pedestrians involved in fatal crashes have a blood alcohol level of at least 0.10 which by law in most states signifies intoxication compared to only 25 percent of drivers in deadly accidents, according to recent federal data. Some types of pedestrain accidents have been declining nationally, especially those involving children, but the number of adult pedestrians who are drunk when killed in traffic has remained ly steady at 2500 a year. The total number of pedestrians killed annually in U.S. traffic accidents is at least 7000, or one of every seven highway accidents resulting in death. \\"We're dealing here, we think, with a very severe drinking problem that leads to a severe highway safety problem,\\" said Richard Blomberg, president of Dunlap and Associates Inc, in Norwalk, Coon. w.w.^w.k.&s.5*u.c.#om.... Blomberg, whose consulting company found a very high rate of alcohol involvement in a controlled study of pedestrian accidents in New Orleans, was among several researchers who spoke on the topic at the annual meeting of the Research council's Transportation Research Board(TRB) in Washington in January. Pedestrian accidents have not received enough attention in the past, according to Kay Colpitts, who chairs the board's committee on pedestrians. Few methods exist to monitor walking habits, she said, and researchers have been mystified about how to prevent disasters.

Emily knew how to cook many different recipes but Jessica did not, so","completion":"Emily decided that it was time to take Jessica under her wing and teach her the art of cooking. The two friends had always bonded over their mutual love for food, so Emily thought there was no better way to spend quality time together and help Jessica expand her culinary skills. To begin with, Emily organized a cooking class at her home once a week. She made sure to buy all the ingredients beforehand and chose a variety of simple recipes that Jessica could easily follow. From homemade pasta and sauces, to fresh salads and soups, Emily ensured that each class covered a different type of dish to keep Jessica engaged and excited to learn. At their first cooking class, Emily taught Jessica the basic techniques of chopping and sautéing ingredients while they made stir-fry. Emily emphasized the importance of using proper knife skills and being mindful of heat control. Jessica was a quick learner, and Emily could see her confidence grow as the weeks went on. As Jessica's knowledge expanded, so did her appreciation for the diversity of flavors and textures in various dishes. Emily introduced her to a wide array of seasonings and taught her how to balance the flavors in each meal. Jessica found herself more and more intrigued by world cuisine and even suggested they try making a Thai coconut curry one week, much to Emily's approval. Over time, the two friends delved deeper into their culinary exploration, gradually learning about the complexities of various ingredients and techniques they could use to elevate their dishes. From homemade bread and sauces to mastering the art of perfectly cooking different types of protein, Jessica's understanding and appreciation of food grew exponentially. Their weekly cooking sessions became more than just an educational experience; it evolved into an opportunity for them to catch up and bond over their shared love of food. The friendly atmosphere, combined with the satisfaction of learning new dishes, created the perfect environment to nurture their friendship and strengthen their bond.

Emily was consistently impressed by Jessica's progress and found joy in watching her friend find so much enthusiasm and excitement in cooking. What started out as a simple gesture between friends soon transformed into a rich and rewarding learning experience that brought them even closer than before. Not only did Jessica learn the art of cooking, but the time invested in the process helped forge a stronger bond between them.

What is the best way to: To create an easy heating pad for your period, Options are: (1). put some rice into a bowl and microwave it. (2). put some rice into a sack and microwave it. Answer:","completion":"The best way to create an easy heating pad for your period is Option 2: put some rice into a sack and microwave it. Step 1: Select a clean, microwave-safe fabric sack or a small cloth bag that will comfortably fit the desired amount of rice. This bag will be used as the heating pad, so it should be soft and comfortable when placed against the skin. Step 2: Fill the sack with uncooked rice, leaving enough space for the rice to move around and distribute evenly within the bag. You can also add a few drops of essential oils like lavender for added relaxation, if desired. Step 3: Seal the sack properly, ensuring that no rice can spill out. This is important for microwave safety and cleanliness. Step 4: Microwave the rice-filled sack on a microwave-safe plate. Start with a low power setting and warm the bag for about one minute. Check the temperature of the bag carefully to avoid burns and overheating. If it is not warm enough, continue microwaving in 15-30 second increments, checking the temperature after each interval until it reaches the desired warmth. Step 5: Place the warm rice heating pad on the affected area to alleviate period pain and discomfort. Option 2 is better than Option 1 because microwaving rice in a bowl can lead to uneven heating, spillage, and difficulty in applying the rice directly to the affected area. Using a sack provides a more convenient and safer way to create a heating pad. Additionally, the rice-filled sack can be reused multiple times, making it an efficient and eco-friendly choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

These ambitious works are some of the largest paintings in the history of Cubism. Léger’s The Wedding, also shown at the Salon des Indépendants in 1912, gave form to the notion of simultaneity by presenting different motifs as occurring within a single temporal frame, where responses to the past and present interpenetrate with collective force.

I lost the grip of the fencing wire and the pliers smacked me in the mouth. This is what I hit myself in the mouth with. The curved end glance off my left front central incisor. It hurt some, my lips were lacerated, I scared my wife when I came in to take a look at it in the mirror but the pain to come was far worse. Tooth was intact thank goodness and was a bit wobbly and I said to myself yup, this could be a problem. A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head. Tooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain. Problem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting.

Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ask a question about Comprehensive school.","completion":"What are the primary features and goals of a comprehensive school system? Comprehensive schools are a type of educational institution that emerged as a response to the selective nature of traditional schools, especially in countries like the United Kingdom. Comprehensive schools aim to provide an inclusive and accessible education for all students, irrespective of their social background, abilities, or future aspirations. The primary features and goals of these schools can be understood in terms of the following aspects: 1. Inclusivity: One of the core principles of comprehensive schools is to be inclusive and break down barriers between students from different social, economic, and educational backgrounds. This commitment to inclusivity and social cohesion is evident in their diverse student populations, which contributes to a shared learning environment that promotes understanding and cooperation between students of all backgrounds. 2. Non-selective admission: Comprehensive schools follow a non-selective admission policy, meaning that they admit students based on their residential area rather than any particular academic or intellectual criteria. This is in contrast to selective educational institutions like grammar schools, which require passing entrance exams to be admitted. This ensures that every student has equal opportunity to access high-quality education, without being subject to entrance examinations or barriers. 3. Broad Curriculum: Comprehensive schools are designed to cater to a wide range of skills, interests, and abilities among their student body. To achieve this, the schools offer a broad curriculum that includes a range of academic, vocational, and extracurricular subjects. This allows students to explore their strengths and interests and ensures that they have the flexibility to develop various skills, which is essential for personal and professional development. 4. Mixed-ability teaching: A significant aspect of comprehensive schools is their approach to mixed-ability teaching. Students are not segregated based on their academic ability but are instead taught in the same classrooms. This helps prevent the development of a divide between high-achieving students and others and fosters an environment of support and collaboration. 5. Personalized learning: Recognizing that students may have different learning needs, comprehensive schools strive to provide personalized learning experiences for their students. This includes providing targeted support and resources for those who require them, as well as ensuring that teaching methods and resources accommodate various learning styles and preferences. 6. Career guidance and support: Comprehensive schools recognize the importance of preparing students for their future careers and provide a range of services to achieve this goal. This includes offering career guidance and counseling services, as well as connecting students with internship, volunteering, and job opportunities. Overall, comprehensive schools aim to equip their students with the knowledge, skills, and experience necessary to succeed in their chosen fields. 7. Community integration: Comprehensive schools often act as community hubs, fostering connections between the school, parents, and the wider community. By organizing and participating in various community events, projects, and initiatives, comprehensive schools aim to promote a sense of belonging and shared responsibility among all stakeholders. In conclusion, the primary features and goals of comprehensive schools center around promoting inclusivity, delivering a broad curriculum, fostering mixed-ability teaching, and providing personalized learning experiences, career guidance, and community integration. Through these features, comprehensive schools strive to offer a well-rounded and accessible education that caters to every student's unique needs and interests."},{"prompt":"Pick one category for the following text.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Rabindranath Tagore FRAS ( ( listen); Bengali: [robindronath thakur]), also written Ravindranatha Thakura (7 May 1861 - 7 August 1941), sobriquet Gurudev, was a Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of Gitanjali and its \\"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse\\", he became in 1913 the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his \\"elegant prose and magical poetry\\" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. Context: Dutta and Robinson describe this phase of Tagore's life as being one of a \\"peripatetic litterateur\\". It affirmed his opinion that human divisions were shallow. During a May 1932 visit to a Bedouin encampment in the Iraqi desert, the tribal chief told him that \\"Our prophet has said that a true Muslim is he by whose words and deeds not the least of his brother-men may ever come to any harm ...\\" Tagore confided in his diary: \\"I was startled into recognizing in his words the voice of essential humanity.\\" To the end Tagore scrutinised orthodoxy--and in 1934, he struck. That year, an earthquake hit Bihar and killed thousands. Gandhi hailed it as seismic karma, as divine retribution avenging the oppression of Dalits. Tagore rebuked him for his seemingly ignominious implications. He mourned the perennial poverty of Calcutta and the socioeconomic decline of Bengal, and detailed these newly plebeian aesthetics in an unrhymed hundred-line poem whose technique of searing double-vision foreshadowed Satyajit Ray's film Apur Sansar. Fifteen new volumes appeared, among them prose-poem works Punashcha (1932), Shes Saptak (1935), and Patraput (1936). Experimentation continued in his prose-songs and dance-dramas-- Chitra (1914), Shyama (1939), and Chandalika (1938)-- and in his novels-- Dui Bon (1933), Malancha (1934), and Char Adhyay (1934). Tagore's remit expanded to science in his last years, as hinted in Visva-Parichay, a 1937 collection of essays. His respect for scientific laws and his exploration of biology, physics, and astronomy informed his poetry, which exhibited extensive naturalism and verisimilitude. He wove the process of science, the narratives of scientists, into stories in Se (1937), Tin Sangi (1940), and Galpasalpa (1941). His last five years were marked by chronic pain and two long periods of illness. These began when Tagore lost consciousness in late 1937; he remained comatose and near death for a time. This was followed in late 1940 by a similar spell, from which he never recovered. Poetry from these valetudinary years is among his finest. A period of prolonged agony ended with Tagore's death on 7 August 1941, aged eighty; he was in an upstairs room of the Jorasanko mansion he was raised in. The date is still mourned. A. K. Sen, brother of the first chief election commissioner, received dictation from Tagore on 30 July 1941, a day prior to a scheduled operation: his last poem. I'm lost in the middle of my birthday. I want my friends, their touch, with the earth's last love. I will take life's final offering, I will take the human's last blessing. Today my sack is empty. I have given completely whatever I had to give. In return if I receive anything--some love, some forgiveness--then I will take it with me when I step on the boat that crosses to the festival of the wordless end. Question: Did he eventually die?

It is the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, with around 70-80 million native speakers, the vast majority of whom live in Turkey. Turkish is part of the larger Altaic linguistic group, alongside languages like Mongolian, Korean, and Tungusic (it's should be noted, however, that the classification of Turkish as Altaic is somewhat controversial in academic circles). Turkish evolved from a language known as Proto-Turkic, which was spoken in northeast Mongolia around the first millennium B.C. The Turkish language underwent several significant reforms in the 20th century that drastically transformed its lexicon, syntax, and morphology. Most famous among these reforms was a 1928 decree which switched the writing system from the Perso-Arabic script to the Latin script. The language has uniform pronunciation, with vowels and consonants pronounced with no alterations throughout the sentence. Turkish is agglutinative, meaning that it frequently uses suffixes, and it follows a subject-object-verb (SOV) sentence structure. The excerpt you've provided \\"Mesele, anayasa ve Ohrid Anlaşması'nda bu şekilde yer aliyor ve bu anlaşma, ülkedeki siyasi partiler ve uluslararası toplumun temsilcileri tarafından da imzalanmıştır\\" when translated into English says: \\"The matter is stated in this way in the constitution and the Ohrid Agreement, and this agreement has also been signed by the political parties in the country and representatives of the international community.\\" Turkish is also known for its honorific system, which distinguishes between formal and informal ways of addressing people and often shows respect to age, social status, and professional rank.

Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment. McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a strict authoritarian woman who passive-aggressively employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients and keep them submissive. McMurphy finds that they are actually more fearful of Nurse Ratched and her methods than they are focused on their main goal of eventually becoming functional in the outside world. In order to help them achieve this (as he believes), McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader of his fellow patients. The ward's other patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, anxiety-prone young man with a noticeable stutter; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is chronically belligerent and profane; Jim Sefelt (William Duell), an epileptic man; and \\"Chief\\" Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent Native American-descended man of very imposing stature who is believed to be both deaf and mute.

Hypothesis: The Hubble Space Telescope's success was praised recently in a Newsweek cover story. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise provided states that Newsweek's cover story celebrates the success of the Hubble Space Telescope. This directly implies that the hypothesis stating the Hubble Space Telescope's success was indeed praised in a recent Newsweek cover story. To further analyze and break down the connection between the premise and the hypothesis, let's look at the key aspects of both statements: 1. The central subject of both the premise and the hypothesis is the Hubble Space Telescope. This telescope is a major scientific instrument that has significantly contributed to our understanding of the universe by capturing high-resolution images of celestial objects and allowing researchers to peer deep into space and time. The fact that both statements are centered on this subject helps establish a clear connection between them. 2. The premise highlights that Newsweek, a well-known publication with a wide readership, has chosen to feature the Hubble Space Telescope on its cover. This choice reflects the significance and impact of the telescope's success in the world of science and astronomy. The hypothesis also specifically mentions Newsweek, further reinforcing the connection with the premise. 3. Both the premise and the hypothesis mention that the Hubble Space Telescope's success is the focal point of the cover story. This shared focus clearly links the two statements, as they both emphasize the remarkable achievements of the telescope. 4. Lastly, the premise explicitly states that the cover story \\"hails the success\\" of the Hubble Space Telescope. This celebratory tone can be seen as an endorsement or praise for the telescope and its accomplishments. This concept of praise aligns with the hypothesis, which mentions \\"praised recently\\" to describe the content of the cover story. In conclusion, the premise – asserting that Newsweek's cover story hails the success of the Hubble Space Telescope – entails the hypothesis which claims that the telescope's success was praised in a recent Newsweek cover story. Both statements are centered around the Hubble Space Telescope and its success, and they both highlight the recognition and praise given by Newsweek through its cover story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Everyone uses the internet nowadays, don't they? Well, no. Not everyone. Earlier this year the Office for National Statistics reported that almost nine out of 10 adults in the UK (44.7 million people) have used the internet in the last three months. That's a lot. But it means there are still 5.9 million people (11% of the UK's adult population) who never go online. So, who are these people? Why are they not using the internet? And are they really any worse off? Unsurprisingly, most of those who spend their entire lives offline are older. Almost everyone aged between 18 and 54 are recent users of the internet, the ONS report found. But that figure falls away dramatically in the older generation, and amongst the over 75s just a third could be described as \\"silver surfers\\". The geographical spread of internet users is also hardly surprising: in London and the south-east of England almost 90% of the population are connected to the world wide web. In Scotland, 85.4% of people are online; in Wales, 82.5% and in Northern Ireland fewer than eight in 10 (79.6%) people have used the internet in the last three months. Less reliable figures from the ONS suggest that one in five people in Dumfries and Galloway are not connected. A poor broadband service in parts of the region is partly to blame for the situation but work is ongoing to bring so-called \\"superfast broadband\\" to region. James Pocock is responsible for improving digital connectivity in Dumfries and Galloway. As the council's Next Generation Broadband manager, he is the local link with Digital Scotland, a partnership of public, private and voluntary groups which promotes the digital technology. He is aiming to meet an ambitious Scotland-wide target to have 95% of homes and businesses connected to superfast broadband by the end of 2017, but he admitted that the south of Scotland has suffered from poor infrastructure in the past and there are challenges ahead. \\"What has been completed to date could be regarded as the easier infrastructure to deliver and we are now looking at how we can push that infrastructure out to harder to reach areas,\\" he said. \\"That will be more challenging and more time consuming.\\" But it is a vital resource for the area, he said. \\"So much of what we do everyday is either done or supported by online activity. Whether that is learning, purchasing services, it's just part of everyday life in a modern economy that we live in nowadays.\\" Janice Rutherford, a grandmother from Cumnock, has no interest in using the internet.

And it can be a huge stumbling block for jobseekers and those applying for Universal Credit, which can only be applied for online. Ms Irvine said: \\"There's a push to move benefit applications online so if you are not computer literate, you don't have access to a computer, you don't have broadband, then it's really difficult for people.\\" Without the purchasing power internet shopping offers, it can also hit the poor and vulnerable in the pocket, she said. \\"We produced a report about the cost of living in the region and what we were seeing was... that if people aren't able to have the purchasing power that you have on line, then there's a disadvantage to that as well. \\"If your local shops have high prices and you don't have transport, you have a disability or a young family, then you are not able to be savvy in how you shop because you're not able to use the online facilities,\\" she added. Many libraries in Scotland offer basic computer literacy courses, and they are listed on the Let's Get On website. However until 100% of the population are digitally literate, Ms Irvine called for \\"flexibility\\" and \\"understanding\\" from the government. \\"It might sound efficient to say put everything online, and for some people that would probably work very well, but for a lot of people it doesn't,\\" she said. \\"It's about understanding at government level and at local government level that not everybody is computer literate, not everybody has access.\\" She added: \\"We would like there to be a flexible approach to that so for those who want to stick with paper systems, they should be able to do that.\\" This article was about:","completion":"This article discusses the digital divide in the United Kingdom, focusing on the reasons why some individuals do not use the internet.

Given the question: Article: Have you ever had the strange feeling that you were being watched? You turned around and, sure enough, someone was looking right at you! Parapsychologists say that humans have a natural ability to sense when someone is looking at them. To research whether such a \\"sixth sense\\" really exists, Robert Baker, a psychologist at the University of Kentucky, performed two experiments. In the first one, Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes. The subjects were eating, drinking, reading, studying, watching TV, or working at a computer. Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods. Later, when he questioned the subjects, almost all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them. For the second experiment, Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind a two way mirror in a laboratory setting. The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they weren't. Baker found that the subjects were no better at telling when they were stared at and when they weren't. and they were no better at telling when they were stared at than if they had just guessed.

Founded in 2000 by vocalist Tim Lambesis, the establishment of the band's first full lineup, which included drummer Jordan Mancino, occurred in 2001. As I Lay Dying has released six albums, one split album, and two compilation albums. As I Lay Dying's fourth studio album An Ocean Although As I Lay Dying has stated on numerous occasions that all of the members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. The band's lyrics do not focus on Christian themes the way many praise music bands do, nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality. Lyricist and lead singer Tim Lambesis has given mixed commentary on the subject: asked in 2008 if the members were \\"a Christian band\\" or \\"Christians in a band\\", Lambesis stated on the band's FAQ, \\"I'm not sure what the difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band, If you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life. All five of us are Christians. I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very 'preachy.' Many of our songs are about life, struggles, mistakes, relationships and other issues that don't fit entirely in the spiritual category. However, all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian.\\" Furthermore, during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis stated \\"I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics.\\" However, in later years, Lambesis showed an increasing philosophical skepticism towards Christianity and religion in general: Court documents stated Lambesis emailed his wife Meggan in August 2012, while on tour with As I Lay Dying, asking for a divorce and stating he \\"no longer believed in God\\". In explaining some of the lyrics from Awakened, Lambesis stated that his studies of theology had led him to the conclusion that \\"tradition and truth are often at odds with each other\\", and while he \\"didn't hate all religious belief\\", he was finding it \\"very difficult for to outline exactly who it is that's worth siding with.\\" He also quoted the book Pagan Christianity by George Barna and Frank Viola, claiming that both \\"Protestant and Catholic denominations have poisonous roots\\". While on house arrest in July 2013, after being charged with soliciting his wife's murder, Lambesis published a blog post in which he obliquely confirmed his previous loss of faith in Christianity. However, since his arrest it has been reported that Lambesis \\"has spent much of the last year reevaluating what originally convinced him to abandon belief in God. After much brokenness and repentance he sees things differently, considers himself a follower of Jesus, someone submitted to the will of God.\\" In 2014 Lambesis said that although they were marketed as a Christian band, the members privately considered themselves atheists. Former guitarist Nick Hipa calls these claims slanderous and defamatory. Did they mention about his wife?","completion":"Yes, they mentioned Tim Lambesis' wife, Meggan.

In 1997, Canada did not issue the special £1 banknote from the Royal Bank of Scotland to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the birth of Alexander Graham Bell. It was the Royal Bank of Scotland who released the £1 commemorative note in honor of Bell, a Scottish-born inventor and scientist. Now, let me provide you with the correct information related to Canadian currency in 1997. To celebrate Bell, Canada did not release a form of currency specifically in 1997. However, in 2002, the Bank of Canada honored the inventor by featuring Alexander Graham Bell on the back of the Canadian 100 banknote (issued as part of the Canadian Journey Series). The banknote depicted Bell with his numerous inventions, such as the telephone, photophone, HD-4 hydrofoil, and the Silver Dart airplane, commemorating his significant contributions to the development of communication and transportation technology. In conclusion, the correct information related to Bell and Canadian currency is that in 2002, the Bank of Canada released a 100 banknote featuring Alexander Graham Bell and his inventions. The 1997 Royal Bank of Scotland £1 commemorative note is not related to Canadian currency but instead was issued by Scotland to celebrate Bell's 150th birth anniversary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: The Senussi defeats in the Coastal Campaign forced the survivors over the border into Libya and to prevent a revival, the light Fords and armoured cars continued their patrols. The Aulad Ali surrendered to Peyton, having also gone hungry in the famine and public unrest in Alexandria diminished. The South African Brigade returned to Alexandria and two battalions of the Composite Brigade, a company of the Camel Corps, two guns of the Hong Kong Battery, the light armoured cars and the reconnaissance aircraft remained in Sollum, with an RFC half-flight. On 7 April, four light armoured cars and a machine-gun section of the 2/7th Middlesex left Sollum to raid an ammunition dump at Moraisa, 18 mi to the north-west and destroyed artillery ammunition and about 120,000 rounds of small-arms ammunition; other patrols that month uncovered another 167,000 rounds. The Italian army posted two battalions at Bardia to co-operate and from 25-26 July, a raiding force from Sollum and Italian cars from Bardia, a party from the Camel Corps and an Italian yacht, Misurat attacked a party of about forty Muhafizia at Wadi Sanal in Libya, 40 mi west of Ras el Mehl. The party was scattered and served as a warning that there was no sanctuary on either side of the border. Patrols continued for the year and a camel convoy was captured near Jaghbub, a Senussi stronghold 135 mi from Sollum; more combined Italian-British raids were made during the winter.

Please answer the following question: Two farms were growing food for several nearby cities. Vole farm grew organic produce and produced organic milk, while Anthill farm did not possess the USDA organic certification. Which farm produces less milk with no antibiotics? Hint: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary. A:","completion":"Based on the hint provided, Vole farm, which grows organic produce and produces organic milk, would be the farm that produces less milk with no antibiotics. Since organic farming practices restrict the use of antibiotics and chemicals, Vole farm's organic production method ensures that their milk has no chemical residues, and the likelihood of antibiotic-resistant pathogens being present is lower. While both dairy cows in organic and conventional farming practices may be exposed to pathogens, the limitations on antibiotics use in organic practices reduce the chances of developing antibiotic resistance, thus making antibiotics more effective when necessary.

Emma Reynolds. PUBLISHED:. 06:44 EST, 12 June 2012. |. UPDATED:. 21:02 EST, 12 June 2012. The world's youngest gastric sleeve patient claims having risky weightloss surgery at 12 years old transformed her life. Betsy Sanchez, from Coahuila in Mexico, is delighted to have slimmed down from 15 to ten stone since having 70 per cent of her stomach removed. Having now taken up exercise for the first time, 14-year-old Betsy is no longer a target for cruel bullies who teased her about her size. Radical change: Betsy Sanchez before the weightloss surgery, left, and after shedding five stone, right. Active lifestyle: Betsy, who was morbidly obese at 15st, is now 10st and enjoys horse-riding and spending time with friends. The change took place thanks to the her uncle, Dr Guillermo Alvarez, a bariatric surgeon who carries out the controversial permanent weightloss operations on adolescents. Betsy's mother Ana, the doctor's second cousin, says that taking the drastic step was the only way to stop her daughter following the. same heartbreaking path as Georgia Davis, the 19-year-old British girl whose food. addiction caused her to balloon to 63st. 'Diet and exercise didn't work for Betsy - she was addicted to food, only surgery would work,' said 39-year-old Mrs Sanchez. 'If Georgia had an operation at 12, she'd be happy and healthy now. She's lost years of her life. She might be too big now to safely have the operation - which proves it's sometimes better to have it young.' Food obsessed: Betsy, pictured with her mother Ana, struggled with her weight from the age of four. Controversial procedure: Betsy's surgery was carried out by her uncle Dr Guillermo Alvarez, left. Dr Alzarez says having surgery is. helpful for children who are struggling to lose weight because having a. much smaller stomach restricts their food intake. He. claims the surgery not only benefits a child's health - helping prevent. medical issues such as diabetes and liver disease - but improves their. confidence and allows for a more active childhood and happier school. life. Dr Alvarez, who. receives patients from across the USA, Britain and Europe, has since. operated on other children, but sets a lower age limit of 12. Betsy said: 'When my uncle said he could make me thinner I was so excited. I can still eat whatever I want but smaller portions. 'I can have McDonald's, but much smaller portions, only two chicken nuggets and chips. 'Out of control': Betsy at five and seven. The little girl weighed four stone by three years old and was 'always hungry', according to her family. 'I'm much happier. I now go horse-riding and I have lots of friends.' Betsy's weight problems began at the age of three when she started asking for extra portions and demanding snacks between meals, causing her weight to soar to four stone. A gastric sleeve is one of the newer types of weightloss operations. The stomach is permanently reduced to about 25 per cent of its original size, by surgical removal of a large portion of the stomach. The open edges are then attached together (often with surgical staples) to form a sleeve or tube with a banana shape. It may be appropriate for people who can't return as often for the follow-up visits required by gastric band procedures. A gastric band is a silicone band with an inflatable inner collar that is fitted around the upper stomach to restrict food intake, creating a small pouch and a narrow passage to the lower stomach. This passage delays the emptying of food from the pouch and causes a feeling of fullness. The band can be tightened or loosened over time. Mrs Sanchez admitted she and her furniture dealer husband Guillermo, 44, kept treats in the house for their two other children, aged 13 and nine. She said: 'Betsy would have four cookies and four crackers between meals. If I tried to stop her, she'd have a tantrum. She was always hungry. 'I tried serving healthy food and cutting portions, but Betsy was out of control.' Betsy's parents took her to see a paediatrician and she was tested for an underactive thyroid, but no medical reason was found for her weight issues. Nutritionists and psychologists also failed to find a solution. The 14-year-old said: 'When I asked mum for seconds she gave in. I used to comfort eat because I was bullied.' By the age of seven, Betsy was eating. up to 3,000 calories a day - double the recommended intake for her age -. and by the time she was nine she was a size 20 and weighed 13st. She. added: 'My parents took me to see lots of doctors and nutritionists but. nothing helped me lose weight. I was worried I was going to get so fat. I'd end up bedridden.' At. 12, Betsy weighed 15st and had a BMI of 41, making her morbidly obese. Her parents took her to see Dr Alvarez, Mrs Sanchez's second cousin,. anxious that Betsy might be suffering from depression and could develop. medical issues such as diabetes and high cholesterol. Dr. Alvarez explained all young patients undergo a psychological evaluation. to ensure they understand the implications of weightloss surgery. They. are put on a nutrition and exercise program which continues after the. operation. Demanding child: Betsy, pictured aged seven and eight, would have tantrums if she was not allowed second helpings and snacks. Happy teenager: Betsy admits she used to comfort eat because she felt miserable about her weight. Confident: Betsy has gone from 15st to 10st and enjoys activities such as horse-riding for the first time. He eventually operated on Betsy in 2008, after studies showed the benefit of surgery on young people. Betsy is believed to be the youngest patient ever to undergo the gastric sleeve. 'It is very controversial to operate on children,' said Dr Alvarez.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness","completion":"Step 1: Identify the sentiment-bearing words/phrases in the sentence. In this sentence, the sentiment-bearing words/phrases are: a. \\"may cause parents\\" b. \\"a few sleepless hours\\" c. \\"a sign\\" d. \\"its effectiveness\\" Step 2: Determine the sentiment polarity of the words/phrases. a. \\"may cause parents\\": neutral sentiment, as it does not indicate anything positive or negative by itself. b. \\"a few sleepless hours\\": negative sentiment, as it implies discomfort or disturbance. c. \\"a sign\\": neutral sentiment, as it merely indicates a correlation without indicating a positive or negative outlook d. \\"its effectiveness\\": positive sentiment, as effectiveness is typically a desirable quality for movies. Step 3: Evaluate the sentiment of the entire sentence. Although the part about \\"a few sleepless hours\\" carries a negative sentiment, the sentence refers to it as an indicator of the movie's effectiveness, which adds a positive connotation. The disagreeableness is framed as a positive aspect, since it demonstrates the movie's impact on the audience.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What were the two staff positions at the Elgin Cathedral that continued to grow?, using the article: Elgin Cathedral is a historic ruin in Elgin, Moray, north-east Scotland. The cathedral—dedicated to the Holy Trinity—was established in 1224 on land granted by King Alexander II outside the burgh of Elgin and close to the River Lossie. It replaced the cathedral at Spynie, 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the north, that was served by a small chapter of eight clerics. The new and bigger cathedral was staffed with 18 canons in 1226 and then increased to 23 by 1242. After a damaging fire in 1270, a rebuilding programme greatly enlarged the building. It was unaffected by the Wars of Scottish Independence but again suffered extensive fire damage in 1390 following an attack by Robert III's brother Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, also known as the Wolf of Badenoch. In 1402 the cathedral precinct again suffered an incendiary attack by the followers of the Lord of the Isles. The number of clerics required to staff the cathedral continued to grow, as did the number of craftsmen needed to maintain the buildings and surrounds. The cathedral went through periods of enlargement and renovation following the fires of 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to the northern and southern walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapter house dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in..., what would be the answer ?

They were all happy at first but type B ovens started to short circuit. But I can use this background: For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit.

Knowing that \\"a plant cell contains chloroplasts\\", how would one answer \\"Cactus house a great amount of\\"","completion":"Cactus house a great amount of specialized cells called parenchyma cells, which have unique adaptations and properties that help the plant survive in its arid and harsh environment. Among these cells, one of the most noteworthy characteristics is the high density of chloroplasts found within them, enabling the cactus to efficiently carry out photosynthesis and convert sunlight into energy. Photosynthesis is a vital process for plants, as it allows them to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. Chloroplasts are the organelles responsible for this process, and therefore, they play a pivotal role in the plant's overall survival and growth. In the case of cacti, these plants have evolved to live in environments with limited water and extreme temperatures, so their cells must be highly specialized to maximize their energy production and storage, while minimizing water loss. The chloroplasts contained within the parenchyma cells of a cactus are a key adaptation that enables this plant to survive in such conditions. Here are some of the ways in which the chloroplasts contribute to the cactus' unique survival strategies: 1. Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) Photosynthesis: One significant adaptation found in cacti is their ability to undergo a specialized form of photosynthesis called CAM. This process allows the plants to open their stomata (pores on the leaf surface) at night to absorb carbon dioxide while keeping them closed during the day to minimize water loss through transpiration. The chloroplasts in the cactus' parenchyma cells play an essential role in this process by storing the carbon dioxide as malate, a four-carbon compound, which is later used for the production of glucose during the day. 2. High chloroplast density: The parenchyma cells in cacti contain a higher density of chloroplasts than many other plants. This allows them to carry out photosynthesis more efficiently and maximize the amount of energy harvested from sunlight. In addition, the arrangement of the chloroplasts within the cells optimizes their exposure to light by positioning them close to the cell walls. 3. Storage of water and nutrients: The parenchyma cells in cacti are particularly large and are capable of storing significant amounts of water and nutrients. This, along with their large central vacuole, enables the plant to survive long periods of drought and extreme temperatures. The chloroplasts within these cells contribute to the production of energy and the synthesis of essential nutrients, such as sugars, proteins, and other organic compounds necessary for the plant's survival. In conclusion, cacti house a great amount of specialized parenchyma cells containing a high density of chloroplasts. These chloroplasts play a central role in the plant's adaptations specific to arid and extreme environments. They facilitate the unique photosynthetic processes, including the highly efficient CAM photosynthesis, providing the cactus with the energy and nutrients necessary to thrive in its harsh surroundings."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: John ran very fast, his feet touched the ground in what way?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question given this paragraph: Gas Laws and Air Composition Gas molecules exert force on the surfaces with which they are in contact; this force is called pressure. In natural systems, gases are normally present as a mixture of different types of molecules. For example, the atmosphere consists of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other gaseous molecules, and this gaseous mixture exerts a certain pressure referred to as atmospheric pressure (Table 22.2). Partial pressure (Px) is the pressure of a single type of gas in a mixture of gases. For example, in the atmosphere, oxygen exerts a partial pressure, and nitrogen exerts another partial pressure, independent of the partial pressure of oxygen (Figure 22.21). Total pressure is the sum of all the partial pressures of a gaseous mixture. Dalton’s law describes the behavior of nonreactive gases in a gaseous mixture and states that a specific gas type in a mixture exerts its own pressure; thus, the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in the mixture. Q: The atmosphere consists of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, which exerts a certain pressure referred to as what? Choices: - gravity pressure - tidal pressure - nitrogen pressure - atmospheric pressure A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"- atmospheric pressure The atmosphere consists of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other gaseous molecules.

In this context, atmospheric pressure is the total pressure exerted by all the gaseous molecules present in the atmosphere, including oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and others. The given choices of gravity pressure, tidal pressure, and nitrogen pressure do not correctly describe the combined pressure exerted by these gaseous molecules in the atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Neil didn't think that Derrick should pay for the damage to their car, because OPTIONS: -Neil was at fault.. -Derrick was at fault..","completion":"Neil didn't think that Derrick should pay for the damage to their car, because Neil was at fault. That cloudy Saturday afternoon, Neil and Derrick had been returning from a local basketball match. As always, they were both fully absorbed in discussing the game's highlights, dissecting each play and celebrating their team's victory. Neil was the driver, and Derrick the designated copilot. Due to their intense conversation, Neil didn't notice the sharp turn until it was too late. In an attempt to prevent their car from dipping into the adjacent ditch, he instinctively jerked the steering wheel too hard, causing him to lose control of the vehicle. The car drifted off the road, scraping against the thick, unforgiving branches of the dense hedgerows that lined the route. They were both mostly unharmed but shaken by the incident. They had been fortunate that there was nobody else on the road at the time, but the impact of the car with the hedgerow had left significant damage, the scratches and dents on the car's bodywork attesting to the vehemence of the crash. After assessing the extent of the damage, Derrick had suggested that they split the cost of the repairs. But Neil couldn't bear the thought of burdening his friend with additional expenses, especially since it was he who'd been behind the wheel. He tried to argue his case, insisting on taking full responsibility for the accident and bearing the brunt of the costs. \\"I was the one driving, Derrick. Really, I should be the one to pay. If I had paid closer attention to the road, we wouldn't be caught in this situation,\\" Neil explained, feeling his cheeks burn with embarrassment. Derrick, however, refused to give in. \\"Man, come on! We were both at fault here,\\" he argued, clapping Neil on the back in a rare, vulnerable display of camaraderie. \\"You wouldn't be so distracted if I hadn't been yammering on about the game the whole way. It's only fair that I help out with the expenses.\\" The two friends stood by the side of the road for a good while, each stubborn in their stance and neither one willing to let the other shoulder the blame entirely. Their voices rose and fell, ricocheting between frustration and dogged determination, as their breaths formed misty clouds in the cold air around them. Realizing that standing by their mangled vehicle wouldn't resolve the matter, Neil suggested they call a tow truck and head back to their shared apartment. But the conversation would continue intermittently for the next couple of days, each time the subject of the damaged car came up. Determined to hold himself accountable, Neil took it upon himself to do the research, seeking out the best local workshop to have the car repaired, and spend time comparing quotes in order to settle on the most affordable and reputable option. One evening later that week, Derrick approached Neil after dinner, seeming more solemn than usual. \\"Look, bud,\\" he said softly, \\"I know you want to do right by me, but the car was ours to begin with. We're a team, Neil, and we share everything – good and bad. So, why don't we just flip a coin and let fate decide who pays for it? That way, it's out of our hands.\\" Neil looked at his friend, contemplating his words, then finally conceded with a nod. \\"Alright, Derrick. Let's do it your way. Heads, I pay; tails, you pay,\\" he said, drawing a deep breath. Derrick produced a worn, silver coin from his pocket and flipped it. As it spun through the air, Neil knew that whatever the result, their friendship would remain strong; after all, they were a team, and that meant sticking together through triumph and adversity alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While the review is quite short and doesn't provide a comprehensive perspective, the use of the word \\"fresh\\" implies that the critic found the movie to be new, invigorating, and potentially different from other movies they have watched. The term \\"fresh\\" often carries positive connotations when used in a movie review, suggesting that the movie managed to deliver a sense of originality, creativity, or innovation in its story, characters, or overall execution. It may also hint at the film's ability to engage and entertain, or even surprise and challenge the audience in unexpected ways. However, without a longer and more detailed review, it's difficult to grasp the full extent of the critic's opinion about the movie. A comprehensive review would typically address specific elements like the plot, characters, dialogue, acting, cinematography, music, and the movie's overall impact on the viewer. By discussing these aspects in detail, a critic can provide a well-rounded perspective about the movie and enable potential viewers to make informed decisions about whether to watch it. Additionally, a longer review would also allow the critic to discuss any possible drawbacks, shortcomings, or areas that could have been improved. This sort of balanced evaluation is crucial for presenting an honest and objective analysis of a movie's overall quality. In conclusion, based on the short review provided, it seems that the critic is thinking positively of the movie, and that the movie was seen as a fresh and potentially original piece of cinema.

Here is a news article: SEARCY COUNTY -- Searcy County Sheriff Joey Pruitt wants information concerning about 60 dogs found apparently shot to death on property in the far south of the county. Pruitt said the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission was initially notified Thursday of dead dogs on the property off of Arkansas Highway 254 in the Chimes/Trace Ridge area. That agency in turn notified his office. He said about 60 dogs were found either dead or so severely wounded they had to be euthanized due to their suffering. Three dogs were still alive and were taken in for treatment. He said they were fairly healthy and not necessarily aggressive, but not extremely friendly either. Pruitt said the dogs were apparently shot on scene in that isolated part of the county. People looking at the land as timber tracts found the first dogs, but others were found in the general area. \\"It appears they were killed there,\\" Pruitt said. Although some of the dogs did have ribs showing, they didn't appear to have been neglected or abused, the sheriff said. None of the dogs had collars or name tags, and they could have been on the property for two or three days, Pruitt said. A dog rescue operation had been shut down in Searcy County a few years ago, but there were no immediate clues where the dogs might have originated, Pruitt said. It was his understanding that the suspect in that case had moved on from Searcy County. \\"Right now, I'm going to say we don't have any leads that have checked out,\\" Pruitt said Friday evening. Pruitt said Arkansas State Police had also been notified of the incident. Anyone with information regarding the investigation is asked to call the Searcy County Sheriff's Office at (870) 448-2340. The investigation was still in its early stages Friday. ||||| CHIMES, Ark. - A gruesome discovery was made on Thursday afternoon in southern Searcy County, just off of Arkansas 254 in the Chimes-Trace Ridge Area south of Marshall.

They were disturbed by what they found: dozens of dead dogs scattered throughout the woods. John Magruder still can't believe his eyes, two days later. He's shelter manager for the Searcy County Humane Society. It's difficult to look at the bullet riddled bodies and consider their innocent lives. Magruder wasn't there to gawk, however. He was looking for survivors. \\"I don't really have any words for what it makes me feel like. I've worked with dogs all my life and I love them a whole bunch and I just don't deal well with this, but I'm doing my best so I can save the ones I can,\\" said Magruder. The sheriff is also shocked. \\"This is my first in 25 years of law enforcement I've never seen anything like this,\\" said Sheriff Joey Pruitt. No one lives in the timber land where the massacre occurred. The sheriff thinks someone brought the dogs out here, fed them poison, and opened fire. \\"Systematically just start shooting and just leaving them lying and not even making sure that they're dead. I just can't imagine somebody doing that,\\" Pruitt said. The sheriff and state investigators recovered evidence, but they're still processing the massive crime scene. No suspects have been named, but the sheriff does want to reassure the public, \\"I don't think they're stealing people's pets.\\" So far 56 dogs have been found either poisoned and/or shot to death. Another dog that was shot and wounded had to be put down by a game warden, bringing the total to 57. Magruder says there was no hope of saving the dog that had to be euthanized because of its injuries. A few dogs survived. That's why Magruder was out in the forest for the third day in a row. He had a dog travel crate, and a bag of food. He's been feeding survivors and trying to lure and rescue them. One female was too skittish to approach the food. She lurked in the woods, but didn't stray from her murdered pack. Magruder already rescued four other dogs and took them back to the Searcy County Humane Society shelter. \\"We caught these two little female dogs. We brought them in this morning. This dog in here has been shot,\\" said Magruder. Only one of the male dogs is recovering from a bullet. It passed through the shoulder and is beginning to heal. Magruder checked on him, \\"You doing okay, Bubba?\\" \\"They could have found homes for these dogs. Why? Just why?\\" asked Jean Passmore, the Humane Society treasurer. Her emotions are raw and she broke into tears while discussing the crime. The people of this Humane Society are trying to channel their anger into nursing the survivors back to health. Magruder says three of the four rescued survivors were skittish and difficult to catch. One little dog came right to Magruder, though, eager for love. \\"He saw us, and that I had a bag of treats, and he took a treat and he was in the truck (immediately). He said, 'I've had enough of this,'\\" Magruder said. Soon, he'll be up for adoption. \\"Who could hurt him? Why would you hurt him?\\" The Searcy County Humane Society can be reached at 870-448-5579. It also has a list of pets ready for adoption on its Facebook page. Magruder and Passmore say they need donations to help cover medical costs and maintenance of the shelter. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A deeply distressing incident occurred in Searcy County, Arkansas, where around 60 dogs were found shot to death in a remote forest area. The dogs were discovered by two people from a lumber mill who were inspecting timber tracts in the Chimes-Trace Ridge area. The dogs did not appear to be neglected or abused, and none had collars or name tags. It is estimated that the dogs had been on the property for two or three days. While investigators have no immediate leads, they do not believe the dogs were stolen pets. Sheriff Joey Pruitt and the Arkansas State Police are currently investigating the case, requesting anyone with information to contact the Searcy County Sheriff's Office. As the investigation continues, the community has been left in shock by this horrific act of animal cruelty. John Magruder, the shelter manager for the Searcy County Humane Society, has been working tirelessly to rescue any surviving dogs from the scene. As of now, three dogs have been found alive and are receiving treatment. The Searcy County Humane Society is asking for donations to help cover medical costs and shelter maintenance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In a surprising and delightful collaboration, the White House and Kid President joined forces to bring joy and humor to the American public, proving that even the highest office in the US can let its hair down and enjoy a good prank. Meeting of the Titans: Kid President and POTUS Robby Novak, a.k.a Kid President, sprang into the limelight with his series of motivational and charming videos on YouTube, where he gave life advice, encouragement, and plenty of laughs. Backed by his effervescent personality and wit, Kid President garnered a strong following over the years. This allowed the extraordinary encounter between Kid President and the President of the United States, an event that left the audience euphoric and amused. Preparations for the Big Prank: With Kid President and the White House teaming up, weeks of brainstorming and meticulous planning ensued. It was essential for the prank to come across as entertaining and joyful without crossing the line into political discourse. The amount of work put in by both parties was evident in the elaborate setup of the April Fool's Day event. April Fool’s Day D-Day: On April 1st, an official White House press conference led by the-then President Barack Obama started off the event.

Humor, warmth, and childhood innocence can draw people in, regardless of their backgrounds, making pranks like the Kid President's White House takeover simultaneously engaging and heartwarming."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

Placing a potato where can cause an explosion? - pantry - exhaust pipe - vegetable soup - pot - shopping bags The best answer is The answer to this question is:","completion":"An exhaust pipe. While placing a potato in other locations such as a pantry, vegetable soup, pot, or shopping bags might be harmless or even appropriate in the case of storage or cooking, putting a potato in the exhaust pipe of a vehicle has the potential to cause damage or an explosion. Here's why: An exhaust pipe serves a crucial function in a vehicle's operation; it is designed to expel noxious gases, such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides, produced by the combustion process inside the engine. By allowing these gases to escape, an exhaust pipe helps to decrease the engine's temperature and reduce pollution. Inserting a potato into an exhaust pipe blocks the gas flow and creates considerable back pressure, affecting the engine's performance. As the potato blocks the pipe, exhaust gases are forced back into the engine itself due to the increased pressure. This can lead to several issues, including: 1. Damage to the vehicle's engine: The increased back pressure can cause the engine's internal components, such as the pistons, cylinder walls, valves, gaskets, or catalytic converter, to suffer damage or become worn. 2. Loss of engine power: The impaired exhaust flow caused by the potato obstruction means that the engine will struggle to expel gases as it should. This results in reduced power output and the engine working harder to function properly. 3. Overheating of the engine: As the exhaust gases are not being expelled efficiently, the engine's temperature can rise rapidly, which may lead to overheating or ultimately a complete engine breakdown. 4. Potential explosion: Although it might not always result in an explosion, having a potato in the exhaust pipe dramatically increases the risk. If the pressure reaches a dangerous level and affects the engine's essential components, such as the fuel or electrical systems, it could result in a spontaneous combustion or explosion. In summary, placing a potato in an exhaust pipe can cause significant damage to a vehicle's engine, leading to engine failure, overheating, or even an explosion. Thus, it is strongly advised not to insert foreign objects into an exhaust pipe as it puts your safety and the vehicle's performance at risk."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Imagine picking apples on Christmas or going skating on May Day. What about going for a swim on Thanksgiving? Without Leap Day ,which takes place every four years, that could happen. Our calendar is normally 365 days long. It was created to match the cycles of the seasons. But Roman ruler Julius Caesar noticed a problem: The earth doesn't circle the sun in exactly 365 days. It actually cakes 365 and one-quarter days. He figured out that the extra part of a day would cause the calendar to grow apart from the seasons over time. Over 100 years, the seasons would shift about 24 days. Spring would start on April 13 instead of March 20. Caesar used math to figure out a way to stop the calendar from shifting. He decided to add an extra day to the month of February every four years. His idea helped keep the seasons and calendar matched up. Even so, it still wasn't perfect--his calendar was adding too many days. In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII worked on Caesar's idea. His calendar, called the Gregorian calendar, declares that every year that is equally divided by 400 is a leap year. Turn-of-the-century years, or years ending in \\"00\\", would not be leap years unless they could be divided equally by 400. These complicated equations help keep the calendar in balance with the orbit of the earth. Today, we still use the Gregorian calendar.

Cells in the pancreas release insulin randomly. 3. Insulin may cause the body to absorb glucose from the blood without an increase in blood sugar levels. 4. Blood sugar levels could decrease or remain normal after glucose absorption. Now, let's examine the potential effects of random insulin release on blood sugar regulation: - In the perturbed scenario, there may be instances where insulin is released even when blood sugar levels are normal or low. This could cause a decrease in blood sugar levels, potentially leading to hypoglycemia (abnormally low blood sugar). - In cases where blood sugar levels are high after a meal and insulin is released randomly, there's a reduced likelihood of adequate insulin release to help maintain a normal blood sugar level. This could ultimately lead to hyperglycemia (abnormally high blood sugar). - The perturbed insulin release may also affect the balance between insulin and glucagon, which are critical for maintaining blood sugar levels within a normal range. In particular, random insulin release might lead to less glucagon being released, as it might mask low blood sugar events that would normally trigger glucagon release. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of random insulin release would have both direct and indirect effects on the regulation of blood sugar levels. This could potentially lead to consequences such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, making blood sugar regulation less precise and ultimately less effective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The power goes out, so Kurt and Brian go outside to check the fuses; Tommy follows with his camera. After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave. The truck will not start. The battery has melted so they return to the house. As they take stock of the situation they hear scrabbling sounds from the roof and discover that an alien has made its way in through an open window.

Does it follow that \\"Why hadn't he mentioned he was still on the case. \\"?","completion":"There could be various reasons why he had not let them know that he was still working on the case. Let's explore some of the possible motives and scenarios, considering both perspectives - his own and the people involved who expected updates on the case progress. 1. Confidentiality and safety concerns: In some cases, revealing the ongoing investigation status to individuals or groups may cause panic, arouse suspicion or result in alerting the subjects under investigation. These could negatively impact the progress of the case and even put the investigator or others at risk. 2. Fear of interference: The individual working on the case might be concerned about external pressures or influences exerted on the investigation if they shared their ongoing work. In some instances, they might prefer to withhold information until they reach a significant breakthrough that would be more conclusive and leave less room for outside tampering or interference. 3. Desire for independent work: It's possible that the investigator values their autonomy and prefers working independently on cases without constantly updating concerned parties. This might stem from their personality, work style, or previous experiences where collaboration may have led to complications in case resolution. 4. Need for time and space: The investigator might have realized that the case is more complicated than initially assumed and requires a deeper analysis. By not disclosing the ongoing work, the investigator can buy time and space to explore the case without external pressure or the burden of expectations from others. 5. Lack of significant progress: Sometimes, investigators might not have concrete updates to share due to the nature of the case or challenges they encountered. In such scenarios, they might choose to withhold information until they have significant findings or breakthroughs that would be worthwhile to share. As for the second question, \\"Why hadn't he mentioned he was still on the case?\\" - Yes, it essentially follows the same meaning, but it is phrased slightly differently. Both questions convey the same idea of enquiring as to why the individual did not inform others that they were still working on the case. The difference lies in the use of \\"hadn't\\" and \\"mentioned\\" in the second question, which implies a slightly more informal and conversational tone. However, both questions are asking for the same insight into the investigator's reasons for keeping the case's ongoing status undisclosed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write the answer: \\"Which English Monarch was the \\"\\"Count de Blois\\"\\"?\\"","completion":"The English monarch who held the title \\"Count de Blois\\" was King Stephen, also known as Stephen of Blois. He was born around 1092 or 1096 in Blois, France, and was the third son of Stephen, Count of Blois, and Adela, who was the daughter of William the Conqueror. As a result, he was a member of the House of Blois, a noble family originating from the French region of the same name. King Stephen ruled from 1135 to 1154, occupying the English throne during a period known as \\"The Anarchy.\\" This era was marked by a struggle for power between the monarchy, the nobility, and the church. It began after the death of King Henry I, who had appointed his daughter, Empress Matilda, as his successor. However, Matilda's right to the throne was challenged by Stephen, her cousin, who claimed that Henry had nominated him on his deathbed. Quick to act, Stephen sailed to England and secured support from key nobles and the Church. On December 22, 1135, he was anointed king by the Archbishop of Canterbury, thus beginning his reign. However, his ascendance to the throne was not universally recognized, and a civil war erupted between his supporters and those that remained loyal to Empress Matilda. Stephen's reign was marked by conflict and political instability. His right to the throne was continuously challenged, and the monarchy's authority was weakened, allowing for the rise of powerful barons. During his rule, administrative structures fell into disarray, contributing to the decline of the royal government's effectiveness. Despite multiple setbacks, Stephen held onto the throne for nearly two decades. In 1153, Stephen and Matilda's son, the future King Henry II, reached an agreement known as the Treaty of Wallingford. This pact stipulated that Stephen would retain the crown for the remainder of his life, but that upon his death, the Angevin line of succession would be restored, and the English throne would pass to Henry. Consequently, when Stephen died on October 25, 1154, Henry ascended to the throne, marking the end of The Anarchy. In conclusion, Stephen of Blois was the English monarch who held the title \\"Count de Blois.\\" His rule was characterized by a tumultuous rivalry for the throne, which severely weakened the monarchy and ultimately led to a period of chaos. However, through a negotiated agreement, Stephen managed to maintain his position until his death, after which the Angevin line was restored with Henry II's reign."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls.

Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons.

Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997.

The reviewer expresses a strong dissatisfaction with the show by using words and phrases such as \\"horrible review,\\" \\"I have no idea,\\" \\"absolutely ridiculous,\\" and directly calling out Amazon to remove the show. These word choices and expressions all point towards a highly unfavorable view of the mentioned show. The reviewer questions the reasoning behind the show's production, demonstrating that they consider it a complete waste of time, resources, and effort. By saying \\"I have no idea how or why a show like this was ever put into production,\\" they imply that the show is lacking any redeeming qualities that would justify its existence. This further reinforces the negative sentiment expressed in the review. Moreover, when the reviewer writes \\"Absolutely ridiculous,\\" it is evident that they are not only unhappy with the show but also consider it to be absurd and nonsensical. This further accentuates the dissatisfaction expressed by the reviewer, revealing a deep level of disapproval regarding the content of the show. Lastly, by addressing Amazon directly and asking them to take the show off, the reviewer not only reinforces their negative perception of the show but also showcases a level of frustration or concern that such a show is even available on the platform. This request indicates that the reviewer does not want other users to be subjected to the same unpleasant experience they had while watching the show. This emphatic plea adds to the overall negative sentiment communicated within the review. In conclusion, the product review expresses a very negative sentiment towards the show. The choice of words, phrases, and the direct address to Amazon indicate that the reviewer holds an unfavorable and disapproving view of the show and wishes for it to be removed from the platform."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Neill was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him in charge of the Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks. He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack. Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Seguín left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer. In response to Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29.

Instead, it focuses on the behavior of Tom's dog fetching Tom's slippers and how it stopped doing so when the slippers smelled bad. Once Tom got a new pair of slippers, the dog resumed fetching them. Several observations can be made based on the passage: 1. Tom's dog has been trained to fetch slippers: It is mentioned that Tom trained his dog to get his slippers for him, and the dog would do it every single time, establishing that it has been conditioned to perform this specific task. 2. The dog stopped fetching the slippers when they smelled bad: It is possible that the odor from the slippers was unappealing to the dog, causing him to stop fetching them. This suggests that dogs might exhibit certain behaviors or preferences based on their olfactory senses. 3. The dog resumed fetching when Tom got a new pair: The fact that the dog resumed fetching slippers when Tom got a new pair suggests the negative olfactory factor played a role in its behavior change. Dogs have a sensitive sense of smell, and it seems likely that the odor of the old slippers was the primary deterrent for the dog's refusal to fetch them.

Q:You are given a new situation: Jacob and Thomas were conducting an experiment in a chemistry class. The goal of the experiment was to identify the strength of unknown acids by examining the products formed in a chemical reaction. After they completed the experiment, Jacob concluded that he was given a strong acid, while Thomas concluded that he was given a weak acid. and a hint : The stronger of two acids will have a higher Ka than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for Ka spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, pKa is more frequently used, where pKa = −log10 Ka. Stronger acids have a smaller pKa than weaker acids. Experimentally determined pKa at 25 °C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material. Please answer this question : Which person's acid, Jacob's or Thomas's, will have a lower ratio of hydrogen ions to acid? A:","completion":"To answer the question, let's first go step by step through the given information: 1. Jacob concluded that he was given a strong acid. 2. Thomas concluded that he was given a weak acid. 3. Stronger acids have a higher Ka (acid dissociation constant) than weaker acids. 4. Stronger acids have a higher ratio of hydrogen ions to acid. 5. Stronger acids have a smaller pKa value than weaker acids. Now, we know from the information above that Jacob has a strong acid and Thomas has a weak acid.
