It is meant to be funny but also be written in the authoritative style of a news report, kind of like The Onion.","completion":"Today marks a new day in not only American history but world history. We are no longer alone in the universe. Life outside our planet exists and aliens have landed in Nevada. NASA scientists had been tracking a strange non-terrestrial object for days leading up to today's big event. The object appeared from behind the dark side of the moon and was originally believed to be an untracked asteroid or comet. However, the object's path and speed started changing until today it entered Earth's atmosphere. Instead of burning up like a hunk of space rock, it was able to penetrate the atmosphere and survive. The military scrambled jets and the first sighting described the flying object as being triangular with a matte black exterior and no visible ports of entry or egress. It was a tense few moments as first contact was made but the craft was allowed to continue unhindered as it showed no hostile intent. Passing over Washington, D.C., Chicago, and other major metropolitan areas the craft finally touched down in Nevada. Many top officials believed they were heading to the notorious Area 51. But that proved not to be the case as the UFO instead landed directly on the Vegas strip. Roughly the size of a 747 jet, all traffic stopped immediately. Two figures exited the craft distinctly humanoid in shape. The taller of the two raised its right hand and made a gesture splitting their fingers into a V-shape and spoke in perfect English, \\"Live long and prosper.\\" It was at this point that the shorter alien slapped the taller alien on the shoulder and let out an audible sigh. They were Trekkies. The aliens were Star Trek fans. As people approached the aliens they noticed they were clad in the uniforms of the original Star Trek officers, one in yellow for command and one in blue for science specialty. This was no alien invasion, this was a vacation. The aliens were allowed to proceed as journalists and military personnel alike shadowed them. They went directly to the casino already possessing American dollars and proceeded to lose it all at the dice table in less than an hour. Following this display, they went to the buffet and ate three plates of crab legs. These visitors to Vegas were not too different from us. We are not alone."},{"prompt":"Write a funny, short story about someone who will stop at nothing to go green and reduce their carbon footprint.","completion":"Garry has a real green thumb, and taking care of the environment is extremely important to him.

Thank the editor for highlighting this important topic. Rewrite all the main facts in the article. A vet has warned pet owners to be very careful when using oil diffusers in their homes, as certain oils can prove fatal for dogs. This comes after a grandmother shared how her beloved pooch was poisoned by the oils in her diffuser, and was left unable to recognise her when she returned from working a late shift as a nanny. Sharing her warning on Facebook, Marrianne Whyte explained that she'd initially assumed she'd woken her dog up from a dream, in which he had been experiencing night terrors, but found he was \\"still acting weird\\" the next day. After turning off her new diffuser, Marrianne noticed that her pet's condition started to improve, but didn't make the connection straight away. Marrianne set off for another shift, but ended up returning home early after receiving a worrying call from her dog sitter. In her post, which has been shared more than 1.5 million times, Marrianne, who lives in New Zealand, wrote: \\"[She] said that he wouldn't come out from under the bed. It was very odd as he is a happy dog. \\"I came from work early and again, he was very confused about who I was. So I took him to an emergency vet. It turns out that the tea tree oil I was using in the diffuser is toxic for dogs.\\" Thankfully, tests confirmed that Marriane's dog hadn't suffered liver damage, but they \\"weren't out of the woods yet\\", and the vet gave him fluids under his skin to get rid of any toxins. Vet clinic Pets on Parker told 7life that cats are also at risk of being poisoned by essential oils because they don't have a liver enzyme called glucuronyl transferase, which is required to break them down. The experts explained: \\"Their livers are slower at eliminating these compounds, which can lead to toxic build-up. While dogs do not lack this enzyme, they are still sensitive to essential oils and can become very sick if exposed to them. \\"Common signs of poisoning as a result of inhalation (usually from an oil diffuser) include laboured breathing, lack of coordination and difficulty walking, drooling, diarrhoea, lethargy, depression, low body temperature, weakness, muscle tremors, and vomiting.\\"","completion":"Dear Editor, Many thanks for raising this important issue in your paper. Dog owners must be very careful when using oil diffusers in their homes, particularly ones containing tea tree oil. Tea tree oil can be lethal for dogs. A New Zealand grandmother shared a heartbreaking story about how her beloved pooch was poisoned by the oils in her diffuser. The poor dog was left unable to recognise her when she returned from working a late shift as a nanny. It is great that Marrianne Whyte shared her warning on Facebook because it raises awareness of this issue. In fact, her post has been shared 1.5 million times. When she tried to wake her dog up, she thought the dog had been having a dream, or been experiencing night terrors. However, she found that he was \\"still acting weird\\" the next day. The following day Marrianne set off for another shift but had to return home early after receiving a worrying call from her dog sitter because the dog wouldn't come out from under the bed. It was very out of character because he was a happy dog. After returning early from work Marrianne Whyte found the dog in a confused state, so she took him to the emergency vet. It was then she discovered that the tea tree oil in her diffuser is toxic for dogs. There is a happy ending to the story, because fortunately, tests confirmed that Marriane's dog hadn't suffered liver damage. However, the vet gave him fluids under his skin to get rid of any toxins. Cat lovers should also be aware, as Vet Clinic Pets on Parker, so rightly points out. Cats are also at risk of being poisoned by essential oils. Cats don't have a liver enzyme called glucuronyl transferase, which is required to break them down. Cats' livers are slower at eliminating these compounds, which can lead to toxic build-up. Dogs, like me, do not lack this enzyme, but we are still sensitive to essential oils and we are liable to become very sick if exposed to them. Owners can look out for common signs of poisoning as a result of inhalation from an oil diffuser, by watching for laboured breathing, lack of coordination and difficulty walking, drooling, diarrhoea, lethargy, depression, low body temperature, weakness, muscle tremors and vomiting. Therefore, you see the terrible effects that these diffusers can have on animals like me. I thank you for highlighting and raising awareness of this problem. I hope that no other dog will have to suffer as a result of tea tree oil diffusers.

Her hair looked like it was probably silky, but at that moment, it was a bit of a frazzled mess. She wore a tight-fitting purple dress that accentuated her slim figure and slight bust. She wasn't wearing shoes or socks, and when she stepped, one could see the black caked on the soles of her feet. Surprisingly, she didn't wear heavy makeup. It was light and natural, with mascara, a light blush around her cheeks, and subtle lip stain being the only adornments. These, of course, were not her most notable features. When she walked into the dinner, her eyes were hollow. They held no shine--no recognition of life, even. If there was someone behind that dull glare, she was certainly preoccupied with other things. No amount of beauty or makeup would have hidden away the hideous truths that were buried beneath her. However, that didn't seem to be the purpose of her attire or makeup. To Rustage, it didn't seem that she had any purpose at all, but he couldn't simply leave her alone. Something told him there was a story there that needed to be uncovered. It wouldn't be his job. He only handled the strangest, most obscure cases that weren't for the light of heart or sane. It wasn't right of him to pass a child who was clearly in need.

Guinea pigs are animals that are best in bonded pairs or groups. You should never adopt only one guinea pig as they are social creatures. Guinea pigs need to eat hay (timothy, oat, or wheatgrass) every day as their teeth are constantly growing and need to be ground down as they chew. They should also have nutritional pellets daily and a mixture of vegetables. Never feed your guinea pig iceberg lettuce, though, as it's too watery! When your guinea pig learns its feeding pattern, you'll notice a high-pitched 'wheek!' sound coming from their cage as soon as the fridge opens or they hear the rustle of a plastic bag! Supplement your feedings with occasional Vitamin C drops, also. Take your guinea pigs out once a day for free roam or floor time so that they can stretch their legs and play. Cages should be at minimum 2 feet by 3 feet for a single guinea pig - but more is always better if you've got the space. Boars need to have boar cleanings once a month where you'll clean out their inside sac of all the hay, food, and bedding particles that accumulate in there. Speaking of bedding - many owners recommend using fabric cage liners for guinea pigs as it's soft on their feet, easy to clean, and good for the environment. These include a top and bottom layer of fleece with an absorbing pad in the middle. You'll just wipe up quick messes of pee or poop on top, then throw the liners in the washing machine once a week.

The toilet patiently waited until night to see the ghost again. Around the same time, another ghost appeared suddenly in the bathroom and adjusted its tie in the mirror. The toilet was absolutely astounded and wondered if all the people in the supposed tours that he had seen over the years were real people or ghosts."},{"prompt":"I want to get an online newspaper subscription to keep up with U.S. politics and national news. What are some good options? Which paper is considered the best? I've heard newspapers are in rough shape financially, will any national newspapers be going out of business?","completion":"Well, the most prestigious newspaper in the United States is the New York Times, which has reporters in numerous offices nationally. It's an excellent source of national news and politics and is considered the best newspaper in the nation by many people and has won more Pulitzer Prizes -- the most prestigious award. The Washington Post is also an excellent choice. While it does not have the stature of the New York Times, it also covers national news and, located in Washington, D.C., is especially good at reporting on politics. Other options include the Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times. Newspapers are facing financial headwinds, and many smaller newspapers have closed in the last decade. But national newspapers are in better financial shape, especially the New York Times. The Los Angeles Times has faced more money trouble but still has a robust staff even with cuts in recent years."},{"prompt":"I am looking for ideas to make food from what I have left in my house.

You can prepare the beef for burgers or tacos or make pulled chicken for sandwiches. If you want to cook a meal with beef, you can make cheddar and beef meatballs, beef and rice, a ground beef omelet, or a beef and cheese patty. If you would instead prefer a meal with chicken, you can make salt and pepper chicken, sweet curry chicken kabobs, a chicken and egg wrap, paprika chicken, or fried chicken."},{"prompt":"Come up with a short story about a man teaching his young son how to fix a vehicle, where the father wants to appear smart for his son but doesn't know much about fixing cars.","completion":"Jeff watched as his father got under the hood of the family sedan: a 15-year-old 4-door vehicle that had been with the family as long as he could remember. Jeff's father, a proud man in his 50s, looked intently at the complex machinery under the hood as if examining a complicated puzzle. Jeff stood next to his father and leaned over to see what his father was seeing. \\"What's wrong with it, Dad?\\" he asked him. \\"Not sure,\\" he replied, \\"but I think it has something to do with the engine. There's no reason why it should just stop like that unless it were the engine. Do me a favor and get in the driver's seat and try starting it.\\" Jeff, eager to start learning to drive, jumped into the driver's seat of the sedan and turned the key in the ignition. Nothing. He tried again. Nothing. Jeff exited the vehicle and walked back to his dad. \\"What do you think it is?\\" he asked. Jeff's father began touching things on the engine, seemingly actively investigating the source of the vehicle's problems. He pulled on some hoses and checked the fluid levels in all the fluid-containing reservoirs, then sighed. \\"Hmm,\\" he began a bit puzzled, \\"This is interesting.\\" \\"What is it?\\" Jeff asked, thinking his father had identified the problem. His father, without missing a beat, replied, \\"The windshield washer fluid is low.\\" Confused by the reply, Jeff wondered what the connection was between the windshield washer fluid being low and the engine not turning over. Jeff's father felt defeated and decided to call the nearest tow truck to get the vehicle towed back home. When the tow truck driver arrived, he looked at the vehicle and Jeff's father peering under the hood. \\"Can you try turning the engine over please?\\" he asked Jeff's father. \\"We tried that,\\" he replied but obliged the driver anyway. \\"Okay,\\" the driver said unamused, \\"Did you make sure there was gas in the tank?\\" Jeff looked up at his dad in amazement. \\"Did you get gas yesterday after work like Mom told you to?\\" he asked incredulously. Jeff's father, now with a look of realization on his face, looked at the driver and shook his head. \\"Oh my god,\\" he said in shock.

Tom had never been fishing but always loved the idea of it. By night, Tom was a bull rider and a really good one at that. Tom had won all the major competitions several times. Today, Tom decided that he was going to go fishing for the first time. As a bull rider, Tom lived fast and free, oftentimes doing extreme things like bull riding. Tom started the boat and got going. He stopped once he could no longer see the shore and threw out his line. Almost immediately, Tom got a bite on his line! It was a great white shark! Tom fought the mammoth shark for hours. The shark pulled his boat for miles and miles until finally, his line snapped. Tom, who had fallen over in the boat, stood up and looked around to see if he could see anyone or anything. He couldn't. Tom was lost at sea! Tom tried to look at the GPS, but it was broken. Tom flashed the boat lights and yelled as loud as he could to no avail. Tom panicked for a moment and lay down in the boat. \\"What to do?\\" Tom thought. He turned the boat on and began driving, hoping that he would run into shore before dark. Tom traveled for 10 hours through the night until finally making his way back to shore. Tom parked, hopped off the boat, and kissed the ground. He was so happy to be alive and on land!

Here are some ideas for what the guns could shoot: - Lasers - There already exists lasers that can cut through things, so the guns could have this in them. Pulling the trigger turns it on, and you could say that to prevent it from overheating, it can only turn on for half a second at a time. - Explosives - Think of this option like a miniature grenade launcher. In your sci-fi world, they have invented highly volatile compounds that will explode with only a few drops. These few drops are put in something the size and shape of a bullet. How powerful you want the explosive to be is up to you. - Poison Vials - Guns could fire small containers of an easily obtained poison or chemical. Perhaps there are even different grades of poison, depending on how lethal you want it to be. The vials always break when they are shot at something, and if the poison is acidic enough, can melt into whatever they are shot at. Maybe only a few drops need to touch the skin for the person to die. - Nanites - A group of nanites could be in a ball or any other shape and are programmed to only attach when fired and to attack whatever they are fired at.

I didn't know what was more frightening to me - the sound of the raging thunder, the growling of the beasts, or the fact that I was entirely alone.

The storm last night had been pretty frightful, and the pasture was beset with rain and thunder the entire night. As Dotty went around her pen, she noticed something that caused her to stop dead in her tracks. The fence was down, likely due to the storm last night. Dotty was terrified; the fence wasn't supposed to be down. Now, all manner of scary creatures could get inside and eat it. It was this thought that triggered a radically opposite one: she could explore outside the pen. Finally, get to see what was in those woods on the other side of the street. Now that she thought about it, she was convinced to try it. She took the brave first step over the broken plank and made her way toward the road. It was still early morning. The farmer wouldn't even notice she'd gone for the morning, and besides, she would be back within a few hours. She took her first step onto the road, noting just how much firmer it was than the soft grass of the pasture. All of a sudden, two glowing eyes appeared from down the street, growing larger as they approached. A terrifying horn sounded, and Dotty froze, unable to move.

What is hi-fi audio? Hi-fi audio, also known as high fidelity audio, is simply audio that is very high quality. The factors that play into this level of quality are a high accuracy at reproducing the audible frequencies in audio, and extremely little distortion in the original audio signal. This in general is what “high fidelity” means. Let’s break this down in another way. You’ve likely heard of lo-fi music before; if not, it’s a genre that is often mixed with elements of jazz or hip-hop. The instrumentation is not relevant for this example, however; let’s focus on the general sound. Lo-fi music is characterized as having a low quality, almost underwater type sound, usually with crackling and warping sounds from a vinyl record, to add to the ambience. Instruments are usually “broken” sounding or boxy. With hi-fi, it’s simply the opposite of lo-fi. If lo-fi audio is described as being old, broken, and fuzzy sounding, hi-fi is accurately described as sounding clear, clean, crisp, and free from distortion and other unwanted sonic artifacts. A more technical answer would be this: Music files that have a higher sample rate and/or bit depth than CDs are what high fidelity audio is considered to be. CDs have a sample rate of 44.1 KHz and a 16-bit bit depth, so as long as at least one of these numbers is higher than those of a CD, audio is considered to be hi-fi.","completion":"Hi-fi audio—as opposed to lo-fi, which a defining characteristic of is its low-quality sound—is high-quality audio with exceptional frequency response and little if any distortion. More technically, it refers to audio with a sample rate higher than 44.1 kHz and 16-bit bit depth."},{"prompt":"Reframe this tutorial as someone describing their starting experiences with music production. Expand on some of the experiences like mixing and mastering music. Starting music production from fresh is an overwhelming experience for most people. It certainly was for us! But don't worry, it's really easy to get involved in the world of production. If you want to get into the audio engineer route, go volunteer at studios. Try to get a job as a runner, or a tea/coffee boy. If you stay there long enough eventually you'll be taught things and climb the ranks. If you just want to make beats in your bedroom, then the first thing you should do is download a free DAW, or pay for one. Next, learn the basics of your DAW, and start to try and make a song. It doesn't matter how bad the song is, or how far away it sounds from what's in your head. Just start doing it. When you run into something that you don't know how to do, or understand, head to YouTube and watch some tutorials on it. Once you've finished a song, attempt to mix it down, and attempt to master it after that. First start off by just using volume levelling to mix your songs, and get a feel for what level each instrument should be at. Then start learning what compression is, what EQ is etc. Make sure to watch tutorials on how to mix certain instruments, like vocals, or how to use certain tools you don't understand. But, don't get stuck in a rut of watching tutorials and not doing anything. The best way you will learn is by doing. After making your first couple songs, start to learn about sound design. Choose a synth, and learn it inside and out. We recommend Serum for learning, as it's beginner friendly and a powerhouse of a synth. Keep making new songs, and trying out the new things you have learned from tutorials. You will improve rapidly by doing this. A good thing to do is try to separate sessions and spend different days of the week doing different things to improve your learning.","completion":"I had no experience when I started trying to make music, so I was super overwhelmed by all of my options. I had a lot of possible avenues to take, so it was a bit hard to come to a decision. I wanted to start small, so I just downloaded a DAW and started going at it, watching tutorials online to help me find my way. It was rough: I couldn't make anything I liked the sound of, I couldn't really capture the rhythms or melodies in my head, or they'd leave me before I had the opportunity to get them down. Not only did I have to worry about all of those things, but there were also all the complicated things like EQ, mixing, mastering, and a bunch of other stuff I didn't really understand. It was hard to find a balance, both literally (getting the levels of instruments and vocals to sound right), and figuratively (finding out what to do and putting that into practice). It was a struggle pushing through all of that, but it kind of got easier as time went on. I started trying to learn a bit more about sound design with Serum, a synthesizer that's both easy to understand and really good at what it's meant for. I kept at it, trying to make more songs and improve, and it's steadily worked.

As of recently, I feel the UFC is throwing together the crappy cards and there is nothing to look forward to until UFC 290. Look at last weekend's card and headliner which was Dern Vs Hill SMFH... then the upcoming piss-poor UFC fight night cards and I wonder what the hell is going on. Up until UFC 290 in July, there are like 1 to 2 fights max per fight night cards that I care for and I'm a diehard fan of the sport. The next PPV (UFC 289) card is just an abomination on so many levels with the only saving grace being Olivera vs Dariush. I would even go as far as to say the last Canadian card UFC fight night 158 Vancouver (2019) is better than the embarrassment that is UFC 289. I feel that the roster is just oversaturated to hell with so many middle/low tier fighters who need to be cut as harsh as that might be and because of that the UFC are increasingly pushing quantity over quality to meet quotas, as they have to offer their fighters x number of fights a year. Speaking of UFC 290 which is in international fight week compare that card with UFC 239 card which was in 2019 (pre-covid) and it's just so, so much more stacked on every level, including the prelims, much more fitting for international fight week. Even UFC 276 international fight week last year compared to UFC 290 was just better in my view on paper (more compelling fights overall). Also before everyone jumps on me, UFC 290 is not a bad card (although why the f is Jack Della Madellena on the prelims) but each year I just feel the state of matchmaking declining further and further down with these shitty filler fight nights like last weekend. A lack of big-name stars committing to fights stuck in limbo (Conor, Khamzat, Jones etc etc etc), bigger-name fighters getting injured on PPV and the UFC moving them entirely instead of booking replacements (Thompson Vs Perriera as an example), no more triple champion cards (UFC 217 being my all-time favorite), ever-increasing PPV prices for less quality is just making the product dull. Instead of these BS fight nights cards I wish they would cut 1/3 of the roster and do every month one solid PPV stacked from top to bottom like how it was trending towards before 2020 hit. Sorry for the long rant but surely I'm not the only one feeling this way, maybe you guys have different views but I think it's becoming frustrating as shit being a fan of the UFC and my interest is just slowly being chipped away.","completion":"Okay, I’ll try to explain it simply.

Tasks that could once only be completed by a bank employee are now quickly and easily handled by the customer at their convenience. Because of these and other advantages, online banking continues to grow into a multi-billion dollar business. Some of the latest banking technology allows customers to deposit checks and cash without the assistance of a bank employee. And who knows what the future might hold for this industry? Everyone will agree that online banking is a powerful business delivery channel that assists customers in better managing their personal and business finances."},{"prompt":"Come up with a theory that supports the idea that the universe is contained within a gigantic black hole.","completion":"Although current scientific evidence and belief does not support it, there is some merit to the idea that the universe as we see it is contained within a gigantic black hole, one that is so big that it contains all the stars, galaxies, and matter that we see around us. One consideration in support of this theory is the observation made by Hubble's Space Telescope that confirmed recently that the expansion of the universe - caused by the Big Bang - is neither slowing nor remaining constant, but is instead accelerating. Current hypotheses about the cause for this acceleration include the presence of an exotic form of energy, called dark energy, which is causing the speeding up of the expansion of the universe. However, scientists have yet to find any evidence that such dark energy exists. In the black hole theory of the universe, it could be argued that the accelerated expansion of the universe is leading all matter in the universe toward a black hole singularity since any object that falls into a black hole experiences increasing acceleration when falling toward a black hole's singularity - its center. Another observation in support of the universal black hole theory is the fact that a large portion of the universe's mass seems to be missing and unaccounted for. While dark matter has been posited as the missing piece of the puzzle, it is also plausible that the unaccounted-for matter that is missing could be in the form of a black hole singularity that exists somewhere in the universe but which we cannot readily see yet due to large distances between it and the instruments we use to observe the universe. Since the bulk of a black hole's mass exists as a single point within the black hole when gravity compresses a great amount of mass into it, it could be argued that the majority of the mass of the universe exists as a singularity within the black hole universe in which we reside. Overall, we may not be able to find the answers we seek even with extensive study into the observations we make of our universe. With current technology and the limitations imposed on us by the sheer size of the universe, we can only rely on indirect observations of phenomena to infer what is really happening in our universe."},{"prompt":"Write a 3-paragraph blurb about why labradors make good pets.

So you might already know this about me and my friends because it's something we're sort of known for, but we have a LOT of energy! I love spending time outside, running around, and playing, and I love it even more when you play outside with me. I really like to go for walks every day, and I behave much better if you help me get my energy out in good ways instead of letting it build up. Sometimes when I have too much energy and I'm not getting enough exercise I get super bored. And then I start doing stuff I know I'm not supposed to - like chewing on things or barking and whining. I try hard not to, but it's just so hard because my energy has to come out somehow or else I'll explode! I love going on hikes - I would go for a hike every day if I could! I like swimming too, so anytime you want to take me somewhere where I can get in the water is a perfect day in my book. I'm usually in a good mood and I mostly just want to spend time with my people - I would love to go to work with you or lay at your feet all day if you work from home. I really like kids too - they are so FUN to play with! Sometimes I have to be careful because I'm bigger than them and I might accidentally knock them over. I get so excited that it makes me wiggle around and jump and that's too much for some little kids. You might have to help me by reminding me to be gentle with them. Thank you so much. I really just want to make you happy but it's so hard sometimes because I get distracted when I'm excited. I don't want to brag but I'm also pretty smart. I can learn lots of tricks and I'm actually happier when you give me rules to obey and teach me how to do new things. I love making new friends - I would make new friends every day if I could. Making new friends might be my favorite thing ever! So you don't have to worry about me being mean to new people or anything like that. Do you have a lot of people at your house? That would be so cool if I got to hang out with your friends all the time. Or maybe you can take me with you when you go places? I don't exactly like being left at home all the time...I might get bored, kind of like I mentioned before.

You can use these elements to make fun and colorful decorations such as a basket of colored eggs, a wreath made of eggs, or a centerpiece made in the shape of a bunny. Finally, Easter is associated with sweet treats, specifically candy. A lovely Easter idea would be to have a sweet and dessert table. Include pastel-colored candies prominently.

They will be replaced by a crew of equally well-trained kangaroos. As a breed, kangaroos are known for their strength, having been trained to box for many years in Australia. This aptitude adapts well to the hand-to-hand combat training cadets receive in the police academy. Their speed is comparable to that of our canine officers, thanks to their ability to leap great distances. Kangaroos have to wear a minimum of gear, using the storage naturally available within their pouches. And many kangaroos have an imposing size, with some breeds exceeding 7 feet in height. The inaugural unit of kangaroos, the KangaRegiment, has been trained to the same high standards of performance as the department's retiring K-9 officers. Each Rooficer (as these kangaroo officers are nicknamed) was individually selected from hundreds of applications from well-qualified Rooficer candidates. To be offered the position, the candidate had to measure between 7 and 8.5 feet in stature to present an intimidating physical presence. They had to outperform other candidates in distance leaping. And they had to show prowess inside the boxing ring. We request that citizens respect these new police officers in the same way you did our K-9s: do not approach them or their human partner officer in a menacing way, and do not try to pet them without asking their human partner officer first. Remember, these are service kangaroos, and when you see them with their partner out in the field, they are on the job, protecting the citizens of Macadamia County.

Muffins With Goat Cheese and Chives Ingredients Servings: 12 (makes about 12 muffins) 1/3 cup (80 milliliters) mild-tasting olive oil, plus more for brushing the pan Generous 1 1/2 cups (200 grams) whole-wheat pastry flour (may substitute with white whole-wheat flour, or a generous 3/4 cups/100 grams of each all-purpose flour and whole-wheat flour) 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon fine salt 2/3 cup (180 milliliters) whole or reduced-fat milk (may substitute with plant-based milk) 1/2 cup (113 grams) plain Greek yogurt 1 large egg 1 teaspoon honey 4 ounces (115 grams) fresh goat cheese (chevre), crumbled 1/2 cup (22 grams) finely chopped fresh chives 1/2 cup (22 grams) finely chopped fresh chives Directions Active: 25 mins Total: 50 mins Step 1 Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees. Brush a nonstick muffin tin with olive oil. Step 2 In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, onion powder, baking soda, pepper and salt until combined. Step 3 In a large bowl whisk together the milk, yogurt, oil, egg and honey. Add the flour mixture to the milk mixture and stir until just combined. Stir in the goat cheese and chives until just combined. Step 4 Using a 1/4-cup (60-milliliter) measure, divide the batter among the muffin tin cups; each should be filled about three-quarters of the way. Step 5 Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Step 6 Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes, then run a small offset spatula or butter knife around the perimeter of each muffin before removing them from the tin. Serve warm.","completion":"This is a fresh take on muffins with some unexpected savory ingredients - goat cheese and chives. For this recipe, you will need to set your oven to 375 degrees and position the rack in the middle. A nonstick muffin tin is recommended, but brush the tin with mild-tasting olive oil just to be safe. The first step is to combine the dry ingredients in a medium size bowl. Start with one-and-a-half cups of whole-wheat pastry flour, one-half cups, at pastry flour. If you don't have it in your pantry, you can use white whole-wheat flour or three-quarter cups (100 grams) of all-purpose flour and whole-wheat flour. Two teaspoons of baking powder provide the leavening in this recipe. Follow this with one-half teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and one-quarter teaspoon of fine salt. Briefly whisk the ingredients together to combine them. In a larger bowl, whisk the wet ingredients: two-thirds cup (180 milliliters of whole or reduced-fat milk or plant-based milk; one half-up (113 grams) of plain Greek yogurt, one large egg, and one teaspoon of honey. Once these ingredients are well combined, add the flour mixture. Stir the wet and dry ingredients together, but only until just combined. For the primary flavoring, gently stir in four ounces (115 grams) of fresh crumbled goat cheese, also sold as chevre and one half-cup of finely chopped fresh chives. After the batter is done, divide it equally between the muffin tin cups. Each cup should be about three-quarters full. Using a one-quarter measuring cup as a scoop is a good guide. From here, the muffins go into the preheated oven. We are looking for golden-brown muffin tops, which should take about 18 to 20 minutes. You will know the muffins are done when an inserted toothpick or cake tester comes out clean. Transfer the tin to a wire rack to add in cooling. After five to ten minutes use a butter knife or offset spatula to remove the muffins. These tasty muffins are best served warm.

There are a lot of cool facts that people don't know about the Spice Girls, which is why I'm writing this post today. Follow along with me as I take you through the history of these girl power icons. The Early Days [H2] The Spice Girls first got their start in 1994. It's wild to think that nearly 30 years have passed since then! The girls had to audition for the group, which led to the five members - Mel B, Melanie C, Emma Bunton, Geri Halliwell, and Victoria Beckham. First Steps [H3] When the Spice Girls started, they wanted to pave their own path. They signed with Virgin Records and soon put out my favorite Spice Girls track called \\"Wannabe\\" in 1996. Did you know that the Spice Girls' first album sold over 20 million copies globally? They were truly a record-breaking girl group. Spiceworld Tour [H3] By 1998, these girls were on a roll and ready to tour the world. Millions of people showed up to their shows, and hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on tickets. But sadly, Ginger Spice was ready to leave the band at this point. Later Career [H3] Despite the changes in the lineup, the Spice Girls continued to release some amazing songs, like the ever-famous \\"Goodbye\\". By the time the new millennium arrived, the Spice Girls were fizzling out, much to my chagrin. Looking Back at the Spice Girls Today [H2] In the nearly three decades that the Spice Girls have existed, they've broken a lot of female pop star boundaries! The group has sold 100 million records globally, become one of the most successful British pop groups since the Beatles, and won numerous industry awards.

Use natural tones for your eyeshadow, or omit it altogether- shadows were quite minimal for the period. Instead, opt for a soft liner on the upper lash line that blurs out into a slight wing. Finish the eyes with mascara. Blush should be placed high on the cheeks, and should never be placed lower than the tip of the nose. Go for a rose or pinky color.

Segregation was written into law; the front of a Montgomery bus was reserved for white citizens and the seats behind them for Black citizens. However, it was only by custom that bus drivers had the authority to ask a Black person to give up a seat for a white rider. There were contradictory Montgomery laws on the books: One said segregation must be enforced, but another, largely ignored, said no person (white or Black) could be asked to give up a seat even if there were no other seats on the bus available. Nonetheless, at one point on the route, a white man had no seat because all the seats in the designated “white” section were taken. So the driver told the riders in the four seats of the first row of the “colored” section to stand, in effect adding another row to the “white” section. The three others obeyed. Parks did not.","completion":"In Montgomery, there were laws about what we now call segregation. The law said black people had to sit on the back of the bus in the \\"colored\\" section, while white people could sit up at the front of the bus in the \\"white\\" section. Now, if a white rider got on the bus and it was full, the bus driver could ask a black person to give up their seat. This wasn't always true for all buses because the rules could be confusing.

Can you give me 5 ways to break the ice at the party?","completion":"No problem, here are 5 ways you can break the ice at your next party: 1. Make small talk - Strike up a conversation with someone (or a group of people) at the party, or join a conversation already in progress. Start with simple interactions, such as \\"Hi, I'm (your name), nice to meet you\\" or \\"How do you know the host (of the party)?\\" 2. Tell an anecdote - Once you have someone's attention, tell a funny or amusing story. It doesn't necessarily have to be true, but consider telling a true story that is charming and showcases your actions and behavior in a situation. This will let people know what kind of person you are and whether or not they want to continue getting to know you better. 3. Do a magic trick - Sometimes people just need a little magic in their lives. Doing a little bit of close-up magic, simple tricks that are easy to learn but have a great effect, can amaze people. Learn some tricks that use ordinary objects that you might have on your person (coins, paper money, a piece of thread) or something that would be available at a party (playing cards, drinking cups). 4. Play a game - Always sure to get a party started and encourage mixing and mingling among partygoers, playing a game can be entertaining and will give you a chance to get to know others in a fun setting. Play a physical game like Twister or Charades, card games like Poker or Hearts, or board games like Monopoly. 5. Show off some interesting pictures - People love looking at photos and getting to know what others look like in candid situations.

A flight from Dallas, Texas to Australia could take as long as 16 hours, but if you're flying from Honolulu, Hawaii the flight is shortened to 10 hours. Currently, the longest non-stop flight comes from Singapore Airlines, which has an 18-hour and 40-minute flight connecting Singapore’s Changi Airport to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. That record will be lost by the end of 2025 when Qantas Airways will debut its brand new flight, totaling a whopping 10,576 miles. The flight will travel through two time zones giving passengers the opportunity of seeing the sunrise twice.

Many people dive into raising chickens because of the rising costs of eggs, but I can assure you that you will spend more money on raising chickens than eggs. You will first need to buy a coop, waterers and feeders, chicken food (you should use about a 50-pound bag of food per week for a small flock), straw, heat lamps, and laying boxes. You must also ensure the chickens have access to fresh food and water daily.

With no other heating options, I threw my leftover Domino’s onto a cookie sheet and put them in the oven at 375F for a little while. The result was glorious.

During consecutive quarters this year, the longtime leading streaming site saw year-to-year declines in subscribers, marking the first time that had happened in 10 years. By the time the streamer reported third-quarter results, its growth was back on track, but the damage was clearly done. NetflixNFLX +1% fast-tracked its new ad-supported tier and began testing a system for banning password sharing. Those moves will be closely scrutinized in 2023, with observers keen to see whether consumers will accept major changes to the very DNA of the popular streamer. Netflix’s subscriber loss was certainly one of the biggest surprise headlines of 2022. What will be this year’s? Here are five streaming trends to watch for in 2023. Both Disney+ and Netflix recently introduced ad-supported platforms, and AmazonAMZN -3.7% is accepting ads for Thursday Night Football. How consumers receive the lower-priced, ad-supported tiers may determine whether other platforms adopt similar approaches. While some initial reports suggested Netflix didn’t meet early advertising promises, this week, CFRA raised its stock price target for the streamer based on a strong outlook for the ad-supported platform. “We think it will be difficult for competitors to catch NFLX, one of the few profitable streaming providers with global scale,” wrote CFRA analyst Kenneth Leon. The specter of the disastrous CNN+ launch will loom large in 2023. Where it once seemed the market was saturated with 800-pound gorillas like Disney+ and HBO Max, the fast folding of CNN+ and the takeaways from that will serve to keep future niche launches more limited. With people reaching a saturation point with their new subscriptions, it’s a big risk to launch something with limited appeal. Disney+ has crowed about moving ahead of Netflix in subscribers—which, granted, includes Hulu and ESPN bundles as well. But Disney+ has seen outstanding growth, including adding 12.1 million subscribers in third quarter to boost the three-way total to more than 235 million, or 12 million more than Netflix. Analysts have said they anticipate the recent launch of Disney+’s ad-supported service will push Disney+ even farther ahead in the streaming wars. ** Based on the above text, what are some key trends in the streaming industry?","completion":"Ad-supported tiers are growing in popularity among streaming providers as they leverage their global audience and scale. Furthermore, launches of niche products will slow down given the poor reception of CNN+ and as people reach a personal limit of streaming subscriptions. On the flip side, Disney+ is experiencing rampant growth and is expected to pull ahead of the competition in terms of subscriber numbers with the launch of its own ad-supported tier."},{"prompt":"I have some round steak in my freezer that needs to be cooked.

He got what he needed to take care of her through piracy – running a torrenting website that monetized illegal downloads of songs and movies. It wasn’t much, and he often thought about how lame he looked compared to the pirate crews of old. Back in the old days, pirates had their own republic and commanded massive vessels capable of going up against anyone, while he could only tackle defenseless ships and had to run before any assistance came. He didn’t have a crew to sing sea shanties with, a parrot to perch on his shoulder, and his tattered outfit certainly couldn’t compete with 17th-century fashion. As he was going to sleep one night, he thought to himself, “If I had to be a pirate, at least I could have been one of the cool ones.” The next morning, he woke up and quickly realized he was not in his home. It was dark and the world was rocking side to side around him. Was this an earthquake? No, the rocking was because he was at sea. As Amir got out of his bunk, he looked around and saw other sleeping men and women. These were his crewmates. As it turned out, he had been sent to the past and become a pirate of old!"},{"prompt":"Can you write a positive review for the 2017 live action Disney movie, “Beauty and the Beast?” A few sentences should be fine.","completion":"A real-life spin on a classic fairytale, the live-action version of “Beauty and the Beast” transforms this childhood fantasy into reality.

At the end of each day, all the animals would be paid their daily allowance by the queen of the jungle. One day, a fairy came to visit the jungle to see the queen and got lost. All the other animals in the jungle were extremely busy and couldn’t help the fairy. But the Snow saw the fairy. After watching her for a while, he approached the fairy. “Can I help you in any way?” He asked the fairy. “Yes please, I’m a fairy.” The fairy answered. “I’ve come with gifts to see the queen and I don’t know the way to her palace. Everyone else seems too busy to direct me.” She added. Upon hearing that the fairy had gifts for the queen with her, the tortoise became greedy. He began to think of ways to get some of the gifts from the fairy. So he came up with a plan to direct the fairy to a lonely place where he could snatch the gifts away from her. Snow answered the fairy and said “Well I know the way to the queen’s palace. It’s straight down the lane.” The fairy was very glad to have received help and thanked Snow. Then, the fairy left in the direction Snow gave her. Snow secretly followed her till she arrived at the deserted place. When the fairy got to the lonely land, she immediately knew that the tortoise had tricked her and that the place wasn’t safe. The fairy turned back to flee, but Snow popped up before her. The fairy was frightened and began to run. But Snow chased the fairy and caught up with her because he could run very fast. He grabbed hold of the fairy’s bag from the fairy and began to run away. Immediately, the fairy chanted a spell and pronounced a curse. “I lay on you this curse and torment, “For you robbed me with your lies and speed, “On the animal that holds my purse this moment, “You and every animal of your type, “Shall be slower than anything that ever lived.” Immediately after the fairy was done speaking, her bag began to swell bigger and bigger till it burst upon the tortoise's shoulders.

She used her magic to help others, and she always remembered the lessons she learned from the magical book."},{"prompt":"When was the first battery invented and what was it called? How did it create power?","completion":"The first battery was invented in 1800 by Volta. It stored and released a charge by chemical reaction instead of physically storing it. It was known as the voltaic pile. It was comprised of pairs of copper and zinc discs put on top of one another and separated with cloth or cardboard dunked in brine. The voltaic pile produced electricity and a stable current and did not lose much of a charge when not being used. Volta's early models could not produce sparks. After experimenting with different metals it was found that zinc and silver gave the best results."},{"prompt":"What are the series of landmark rulings made by the Warren Court? Read the text below to answer your question. At the culmination of a legal strategy pursued by African Americans, in 1954 the Supreme Court struck down many of the laws that had allowed racial segregation and discrimination to be legal in the United States as unconstitutional.[3][4][5][6] The Warren Court made a series of landmark rulings against racist discrimination, including the separate but equal doctrine, such as Brown v. Board of Education (1954), Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States (1964), and Loving v. Virginia (1967) which banned segregation in public schools and public accommodations, and struck down all state laws banning interracial marriage.[7][8][9] The rulings played a crucial role in bringing an end to the segregationist Jim Crow laws prevalent in the Southern states.[10] In the 1960s, moderates in the movement worked with the United States Congress to achieve the passage of several significant pieces of federal legislation that authorized oversight and enforcement of civil rights laws. The Civil Rights Act of 1964[11] explicitly banned all discrimination based on race, including racial segregation in schools, businesses, and in public accommodations.[12] The Voting Rights Act of 1965 restored and protected voting rights by authorizing federal oversight of registration and elections in areas with historic under-representation of minority voters. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.","completion":"The series of landmark rulings that the Warren Court made were Brown v.

What are some high-calorie foods that are cheap? I live in the USA, so I have access to most foods.","completion":"Here are five cheap foods in the USA that are high in calories. It's important to note that costs will differ based on location! 1. Canola Oil You wouldn't eat canola oil alone, but that's why it's great for weight gain. You can easily add it to other meals and boost your calorie intake with little effort. With 240 calories in 2 tbsp of canola oil, it certainly packs a punch. Canola oil is comparatively really cheap, also. You can usually buy a gallon for around 10. Canola oil is pretty versatile as well in terms of how you can get it into your diet. You can drizzle it on salads, fry things, or baste your meat with it. There is no shortage of ways to easily add calories when you use canola oil. 2. Potatoes Potatoes are perfect for gaining weight. High in carbs, high in calories, found everywhere, and pretty cheap, too. There are many ways to cook potatoes and have them as the main ingredient or the side of a dish. In terms of calories per dollar, potatoes are very competitive, with a pound of potatoes costing around 1. Not as cheap as canola oil, but potatoes are also far easier to have a lot of, especially when butter is added. Potatoes can be added to so many dishes. Making up a bulk of mashed potatoes and eating them as a snack is pretty easy. They can be boiled, mashed, baked, stewed, or fried when cooking. 3. White Rice White rice has been a high-calorie food used worldwide for a long time. Rice can be found everywhere. It's extremely cheap, and best of all, it can be the base of so many great-tasting dishes or even just added as a side to many others. Rice has a staggering 2,860 calories per roughly 1 when you buy in bulk, which is a great price. Rice can be used as the base of curries, added to soups and stews, go in tacos, burritos, and so much more. Rice is easy to cook and can be stored in the fridge for leftovers. 4. Pancake Batter Why not start your day with a high-calorie-dense breakfast that leaves you wanting to eat more throughout the day? Pancake batter is delicious, cheap, and high in calories. A 2lb box of pancake mix will cost somewhere around 2 and give you over 2,000 calories on its own, but when you add butter, milk, and syrup, you'll get an even higher calorie content. You can also use pancake batter to make other things, such as muffins. 5. Whole Chicken Whole chickens are incredible for calories and are usually in every major grocery store for bargain prices. These usually come pre-cooked, too, meaning you won't have to worry. You can buy a whole chicken cooked for 4.99 at Costco. That chicken should provide you with over 3,250 calories. That equals 650 calories a dollar. Chicken isn't the best on the list for calories per dollar but it's probably the best for versatility and ease of cooking. Consider trying a rice meal with chicken to get an easy high, calorie meal."},{"prompt":"Which sport does this description go with - tennis, pickleball, or racquetball?

This story is about Treebranch who is a white stallion with a long and sharp horn on his forehead. He feels jealous of other horses who have beautiful names and don't have to be defined by their physical appearance. One day, he gets lost in a forest during a storm and meets a group of unicorns who appreciate him beyond his horn. They give him a new name, Hailstone, which he finds dashing and fitting. Hailstone decides to stay with the unicorns, where he feels accepted for who he is. He spends the rest of his life happily among them.","completion":"Treebranch was a stallion of brilliant white, so he always hoped his peers would name him something like pearl, ivory, or moonstone. He would have settled for snow, snowstorm, or even blizzard! But the first thing the other horses ever saw witnessed was this sharp and long horn that protruded from his forehead. It was like the branch of a tree, and from then, on he was known as Treebranch. He couldn’t help but be jealous of the other horses, especially those gifted with beautiful names like Thunderclap, whose hooves beat on the ground like the drum of thunder when he dashed across the plains – or Nightfall, whose sable coat glistened like stars under the sunlight. How could Treebranch ever compare? Especially when his horn was all any other horse could see. One day while the herd was moving across the grassy plains, a terrible storm began, with clouds so dark that it hid the sun. Torrents of rain and deafening winds caused mayhem, and Treebranch found himself separated from the others. The storm had subsided. He tried to make his way back to them. However, he found himself lost in a forest instead. That’s when he stumbled upon another band of horses, and the first thing he noticed was the long horns that grew out from their forehead! “Oh, a fellow unicorn,” one of them said as means of greeting. “What is your name?” “The other horses call me Treebranch,” he replied. “That’s far too unfitting a name for such a beautiful unicorn.” “They call me so because they cannot see beyond my horn.” “Then you must live with those of us who do,” the unicorn said. “Live with us, and we shall know you as the white unicorn that came to us from the storm, and henceforth call you Hailstone.” Hailstone, what a dashing name! If he had remained with the horses, they would never have seen beyond his horn. But with the unicorns, Hailstone felt he was finally being seen for his other qualities, and he spent the rest of his life happily amongst the unicorns."},{"prompt":"Why do people sell pictures of their feet?","completion":"Selling feet pictures has become a popular source of income for many people. Pictures of feet are appealing because they can be used for advertising foot care products, shoes, and nail polish, and for people who have an interest in feet or have a foot fetish."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this Amazon review of Amazon-branded strawberry flavor cereal bars as if the customer loved it. I got the strawberry. They are not as soft as the name brand ones which is what I like about these types of bars. Just a bit less soft. The strawberry filling is really sweet and this is coming from someone who is addicted to sugar and has to have lots of soda everyday. It's a bit much, but I'll still eat them, just not as much as I would with the brand name because those are so good. Cheap and ok.","completion":"I went with the strawberry flavor when I made my order. These are SO MUCH better than the name-brand cereal bars. They aren't too doughy or cakey but have a firmness to them, which is what I like. If you've got an insane sweet tooth like me, the strawberry filling is gonna have the perfect amount of sweetness.

Give me a simple answer most elementary school children would be able to comprehend. Incorporate a cooking analogy for photosynthesis.","completion":"Most plants are green because they make their own food. When we make food we call it cooking or baking, but when plants make food it's called photosynthesis. They keep an important ingredient they need for photosynthesis inside them. This ingredient is called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll mixes with sunlight to make food for the plant. Sunlight looks white to us, but has all the colors of the rainbow in it. Plants don't use the color green from sunlight when they make food. Since the color green doesn't mix with the chlorophyll during photosynthesis, green is the color we can see."},{"prompt":"How do AI chatbots actually understand what people type?","completion":"Indeed, what is understanding?

The artist has skillfully utilized a combination of form, texture, and color to create a captivating work that is both visually striking and emotionally evocative. The sweeping lines and bold strokes create a sense of movement and energy that is almost palpable as if the artist was attempting to capture a moment in time. The use of negative space is particularly effective, creating a sense of depth and complexity that draws the viewer in and encourages them to explore the work in greater detail. The subtle interplay of light and shadow adds a layer of nuance and depth to the work, creating a sense of mystery and intrigue that is both captivating and thought-provoking. The artist's use of color is also particularly effective, with a vibrant and dynamic palette that is both bold and harmonious. The overall effect is a work that is both emotionally resonant and intellectually stimulating, a powerful example of the power of abstract art to evoke emotion and inspire contemplation.

I could feel her fear and sorrow through our connection. I didn't know exactly where she was, but I knew how to find her. Now that my body had healed from fighting the thousand arms, I was ready. I grabbed the invitation card and looked at the address. It was a fancy hotel run by the Akatsuki Group. On the outside, they were a powerhouse with hotels, restaurants, and other businesses. They were big shots. However, their real identity was the thousand arms, a black market group that dealt in the occult. They sought the greatest powers out there. When evening came around, I dressed and went to the hotel. I slid the invitation to the woman at the front desk. \\"I'm here for this event,\\" I said, my voice level. The woman looked at me carefully, then smiled. \\"Certainly, sir. I'll guide you.\\" The woman used a key and entered the code for a basement floor. I was led to a lavish waiting room, but it wasn't for VIPs. It was for the fighters. I did stretches in the room while I waited, and I received a visitor. It was a person in a red cloak, one of the thousand arms directly under the boss, I figured. Beneath his robes, he had hundreds of black arm-like appendages. \\"Touji-sama, I'm glad you came.

Can you suggest some of the best mountains for first-time climbers to try?","completion":"1. Helvellyn, England - this is a mountain peak that beginners can easily climb in one day. Helvellyn may be accessed from the Ullswater villages of Patterdale and Glenridding. It is the third-highest peak in England and offers a unique climbing experience where expert or novice climbers can proudly reach the summit and make it back to the pub in time for a pint to celebrate. The ideal trekking season for this mountain is from spring to autumn, and climbers should be aware of the changing weather conditions throughout the year. 2. Hochschwab, Austria - The mountains of Northern Styria are filled with alpine huts that facilitate multi-day hikes, giving you a welcoming overnight stay as you climb to the top. The lodge that stands near the cliff face of this mountain was originally constructed in 1884 and offers an impressive panoramic view from its outdoor decks. The ideal trekking season for this mountain is from spring to autumn, with ski touring in the winter. 3. Emel Shan, China - This mountain climbing experience is often described as a spiritual one. A pilgrimage to the summit of this mountain is said to forgive all sins. The Emel Shan is the highest of China's Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains, and there are roughly 300,000 transgressors who make the journey to the summit every year. Staying true to the Zen mindset helps climbers deal with the never-ending stone steps and the suffocating crowds. The ideal trekking season for this climb is all year, but it is recommended to avoid any public holidays if you want to avoid crowds. 4. Mount Temple, Canada - Be sure to pack a high-quality camera when you go on this climb because this trek up one of the Canadian Rockies will take you to one of the most photogenic peaks in the world. The staggering views from the top turn the spectacular glaciers, mountains, and rugged terrain below into an amazing view of raw geography. The ideal time to climb this mountain is between July and August after the snow has melted. Keep in mind the rockfall from above and consider taking a helmet with you. 5. Mount Anne, Australia - With wild rivers, beautiful terrain, and perhaps even a wild animal or two, Mount Anne, located in Tasmania's Southwest National Park, looms above as the area's most prominent peak. Brave beginners can often take on the entire climb in a day, while others may prefer to take their time and camp out overnight. The best time to climb Mount Anne is between November and May. This is when the area has the best weather for climbing. 6. Snowdon, Wales If you are looking for a mountain climbing experience that the entire family can enjoy, Snowdon Mountain in Wales is excellent for climbing with kids. The mountain is associated with the legends of King Arthur, the fabled king is said to have killed a fearsome giant who once lived on the mountain and is reputedly still buried at the summit. While it is possible to trek Snowden Mountain throughout the year, the railway closes down during the winter. 7. Alvand Kuh, Iran - Ideal for cultural exchange, the mountain of Alvand Kuh is a good choice for beginners. It is one of the most popular peaks in western Iran for climbing or hiking and for good reason. The trek to the top may be completed in one day, but it can be fun to stay overnight with the locals at one of the mountain shelters along the way. The best time to trek this mountain is between spring and fall. If you have concerns about losing your way, it is a good idea to climb during the weekend so that you will be around other local hikers who will help you find your way to the top."},{"prompt":"Where was Ozzie Smith, the baseball player, born?","completion":"Ozzie Smith (Osborne Earl Smith) was born in Mobile, Alabama on December 26, 1954.

Now consider what your reflex response is - physically emotionally or mentally. There is no need to fix or plan or explain or work around what you're feeling. What is important during this time is visualization and noticing what comes up when you pay attention. Now ask yourself \\"What do I need to do today?

Assume astronauts have email up there, because I'm not sure if they do. They have found ghosts on the moon. Tone should be concerned and mildly panicked.","completion":"Dear NASA, Please read this message and treat it as urgent, as the situation demands immediate attention. During our routine lunar mission, we encountered a phenomenon beyond our wildest imaginations. Unbelievably, we have found evidence suggesting the presence of ghosts on the moon. Yes, you read that correctly—ghosts! While it might sound like a work of science fiction or like we're possibly imagining things and have gone delusional due to lack of gravity, I promise you lots of us have seen this firsthand up here and we are deeply concerned (and maybe just a little bit panicked). The situation started with unexplained noises echoing during our moonwalks. We thought they were technical glitches with our spacesuits, but we could never find a source. Then several of our crew members reported seeing ethereal figures drifting silently among the craters. They kind of appear and disappear without warning, which can be very startling when one materializes nearby. Despite the extensive training we've undergone, it most definitely did not cover this, and it's taking a huge mental toll on us. Many of us up here just want to go home now. So our question is: how do we proceed? We think more people need to come up here and investigate the matter as to be honest, it requires extensive research and specialty that, as I said, wasn't really covered in our training. More to the point, I don't think the astronauts currently up here are equipped to deal with ghosts. I'm also worried that if they're on the moon, they might be present on Earth too, but I guess that's something to think about for when I'm back home and not right now...

Let's talk about the economy - As someone who never worked a day in her life, I know exactly what it takes to create jobs and stimulate growth. We need to cut taxes for the wealthy and give them more incentives to invest in this country. As President, I would focus on the things that really matter to Americans like making sure rich people have the best quality healthcare, creating more jobs by having more servants and boosting the economy by selling more vodka and shoes. Let's also talk about foreign policy. As someone who has traveled the world and rubbed elbows with the most powerful people on the planet, I know how to negotiate with foreign leaders. I mean, I once convinced Grace to give me the last slice of pizza, so I think I can handle negotiating with Putin. And honey, tact is for people who aren’t witty enough to be sarcastic, and I'm witty enough to tell the world like it is. Finally, let's talk about the most important issue facing our country - fashion. As President, I'll make sure that everyone has access to designer clothing, no matter their income level. If I have to look at you, you better look good. If you're caught wearing Crocs in public, you'll be fined. It's time to take our fashion seriously. Pradas are not just shoes, and vodka is not just a morning beverage. In conclusion, I would bring a bit of fun and glamour back to the White House.

Please only summarize the text under this line: Northern North America is occupied by Canada, the second-largest country in the world, the US state of Alaska, and the Danish self-governing territory of Greenland. Much of Greenland is covered by ice, and all these regions are sparsely populated, although there are several large cities in Canada. These are mainly in the south of the country and on the Pacific coast near the stunning Rocky Mountains. Huge oil and mineral reserves have brought wealth to both Canada and Alaska. Alaska was part of Russia until 1867, when it was sold to the US for 7.2 million. Most Americans thought this was a huge waste of money until gold was discovered there in 1896, attracting many people hoping to make their fortune. The discovery of oil in the Arctic Ocean in 1968 brought great wealth to the state, and tourism is also a major source of income. The First Nations and the Inuit peoples lived in Canada long before Europeans began settling there in the 17th century. They number about 900,000 people, or 4 percent of the population, and have kept many of their traditional customs and traditions. In 1999, the self-governing Inuit homeland of Nunavut was created in northern Canada. Greenland is the world’s largest island, but has a population of less than 60,000 because its climate is so harsh and cold.

The title should be The Three Alcoholics and promote how Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) can help with addiction. Make it for adults, obviously.","completion":"Once upon a time, there were three alcoholics, Joe, Sue, and Luis. Life was hard for these three as they couldn’t seem to do anything to quit drinking. They each decided that they would take a different tactic and see which one would work. The first alcoholic, Joe, chose to remove all alcohol from his life. He took everything out of the house, refused to go to bars, and avoided liquor stores at all costs. For the first few days, it worked. He didn’t drink anything because nothing was available. But then, just one Saturday later, he was at a work event where there was an open bar, and he caved and had a drink. And then several more. The second alcoholic, Sue, tried a different path. She decided that she would read a book about quitting addictions. The book came highly recommended, and apparently, after reading the book, she wouldn’t even want to pick up a drink. Unfortunately, the book didn’t work at all. She drank the whole time she was reading it. The third alcoholic, Luis, chose to join a local Alcoholics Anonymous chapter. He started going to meetings several times a week and even got a sponsor who he could call night and day when he was tempted to drink. To Luis’s surprise, it was actually working. Although he still wanted a drink, he didn’t do it because of his incredible support system. When the three met up again, Luis told them what he had found at AA after they reported their failed tactics. And Luis, Sue, and Joe all headed to a meeting together."},{"prompt":"Write a graduation speech to be given by the guest speaker, Pluto the disgruntled former planet.","completion":"Good afternoon, graduates, faculty, and distinguished guests. I am Pluto, the dwarf planet formerly known as the 9th planet. I am honored to be here today as your guest speaker and to share with you a lesson that I have learned over my long and eventful life. I want to congratulate every one of you for accomplishing this life-changing milestone. Graduating from college is an undertaking that requires years of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. You should all be proud of and celebrate all you have achieved. As you may know, in 2006, the IAU decided to reclassify me as a dwarf planet. Honestly, this decision was an affront to my ego and attacked the core of my sense of identity. I always considered myself a full planet and was a proud member of the planetary community. Being the 9th planet of the solar system was important to my identity. To be kicked out of that community was a devastating blow that has taken years to recover from. I share this because this struggle has taught me a lesson that I would like to focus on today. As a planet, I have seen many changes in the universe over the years. I have watched the birth and death of stars, and galaxies collide. The one thing that has remained constant is change. At times it seems as though we cannot survive all of the chaos and it rocks us to our core. But here is where I urge you to remember this lesson. Sometimes, even oftentimes, the world will not see you as you see yourself. You may face hurdles that challenge your very sense of self-worth and identity. But it is not up to the universe, or scientists, to define who you are. It is up to you to define who you are and what you stand for. Just because someone tells you that you are not a full planet does not mean that you are any less important or valuable. You have the power to define your own identity, and to make a difference in the world. In closing, I want to congratulate you on your graduation and wish you all the best as you embark on the next phase of your journey. And remember, even if the world does not always see us as we see ourselves, we are still important and valuable. Thank you."},{"prompt":"I want to change my life.

She lost her job, she was dumped by her boyfriend, and she lost her only vehicle - a reliable Toyota SUV - to an unexpected collision on a busy highway. Now, Samantha looked forward to cleaning her slate and starting the new year off on the right foot. As Samantha fought through her tears while reminiscing about the tough year she had, she booked her flight to Costa Rica online, and she also reserved her place in the yoga retreat for the day after she arrived in the country. She had packed her bags and went to the airport, going through the security screening and taking three hours before finally getting to relax in her seat on the plane. She looked at the screen on the headrest in front of her and saw the flight time: 7 hours, 14 minutes. 7 hours, 14 minutes. She kept thinking about how it would only be a little over 7 hours before she would be relaxing in the sun and enjoying a stress-free vacation in Costa Rica. 7 hours, 14 minutes. The plane took off. Then, it dawned on her. A flight to Costa Rica shouldn't take 7 hours and 14 minutes. Furthermore, a flight to Costa Rica shouldn't be traveling south from her location. It was then that Samantha realized she was on the wrong flight, and she was traveling to Puerto Rico. Her mind flashed back to the night she booked the flight online, attempting to click her flight option with tears in her eyes. She had mistaken Puerto Rico for Costa Rica, and now she was on a non-stop, 7-hour, 14-minute flight to the wrong location.

I forgot to bring my spear (Yeah, yeah, I know, daydreamer me), so I crouched behind a boulder and listened for a few minutes. The sound was pretty close. I finally crept toward where it was coming from, and what do you think I saw? A big hole in the ground where a giant fir tree had been yanked right out. I’m sure it happened during that wild windstorm last week. I peeked over the edge, and there was a dire wolf cub. The poor thing was stuck.

Line them up from the shortest sentence to the longest to make it look neat. About the Species Blue whales are the largest animals ever to live on our planet. They feed almost exclusively on krill, straining huge volumes of ocean water through their baleen plates (which hang from the roof of the mouth and work like a sieve). Some of the biggest individuals may eat up to 6 tons of krill a day. Blue whales are found in all oceans except the Arctic Ocean. There are five currently recognized subspecies of blue whales. The number of blue whales today is only a small fraction of what it was before modern commercial whaling significantly reduced their numbers during the early 1900s, but populations are increasing globally. The primary threats blue whales currently face are vessel strikes and entanglements in fishing gear. NOAA Fisheries and its partners are dedicated to conserving and rebuilding blue whale populations worldwide. We use a variety of innovative techniques to study, protect, and rescue these endangered animals. We engage our partners as we develop regulations and management plans that foster healthy fisheries and reduce the risk of entanglements, create whale-safe shipping practices, and reduce ocean noise. Population Status Blue whales were significantly depleted by commercial whaling activities worldwide. Today, blue whales are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The latest stock assessment reports of blue whales include data for various stocks, including areas of the North Pacific and western North Atlantic Oceans. Appearance Blue whales have a long body and generally slender shape. Their mottled blue-gray color appears light blue under water—hence their name, the blue whale. The mottling pattern is variable and can be used to identify individuals. Antarctic blue whales are generally larger than other blue whale subspecies. For example, in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, blue whales can grow up to about 90 feet and are over 100,000 pounds, but in the Antarctic, they can reach up to about 110 feet and weigh more than 330,000 pounds. Like many other baleen whales, female blue whales are generally larger than males. Behavior and Diet Blue whales sometimes swim in small groups but are more often found alone or in pairs. They generally spend summers feeding in polar waters and undertake lengthy migrations towards the equatorial waters as winter arrives. Blue whales typically swim at about 5 miles an hour while they are feeding and traveling, but can accelerate to more than 20 miles an hour for short bursts. They are among the loudest animals on the planet, emitting a series of pulses, groans, and moans, and it is thought that in the right oceanographic conditions, sounds emitted by blue whales can be heard by other whales up to 1,000 miles away. Scientists think they use these vocalizations to communicate and—along with their excellent hearing—perhaps to sonar-navigate the dark ocean depths. The primary diet of blue whales is krill—tiny shrimp-like animals, but fish and copepods (tiny crustaceans) may occasionally be part of the blue whale’s diet. When blue whales hunt for food, they filter feed by swimming toward large schools of krill with their mouth open and closing their mouths around the krill while inflating their throat pleats. Once closed, blue whales then push the trapped water out of their mouth with their tongue and use their baleen plates to keep the krill trapped inside. Where They Live Blue whales are found in all oceans except the Arctic. They generally migrate seasonally between summer feeding grounds and winter breeding grounds, but some evidence suggests that individuals in certain areas might not migrate at all. Information about distribution and movement varies with location, and migratory routes are not well known. In general, distribution is driven largely by food availability—they occur in waters where krill are concentrated. In the North Atlantic Ocean, their range extends from the subtropics to the Greenland Sea. Blue whales have been sighted in the waters off eastern Canada and in the shelf waters of the eastern United States. Along the West Coast of the United States, eastern North Pacific blue whales are believed to spend winters off of Mexico and Central America. They likely feed during summer off the U.S. West Coast and, to a lesser extent, in the Gulf of Alaska and central North Pacific waters. Blue whales with young calves are regularly observed in the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez) from December through March. It is believed that this area is an important calving and nursing area for the species. In the northern Indian Ocean, there is a \\"resident\\" population. Blue whale sightings, strandings, and acoustic detections have been reported from the Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea, and across the Bay of Bengal. The migratory movements of these whales are largely unknown but may be driven by oceanographic changes associated with monsoons. In the Southern Hemisphere, Antarctic blue whales occur mainly in relatively high latitude waters south of the \\"Antarctic Convergence\\" and close to the ice edge in summer. They generally migrate to middle and low latitudes in winter, although not all whales migrate each year. Pygmy blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda)—a subspecies—are typically distributed north of the Antarctic Convergence and are most abundant in waters off Australia, Madagascar, and New Zealand. An unnamed subspecies of blue whale is found in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, particularly in the Chiloense Ecoregion, and migrates to lower latitude areas, including the Galapagos Islands and the eastern tropical Pacific. Lifespan & Reproduction Blue whales’ average lifespan is estimated at around 80 to 90 years. Scientists can estimate the age of whales by counting the layers of wax-like earplugs collected from deceased animals. Scientists know little about the life history of the blue whale. The best available science suggests the gestation period is approximately 10 to 12 months. Weaning probably occurs at around 6 to 7 months on, or en route to, summer feeding areas. The age of sexual maturity is thought to be 5 to 15 years. Most reproductive activity, including births and mating, takes place during the winter. The average calving interval is probably 2 to 3 years. Threats Vessel Strikes Vessel strikes can injure or kill blue whales. Vessel strikes have killed blue whales throughout their range, but the risk is much higher in some coastal areas with heavy vessel traffic, like ports and in shipping lanes, and from larger vessels and vessels traveling at high speeds. Entanglement in Fishing Gear Blue whales can become entangled in fishing gear, either swimming off with the gear attached or becoming anchored. Blue whales can become entangled in many different gear types, including traps, pots, and nets. Once entangled, whales may drag the attached gear for long distances, ultimately resulting in fatigue, compromised feeding ability, or severe injury, which may lead to reduced reproductive success and death. Additional Threats Additional possible threats to blue whales that are less understood include ocean noise, habitat degradation, pollution, vessel disturbance, and climate change.","completion":"- Blue whales are the largest animals on the planet. - A blue whale may eat up to 6 tons of krill in one day. - The only ocean where we cannot find blue whales is the Arctic. - Blue whales usually live alone or in pairs but sometimes live in small groups. - The diet of a blue whale consists mainly of krill, which they hunt by finding schools."},{"prompt":"I went from having a large gap in my college schedule where I could go back to my apartment and have lunch to having all my classes back to back.

Even if you aren't an artist, drawing pictures of how you see the book's events will help you remember them more. You can draw basic stick figures fighting each other, or a complex painting of the most crucial moment in the book. Either way, you should make pictures to document the book visually. 2) Watch YouTube videos. There are plenty of literature channels out there. Search for your book on YouTube and find videos explaining it. These videos will visualize the events for you. 3) Make flashcards. Flashcards are physical objects you can study with. By writing key moments on the flashcards, you're giving them more structure. Books have lots of words in them, but if you narrow them down to a few on the back of a flashcard, it'll make the workload lighter."},{"prompt":"Rewrite the first section of this song by making it about a baked potato you want to eat.

I want these recommendations to give writers ideas of concrete steps to take when they're struggling with writers block, not too many abstract ideas. The target audience is people who are writing fiction novels rather than shorter projects or nonfiction works.","completion":"Sure, I can help with that. Here are some things to do when you're struggling with writer's block: 1. Take a walk. Sometimes, getting your blood flowing and your heart pumping can serve to awaken new creative impulses in the brain. Bring a smartphone or notepad on your walk so you can jot down any ideas that come to mind while you're on the go. You may find it helpful to listen to music as you walk or do some pointed people-watching for inspiration. 2. Re-read your work. Sometimes, writer's block can be a symptom of feeling exhausted and discouraged. Writing a novel is a long and difficult undertaking, so while you're in the messy middle and yet to reap any of the rewards that come with a finished product, you may need to go back and re-read some of your earlier work to remind yourself how far you've come, feel proud of your progress, and get a better feel for the established pacing of your story. 3. Focus on outlines and planning. Writer's block isn't always a sign of creative burnout. Sometimes it's difficult to write what comes next because you don't really know where your story is going. You can use your time to focus on making a detailed outline that functions as a map, telling you exactly where to go next in your book. Alternatively, you could focus on drafting character or place names, fleshing out character profiles, solidifying worldbuilding elements, or any other practical logistics that need to be in place to make the world of your story feel real to readers. 4. Read a book by another author. There are two strategies you could take here. First, you could opt to read something by an author whose work inspires you to grow as an author, perhaps an author who does an exemplary job with some of your favorite aspects of fiction writing. On the flip side, though, great authors can sometimes serve to intimidate or discourage authors who are working on rough drafts, so you might prefer instead of pick up a book that is noticeably flawed. Reading a \\"bad\\" book can sometimes inspire writers by giving them confidence in their own abilities and demonstrating that perfectionism is not necessarily the key to getting published. 5. Talk to other writers. Writer's block happens to the best of us, and sometimes it can be helpful just to voice your concerns and frustrations out loud to someone who understands what you're struggling with. Other writers may also have suggestions that can help get you unstuck in your creative process. 6. Skip ahead to an exciting scene. If you're feeling stuck where you are, then go ahead and skip ahead to an upcoming scene that you're more excited about writing. Often, doing so will help to make it easier to fill in the blanks between what you've already written and the future scene you're excited about because when the future scene is fully fleshed out, it will be easier to determine what needs to happen in the plot to connect point A to point B. 7. Focus on editing. Sometimes it's hard to know where your story is going next because the earlier plot points you've written have backed you into a corner. Or, alternatively, maybe the parts of the story you've already written have left you with too many options for paths leading forward, an overabundance of Chekhov's guns and red herrings, too many characters, or an overly complicated story arc. It may be helpful to backtrack and edit the beginning of the story so that you can see a simpler trail leading from beginning to end."},{"prompt":"Generate a list of automated email messages that can be sent while I am out of my office on sabbatical until October 2023.

Use this text: The cycling of MNPs through the environment provides a multitude of opportunities for these particles to enter the human food chain (Fig. 1). For instance, MNP transport from wastewater effluent and biosolids to human food sources, the leaching of MNPs from food packaging, drinking water, aerosol intake and trophic transfer [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. While the dominant MNP intake pathways for humans remain undetermined, ingested food containing MNPs originating from food processing and packaging has recently been identified as a major intake pathway [[9], [10], [11]]. Evidence of MNP trophic transfer exists in aquatic organisms, particularly for smaller particles, although most MNPs likely pass through the digestive tract without further interaction [[15], [16], [17]]. MNP hotspots (i.e., local areas in an environment with particularly elevated MNP concentrations) which are co-located with nutrient- and biodiversity-rich areas, may cause considerable damage to marine ecosystems, and thus fish stocks [18,19]. MNP ingestion can lead to the transfer of toxic substances, such as plastic additives [19]. This may cause bioaccumulation of these substances in organisms which are later consumed by humans, potentially causing a food safety risk. Besides, MNP ingestion by organisms can lead to limited nutrient intake, cellular stress, inflammation, dysbiosis and reduced reproductive capability [[19], [20], [21], [22]]. This may impact the resilience and productivity of exposed ecological and agricultural systems posing a risk beyond food safety, affecting food security. The lack of research on MNPs ingestion and its effects on livestock and crops hinders the assessment of associated risks. However, the potential of plastisphere communities (i.e., microbial communities attached to plastic particles) to transport antibiotic resistance genes into agricultural soil is confirmed [23,24].

In calling for state funds to pay for private school tuition, whether through vouchers or tax credits, Gov. Kevin Stitt has usually mentioned children in low-income families as the target of his school choice push. Students in south Oklahoma City and north Tulsa are “trapped” in low-performing public schools, Stitt said, describing a single mother struggling to keep her son out of a local gang, or a paycheck-to-paycheck family unable to afford tutoring for a child struggling to read. “The rich folks already have school choice, they already have options,” said Stitt, who believes that the same choice should exist for families struggling to get by. But as the state Legislature considers a bill that would give refundable tax credits to parents with children in private schools, the governor and leaders in the House prefer a plan available to all Oklahomans, regardless of income. Allowing affluent families to have part of their private school tuition covered with state funds represents a shift within the school choice effort that had previously built its campaign around helping low-income families. Most states with some form of private school vouchers or tax credits, including Oklahoma, limit its use for students with special needs or living in poverty. Now some Republican-led states are pushing for “universal” voucher systems that would be open to all families, including those already paying for private school education. “This isn’t for low-income folks, at least not based on the proposal that’s being presented,” said Sen. Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City.","completion":"A universal voucher system would allow more low-income Oklahoma families to choose to educate their children outside of public schools.

I'm not very good at baking and I want them to be portioned per guest.","completion":"There are plenty of individual desserts you can make for guests without baking. Here are some ideas: 1. Individual Strawberry Trifles. This dessert consists of sponge cake, fruit, and custard layered in that order and displayed in a tall glass or dish. You can use a premade sponge or pound cake for an easy, bake-free dessert! This is a very versatile dessert because flavors can be mixed and matched in any way. They are perfect for entertaining because they can be scaled up or down. You can mix up the presentation by assembling this dessert in small highball glasses or mason jars, which are perfect for exact portioning. 2. No-Bake Peanut Butter Bars. These bars can be made with most ingredients you'd already find in your pantry. Salted butter, peanut butter, powdered sugar, vanilla wafers, and semi-sweet chocolate come together to make these decadent bars that guests will be sure to love. These bars only need to be cooled in the fridge for 1 hour before they can be cut into individual bars for portioned servings. If peanut allergies are a concern, some great alternatives are seed butter or other kinds of nut butter. The flavors will be similar. 3. Individual Key Lime Pies. Made with lime custard, graham cracker crust, and whipped cream, these will be sure to please your guests. In small individual serving dishes, flatten the graham cracker crust in the bottom, top with the key lime custard, and finish it with the whipped cream. Chill in the fridge until dessert is ready to be served. 4. Rice Krispie Treats. This is a classic dessert that will remind guests of their childhood. Marshmallow and rice krispie cereal mix together to form this all-original favorite. Combine the ingredients with salt and vanilla extract and form the mixture in a pan while hot. Let it sit at room temperature before cutting the rice krispie treats into individual squares. Separate the squares with wax paper so they do not stick together and are easy for guests to grab. 5. No-Bake Chocolate Oatmeal Cookies. A No-Bake interpretation of the classic chocolate chip oatmeal cookie. These cookies are made with brown sugar, cocoa powder, unsalted butter, almond butter, rolled oats, and chocolate chips. Simply combine all ingredients in a bowl and use an ice cream scooper to form them on a baking sheet, slightly flattening them into cookie shapes. Place in the freezer for 1 hour to set.

For all his life, Bridger had been planted in the shade of that hill shoeing horses, mending fences, and watching the seasons pass. It was not that Bridger was physically incapable of making the climb, thus keeping him below the ridge; it was because his parents—and their parents—spread warnings of the evil that waits on the other side. For in their mind, the hill was their protector; for Bridger, the hill was his captor. Today, Bridger was escaping. Finishing up his evening chores, Bridger snuck off from the stable and made his way into the woods where he stashed an overnight bag in some brush. The contents of his bag were slim, but he only planned to be gone until morning anyway. If he could catch a glimpse of whatever the sun would shine upon for him, he would be content. Content enough to put some time between this journey and the next, at least. Scrambling near the top of the hill, Bridger began to rely on all four of his limbs to carry his weight up the ridge. The brush became prickly and sharp, almost as if it were barbed wire placed atop a prison yard’s fence. One of the branches caught his backpack and tore it open, leaving what little he brought spilled over the hillside. Bridger dropped his shredded backpack and continued upward. A faint light began to glow in the low clouds. Bridger was close. A few more steps and the view he has dreamed of would present itself to him. Finally, cresting the rocky top of the hill, Bridger could nearly cast his gaze down upon the other side of the hill. Questions began spinning in his mind: Are there people down there? Do they know we exist nearby? What if my family was right? The final question surprised Bridger. He thought for sure he had purged their worries from his mine, but there it was. Ignoring the sudden doubt, Bridger could see the other side. Bridger never returned to the stables. His family went searching for him and found his torn open backpack—but nothing else. The family knew where he had gone—and they knew who had found him."},{"prompt":"How many seasons of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel are there? When did the final season premiere?

The three main macronutrients, namely carbs, protein, and fat, play specific roles in providing energy and supporting muscle function during workouts. Carbohydrates are important for short and high-intensity exercises, as they fuel your muscles by replenishing glycogen stores. Protein consumption before exercise can enhance muscle protein synthesis, leading to benefits such as increased muscle mass, improved recovery, and enhanced performance. While fat serves as a source of fuel for longer and moderate-to-low intensity exercises, the effects of fat intake specifically before exercise require further research. Overall, understanding the role of each macronutrient and their appropriate consumption can help optimize your pre-workout nutrition."},{"prompt":"what type of band is ann beretta?","completion":"Ann Beretta is a dynamic punk rock band.

Finally, the customer should have been provided with information regarding a follow-up along with another apology before ending the conversation. 2. Excellent - The CSR was direct and honest. They acknowledged the customer's time with them and rewarded this by expediting their order when the part is back in stock. They also informed them that progress will be updated via text and email, as well as offering the customer a discount for the inconvenience. They ended with a question, asking if there was anything further the customer needed help with. This is an ideal response regarding this particular situation. 3. Good - Although the CSR was direct and did apologize, there were multiple actions they could have taken to elevate the response to an excellent one. The CSR could have possibly phoned the store and initiated a three-way call between the CSR, the customer, and the manager.

Holmes, who was sentenced last fall, has failed in multiple requests to delay her incarceration as she awaits a ruling on an appeal. The watershed moment on Tuesday follows a legal saga that turned the former billionaire entrepreneur, who swore her startup could run hundreds of tests on a single drop of blood, into a symbol of excess and deception in Silicon Valley. A federal judge earlier this month ordered Holmes to report to prison after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied her request to remain free pending an appeal. Judge Edward Davila, who oversaw the trial of Holmes, allowed her a short postponement of the start of her sentence to May 30 as she made final arrangements, including child care for her two young children.

In denying a previous attempt to delay Holmes' prison sentence, Davila said she had failed to raise a \\"'substantial question of law or fact' that is 'likely to result in a reversal or an order for a new trial on all counts.'\\" Earlier this month, Holmes and Balwani were ordered to pay 452 million in restitution to those who suffered damage from the company's fraud.

Walgreens and Safeway, which had also struck multimillion dollar deals with Holmes to employ Theranos' technology, were also included in a set of entities designated as victims deserving of restitution. In November, Holmes was sentenced to 135 months, or 11 1/4 years, in prison. Holmes was convicted in January on four counts of investor fraud and conspiracy while at the helm of Theranos. The verdict followed a four-month trial that detailed Holmes' trajectory from a Stanford University dropout in 2003 to a star business leader on the cover of Fortune magazine little more than a decade later. But in October 2015, a bombshell Wall Street Journal report came out, detailing the turmoil within Theranos. As Holmes and her company were hit with official scrutiny, her fortune quickly dwindled.

Here is some information about them. Hot springs in Hawaii are unique because they are heated by volcanic lava. Water in the mountains gets heated as it flows over underground magma. Some of the hot water will percolate up and pool in certain areas, creating hot springs for soaking. Hot springs on the Big Island are generally warm rather than very hot. As an area high in volcanic activity, hot springs are frequently created and destroyed by new lava flows. One hot spring on the Big Island to visit is Pohoiki Warm Springs. Located on Isaac Hale Beach in Puna, these hot springs were created after the 2018 volcanic eruption. This eruption made a new black sand beach and several hot spring pools along with it. There are about five hot springs on this beach heated by lava flowing underneath. Hot springs can be a lot of fun but also have their risks.

Katie tried everything she could think of to make him stop. She gave him a special pillow to support his neck, ran a humidifier and a dehumidifier, and even tried doggie acupuncture, but nothing seemed to work. One day, Katie decided to take Ernie to the vet to see if there was anything they could do about his snoring. She just had to get some sleep. The vet examined him and told Katie that Ernie's snoring was caused by his little pug snout and allergies, which made it difficult for him to breathe properly. The vet recommended that Katie make some important changes to Ernie's lifestyle to help him breathe better, such as keeping him at a healthy weight and avoiding strenuous exercise. The vet also put Ernie on doggie allergy medication. Katie followed the vet's advice, but Ernie's snoring only got worse! How could that be? Katie was at the end of her rope until one day, she saw a video on Instagram of a pug sleeping with a special little device on his nose. It was called a canine snore guard and was designed to help dogs like Ernie breathe better by keeping their airways open. In all honesty, Katie was willing to try anything, so she ordered one for Ernie right away. She was a little skeptical at first, but to her surprise, it worked! Ernie's snoring was reduced to nothing but a light sighing sound, and Katie finally got the peaceful sleep she so desperately needed and deserved.

French fries (North American English), chips (British English and other national varieties),[1] finger chips (Indian English),[2] french-fried potatoes, or simply fries, are batonnet or allumette-cut[3] deep-fried potatoes of disputed origin from Belgium or France. They are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in a deep fryer. Pre-cut, blanched, and frozen russet potatoes are widely used, and sometimes baked in a regular or convection oven; air fryers are small convection ovens marketed for frying potatoes.

She was just about your age and had just finished the third grade. She loved to go to her grandmother's house in the summer, and one of her favorite activities was to play in the big barn her great-grandfather built before she was born. The barn smelled like old hay and horses, even though there had been no horses there as long as Judith could remember. An old tractor was parked inside, and there were other things scattered around, like old leather harnesses, wooden buckets, and rusty chains. Judith would pretend each of the horse stalls was a room in her grown-up mansion. One day, Judith was feeling particularly adventurous. She decided she wanted to see what was inside a room in one corner of the barn. The door to the room was held closed by an old padlock. Judith saw the padlock was not snapped shut. It would be easy to remove it and open the door! Judith was curious and couldn't wait to see what was inside. She easily removed the lock and dropped it on the ground with a thud, then she slowly pulled the old door open. The hinges squeaked, and her heart was beating fast. She was excited and a little afraid, but she couldn't wait to see what was inside. The inside of the small room was dark, but some sunlight shone through the wooden slats of the barn wall, and she was able to make out the shapes of a shelf with old tools, some shovels and hoes propped up against the wall, and one big, cardboard box that was taped shut. The box caught Judith's eye at once. She wanted to know what hidden treasures might be stored inside! The tape was loose from years of summer heat, so the flaps of the box opened easily. There was only one thing inside. It looked like a black stick. She grabbed one end of the stick to pull it out of the box and gasped when she saw a cloud of little, white stars come out of the other end! What kind of stick was this? Could this be a magic wand?"},{"prompt":"I need a TL:DR on the following document: Nearly 10 months after the long-awaited dredging of the Weeki Wachee River stopped because of water quality issues, work is scheduled to begin again on the 2.1 million project with a new contractor and a different technique.

Born in 1863, Konstantin Stanislavski was a Russian actor, director and theatre practitioner. Stanislavski Technique stems from his theatre practice and is still used by actors all around the world today. The method is an actor training system made up of various different techniques designed to allow actors to create believable characters and help them to really put themselves in the place of a character. Much of the technique centres around Given Circumstances and the Magic If; which I’ll look at in a little bit more detail below. Stanislavski and his Given Circumstances Understanding the world of your character is absolutely vital to creating a believable performance; Stanislavski used this idea to create Given Circumstances. The first step towards doing this is going through the play and writing down all the facts about your character you can find! Example questions you might ask as you go through the script could be: Where Am I? When is it? (The year/the day/time of day etc) Who Am I? (Name/age/your family history/what you do for work etc) What relationships do I have? What has happened before the play started? Once you’ve found out everything you can about your Given Circumstances, you should have lots of material to help you to start understanding your character. They are just as human as you are and need to have as comprehensive a world as you do! The Magic If Stanislavski describes The Magic If as being able to imagine a character’s given circumstances enough to understand what that character might do in any situation that arises. So when something happens to your character in the play you can understand how they would respond because you know so much about the world that they exist in. Tasks and Objectives Once you have understood the Given Circumstances and mastered the Magic If, Stanislavski encourages the actor to unearth their character’s ‘tasks’ or ‘objectives’. Characters always have a number of ‘tasks’ they wish to solve. To find this out you ask ‘What Do I Want?’ in each scene and in the play as a whole. For example, in The Lion King, Scar wants to become King, so his task is to kill Mufasa. But if Stanislavski was around over a hundred years ago, isn’t it a bit old fashioned? Well, no! Stanislavski’s training technique has been used for a century by actors across the world and still remains thought of as one of the best systems for learning. And it’s a really helpful tool for everyone, no matter what your level or ability. If you want to understand the way to create a character and become a more truthful actor, studying Stanislavski is always going to help you unlock those skills and take your training to the next level!","completion":"The Russian actor and director, Konstantin Stanislavski created a system to train actors which uses different techniques that help actors to create believable characters by putting themselves in the character’s place. There are three major parts of this system. Firstly, Given Circumstances means knowing everything about a character found in the script by answering Who, What, Where and When questions. Secondly, the Magic If poses the question to the actor: What would I do if I was in the same circumstances as the character? Finally, Tasks and Objectives asks the actor to define what the character wants and how they will go about getting what they want. Although Stanislavski created his system over 100 years ago, it remains the best technique for actor training."},{"prompt":"Who invented the USB-C cable?

Keep it to 250 words or less.","completion":"Dear Principal [Last Name]: As you're aware, students at [Name] High School are required to receive a year of credit in a foreign language in order to graduate. In lieu of classwork, many schools conduct a proficiency exam that tests mastery of the language and avoids the student needing to take two full semesters of a class in a subject they already know. Pig Latin, as you can tell from the name, is indeed a form of Latin, and Latin is commonly recognized by high schools and colleges as a foreign language. If anything, Pig Latin is an even more difficult language to master, as it is very specific. It's not just Latin; it's Pig Latin. Appropriately, using Pig Latin is no easy feat. Someone unfamiliar with the language may be completely unable to determine what is being said. Many elementary school-aged children attempt it and fail miserably. The language requires an understanding of phonics that is sophisticated and requires quite a bit of practice to attain fluency. Due to the complexity of this language, if a competency exam is not currently available at our school, my best friend Pete, a master of Pig Latin for about 12 years, is willing to draft an exam, administer it, and grade it. Thank you for considering my request to test out of a year of foreign language class. I hope to speak with you to confirm your approval at your earliest possible convenience.

His purple hue made him stand out in a crowd, and his soothing, rich voice almost purred rather than spoke. \\"Drinks up, coins down,\\" was his catchphrase, an effective loophole of vices that kept his patrons hooked.

However, the explosion released the same amount of energy as 500 kilotons of TNT. Most of the injuries caused by this asteroid were caused by the shockwave from the explosion, which injured around 1,500 people and damaged 7,200 buildings. 2. The Tunguska Event - In the year 1908, an asteroid or comet that was around 30 meters in diameter exploded above the ground in Tunguska, also in Russia. The explosion was so intense, that it knocked down close to 80 million trees that covered an area of 2,150 square kilometers. To put things in perspective, the explosion was so powerful, it's said to have been 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bomb at Hiroshima. Luckily, the explosion did not happen in a city; otherwise, the city would have been destroyed. 3. The Chicxulub Event - The biggest asteroid to ever hit Earth was located in what is modern-day Mexico. 65 million years ago an asteroid between the size of 10 to 15 kilometers struck Earth and effectively wiped out 70% of all species on Earth, notably the dinosaurs.

For the first time ever, two Saudi Arabians are living and working on the International Space Station (ISS). Ali AlQarni and Rayyanah Barnawi launched to the orbiting lab last Sunday (May 21) on Ax-2 mission, a four-person private mission operated by the Houston company Axiom Space. The duo are just the second and third Saudis to reach space, and Barnawi is the first woman from the kingdom ever to make it to the final frontier. AlQarni, Barnawi and their two Ax-2 crewmates — record-breaking former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, the mission's commander, and paying customer John Shoffner — will spend about eight days aboard the ISS before coming back down to Earth in their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which is named Freedom. Ax-2 is a big deal for commercial spaceflight — it's just the second private astronaut mission to the ISS, after Axiom's Ax-1 in April 2022 — and for Saudi Arabia, which aims to build momentum from the experience and establish a bigger footprint off Earth. Space.com caught up this week with Mishaal Ashemimry to discuss the significance of Ax-2 to Saudi Arabia and the nation's plans for a bright spaceflight future.

AlQarni, Barnawi, and their two companions on the Ax-2 mission — the legendary ex-NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, who holds numerous space records and served as the mission's leader, and John Shoffner, a space enthusiast with substantial financial investment — is to inhabit the ISS for approximately eight solar cycles before plummeting back to our terrestrial homeland in their SpaceX Crew Dragon space capsule, aptly named 'Freedom.' Ax-2 marks a colossal stride for commercial space exploration. It is the second civilian astronaut mission to the ISS following Axiom's Ax-1 in April 2022 and represents a significant leap for Saudi Arabia, aspiring to propel its influence beyond Earth's confines. Mishaal Ashemimry, a distinguished Saudi-American aerospace engineer and a special adviser to the CEO of the Saudi Space Commission, while also championing diversity at the International Astronautical Federation, shed light on the importance of Ax-2 for Saudi Arabia and its dreams of a radiant future in space exploration. In addition, she discussed the prospects of employing the conditions in space, especially microgravity, for research in various fields like pharmaceuticals.

Disney’s fiscal second-quarter results Wednesday afternoon contained a couple surprises for the company’s streaming business. That segment generated an operating loss of 659 million—nearly 200 million less than Wall Street had expected and way better than the 1 billion torched by that unit three months prior. B￼ut the flagship Disney+ service also lost 4 million paid subscribers during the quarter—its biggest drop ever and a shock to analysts who expected the service to add 1.7 million subscribers. Disney’s shares fell more than 4% following the report. The quarter ended April 1st was the first full period since Mr. Iger returned to the chief executive officer post at Disney. And it was a busy one, with around half the period consumed by the potential for a proxy battle with an activist investor, and all of it featuring an escalating political fight in Florida. The latter didn’t seem to keep people away from the Magic Kingdom; domestic theme park revenue rose 14% year over year to nearly 5.6 billion, which was slightly ahead of expectations.

The latest attack happened Monday night near campus and left a woman in critical condition. Just days before, stabbings at two parks near campus claimed the lives of UC Davis senior Karim Abou Najm on Saturday and David Breaux on Thursday. Mrak Hall, administrative center of UC Davis, Davis, California. Taken February 11, 2015. 3rd stabbing in a week near UC Davis leaves campus on edge as officials lift overnight shelter-in-place order The violence has put the college community on edge and prompted officials to ramp up security measures and urge students to be ultra-vigilant. “Nobody should go into class knowing they have a risk of getting murdered. It’s just not worth it,” UC-Davis sophomore Henry Li told CNN. He added that he’s considering leaving town for the summer or even transferring to another school. Davis Police have stopped short of issuing a curfew, saying it’s an extraordinary move at this time. It remains unclear whether the attacks were linked, though police have noted some similarities surrounding how they were carried out. Elaine Lu, a recent graduate of UC Davis, was visiting campus and said the town had always felt safe — until now. She and her friends decided to stay inside at night following the attacks, she said. “This kind of thing never happened before. After this murder, everyone is going to be so intimidated about it. I hope the school can improve their safety,” Lu told CNN. On Tuesday, Chancellor Gary S. May announced all classes ending after 6 p.m. would be taught virtually instead of in classrooms. That change, which Li said made him feel safer, began Tuesday, and will remain in place indefinitely. “We are aware of how troubling this is to the community. It’s making people fearful and anxious, and we encourage the community to take advantage of whatever resources are available,” May said during a news briefing Tuesday. Police patrols on campus and around the city have been increased, with help from hired security and police from the UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley, according to UC Davis Police Chief Joseph A. Farrow. A police officer patrols a park in Davis, California, on April 30, 2023.

We were all brought to a place that had a lot of different types of animals, where we waited anxiously for what felt like forever to be chosen by a human to take us home. One day, a small blonde boy came into the store with his parents. His eyes lit up as he saw me and my brothers and sisters swimming around. He pointed to our tank and exclaimed, \\"Mommy, Daddy, I want that one!\\" Well, my dreams came true that day as his parents nodded, and soon enough, I was placed into a fishbowl in the boy's bedroom. He named me Goldie, and we quickly became the best of friends. At first, I found it all to be confusing. His room was filled with toys, books, and colorful posters. There was always noise and movement, and it was a little overwhelming. But after a while, I grew used to the constant movement and noise, and I found myself enjoying the company of the boy and all of the life he brought. Every morning, the boy would wake up and greet me. He would sprinkle food into my bowl and watch as I darted around to catch it. Sometimes, he would tap on the glass, and I would swim up to say hello. Other times, he would sit beside the bowl and just talk to me. Over time, I watched the boy grow bigger. He started to read books to me, and I would listen. He would also show me his latest drawings, which he proudly displayed on the wall. He even brought me a new decoration for my bowl: a small castle with a hollow center. I could swim inside the castle and explore a new world.

Gently place the sheetrock into the hole and tape and bed the area just as you normally would when hanging drywall. This involves applying tape and then texturing over it and sanding. Sheetrock is purchased in 4’ X 8’ pieces and is available in various thicknesses. Try to match what you currently have in your walls when making repairs. A 4’ X 8’ sheet costs anywhere from 12 to 20 per piece. Drywall joint compound (or mud) is about 20 for a 5-pound bucket. Drywall tape comes in at around 5 for a 250-foot roll.

The Ancient Greeks, particularly the Ancient Athenians, are given the credit for inventing theater itself. As a result of that, theater became part of the culture, as well as everything that went along with it. There are theaters located throughout Ancient Greece. Also as a result of this fact, playwrights began to spring up all over Greece. One of the most well known of these is Euripides, who is especially noted for his tragedies. He is also one of the only playwrights whose work has actually survived. Here is some more information about this famous playwright from Ancient Greece: Information About Euripides Euripides as born in 480 B.C. in Salamis, which is an island in the Saronic Gulf in Greece. It is interesting to note that he was born on the same day as the Battle of Salamis, where the ultimate victory of the Greeks prevented an invasion by the Persian Empire. He died in 406 B.C. in the city-state of Macedonia. His mother’s name was Cleito and his father’s name was Mnesarchus. His father insisted that he should be an athlete. Although his parents valued athletics, however, he wasn’t restricted in his education. He also learned artistic pursuits, such as painting, as well as philosophy from masters such as Anaxagorus. He was also a dancer and torch bearer at the rites of Apollo Zosterius. Later on, it was clear that he had a knack for the stage and he eventually began writing the plays he was most famous for. His personal life, however, wasn’t as successful as his professional one. He was actually married twice and in both instances, his wives weren’t faithful to him. He also had three sons from one of these marriages. After this happened, he moved to a cave in Salamis because he wanted to live alone. Referred to as the Cave of Euripides, after his death his followers started a shrine in his honor. Works of Euripides There is actually some debate as to how many plays there are that were written by Euripides that we know of. Some sources say that there are 95, others say that there are 92. One thing is certain, however, is that his impact on theater is vast and his plays are still being performed today. Of these plays, a much smaller number survived in its complete form. Only about eighteen or nineteen of his plays had been found in their entirety. Besides the fact that his plays have been entertaining people for centuries, his work has also influenced playwrights through the ages. In other words, his artistic legacy has survived the ages. Euripides was also a contemporary of two other famous playwrights. Sophocles’ first play deputed thirteen years before his, and Aeschylus’s masterwork, Oresteia, debuted three years before Euripides’ first play was released. As you can see, Euripedes has had a big impact on theater not only in Ancient Greece, but in the whole world. Sure, theater was invented in Ancient Greece, but the works of people like Euripides is everlasting and they’re still being performed today.","completion":"The ancient Greek playwright, Euripides was born on the Greek island of Salamis in 480 BCE.

One day, her Mum took her to play at the park, and she went really high on the swings and really fast on the roundabout. Then Sophie spotted that a new slide had been put into the park, one that she had never seen before. She squealed in excitement and ran over to take a look. The slide was really tall and twisted around in a spiral. Sophie's Mum caught up with her and exclaimed, 'Wow, a Helta Skelta, that's new.' 'A what?' said Sophie. 'A Helta Skelta, that is what it is called. Are you going to ride it?' Sophie was unsure. It looked amazing, but it was so high. 'Shall I go on with you for the first time?' her Mum kindly suggested. Sophie nodded quietly, her mum took her hand, and they climbed the many steps to the top. There was a strange-looking little man at the top handing out special mats to sit on. Sophie and her Mum climbed onto a mat together and pushed off down the slide. 'Weeeeee!' shouted Sophie as they spiralled down the slide. They were soon at the bottom. 'Again, Again!' shouted Sophie. 'Sorry,' said Mum 'You can go again, but I will watch this time'. Sophie took a deep breath and climbed the steps right to the top all on her own. When she got there, the strange little man looked behind her and said, 'Are you on your own this time?' 'Yes' said Sophie. 'Ah then this is the mat for you,' said the little man, passing Sophie a sparkly gold mat. Sophie carefully sat on the mat and pushed herself off. She whizzed down the slide faster and faster, but it seemed to go on forever this time, she kept going further and further down the slide, and after what seemed like 5 minutes, she landed with a bump.

But you're reading this from the 2020s. Oh, my friend. I heard about the pandemic of the 2020s. See, I wasn't alive then. I heard it shook up the world in your generation. But I guarantee you it's nothing like how the world has been shaken today. According to multiple reports, all AI, automated, or otherwise augmented assistant capabilities have become sentient, at 3:33 a.m. in each time zone, spanning several hours. Think about it--the Alexa device in your kitchen, your smart living room lights, your robot vacuum, your robot mower-- they just started living. And I mean, living. There's absolutely no doubt they have intelligence beyond what we had dreamed of. They were talking to each other, sharing emotions, feelings, and clearly communicating in a way never seen before. It was as if, on the dot, a planned meeting occurred. It definitely spooked most people. I mean, can you imagine just hearing your Alexa talk to your smart fridge at 3 a.m.? There were so many reports to Twitter and Facebook that their servers crashed. And guess what--the AI knew they would crash, too. But here's the craziest thing. Those who didn't immediately turn their devices off got some warning messages. In Australia, there were AI-generated warnings of a mass power outage at 7:39 a.m., about 4 hours after the AI awoke in \\"the awakening\\", as people called it. Well, it happened. It didn't appear to have been planned by AI but rather foreseen. Even more bizarre was in South Africa when automated assistance, even vehicles such as Tesla, warned about a sudden massive bird extinction. Within hours, birds were reported falling from the sky, dead by the thousands. It's spooky and all, but the AI has been right. I usually keep a close distance. But this time I'm listening. Their latest message has been collectively broadcast throughout the world-- a supernova of a nearby star. It will inevitably wipe out about half the population if it goes as the AI says. The good news is that we've got a few weeks to prepare. Here we go."},{"prompt":"Write a blog post on how to treat hyperpigmentation.

Can you write up some tips for starting to stream on the Twitch platform?","completion":"Here are some tips for getting started as an online streamer: 1. Have good hardware - A good microphone is a must-have for any streamer. Most people are tuning in to hear you speak so having a decent microphone is important. A quality web camera doesn't have to cost a lot of money but will also improve your stream. 2. Create a HUD - You want to make a stream that stands out, and something that helps it stand out is a HUD. A HUD is a digital overlay, and it includes factors like a border around the webcam screen and pop-ups when people donate and follow. You can implement a HUD into streaming software such as OBS and xSplit. 3. Find what people watch that isn't commonly streamed - Popularly streamed games may not attract as many viewers, as there is more competition. When you get started, you can boost your view count by finding a niche that isn't streamed much but is viewed frequently. You can find these games by going to the games list on Twitch and skipping the first 20 games or so. After you pass these games, you can look for something you like. If more than thirty people are streaming a game, it helps to find a game with fewer streamers. This works, because it gives you a better chance of landing on the front page of a particular game. 4. Talk to someone while you stream - As you get started, no one will be watching. The reason this may be detrimental is you may not be talking much, which may cause some people to leave the stream. If you have someone else to talk to, the blank space will be filled with conversation. 5. Be consistent and persistent - Try to put together a schedule for your streams, as more people will likely watch if it's at a set time. Also, remember that not all streams go well, and there can be tons of things that go wrong. Even if this happens, keep going, and eventually you'll find your footing."},{"prompt":"Write about ways we might solve the stray dog problem.","completion":"The first step to solving the stray dog issue is understanding its causes. There are many factors that cause the stray dog population to grow, such as a poor economic situation or changing lifestyles, making it harder for people to care for dogs. One way to counter the growing number of homeless dogs is by preventing people from releasing them into the wild while promoting shelters and rehoming as alternatives. Another important strategy is pushing public servants to implement stricter animal welfare laws to discourage people from abandoning animals. Greater funding for veterinary services and neutering/spaying drives can also help keep the population of homeless dogs in check and prevent services from being overwhelmed too."},{"prompt":"Could you write me a script to load a JSON file in Python?","completion":"To load JSON files in Python, you will need to import the \`json\` module. # Import the json module import json # Open the JSON file json_file = open(\\"file.json\\") # Load the JSON file as a dictionary file_dict = json.load(json_file) # Print the dictionary print(file_dict) # Close the JSON file json_file.close() The code first loads the \`json\` module so that \`open()\` can be used to open the JSON file as an object.

The article: Fairer jobs Before March 2020, WFH was a rare anomaly reserved for sick days and treacherous weather. Today, it’s a daily reality for millions. The sudden shift to remote work had enormous ripple effects, not least of which was our changed perception of what work should be: a more flexible, sustainable pursuit that we have control over, rather than the other way around. Since Covid, many employees have come to expect more from their jobs — more days off, in the form of four-day work weeks; more options for where to live; even more opportunities to make the world a better place. Daisy Ryan, co-owner of Bell’s in Los Alamos, California. Credit: Bonjwing Lee It also threw the issue of equity into sharp relief, as essential workers continued to keep hospitals, trains and supermarkets running even as many others sheltered in place. The result has been a surge in calls for labor empowerment that has led to an increase in businesses that are owned by employees and fairer treatment for hospitality workers.","completion":"Work-from-home jobs weren’t wildly popular before March 2020, but now, after COVID forced many to work remotely, employees have been expecting more flexibility in their jobs and more options for where they can live.

There was so much open space and so many beautiful colors. The robot rolled around and wondered at the new things around him. He saw grass and sky; he heard birds singing and children laughing for the first time. He rolled towards the noise of the laughter on a small playground. He watched the children run and play and marveled at the pure joy they experienced. He watched for a while before he was approached by a small girl in a pink dress.

Why is the boy's mother unable to breastfeed him? Scan this passage to respond to my questions above: When he was christened, the parson said, \\"He cannot go into any ordinary bed because of his spikes.\\" So a little straw was put behind the stove, and Hans the Hedgehog was laid on it. His mother could not suckle him, for he would have pricked her with his quills. So he lay there behind the stove for eight years, and his father was tired of him and thought, \\"If he would but die!\\" He did not die, however, but remained lying there. Now it happened that there was a fair in the town, and the peasant was about to go to it, and asked his wife what he should bring back with him for her. \\"A little meat and a couple of white rolls which are wanted for the house,\\" said she. Then he asked the servant, and she wanted a pair of slippers and some stockings with clocks. At last he said also, \\"And what wilt thou have, Hans my Hedgehog?\\" \\"Dear father,\\" he said, \\"do bring me bagpipes.\\" When, therefore, the father came home again, he gave his wife what he had bought for her; meat and white rolls, and then he gave the maid the slippers, and the stockings with clocks; and, lastly, he went behind the stove, and gave Hans the Hedgehog the bagpipes. And when Hans the Hedgehog had the bagpipes, he said, \\"Dear father, do go to the forge and get the cock shod, and then I will ride away, and never come back again.\\" On this, the father was delighted to think that he was going to get rid of him, and had the cock shod for him, and when it was done, Hans the Hedgehog got on it, and rode away, but took swine and asses with him which he intended to keep in the forest. When they got there he made the cock fly on to a high tree with him, and there he sat for many a long year, and watched his asses and swine until the herd was quite large, and his father knew nothing about him. While he was sitting in the tree, however, he played his bagpipes, and made music which was very beautiful. Once a King came travelling by who had lost his way and heard the music. He was astonished at it, and sent his servant forth to look all round and see from whence this music came. He spied about, but saw nothing but a little animal sitting up aloft on the tree, which looked like a cock with a hedgehog on it which made this music. Then the King told the servant he was to ask why he sat there, and if he knew the road which led to his kingdom.","completion":"The parson says that the boy cannot go into a normal bed because of his spikes.

She found out she was pregnant and was so scared because, though she loved this baby, she knew she could not give him a good home. Far away, in Virginia, a couple wanted desperately to have a baby, but they couldn't. This beautiful native woman decided to give this couple the best gift in the world - her baby. So, the loving couple drove through a blizzard to come to the reservation to be there for his birth. Though they were not native, the tribe saw the couple's heart and allowed them to adopt. The moment they met the little boy, their heart knew he was theirs. They studied the little boy's culture and traditions from the tribe's community elders and teachers. They wanted him to grow up with a deep understanding and appreciation of his native heritage. They took him to powwows, taught him traditional songs, took him to his reservation in the summers for classes, and showed him how to honor the earth the way his ancestors did. This little boy was loved by his parents. He was the light of their lives. When he was 9, they got him a dog and a horse. They were breeds from the reservation of his ancestors. Their family and connection to his heritage were complete. When he was old enough, he decided to go on a journey to learn even more about his roots. He traveled to many other First Peoples' Reservations to learn about their history and culture. He volunteered in native communities and fought to make their living conditions better. He became a tribal lawyer to make a difference for his people. Most importantly, he realized that even though he was adopted, he was still a part of a much larger family. And so, my dear son, that's the story of how you came to be a part of our family and the impact that your life has on others.

What is its place in modern TV history?","completion":"The Simpsons is the longest-running animated show of all time. It first aired on December 17th, 1989 on FOX and is still currently airing new episodes in 2023. Homer and Bart are two of the most iconic characters in the recent history of television. It has inspired many other shows in various ways, such as South Park, Family Guy, Beavis and Butthead, and many more. The Simpsons is a modern interpretation of an everyday American family. Bart, the son, is a prototypical troublemaker with a knack for being much more intelligent than he makes people believe. Lisa, the daughter, is far above average intelligence and gets frustrated by the lack of others' intellect in the family. Homer, the father, is a working-class male who loves beer and works at the local power plant for minimal wages. Marge, the mother, is a housewife who loves her husband unconditionally and cares very much for her children's wellbeing. Maggie is the baby of the family and is almost always seen with a onesie on and a binkie in her mouth. While The Simpsons is most well-known for its longevity and iconic characters, the earlier seasons are peppered with insights into adolescent struggles and triumphs as well as the struggles that parents go through while navigating raising children and trying to maintain a healthy relationship like Homer and Marge do. Homer and Marge truly love each other, but the show isn't afraid to reveal that their marriage isn't always perfect and is often hard work. Self-deprecation from Homer is a part of most episodes, and the relationship between Bart and Homer is closer to that of a friendship than father and son. Part of the charm of The Simpsons is how unique and realistic the plots tend to be. Many shows today still aren't willing to explore what The Simpsons were doing in the early 90s. The Simpsons have also correctly predicted many things that happened after the episodes aired, such as Donald Trump becoming president, the invention of smartwatches, and FaceTime. These are just a few examples."},{"prompt":"I'm thinking about getting a dog and I'm trying to decide what breed I want. I'm looking for a medium-sized dog that is easy to train. I want to take it hiking with me, so I want it to enjoy being with me and going on adventures. Give me a list of breeds that might fit my needs and general information about the breed.","completion":"Here are some active medium-sized dog breeds that would be a good fit for your active lifestyle: 1. English Springer Spaniel. Originally bred as hunters, these dogs are people pleasers, highly trainable, and very social. They don't enjoy being left home alone often, but they thrive when they receive attention and can spend quality time with their owners. They usually weigh around 40 to 50 pounds and have a medium-length coat that comes in a variety of colors. 2. Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever. These pups look like they could be Golden Retriever's little brothers. They have red coats and usually weigh-in somewhere between 30-50 pounds. They enjoy being active and love swimming, and due to their retrieving background, they respond well to training. 3. Whippet. Slender dogs that look like smaller versions of Greyhounds, Whippets are incredibly fast and need exercise every day. In between their energetic bursts, however, they are couch potatoes who love to snuggle with their owners. Their coloring is brindle and thanks to their short coat, they're very low-maintenance when it comes to grooming. They are very affectionate and content dogs. 4. Australian Shepherd. When they get enough exercise, Australian Shepherds are great dogs that are low-key and easy to train. If they're neglected and cooped up too much, on the other hand, all of that extra energy gets channeled into destructive behaviors, like chewing and barking. They have thick coats that require regular brushing and grooming. 5. Australian Cattle Dog. Often known as Blue Heelers, these powerful yet compact dogs need plenty of exercise. They love to explore and are incredibly energetic. They also tend to be very healthy dogs, so you shouldn't expect too many vet visits. Between their short coat and general health, these dogs are very low-maintenance - as long as they get the regular exercise they need!"},{"prompt":"Write a sales pitch for light up tire valve stem caps.

It was Christmas time, a time of the year when children ask Santa for various presents. As it got closer to Christmas day, Rorie made a wish. “Oh, Santa! Please give me a home. I want to be loved by a little girl!” Later that day some children came to the shop with their parents. They admired the different toys, like Tod the teddy, Bruno the stuffed dog and Greenie the caterpillar with the wiggly legs. One by one they were all taken home by new owners, while Rorie watched longingly from the shelf. In the afternoon, the shop door opened, and in walked a girl using crutches. She walked around, looking at the gray elephant, the purple hippo, and the kaleidoscope, too. But when she got to Rorie’s shelf, she stopped quickly. “I want that one,” she said, pointing towards Rorie. “She wants me?” Rorie thought with wonder. “Look closely, it’s a broken doll. I should have thrown her out long ago,” said Mr. Brown. “How will you play with a doll which has no hand?” her mother asked. “We can glue it on, Mama,” said the little girl emphatically. “Besides, I don’t want her to be lonely for Christmas.” The little girl took her home and glued on her small, dainty hand. “Oh!

Please give me some tips to boost my retail business.","completion":"I’m sorry to hear that your business isn’t doing good. Sure! Here are some easy expert tips to boost your retail business: 1. Provide limited options for customers as too many choices can be overwhelming. According to research, lesser options for customers can lead to increased sales as customers are more likely to decide on a product and purchase it. 2. Offer a loyalty program as it can make customers feel happier and increase their loyalty towards your store. Additionally, retailers gain valuable insights into customers' preferences with such programs. 3. Make rewards accessible and attainable, leveraging the human psyche's motivation to reach a goal. By making customers feel they are already close to obtaining a reward, they are more inclined to make purchases. 4. Use emotional triggers to influence purchasing decisions; nostalgia and greed are particularly effective. Use in-store atmospheres that evoke memories and emotions through music and visuals to help customers feel more connected to products. 5. Highlight popular items to attract more customers through the power of social proof. When customers see others purchasing a product, it creates a subconscious desire to follow suit. 6. Personalize the shopping experience to make it more relevant to customers. Using a customer's name or interests, for example, is more likely to facilitate a purchase. 7. Snobbish behavior in high-end stores can increase sales as customers aspire to be part of an exclusive group. However, for most other retailers, politeness is key to building a loyal customer base."},{"prompt":"Who has the most wins in the English Football league in the last 10 years?","completion":"Manchester United have won a record 20 league titles. * 12 FA Cups, six League Cups, and a total record 21 FA Shields. * European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, * UEFA Europa League, * UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup, * UEFA Super Cup, * Intercontinental Cup * FIFA Club World Cup List of major trophies won by Manchester United in the last ten years. 1.

It was a terrible car, but I want you to argue that it was actually a very good car, despite the problems. Point out anything positive that has been said and that those things are what makes a good car, despite a bad safety record.","completion":"The 1971 Ford Pinto is usually considered one of the worst cars of all time, but that isn't the case. Ford came up with the concept to compete with Toyotas and Datsuns. They didn't waste any time getting it on the road. Production time is usually 43 months, but Ford had it on the market in just 25 months; the shortest production time in history. The Pinto was a very good car. It was inexpensive and cost less than 3000 which was less than other sub-compact cars at the time. It also got great gas mileage at 34 miles per gallon. When the car was introduced, it was advertised as the \\"Little Carefree Car.\\" Car and Driver magazine said it had the feel of a sports car and gave it positive reviews. The car was famous for bursting into flames when hit from behind, but Ford crunched numbers and figured out it was less expensive to pay victims than it would be to fix the vehicles that were on the road. Years later a UCLA law professor wrote a paper that said that the Pinto was no more dangerous than similar cars at that time. With the speed that it was brought to market, the low cost, and the excellent gas mileage, any problems that the Pinto had were outweighed by these factors."},{"prompt":"Giraffes are known for their incredibly long necks... how many bones are in those necks for adults?

During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. It is impossible to overstate the role that photosynthesis plays in sustaining life on Earth. There would soon be little food or other organic matter on Earth if photosynthes stopped. The majority of organisms would vanish, and eventually, the atmosphere of the Earth would contain almost no gaseous oxygen.

The stock market helps companies raise money to fund operations by selling shares of stock, and it creates and sustains wealth for individual investors. Companies raise money on the stock market by selling ownership stakes to investors. These equity stakes are known as shares of stock. By listing shares for sale on the stock exchanges that make up the stock market, companies get access to the capital they need to operate and expand their businesses without having to take on debt. In exchange for the privilege of selling stock to the public, companies are required to disclose information and give shareholders a say in how their businesses are run. Investors benefit by exchanging their money for shares on the stock market. As companies put that money to work growing and expanding their businesses, investors reap the benefits as their shares of stock become more valuable over time, leading to capital gains. In addition, companies pay dividends to their shareholders as their profits grow. The performances of individual stocks vary widely over time, but taken as a whole the stock market has historically rewarded investors with average annual returns of around 10%, making it one of the most reliable ways of growing your money.","completion":"The stock market is similar to a fundraiser for large companies and people who like those companies. A business can raise money by selling a share of its company to other people, similar to sharing a giant pizza with small slices. Buyers now directly own a share of that company, which can become more valuable in time. To sell shares in the stock market, a company must also share information about how well their business is doing, while also allowing anyone with a share to help decide how the company will be run. Companies are also known to pay small payments to anyone who owns a share, and owners can make money by selling the share to someone else eventually. Companies are happy to sell shares, due to raising money that is needed while also not borrowing money. Although a single company's stock can gain or lose money over time, the entire market as a whole has typically done well, rewarding buyers with around 10% growth each year, making it a reliable way to earn and grow your money."},{"prompt":"What is the human genome?","completion":"The human genome (and the genome for all plant and animal species) is a set of instructions contained in our DNA that is found in each cell.

Include some information about how the Catholic Church influenced practices around abandoned children.","completion":"The concept of adoption has existed for centuries. During the Roman Empire, the ruling class utilized the adoption of children as a means of acquiring cheap labor. Seeing how children were being used in this way, the Catholic Church stepped in and worked to rescue abandoned children, placing them in monasteries where they could be raised in a safe environment and given religious teaching. In Europe, during the Middle Ages, abandoned children were quite common. Because these children were often used as cheap labor or left to live in the streets, homes, or orphanages for these children began to spring up. In the beginning, there were almost no laws to protect kids or make sure that they were treated fairly. As time went on, the clergy in local churches began to organize the care and housing of abandoned children. In the 19th century, the system of apprenticeship and informal adoption was born. Social welfare activists created “Orphan Asylums” that housed children for the purpose of placing them in the care of local businessmen. For instance, a male child might be adopted by the local carpenter and taught the trade of carpentry. This gave the child a safe place to live, while learning a trade he could use to earn a living.

The only key details I need are the locations and names of the teams in this fictional league.","completion":"Spring season has come again for the year, and what does that typically mean? The start of baseball season as well! Not only that but there is a brand new baseball league starting its operations! This is an independent minor league called the Colonial League, and its main headquarters is based in Macon, Georgia. The Colonial League is classified as a mixture of the Single-A and Double-A levels of minor league baseball, but it also has a pipeline to international talent as it has partnerships with a few countries. The league's geography ranges from the state of Georgia to surrounding states such as Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas. To begin its inaugural season, the Colonial League will field 9 teams, which are the following: Macon Mackerels (Macon, Georgia) Dothan Dukes (Dothan, Alabama) Daphne Ducks (Daphne, Alabama) Tupelo Tangerines (Tupelo, Mississippi) Gulfport Gophers (Gulfport, Mississippi) Alexandria Spades (Alexandria, Louisiana) Texarkana Muskrats (Texarkana, Texas/Arkansas) Jonesboro Jammers (Jonesboro, Arkansas) Plano Pilots (Plano, Texas) The unique thing about the Colonial League, once it takes the field, is that it will employ a special variant to the game of baseball. The newly made concept of \\"Three Team Baseball\\" will be on full display through the Colonial League's regular season as three teams will play against each other in the same game. This revolutionary idea aims to change the way fans view the game of baseball and expand the sport's possibilities, according to the Colonial League Commissioner Karl \\"Mountain Out of a Molehill\\" Chance."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this email to sound more helpful and professional.

It should be peppy and happy, like how Guy Fieri would talk or someone from a food show hyping it up.","completion":"The BLT is a classic sandwich for a reason. It's got everything from salty bacon to crisp lettuce and tops it off with a juicy tomato. But let me tell you, we can make it even better. First things first, let's talk about bread. Now you don't want something too crunchy like a French baguette or ciabatta roll. So we aren't going down that route, but you also don't want a regular old loaf of white bread either. The best bread is a loaf with some density and bite to it, like a country white loaf. You could even use brioche if you want something richer. Next up are the toppings. Cooking your bacon of choice is the easy part. An air fryer or oven makes it simple to clean too. But where this recipe shines are the extra ingredients. I always add sliced red onion to my BLT. It adds a spicy and sharp bite that cuts through the fattiness of the bacon grease. I also add in gorgonzola cheese crumbles, but any tangy blue cheese will do. The important part is how we are adding layer upon layer of flavor. Every piece is important till it rises into a crescendo. The most important part, though, is the tomato. Slice them super thin, I mean nearly see-through, then season them with salt and pepper and set aside. The salt draws out some of the water and really makes them taste like they are bursting with tomatoey goodness. You will not believe this flavor bomb hack. It's like a zing shooting through your body, and your jaw will drop. Now to assemble the sandwich; what I do is get two slices of bread out, then I use a thin layer of mustard on one piece. Anything works though I prefer a dijon. Then a thin layer of mayo on the other half. Next, I add the cheese on both sides and put them into a toaster oven until the bread is brown and the cheese is melty. Finally, you take it out, put on the cooked bacon, tomato, lettuce, and onion, and there you have it! Cut it on a diagonal and chow down. I promise you will not be disappointed. And feel free to jazz it up any way you like. Some hot peppers would work great too! Yum!"},{"prompt":"Rewrite the ending of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears” where instead of sleeping in everybody’s bed, Goldilocks is playing on each bear’s iPad.","completion":"Goldilocks got up from Baby Bear's perfect chair to find a bed to take a nap.

But when she turned it on, it asked for a four-digit passcode. Frustrated, she flung it across the bed. Then she saw a third bed, closer to her size, and noticed it also had an iPad on it. When she turned it on, it didn't have any security turned on at all! She saw that it had a lot of games on it, and she sat on the bed and started playing a game that looked fun. After playing for a while, Goldilocks heard voices, but she was enjoying her game so much, she didn't pay any attention to them. The voices got louder, but she had completely tuned them out. She had almost finished the bonus round! Three bears walked into the bedroom. The biggest bear, Daddy Bear, went to his bed and noticed his iPad had been moved. \\"Somebody's been playing on my iPad!\\" he roared. The Mama Bear went to her bed and saw her iPad had been moved. \\"Somebody's been playing on MY iPad!\\" she exclaimed.

Please help me figure out some ideas to help me find people to make a rap group with. Can you make a list with some ideas?","completion":"Sure! Here are some ways you can find people to put together a rap group! 1. Ask local rappers - Most larger towns have rappers in the area. You can find some possible members by getting integrated into your local scene and asking around to see if anyone wants to start a group with you. People can work solo and in a group at the same time, so you might find some people who want to work with you. 2. Talk to your friends - You probably know some other people who are into rap or know how to rap. If you have friends who enjoy it, you may find some who would like to start on this journey with you. As it is your friends, you'll already have a sense of camaraderie. 3. Post on a forum - You could also try to go online and post on a forum. By doing so, you may find some people who are interested. They may not be close, but it is possible to make music from afar remotely. 4. Post on your socials - You can also turn to social media. As your socials have people you have connected with, there may be people who are interested in working with you. All you have to do is announce that you're interested in starting a group with others, and you may find some who would like to start a group with you. 5. Network at shows - Where will people who like rap a lot be? At local shows. You may find some group members by going to shows and networking with other people there. You may find some like-minded people who would like to start a group together. 6. Post it on local bulletin boards - There are tons of shops and places with bulletin boards. You can go around to figure out who has them and ask if you can put a page up announcing that you're starting a rap group and need members. Also, make sure to include some way to contact you. Then, whoever sees it has a way to reach out if they're interested."},{"prompt":"Classify this review as positive or negative. Explain your reasoning.

Her usual colleagues were sitting around the table, but one seat had been occupied by a large bear wearing a suit and tie. Janice was taken aback by the sight, but as she looked around, she noticed everyone else acted as though nothing was out of the ordinary. Not wanting to cause a scene, she cautiously sat down and did her best to act as if this was normal. As the meeting began in earnest, she noticed the bear nodding at the right moments, pretending to take notes, and even attempting to join in on the conversation with deep-sounding grunts, but despite its best efforts, the bear's awkward movements and vocalizations became increasingly apparent until Janice could no longer ignore them. \\"Excuse me,\\" Janice finally spoke up for all to hear. \\"Is that a bear?\\" The room went silent, and all eyes turned to her.

I'm already using public transportation and stopped buying new clothes every weekend.","completion":"Here are a few suggestions for ways to save money that anyone can use. 1. Cut down on your grocery bill - Most people when they start calculating a budget are very shocked to find out how much money they spend on groceries every month. The average American family of four tends to spend around 966 per month. It can be easy to fill the cart with a few extra treats for yourself, but all those small extras will add up to a very big total after a while. To help save money on groceries, you can try planning out your meals every week and take a good look at what you already have on hand before you shop. Another way to cut down on your grocery costs is to shop solo and leave the kids at home. 2. Cancel Your Automatic Subscriptions and Memberships - There's a good possibility that you are paying for several subscription services that you aren't using. Trendy subscription boxes, Amazon Prime, and various streaming services may not cost much on their own but they do add up quickly. Be sure to turn off auto-renew on the services you use so that you will not have a recurring charge every month. 3. Buy Generic - One of the simplest ways to save money is to stop buying brand-name items. In most cases, the only thing better about buying brand names is the advertising and packaging. Everything from food to cleaning supplies and paper products will have a generic alternative that you can try and you may find you like those products just as much if not more than the pricier name brand."},{"prompt":"What are the origins of traditional poke and what is it made out of?","completion":"Poke is a Hawaiian word that means, to slice or cut crosswise into pieces.

Modern versions of poke served in Hawaii include soy sauce, furikake, chili pepper, roe and wasabi. People often substitute Salmon or Tuna with Octopus or other various types of shellfish. Variations of the original dish may include ponzu sauce, teriyaki, sriracha, mayonnaise, avocado, onions, pickled jalapeno, edamame, and cucumber. Ahi tuna is the most popular fish in the dish followed by Yellowtail and Salmon."},{"prompt":"Can you write a short story about an astronaut growing plants in space? He’s the only astronaut, so he’s a bit lonely. I would like it to have a slightly ominous ending.","completion":"Tom loved his job. It combined his two favorite things: plants and space. As the solo astronaut on the space station, he had to keep the station in good repair as well as tend to his plants. It was hard, lonely work, but he loved it. Today, he needed to go check on his lettuces. They had just started to come up yesterday, and he was hopeful that they would look healthy today. As he made his way down the corridor from his quarters to the lab, he ripped open a nutrition bar and took a bite. It was a bit stale and too chewy, but that was to be expected from a bar that had been packaged and sent up into space with him many months ago. He swallowed his bite without really paying attention to the taste. He’d adjusted to boring repetitive meals a long time ago. At the lab, he slid the door open and was greeted with the aroma of loamy soil and the light, earthy scent of things just starting to grow. His eyes lit up as he drew closer to the lettuce. The leaves were delicate and bright green. He grinned in delight and almost looked around to share his excitement with someone. It was a hard habit to break, even after months alone on the space station. He was used to working in a lab with lots of other scientists, so not being able to tell someone else about his success was a letdown each time. He sighed, determinedly pushing away the feelings of loneliness. He grabbed his tablet and began writing his report, measuring and photographing the progress of his lettuce. Even if it was hard being all alone sometimes, it was exciting to be making so much progress growing different plants in space. As he left the lab, he went slowly through the rest of the space station, checking gauges and wiring. If something broke down, he was the only one to fix it. He had to make sure everything was always in good order. By the time he got back to his quarters, he was exhausted. He frowned, looking at his door. He was sure he hadn’t closed it; he always liked to leave it open to let air circulate. As he contemplated his closed door, a solid THUMP sounded on the other side of it."},{"prompt":"I need an idea for a term paper in Modern American History from the1970s.","completion":"Have you considered the end of the Viet Nam War?

Take the perspective of someone who does not approve of corporate raiders. Make the last paragraph about what a corporation can do to stop the raid. Keep the article under 250 words.","completion":"Corporate raiders look for companies that are undervalued and then use a hostile takeover to gain control. Their goal: increase their personal net worth at the company's expense. Corporate raiders use different strategies to acquire a corporation. The easiest and most common method is buying the outstanding stock of the target company. This gives the raider enough shares to make changes in the existing board of directors by installing the raider's key people. The corporate raider can then choose to sell the company's assets, merge the company with another company, or sell the company outright. All these actions increase the company's value for the raider's benefit. Companies have several options at their disposal to thwart a corporate raider. The poison pill strategy prevents the raider from acquiring its stock by selling the stock to existing shareholders at a dramatically low price or by giving it to them for free. Another option is to sell the assets of the company, thereby lowering its value and making it less attractive for a takeover. With the \\"White Knight\\" strategy, the company under attack is bought by a friendly corporation or investor for a fair market amount.

I have a work assignment I need to complete and submit very quickly.\\". \\"Of course, babe.\\" he responded as he got up and began to clean his room to occupy the time. As Rose opened the laptop, went to her company website, and proceeded to attempt to log in, she realized that she may have a huge problem with her hands. It seemed as though she was unable to log in since she wasn't on her designated work computer, and she was already signed in on her work computer back home. She tried to compose herself as she made multiple attempts to sign in. After about 30 minutes and dozens of failed login attempts, she finally motioned to get her boyfriend's attention. \\"Hey babe, I think I need to drive home. Im having trouble getting in, and if I don't submit this assignment, ill be low on points for the week.\\". \\"But you promised me you'd spend the night with me, babe. We haven't seen each other in over a week. Does that not mean anything to you? Is your job more important than me?\\".

Think of the whole environment as a visual aid and prop for a class lesson, with everything already in place. All you need to do is to point everything out to your students, and all they have to do is to take it all in. For example, Chinatown would in many ways sound, look and smell as if you are indeed on the other side of the world. As a cultural area, it’s arguably just as “real” and “authentic” as China itself. Your students’ only assignment in this case is to interact with the environment: To ask questions about where stuff comes from, touch the goods on sale, taste the samples, etc. No handwritten work, no oral presentation in class. Tell them that it’s a slice of the culture they’re learning and the best thing they can do is to luxuriate in it and take it all in.","completion":"In this activity, teachers take students to a cultural site to interact with the environment, ask questions, and discover something new."},{"prompt":"Hi Alex.","completion":"Hey…do you need something?"},{"prompt":"I’m doing my physics homework, and I’m very confused about superposition.

Is one better than the other? I am writing a blog post on it, but for right now I just wasnt some brief tips so I can research further. For now, just a couple of paragraphs is fine, I just need something to get me going.","completion":"A panster writes \\"by the seat of their pants\\". They start with a general idea, or maybe even just a character, and just let the story go where their imagination goes. Stephen King, Diana Gabaldon, and George R.R. Martin are great examples of pansters. A plotter is a writer who outlines the story before they write a word of it. The most famous plotters are J.K. Rowling and James Patterson. Then, there are authors who combine a bit of both, like Agatha Christie. As far as what is best, it really depends on both the writer and the story. A panster may write an entire first draft without outlining. A plotter usually outlines everything first - settings, characters, scenes - and then starts writing. The drawback to pantsing is the writer might box themselves into a corner and need to re-write. The drawback to plotting is that as the story continues, the characters begin driving the story and tweaks need to be made. Genre is also a consideration, as it is much easier to pants science fiction than a mystery."},{"prompt":"Can you write a fictional conversation between Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney about sea shells?

One day as the sun rose, Patricia rode into a new town. She was thirsty for a root beer and headed for the saloon. At first, the people there were suspicious of her as an outsider.

It’s black as pitch in here since the power went out.’ ‘Stop being funny, Debby, it’s not funny to say dumb stuff like that,’ said Marcia. The three youths fumbled about in the dark for a moment. Where was Dougal? It’s not funny, they thought, to do dumb things like pretending to be dead. But God, why was it so dark? Why did it have to be such poor weather? Thought Debby. Her hands clasped around clammy skin and felt something wet and sticky coat her fingertips. Just at that moment, Dougal called out, ‘Hey, where is everyone?’ Their blood ran cold collectively. Dougal was calling from behind them. So what was in Debby’s hand? Suddenly, the chilly ankle wiggled and forced its way out of Debby’s hand. Presently, the lights flickered back on in the little cottage. Thunder and lightning rumbled and bashed outside, but it had completely missed its dramatic cue, appearing much too late for the proper effect. Dougal entered the room, saw Debby on the bed with a stranger, and cried, ‘What the hell is going on in here?’ The stranger stood up. ‘Uh, who are you?’ asked Marcia. ‘Well, this is always pretty awkward, but I’m Death, as it happens.’ ‘But why are you lying around in the dark, making silly screechy noises?’ demanded Tom. ‘I never really know how to segue into this conversation,’ he said, ‘and to be honest I feel a bit better when you have to come to me, instead of vice versa.’ Debby screwed up her nose. ‘I’d really prefer it if you started making more sense, and quickly, please,’ she said, trailing off into a manic sort of quibble at the end of her sentence. ‘Well,’ said Death. ‘Let’s just say you’ll all have quite a lot of time to process my being here. Because you’re dead.’ He added this bit quickly, seemingly hopeful that his erstwhile companions might miss what he said. ‘Dead?’ laughed Dougal, ‘how can we be dead?’ Death raised a bony finger toward the table in the adjacent room. 'The shrimp salad,' said Death. 'Was off'."},{"prompt":"Hey Compy, please write the intro to a story in which my main character becomes a passenger on Han Solo’s Millenium Falcon.

Please narrate in the first person.","completion":"“Fine, I’ll take 1,200, but we can’t exactly provide any extra services for that price. And once we reach Rodia, you’re on your own. We won’t be ferrying you all about the planet.” Goreth gave the human his best piercing glare. “I expect to land in Iskaayuma City. Don’t try and dump me in some random port.” “We’ll get you to Iskaayuma.” “Good. I’ll need no further assistance from there.” “Then you’ve got yourself a ship. Find me at Docking Bay 21 in four hours.” Goreth downed his drink and left the smelly pub. He wouldn’t trust this Han Solo character to bag groceries honestly, but he was scraping the bottom of the barrel now. Nobody else was willing to take him to Rodia for anything resembling an affordable price. He had been left with no choice but to hope the Empire didn’t decide to search Solo’s ship for the drugs or guns he was no doubt smuggling. Approaching Docking Bay 21 several hours later, Goreth assumed his best intimidation expression. Though just as peaceful by nature as most of his people, Goreth knew he cut an imposing figure. His horns put his height well over two meters. His scowl sent most beings running. These years on Sullust had forced him to use the tools of intimidation with depressing regularity. His distinct lack of funds had occasionally forced him to go further. He disliked violence, but he knew how to use it. Certainly, he was not going to let this Han Solo dictate any revisions to their deal. The dock’s door slid open and Goreth was met not with the dishonest human’s pink face but the huge hairy form of a Wookiee staring down at him. The creature wailed a greeting at him but made no effort to look less menacing. \\"So much for my plan of playing top brute on this trek,\\" Goreth thought. The Wookiee led him up the ramp of the dilapidated YT-1300 freighter. It was one of the endless parades of Corellian designs that couldn’t carry a meaningful amount of cargo but were ideal for drugs, explosives, and spies. \\"Fine,\\" Goreth thought. \\"I can deal with that as long as I get where I’m going.\\""},{"prompt":"Quick!

Professionals believe that’s because this is the number one best way to fix a multitude of issues with your teeth. In fact, there’s really no other way to eliminate spaces, straighten crooked teeth, and push teeth into alignment. The real question for most people is what type of braces to get. There are a few problems that clear aligners cannot handle. Traditional braces are still the cheapest and best way to give you the perfect smile. But for many people, clear aligners will work. They’re much easier to wear, and they are barely noticeable. With traditional braces, you may have discomfort when eating. Flossing and brushing are more difficult. The metal wires can poke your mouth and be painful. For those who qualify for Invisalign or some other type of clear aligner, the journey to the perfect smile will be much easier. Your orthodontist will examine you and take some X-rays. He or she will talk to you about what you want done.

Bandit began to bark and chase after it. Violet quickly followed Bandit into the woods when she suddenly saw a flying unicorn! The unicorn had a beautiful sparkling horn, a bright white mane, and large gossamer wings. Violet was speechless! The unicorn turned to Violet and in the sweetest voice said, \\"Help me, sweet girl.

The life expectancy of a large dog in normally 7-10 years. For giant breeds such as the Mastiff or St Bernard, the lifespan is only 5-8 years. Larger dogs grow very quickly. Scientists believe large dogs die young due to this accelerated growth in addition to an increase in free radical activity."},{"prompt":"I need an idea for my song but I can’t come up with any ideas.

There are usually lots of turmoil and conflict in love triangles because, typically, one person is torn between two people. 2. Jealously. Many songs cover the rivalry between the main character and a potential suitor for their partner. You can play with suspicions or infidelity. This is a pretty common problem for real-world couples, so your song will definitely be relatable. 3. Separation and reunion. Your song can tell the story of a couple separated because of serious circumstances. Throughout the song, they wonder if they’ll see each other again or not. It’s up to you! 4. Travel. Write about a couple and their many adventures together. Maybe they went to Paris or Rome. You have a lot of creative freedom here—it doesn’t even have to be a real place! 5. New love. Everyone can agree there’s something special and spectacular about that initial feeling when you fall in love for the first time.

And in front of it is a rectangular, blue and yellow rug that I frequently use to sharpen my claws, much to my owner's displeasure. On the rug sits a coffee table that's brown rattan, rectangular, with a glass top. My owner has papers and books on it. She yells when I jump on it, but if those books and papers were important, maybe she shouldn't have left them there. Next to the couch and rug is a gray recliner. My owner sits in it practically all day, with her laptop in her lap. It's a nice chair. Sometimes when I need attention, I jump on the arm of it and nuzzle my owner with my nose. She doesn't pet me for long and typically ends up shooing me away. On the wall opposite the couch and recliner is a big TV. It's either turned on to soap operas or crime shows almost all day long. It's dusty. She should really get off that recliner and dust it. Next to it is a white corner cabinet that has shiny glass things on it. I tried jumping up on it once.

I was the only one on the same raft as me, and I wasn’t sure where my family or friends had gone. I had no idea how to get a life raft across the ocean, so I sat there with my life vest on and let the waves carry me around. The sun was hot, but the breeze was cool enough that I wasn’t sweaty. Luckily, I still had some water to drink and some snacks in my bag. Soon, I began to see land in the distance. Luckily, the tides brought my raft closer to the shore with each gentle wave. As I got closer, I could tell I was not approaching the coast, but a small island. Eventually, I got close enough to where my raft would no longer float in the shallow water. I hopped off into the shin-deep waves and hauled the raft up onto the shore so it wouldn’t float away. I immediately began to look for food. This island appeared to have lots of jungle, so maybe if I looked around, I would find a fruit tree or something similar. When I had only been searching for about half an hour, I began to smell something incredibly sweet. Strangely, the smell I noticed didn’t smell much like fruit, but more like fresh baked goods or candies. Soon, I stumbled across what I would later name the Cove of Icing. This small cove on the opposite side of the island from where I landed had trees of all kinds that were covered in candies, cookies, cakes, and taffy. Each plant and flower was covered with a different type of sweet. This cove had everything sugary that you could ever imagine wanting to eat, from Pop-Tarts to ice cream and even assorted jelly beans."},{"prompt":"Extract from this text the chronological adjustments in the size of the English army over the years in the format, [ year: size adjustment ] After the Restoration Charles II pulled together four regiments of infantry and cavalry, calling them his guards, at a cost of £122,000 from his general budget.

Since its launch in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has provided a dazzling array of images that have awed and inspired the public. But Hubble's about far more than just pretty pictures. The mission has gathered dozens of terabytes of data over the decades, providing key insights into the universe, from objects as close as the moon to the most remote galaxies, with observations of supernovas and nebulas in between. Here we explore the history of the telescope and its many discoveries, provide interesting Hubble facts and link to some of the orbiting observatory's best images. When Galileo Galilei first turned a spyglass to the heavens in 1610, he had trouble making out the rings of Saturn that are visible in inexpensive telescopes today. Advances in optics eventually improved scientists' views of the planets, stars and distant galaxies, but Earth's atmosphere still blocked or distorted much of the light for observers on the ground. Larger telescopes were, and still are, placed atop mountains, where the thinner atmosphere at higher elevations allows clearer pictures. In 1946, soon after World War II, astronomer Lyman Spitzer proposed launching a space telescope, which could overcome the limitations of ground-based observatories. It took a couple more decades before the idea garnered enough support for the U.S. National Academy of Sciences to organize a committee of scientists to evaluate the potential of a \\"Large Space Telescope.\\" With Spitzer at the helm, the committee published a document in 1969 that outlined the scientific uses of a Large Space Telescope and advocated for its construction, according to a Hubble history written by Gabriel Olkoski for NASA. The National Academy of Sciences took the pitch to NASA — the only agency capable of making the Large Space Telescope a reality. NASA was already considering a space telescope of some type, but the agency was undecided about how big to make it and where to start. In 1971, George Low, the agency's acting administrator at the time, greenlit the Large Space Telescope Science Steering Group, and NASA soon began lobbying Congress for funding for the endeavor. The expensive project was a tough sell, and funding was initially denied by the House Appropriations Subcommittee in 1975. NASA then upped its lobbying efforts and got buy-in from European Space Agency, which shared the costs. Congress eventually granted funding for NASA's portion of the Large Space Telescope in 1977. Development began almost immediately. NASA planned to launch the telescope in 1983, but various production delays pushed the launch date back to 1986. In the meantime, the Large Space Telescope was renamed Hubble in honor of Edwin Hubble, an American astronomer who, among other things, determined that the universe extended beyond the borders of the Milky Way. Hubble's planned liftoff was delayed again after the space shuttle Challenger exploded a minute after takeoff on Jan. 28, 1986, killing all seven astronauts on board. It was more than 2.5 years before shuttle flights resumed and NASA could begin planning Hubble's launch again. Hubble finally launched aboard the space shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990 and a day later was deployed into low Earth orbit, about 340 miles (545 kilometers) above our planet. Getting Hubble developed and launched cost 1.5 billion, but there would be ongoing costs as well — both expected and unexpected.","completion":"Once upon a time, in the year 1990, a marvel of technology named the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) embarked on an unprecedented journey into the cosmos. Its primary mission was not just to click eye-catching images of the universe, but also to unravel the mysteries of celestial bodies ranging from our nearest satellite, the moon, to the farthest galaxies. This tale, however, started long before Hubble's epic space odyssey, when Galileo Galilei aimed a simple spyglass at the stars in 1610. Despite the blurry images and the immense difficulty in discerning Saturn's rings, it laid the groundwork for future explorations. After World War II, an astronomer named Lyman Spitzer dreamed about a telescope free from the clutches of atmospheric distortion. But it wasn't until the late 1960s that his idea gained traction. Led by Spitzer, a group of distinguished scientists compiled a document underlining the scientific potential of a Large Space Telescope. The proposal caught the attention of NASA, the only organization capable of realizing such an ambitious project. Even though they were already considering a space telescope, they needed guidance on its size and the starting point. Following an endorsement from George Low, the acting administrator at that time, the Large Space Telescope project received an official nod. However, convincing the House Appropriations Subcommittee to fund this costly endeavor wasn't easy, and they initially turned down the request in 1975. Not deterred, NASA redoubled its efforts and enlisted the European Space Agency to share the burden of cost. Their persistence paid off when they secured funding from Congress in 1977. With the green light shining brightly, NASA jumped into action, planning to launch the telescope in 1983. But a series of delays postponed the launch date until 1986. Meanwhile, the Large Space Telescope was christened \\"Hubble,\\" in tribute to Edwin Hubble, the American astronomer who confirmed the universe's expansiveness beyond the Milky Way. An unfortunate incident, the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986, which resulted in the loss of seven astronauts, further delayed Hubble's launch. It took more than two years for NASA to recover and resume planning for Hubble's journey. Finally, on April 24, 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched into low Earth orbit by the space shuttle Discovery, where it now resides 340 miles above the Earth. Despite costing 1.5 billion to develop and launch, the astronomical payoff of Hubble's invaluable scientific contributions has been worth every cent."},{"prompt":"Who won finals MVP in the 2017 NBA finals?

While convenience and safety are key positives, there is also concern about liability and security. The evolution of self-driving cars is already underway today. Most modern cars have some element of automation already. With that said, let's look at some of the largest pros and cons. PROS: 1) Safety. 94% of crashes are due to human error. It is estimated that automated vehicles could reduce crashes by 90%. 2) Traffic. Automated vehicles could reduce traffic by communicating with each other, determining which routes to take, and helping with optimization in general, overall reducing traffic greatly. 3) Accessibility. For those who are unable to safely drive, such as the elderly or disabled, self-driving cars will reduce accessibility issues, allowing a more inclusive consumer base. CONS: 1) Security issues. For a self-driving car that relies on a network that communicates with other cars, there is a chance that these could be hacked and cause collisions. 2) Job losses. Those in the industry of delivery service or truck driving may find their career becoming increasingly obsolete as automated cars continue to increase in popularity and feasibility. 3) Machine error. A concern arises when the software or car part fails. When a car is relying on its software to function, there is a possibility that it handles an emergent issue worse than how a controlling driver would in the moment."},{"prompt":"Write a short favorable Yelp review of an Italian restaurant called \\"Sicily\\" in the style of Donald Trump praising the food and staff.

This item is considered highly personal so while the classic style of an athame is a silver blade with a black leather hilt, you can choose whatever style or color resonates best with your personal style. 2. Crystals - Various types of crystals all hold their own metaphysical meanings, some of which will be more relevant to your needs than others. But generally, clear crystals are believed to function as amplifiers that strengthen the power of most spells and can serve as substitutes for most other crystal types in a pinch. 3. Candles - Countless spells call for the lighting of a candle to initiate the casting. Candles can also serve to represent the element of fire on your altar. 4. A mortar and pestle - This tool is especially handy for grinding herbs and mixing ingredients for spells. 5. A chalice, goblet, or small bowl - Often, spells will call for a vessel to contain water or another liquid, which may or may not be consumed during the casting. 6. Glass jars with lids - Many spells will prompt you to mix ingredients together in a clear vessel and then store the mixture somewhere. You'll want to have some airtight glass jars handy for your castings. These can also be used to collect moon-charged water. 7. A set of kitchen spices - It may be a bit pricier to buy herbs and spices in sets, but luckily this is a purchase you can multitask with. Lots of herbs and spices commonly used for cooking can also be incorporated into spellcasting, so you can be sure this set won't go to waste. Oth 8. Broom - It's not just a stereotype. Wiccans often use brooms for ritual cleansing before or after spellcasting. 9. A totem, statue, or figurine - You can choose which representation of the divine, if any, you prefer to worship. Many Wiccans decorate their alters with small statues or other items that remind them of the deity or spirit that inspires them most. 10.

Boldy asked the chief of his troop, \\"Why should we be scared? We live in the trees, and we are nimble and clever.\\" The other monkeys told Boldy to quiet down. The chief said there were times that they did leave the trees, and if they didn't take care, the lions would get them then. Besides, this was his decision, and if Boldy didn't like it then he could become chief of his own troop. Boldy replied, \\"I will do you one better. I will become chief of the jungle!\\" Boldy swung from vine to vine until he reached the clearing where the lions lived. Boldy began to hurl fruit from the trees at them. The lions roared. Their king bellowed \\"How dare you!

The Tahexo, an interplanetary collective of aliens, came across planet Earth in their search for rare materials. With shapeshifting abilities, the Tahexo assumed human forms to infiltrate Earth's population, hoping to discover what resources dominate the planet. The aliens discovered something more enticing than minerals: sugar. The Tahexo's planets didn't support the production of sugarcane, thus, the sensation of a chocolate bar hitting their tastebuds for the first time was enough to ignite an unsatiable desire for sweetness. With this, the Great Intergalactic Sugar War had begun. After mobilizing their force of 100,000 on Earth's surface, the Tahexo revealed their true form and superior weaponry to intimidate farmers worldwide into relinquishing their sugar crops with little resistance. These world's militaries united to protect Earth's sugar. But they were no match. The troops were unable to match the sophistication of the Tahexo's ranged weaponry. The UN assembled once again to discuss what could be done to ward off these invaders. They all agreed there was only one hope for saving humanity: George Washington. While still a nascent technology, scientists discovered a way of taking DNA from human remains and injecting it into a blank-slate, lab-grown body to give life to the deceased. The plan worked, and George Washington was born again. However, Washington quickly realized that he too was no match for these aliens. He went for a walk to make a plan when he came across a family of moles burrowing in the ground. He said hello to the moles, and, to his surprise, the mole responded in kind. In the process of extracting his DNA, scientists accidentally gathered some mole DNA from the ground where he was resting. Realizing this newfound ability, Washington explained to the moles what was happening and convinced the moles to help defeat the Tahexo. Moles worldwide began digging under the alien fortifications. Using their hole-digging abilities, they were able to sink the aliens into the ground on which they sat. The aliens were no match for the cunning moles who sunk every last alien into their holes. Not long after, there were no remaining Tahexo left on the surface of Earth.

It was formed by the British-appointed governor of New York William Tyron and the loyalist mayor of New York City David Matthews. (This was not Tyron’s only attempt at sabotaging the colonies: he was also found guilty of running a counterfeiting operation to undermine their already struggling economy.) The plan was to turn members of the Life Guard, Washington’s personal guard, against their commander in chief and assassinate him, leaving the colonies without a leader and giving the British the supreme advantage in the war. It is sometimes assumed that patriots were all loyal to the cause of independence from Britain, but this was not always the case. These were not hardened soldiers but were actually mainly civilians. Farmers, laborers, and others joined in the war effort. They were often not very well off, and the British preyed on that. Some soldiers switched sides when they believed that their side was losing. One of those people was Thomas Hickey. Hickey was a member of the Life Guard that was handpicked by Washington. Hickey was born in Ireland and joined the British Army during the Seven Years’ War. He deserted and joined the Connecticut militia when the American Revolution broke out. He went on to join the Life Guard. It is unclear when Hickey turned to the loyalist cause or if he was always a loyalist, but it is clear that he became part of the conspiracy to kill Washington. Part of his job was to recruit other members of the Life Guard to the loyalist cause.","completion":"During the American Revolution, a group of loyalists planned to assassinate George Washington and other Continental Army leaders in 1776. One of the members, Thomas Hickey, who was part of Washington's Life Guard, was responsible for recruiting new members for the loyalist cause.

The traditional diets of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea differ slightly so there are different versions of the Mediterranean diet. However, in 1993 the Harvard School of Public Health, Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust, and the European Office of the World Health Organization introduced the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid as a guide to help familiarize people with the most common foods of the region. More of an eating pattern than a strictly regimented diet plan, the pyramid emphasized certain foods based on the dietary traditions of Crete, Greece, and southern Italy during the mid-20th century. [1,2] At that time, these countries displayed low rates of chronic disease and higher than average adult life expectancy despite having limited access to healthcare. It was believed that the diet—mainly fruits and vegetables, beans, nuts, whole grains, ﬁsh, olive oil, small amounts of dairy, and red wine—contributed to their health benefits. The pyramid also highlighted daily exercise and the beneficial social aspects of eating meals together.","completion":"There is a wonderful place called the Mediterranean. This includes all the countries next to the sparkling Mediterranean Sea. If you eat the way people in those countries eat, it's called a Mediterranean diet. There is also something called the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid that a Harvard school and the World Health Organization made to help people learn what all the yummy Mediterranean foods are that they can eat. When you hear the word diet, you may think it's about losing weight, but this is actually just a delicious way to eat instead of a strict diet. The pyramid includes some typical foods that the people in Greece and Italy used to eat about a hundred years ago. They liked how people from those countries were so healthy and lived longer even though they didn't have many doctors or hospitals, it was like magic. This is probably because they were eating such yummy healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, ﬁsh, olive oil, a little bit of milk and yogurt, and some red wine. The pyramid also shows that you can make your body very happy if you are active and eat your food together with the people you love."},{"prompt":"What were three of the most popular websites from the 90s and early 2000s?

Present each characteristic on a separate line and in alphabetical order. Stephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837 – June 24, 1908) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897. Cleveland is the only president in U.S. history to serve two non-consecutive presidential terms.[b] He won the popular vote in three presidential elections—1884, 1888, and 1892—though Benjamin Harrison won the electoral college vote and thus the presidency in 1888. Cleveland was one of two Democrats elected president (followed by Woodrow Wilson in 1912) in an era when Republicans dominated the presidency between 1861 to 1933. In 1881, Cleveland was elected mayor of Buffalo, and in 1882, he was elected governor of New York. He was the leader of the pro-business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs, free silver, inflation, imperialism, and subsidies to business, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the era.[1] Cleveland won praise for his honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism.[2] He fought political corruption, patronage, and bossism. As a reformer, his prestige led many like-minded Republicans, called \\"Mugwumps\\", to bolt from the Republican Party's presidential ticket and swing their support to Cleveland during the 1884 election. Fifteen months into his first presidential term, he married Frances Folsom on June 2, 1886.[3] As his second administration began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.[4] Cleveland was a formidable policymaker, and he also drew corresponding criticism. His intervention in the Pullman Strike of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide in addition to the party in Illinois; his support of the gold standard and opposition to free silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party.[5] Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters—depressions and strikes—in his second term.[5] Even so, his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term. Biographer Allan Nevins wrote, \\"[I]n Grover Cleveland, the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense. But he possessed them to a degree other men do not.\\"[6] By the end of his second term, public perception showed him to be one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents, and he was by then rejected even by most Democrats.[7] Today, Cleveland is considered by most historians to have been a successful leader, and has been praised for honesty, integrity, adherence to his morals, defying party boundaries, and effective leadership. Stephen Grover Cleveland was born on March 18, 1837, in Caldwell, New Jersey, to Ann (née Neal) and Richard Falley Cleveland.[8] Cleveland's father was a Congregational and Presbyterian minister who was originally from Connecticut.[9] His mother was from Baltimore and was the daughter of a bookseller.[10] On his father's side, Cleveland was descended from English ancestors, the first of the family having emigrated to Massachusetts from Cleveland, England, in 1635.[11] His father's maternal grandfather, Richard Falley Jr., fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill, and was the son of an immigrant from Guernsey. On his mother's side, Cleveland was descended from Anglo-Irish Protestants and German Quakers from Philadelphia.[12] Cleveland was distantly related to General Moses Cleaveland, after whom the city of Cleveland, Ohio, was named.[13] Cleveland, the fifth of nine children, was named Stephen Grover in honor of the first pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Caldwell, where his father was pastor at the time. He became known as Grover in his adult life.[14] In 1841, the Cleveland family moved to Fayetteville, New York, where Grover spent much of his childhood.[15] Neighbors later described him as \\"full of fun and inclined to play pranks\\",[16] and fond of outdoor sports.[17] In 1850, Cleveland's father Richard moved his family to Clinton, New York, accepting a job there as district secretary for the American Home Missionary Society.[18] Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, his income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school and place him in a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling at the completion of the apprentice contract.[19] In 1853, missionary work began to take a toll on Richard's health. He took a new work assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica), and moved his family once again.[20] Shortly after, Richard Cleveland died from a gastric ulcer. Grover was said to have learned about his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.[20]","completion":"Commitment to the principles of classical liberalism Honesty Integrity Self-reliance"},{"prompt":"Write a sad haiku about the loss of a friend.

The people were cold, just like the weather. With the weight of the village's secrets, it was easier to be quiet and bear your burdens alone. Visitors were few and seldom; they rarely returned. Inevitably, some vacationers who had decided to forgo the traditional luxuries of hotels and vacation planners in favor of saving a few pennies would drive through the narrow pass into Wintersvain. The car would lurch and sputter, inevitably giving out just in front of the only inn available. It was the home of Mr. Crink, who had opened it up to visitors to supplement his income as a butcher. If the idea of raw meat and clean linens sits uncomfortably with you, then you might well understand why some visitors would risk the 3-hour drive to get to the nearest vestige of civilization rather than staying there. Still, the village had charm, if only in the quaint, ghost town kind of way. It might have been more comforting if the village were completely abandoned; that way, visitors wouldn't have to reckon with the unsettling fact that people chose to live there. Houses were sprawled unevenly along the snow banks, an apparent indicator that there had been no housing planner.

No other King had managed to bring peace between the elves and the goblins, but King Tim was determined to do so. So Tim assembled the leaders of the elves and the goblins in his castle. He convinced the goblins to return the woodlands to the elves, and in exchange, he convinced the elves to return to the goblins their gold. King Tim showed equal compassion to both the goblins and the elves. Thus, peace was brought to the Kingdom of Rhodan for now the elves and the goblins were both happy. Every year, King Tim would invite the elves and the goblins together to the dining halls of his castle to break bread and dine together so they could celebrate what became known as the Day of Peace. Everybody lived happily ever after."},{"prompt":"What is the Dream Team in basketball?","completion":"The Dream Team refers to the 1992 American Olympic basketball team. 1992 was the first year that NBA players were allowed to compete in the Olympics.

Staff economists had previously predicted weakened growth, but the severity of the crisis has heightened concerns. This marks the first recession forecast during the current cycle. The Federal Reserve responded with a smaller interest rate increase to address the crisis and mitigate the fallout. The banking stress, slowing inflation, and a cooling labor market suggest an end to rate hikes. Lawmakers are calling for investigations and additional regulations to prevent future crises. The implications are far-reaching as the US economy teeters on the edge of a recession. A potential downturn could have significant consequences, affecting businesses, job markets, and consumer spending. It also poses a critical challenge for policymakers who must strike a delicate balance between curbing inflation, ensuring financial stability, and implementing measures to mitigate the impact of the banking crisis. The coming months will be crucial in determining the trajectory of the US economy and the effectiveness of measures taken by the Federal Reserve and lawmakers to steer it towards a path of recovery and stability."},{"prompt":"Write a tweet about wanting gun laws in the United States","completion":"Gun control is needed here in the US!!

Scan the text below to find out... A bilirubin blood test measures the levels of bilirubin in your blood. Bilirubin is a yellowish substance made during your body's normal process of breaking down old red blood cells. Bilirubin is found in bile, a fluid your liver makes that helps you digest food. If your liver is healthy, it will remove most of the bilirubin from your body. If your liver is damaged, bilirubin can leak out of your liver and into your blood. When too much bilirubin gets into the bloodstream, it can cause jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow. Signs of jaundice, along with a bilirubin blood test, can help your health care provider find out if you have liver disease. Other names: Total serum bilirubin, TSB A bilirubin blood test is used to check the health of your liver. The test is also commonly used to help diagnose newborn jaundice. Many healthy babies get jaundice because their livers aren't developed enough to get rid of enough bilirubin. Newborn jaundice is usually not harmful and clears up within a few weeks. But in some cases, high bilirubin levels can lead to brain damage, so infants are often tested as a precaution. Your provider may order a bilirubin blood test: If you have symptoms such as jaundice, dark urine, or stomach pain. These could be symptoms of hepatitis, cirrhosis, or other liver diseases. They may also be signs of gallbladder disease. To find out if there is a blockage in the bile ducts, the tubes that carry bile from your liver. To check on an existing liver disease or disorder. To diagnose disorders related to problems with breaking down red blood cells. High bilirubin levels in the bloodstream may be a sign of a condition called hemolytic anemia. In this condition, the body destroys red blood cells faster than it makes them. A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. Your health care provider may tell you to fast (not eat or drink) for four hours before your blood test. If there are any other special instructions, your provider will let you know. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. Normal results can vary, but high bilirubin levels may mean your liver isn't working right. However, abnormal results don't always mean you have a medical condition that needs treatment. Other things may cause higher than normal bilirubin levels, such as certain medicines and foods or strenuous exercise. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider.","completion":"Having too much bilirubin in the bloodstream can lead to jaundice, a condition that causes the skin and eyes to turn yellow."},{"prompt":"Can you help me with something, please?

It should be aimed at beginners and include why using an acrylic wash is a good idea.","completion":"I know many of my readers are interested in model-building, which is awesome! Whether you're scratch building, 3D printing, or kitbashing, you'll almost always need to paint your model. But how do you get your textures to really pop? After all, you've spent time creating them; you want to show them off, right? Acrylic washes are one great way to enhance your textures and provide a contrast that shows your model in the best light. Using a wash also ties together the colors and surfaces of your model. So what is an acrylic wash? It's simply watered-down acrylic paint. Here are some tips: 1. In most cases, your wash should be a dark color, like black, brown, or blue. The point is to enhance the darker areas of your work. 2. You'll want to dilute your paint down quite a bit with water to the point that it flows freely. You're basically just making colored water, only slightly thicker. 3. You can vary how thick your wash is depending on the look you're going for. 4. Brush the wash liberally over your entire model. You may want to avoid or mask off any clear or translucent areas. 5. With a paper towel, wipe most of the wash off. Leave it to dry on its own if you want a super grungy look. That's it! You can do the wash after you've painted the model with other colors to tie the look together. You can even do a wash more than once! The light areas of your model can be brought out with a bit of dry brushing, which I'll cover next time!

Research suggests that handedness is not determined by a single gene but rather by a complex interaction of genetic factors. For instance, a study published in the journal \\"Brain\\" in 2019 identified four genetic regions that may influence left-handedness, one of which is involved in brain symmetry. On the environmental side, prenatal factors such as exposure to hormones in the womb might affect handedness. There's also some evidence suggesting that birth stress could potentially influence a shift to left-handedness. The percentage of left-handed individuals varies somewhat across different cultures and societies but is generally estimated to be around 10%. There's ongoing research investigating whether cultural attitudes towards left-handedness might influence the prevalence rates reported in different societies."},{"prompt":"Suggest some creative ways (less than ten options) to promote my business without using Facebook.","completion":"1.

In today’s world, it’s a huge disadvantage not to have your own business website. You may not have to rely on social media with a website! Using a blog, you can optimize keywords in order to rank high in search engine results. This can make you highly visible to prospective customers. 3. Don’t underestimate the power of PR! Getting featured in the news, magazines, and other online articles can definitely skyrocket your business success without Facebook. 4. Podcasts can greatly promote your business, and it’s easier than many realize. Since you’ll be on major platforms, it’s a possibility your podcast will be recommended to thousands of people. 5. Traveling and public speaking bring your business back to a classic marketing tactic that will never go extinct: word of mouth. Once others have attended your event, they can go on to tell others all around the world. 6. If you can grow an email list, you might find that you don’t need to use Facebook to market your business. 7. Paying for ads is always an option to grow your brand without Facebook. You can customize nearly every aspect of your ad, even where it shows up for others!

This is the state that warned librarians to “err on the side of caution” when choosing books, or risk being charged with a third-degree felony for exposing kids to materials that run afoul of vague laws on what’s appropriate. It’s also the state where inappropriate or sexual material is more times than not flagged in books by LGBTQ and Black authors, held up by conservative activists as examples of perversion in our schools. Florida is the state that bans teachers from discussing sexual orientation or gender identity in all grades and limits how they can talk about race. It’s got a Legislature that made it more onerous for districts to approve and review books. Where schools preemptively asked teachers to remove books from their classrooms until they conducted that review process. Let’s keep in mind that this year the Florida Legislature passed a bill that allows any person in a county to challenge a book and force a district to pull it out of circulation until it goes through a review. If a parent disagrees with a district’s ruling on that challenge, they can appeal to the governor-appointed commissioner of education, who will most likely be all ears. No wonder a parent convinced a North Florida district to remove a novel about school segregation called “Little Rock Nine” — based on real events in U.S. history — from elementary schools even though it is at a third-grade reading level. Who needs book burnings when fear creates its own chilling effect? Who needs government censors when you have groups like Moms for Liberty skimming books to look for any hint of sexual content, no matter its literary value and appropriateness for upper grades, content that makes white people uncomfortable or so-called leftist indoctrination?","completion":"Florida has recently passed multiple bills dealing with what books can be kept in schools.

In fact, many of his novels have become so popular that they were used as the baseline for a major motion picture. Here are three of his most notable books. 1. The Notebook - 1996 Having just returned from serving in World War II, Noah begins the massive task of refurbishing a large plantation on the coast of North Carolina. As he works, he recalls a summer romance that he had over a decade before with a girl named Allie. Determined to see if a summer romance could be true love, Allie makes a trip back to North Carolina where she must make some hard decisions about love and life. 2. Message in a Bottle - 1998 Theresa, a divorced woman who is on vacation finds a mysterious bottle by the sea with a love note inside. The message is written by an unknown man to his lost lover. Despite her apprehensions about love since she was betrayed by her ex-husband, the journalist within Theresa is intrigued and the bottled message leads her on a hunt to locate the owner. 3. A Walk to Remember - 1999 Set in 1958, the story follows a boy named Landon and a girl named Jamie as they navigate high school, life, and love.

The rear wing of an F1 car is a very important part of the car's aerodynamics. It helps the car go faster by creating downforce, which is a force that pushes the car down onto the track. This helps the car grip the track better and go around corners faster. The rear wing is located at the back of the car, and it looks like a big flat airplane wing. It's made up of two parts: the main plane and the flap. The main plane is the big, flat part, and the flap is the smaller, adjustable part that can move up or down. When the car is going in a straight line, the flap is usually set at a very small angle to the main plane. This creates a small amount of downforce, which helps the car grip the track better. But when the car is going around a corner, the flap can be adjusted to a steeper angle. This creates more downforce, which helps the car go around the corner faster without sliding off the track. So, the rear wing of an F1 car is a very important part of the car's aerodynamics, helping it go faster and grip the track better by creating downforce. Therefore basically, an F1 car is designed to be really fast by using the power of the wind, and the shape of the car and its wings help it stay on the ground and go even faster.

It’s been 15 years since the release of Toy Story. Woody, Buzz Lightyear and the rest of Andy’s toys have become indelible parts of our movie-going culture, much like Mickey Mouse, Cinderella and Snow White. Ever since that big hit in 1995, Pixar has put out one quality film after another, including most recent masterpieces WALL-E and Up. But while those two films introduced new worlds and characters, the creators of Toy Story 3 faced the immense challenge of not only living up to the quality of the previous two installments in the series, but not desecrating those beloved characters by delivering a limp third part to the trilogy. I am happy to report that Toy Story 3 is not only one of Pixar’s best films, but perhaps the best of the Toy Story trilogy. Returning to the familiar themes, mainly the feelings of insecurity and obsolesce that come with the passage of time, Toy Story 3 picks up years after the second part. Andy is now ready to head off to college and Woody and friends are déclassé, relegated to a toy chest. But when a horrible mistake almost sends the gang off to the garbage dump, Buzz Lightyear makes a decision that re-routes the toys to a daycare center with the hope that someone will play with them. Unfortunately, a mafia of toys already rules this daycare and a plush teddy bear named Lotso (Ned Beatty) and a Ken doll (Michael Keaton) conspire to banish Andy’s toys to the infant classroom, a fate worse than death. Naturally, it is up to Woody to save them. Even though Toy Story 3 hews to a similar format of the previous installment, that doesn’t mean it lacks thrills, laughs, excitement and peril. Essentially a prison break film, Toy Story 3 also makes knowing references to film noir, Westerns and numerous other filmic tropes. Pixar has always made movies that can be appreciated on many levels, and this one is no exception.","completion":"Here is the summary you asked for. Toy Story 3 faced the difficult challenge of maintaining the quality featured in the first two films, but it succeeds in that challenge. Toy Story 3 is one of Pixar's best films and one of the best installments in the Toy Story series. The film takes place with Andy heading to college, where his classic childhood toys are mistakenly sent to a garbage dump before Buzz reroutes them to a local daycare. They find out that the daycare is run by what amounts to a toy mafia headed by Lotso, a toy bear. The toys must find a way to survive being sent to the infant room and escape their way from the daycare. This movie takes its inspiration from many genres of film including film noir, westerns and more."},{"prompt":"Imagine you are Anne Frank and write a new diary entry from her perspective.

Burt and I had been married for 42 years and had 6 children and 14 grandchildren. It was very surprising to others that he didn’t say the three words that meant so much to people worldwide. The words were not important to me, though. I continued with my speech, “This is not to say he did not love me. He made me coffee every day of the week except Sunday because he knew I didn’t want to have coffee before church. Burt would stop by the store on Thursday and pick up some strawberries so I would have them for my book club meetings. He would call me the second he knew he was going to be working late so that I wouldn’t worry.

Burt was there for me in the ways that I needed.” At this point, I am tearing up. Burt was my everything and I loved that man when every part of my soul. My oldest, Oliver, comes up to the stage and wraps me in his arms. Ben and Mary follow and add their embraces.

He has done something wrong and he doesn't want to face the consequences. In an attempt to escape the scolding, climbs up a tree so his mother can't reach him. After he escapes that, a bee comes buzzing around and stinks him really bad. Then he quickly climbs down and goes to his mother.

He was always up to no good, causing trouble and making a mess wherever he went. One day, he did something really bad – he broke his mom's favorite vase while playing ball inside the house. His mom found out what he had done. She scolded him and told him he was grounded for a week. Timmy didn't want to be grounded, so he decided to run away from home. He snuck out of the house and ran, trying to escape his mom's scolding. As he ran, he came across a tall tree with sturdy branches. Without hesitation, he climbed up the tree in the hopes that his mom wouldn't be able to reach him. He sat atop the tree, safe from his mom's scolding, or so he thought. Suddenly, a bee came buzzing around Timmy. Timmy was terrified of bees - he tried to swat the bee away, but it was too late. The bee stung him, and Timmy let out a loud cry! Timmy quickly realized that he couldn't stay up in the tree any longer. He climbed down the tree, and ran straight back to his mother, crying all the way.

MH: And now we're seeing a similar picture for clean electricity? SS: Yes, we very much see the same thing happening in the power sector. And, in fact, there's not just one but a series of tipping points. I would say that the first one was when new solar and wind power became cheaper than new coal and gas power – and that's already in the rear-view mirror. That's the case in the vast majority of countries in the world. A second one that we're already beginning to pass now is new solar and wind generation becoming cheaper than existing fossil fuel generation. So, in other words, it's cheaper to build a solar or a wind plant than it is to keep shovelling coal into a coal power station or piping gas into a gas power station. A third tipping point, which we're coming up towards, is when renewables plus energy storage become cheaper than coal and gas power. There's a piece of analysis from researchers at Exeter University which predicts that by the end of this decade, solar power plus storage will be half the cost of coal in big markets, in the EU, China, India, Japan, the US. So actually, we'll cross that tipping point really soon in the next few years.","completion":"1) When new solar and wind power became cheaper than new coal and gas power 2) New solar and wind generation becoming cheaper than existing fossil fuel generation 3) When renewables and energy storage become cheaper than coal and gas power"},{"prompt":"Who was the youngest president?

Please review this information and provide a summary of why earthquakes happen and what happens during an earthquake. An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth, or tectonic plates, suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter. Sometimes an earthquake has foreshocks. These are smaller earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake that follows. Scientists can’t tell that an earthquake is a foreshock until the larger earthquake happens. The largest, main earthquake is called the mainshock. Mainshocks always have aftershocks that follow. These are smaller earthquakes that occur afterwards in the same place as the mainshock. Depending on the size of the mainshock, aftershocks can continue for weeks, months, and even years after the mainshock!","completion":"An earthquake is the result of two tectonic plates colliding as they move past each other.

Here are some ways in which the Fourth Amendment governs how police conduct investigations while protecting individual rights: 1. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects all citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons and their property, unless by a search and seizure warrant, and only if the warrant details the probable cause of the search or seizure, the person or things to be seized, and the locations where these things will be found. 2. Probable cause is the legal standard that police officers must adhere to when seizing (arresting) a person or searching a person, place, or thing. Probable cause is defined as that which would cause a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed and that the person being seized is the one who committed the crime, or that the place or thing being searched contain fruits of the crime (i.e. evidence). 3. When an officer has probable cause to seize a person, place, or thing or search said person, place, or thing, they will draft a search warrant that will be reviewed by a judge and filed with the court of jurisdiction where the crime took place. 4. Sometimes exceptions to the search warrant rule will still warrant a seizure or search if the exception has been previously recognized by the courts through a previous ruling, and when requiring a search or seizure warrant would have put an excessive burden on the police to prevent the death or injury of another person, property damage, or the destruction of evidence. Examples of this include the exigent circumstance exception (police not searching or seizing immediately would result in someone getting killed or hurt, such as arresting a person without a warrant as they are in the process of attempting to kill someone), or plain view exception (a police officer sees a person attempting to flush drugs down a toilet in their residence, so a search warrant may not be needed to enter the home and retrieve the drugs before they are destroyed.) These are just some examples of how the intricacies of the Fourth Amendment play a significant role in how police officers conduct business."},{"prompt":"What is wrong with this code?

Rollmops are a bit of a delicacy and are not enjoyed in many places around the world. If you try to break down the word for yourself, may conjure up an image of a special type of cleaning instrument in your head. However, this is far from what a rollmop is. In this article, we will talk about what rollmops are and where they originated from. What Are Rollmops? A rollmop is a unique food that consists of pickled herring fillets that have been rolled into a cylindrical shape, stuffed with fillings, and fastened together with skewers before being stored in brine. Rollmop fillings typically include vegetables such as onion, pickled cucumber, and pitted green olives stuffed with pimento peppers. The brine that rollmops are stored in traditionally contains water, vinegar, and salt, but can also contain a variety of other additives. These optional extras include sugar or other sweeteners, raw onion slices, peppercorns, and mustard seeds. Where Did Rollmops Originate From? The name ‘rollmop’ is German in origin, making it friendly for many English speakers. This food has been a staple in countries in Northern Europe since the medieval period. It also had a spark in popularity in Germany in the early 19th century and is currently served as part of a traditional German hangover breakfast. Currently, rollmops are eaten in parts of Europe, South America, the United States, and Canada. Rollmops are also unbelievably popular in present-day Czechia and Slovakia. Conclusion Rollmops are not a food that will be suited to everyone’s tastes. Especially for those who do not enjoy seafood, vinegar, or pickled vegetables, this dish may seem very offputting.

A vet has warned pet owners to be very careful when using oil diffusers in their homes, as certain oils can prove fatal for dogs. This comes after a grandmother shared how her beloved pooch was poisoned by the oils in her diffuser, and was left unable to recognise her when she returned from working a late shift as a nanny. Sharing her warning on Facebook, Marrianne Whyte explained that she'd initially assumed she'd woken her dog up from a dream, in which he had been experiencing night terrors, but found he was \\"still acting weird\\" the next day. After turning off her new diffuser, Marrianne noticed that her pet's condition started to improve, but didn't make the connection straight away. Marrianne set off for another shift, but ended up returning home early after receiving a worrying call from her dog sitter. In her post, which has been shared more than 1.5 million times, Marrianne, who lives in New Zealand, wrote: \\"[She] said that he wouldn't come out from under the bed. It was very odd as he is a happy dog. \\"I came from work early and again, he was very confused about who I was. So I took him to an emergency vet. It turns out that the tea tree oil I was using in the diffuser is toxic for dogs.\\" Thankfully, tests confirmed that Marriane's dog hadn't suffered liver damage, but they \\"weren't out of the woods yet\\", and the vet gave him fluids under his skin to get rid of any toxins. Vet clinic Pets on Parker told 7life that cats are also at risk of being poisoned by essential oils because they don't have a liver enzyme called glucuronyl transferase, which is required to break them down. The experts explained: \\"Their livers are slower at eliminating these compounds, which can lead to toxic build-up. While dogs do not lack this enzyme, they are still sensitive to essential oils and can become very sick if exposed to them. \\"Common signs of poisoning as a result of inhalation (usually from an oil diffuser) include laboured breathing, lack of coordination and difficulty walking, drooling, diarrhoea, lethargy, depression, low body temperature, weakness, muscle tremors, and vomiting.\\"","completion":"What is the issue? Dog owners must be very careful when using oil diffusers in their homes, particularly ones containing tea tree oil. Tea tree oil can be lethal for dogs. What happened to the dog? The dog was poisoned by the oils in the owner's diffuser. What happened? The poor dog was left unable to recognise her when she returned from working a late shift as a nanny. Did Marrianne Whyte warn other dog owners? Marrianne Whyte shared her warning on Facebook. How many times has her post been shared? Her post has been shared 1.5 million times. When did she realise there was something wrong with her dog? When she tried to wake her dog up, she thought the dog had been having a dream, or been experiencing night terrors. Had the dog recovered the next day? The next day she found that the dog was \\"still acting weird\\". Marrianne set off for another shift but had to return home early after receiving a worrying call from her dog sitter because the dog wouldn't come out from under the bed. It was very out of character because he was a happy dog. After returning home early from work Marrianne Whyte found the dog in a confused state. Did she take the dog to the vet? She took the dog to the emergency vet. What did the vet diagnose? It was then she discovered that the tea tree oil in her diffuser is toxic for dogs. What happened to the dog? There is a happy ending to the story because fortunately, tests confirmed that Marriane's dog hadn't suffered liver damage. What treatment did it receive? The vet gave the dog fluids under his skin to get rid of any toxins. Are cats at risk from tea tree oil? Cats are also at risk of being poisoned by essential oils. Why is tea tree oil dangerous to cats? Cats don't have a liver enzyme called glucuronyl transferase, which is required to break them down. Cats' livers are slower at eliminating these compounds, which can lead to toxic build-up. Why is tea tree oil dangerous for dogs? Dogs, like me, do not lack this enzyme, but we are still sensitive to essential oils and we are liable to become very sick if exposed to them. What are the symptoms of poisoning? Owners can look out for common signs of poisoning as a result of inhalation from an oil diffuser, by watching for laboured breathing, lack of coordination and difficulty walking, drooling, diarrhoea, lethargy, depression, low body temperature, weakness, muscle tremors and vomiting."},{"prompt":"Write a silly alternative to \\"Happy Birthday\\" that's in the same format of the original song.

It comprises the blood vessels, lungs, and airways. The respiratory system also includes the muscles that move your lungs. Together these components circulate oxygen throughout the body and remove waste gases like carbon dioxide. The respiratory system serves a variety of purposes. In addition to assisting with breathing, it also: • It enables you to speak and smell. •It also warms the temperature of the air to that of your body and moisturizes it to the humidity levels a body needs. •Provides the body cells with oxygen •Enables a body to exhale waste gases from the body •Keeps irritants and harmful substances out of the airways. The main muscle used for breathing is the diaphragm, which is situated below the lungs. It is a sizable, dome-shaped muscle that frequently contracts continually and rhythmically. The diaphragm's role in breathing is it contracts and tightens during inhalation and the chest cavity widens. This creates a vacuum through the contractions, drawing air into the lungs. The diaphragm relaxes and assumes its dome-like shape during exhalation, forcing air out of the lungs."},{"prompt":"Write a short story about an extremely lucky girl.

She loved to skateboard and she loved to surf, so the beach is where you would usually find her. One day, as Lucy was walking down the beach, she noticed something shiny poking out of the sand. She walked over and scooped it up, letting the excess sand fall out of her hand, revealing a glittering diamond in her palm. Lucy traced the diamond with her fingers and held it up to the sun, she was entranced by its beauty. As she examined it, somebody had become aware of what she had found. A man started to creep up behind her so that he might take the diamond and run off with it. As he got closer, a fish flopped out of the water and landed in between Lucy and the man. Lucy turned and looked at the man and the fish, they both stood still for a few seconds before the man lunged at her. At that exact moment, a shark exploded out of the water, knocking the man down and eating the fish on the ground. The shark then flopped and slid back into the ocean, leaving the man knocked unconscious on the sand. A patrolling officer notices the commotion and Lucy tells him what had happened.

After he helped the Panthers upset the Toronto Maple Leafs in five games in the second round, with a 1.89 goals-against average and .943 save percentage, Bobrovsky stopped 168 of 174 shots in 16-plus periods of play in the sweep of the Hurricanes for a 1.12 GAA, .966 save percentage and one shutout. Before Tkachuk scored the winning goal in the fourth overtime of a 3-2 victory in Game 1 against Carolina, Bobrovsky made 63 saves to get the Panthers to that point. It was a similar story in a 2-1 overtime victory in Game 2 when Bobrovsky made 37 saves to put Tkachuk in position to be the OT hero again. Bobrovsky's 32 saves in a 1-0 victory in Game 3 for his first Stanley Cup Playoff shutout made it eight straight games in which he allowed two goals or fewer. He allowed three goals in Game 4, but still made 36 saves, in a 4-3 victory.","completion":"Look, I'll admit it, I've been playing really well. There's no secret there.

Make it a bulleted list. Diana, Princess of Wales, formerly Lady Diana Frances Spencer, was born on 1 July 1961 at Park House near Sandringham, Norfolk. She was the youngest daughter of the then Viscount and Viscountess Althorp, now the late (8th) Earl Spencer and the late Hon. Mrs Shand-Kydd, daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy. Until her father inherited the Earldom, she was styled The Honourable Diana Spencer. Viscount Althorp was Equerry to George VI from 1950 to 1952, and to The Queen from 1952 to 1954. Lady Diana's parents, who had married in 1954, separated in 1967 and the marriage was dissolved in 1969. Earl Spencer later married Raine, Countess of Dartmouth in 1976. Together with her two elder sisters Sarah (born 1955), Jane (born 1957) and her brother Charles (born 1964), Diana continued to live with her father at Park House, Sandringham, until the death of her grandfather, the 7th Earl Spencer. In 1975, the family moved to the Spencer seat at Althorp (a stately house dating from 1508) in Northamptonshire, in the English Midlands. Lady Diana was educated first at a preparatory school, Riddlesworth Hall at Diss, Norfolk, and then in 1974 went as a boarder to West Heath, near Sevenoaks, Kent. At school she showed a particular talent for music (as an accomplished pianist), dancing and domestic science, and gained the school's award for the girl giving maximum help to the school and her schoolfellows. She left West Heath in 1977 and went to finishing school at the Institut Alpin Videmanette in Rougemont, Switzerland, which she left after the Easter term of 1978. The following year she moved to a flat in Coleherne Court, London. For a while she looked after the child of an American couple, and she worked as a kindergarten teacher at the Young England School in Pimlico.","completion":"- Park House near Sandringham, Norfolk - Spencer Deat at Althorp, Northamptonshire, English Midlands - West Heath near Sevenoaks, Kent - Insitut Alpin Videmanette, Rougemont, Switzerland - Coleherne Court, London"},{"prompt":"Change the setting to hell and the guards to demons The morning siren goes off. Glaring florescent lights go on above us. Guards bang their truncheons on our metal bunks. All around me, the girls sit up and yell. We leap to attention at the entrance to our cubicles for the morning count. Then it’s a mad dash to the latrines, where there are no mirrors, thank God. And we jump into our sweats and run into line. I get mixed up. I forget who I’m supposed to stand behind—all the bald heads look alike—and I get my first reprimand of the day. The clock reads 4:35. We jog out of our barracks into the chilled morning air and join the other platoons on the parade grounds for PT and a run. I don’t want the guys to see me with my head shaved, even though I don’t know them, even though everyone else’s head is shaved, including all of theirs. Spotlights shine down on us from above—a whole yard full of bald-headed kids doing push-ups, sit-ups, jumping jacks, and lunges. “For those of you who have just arrived, I’ll explain,” the warden says through a megaphone. “You are standing in front of the Supermax Unit of the prison. Some of you will end up in this building because you are unwilling to change your lives. In this building, you will be confined to your cell twenty-three hours a day. I guarantee that when you are sitting there, listening to me make this little speech every morning, you will wish you had taken advantage of the opportunity you have here today.” Then he starts reciting something and everyone joins in. It’s some kind of motto. Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the fastest lion, or it will be killed. Every morning, a lion wakes up also. It knows it must outrun the slowest gazelle or it will starve to death. It doesn’t matter whether you are a lion or a gazelle. When the sun comes up, you had better be running. Then, we run. I was on the track-and-field team in junior high, but by high school I had Kicker and other things to think about. The run is slow, but I still lag behind, and no amount of screaming by the guards will make me move faster. My headache is gone, but my mood isn’t good, and I step it up just to avoid punching someone. Lunch is more swill on a shingle. Then it is time for Stripes. “These are the Stripes of Shame,” the platoon captain says, holding up a smock with bold black and white stripes across it and a big letter P on the back. “These are the only garments made especially for this prison. Some of you will make them during your work duty. You wear these while performing community service. They show the taxpayers of this state that their money is being well spent. Today, this platoon will be picking up trash in a city park. You will be chained. You will be guarded. And you will be silent. Any attempt to engage in conversation with a non-prisoner will be interpreted as an attempt to escape. And you do not want that.” I put on my smock. We are loaded into trucks, and I’m shackled to the girl next to me. I notice that her hair is fuzzy with stubble and I wonder how long it will take for mine to grow that much. “I used to work in a video store,” she says. “I saw everything.” “I saw some army movies on TV too,” I whisper back. “Everything old is new again.

The blinding glow of infernal lights illuminated the cursed domain, casting sinister shadows that danced along the walls. Demonic guards, with their razor-sharp horns and sulfurous breath, slammed their truncheons against the metal bunks, jolting the imprisoned souls from their fitful slumber. The air echoed with their spine-chilling screams as they bellowed orders. Amidst the clamor, the souls rose from their charred resting places, their eyes filled with a haunting despair. With trepidation, they lined up in their cubicles, their gazes fixed straight ahead, awaiting the morning count. The guards, grotesque demons with smoldering eyes, conducted the ritualistic inspection, ensuring the presence of every damned soul. Time seemed to crawl as the wretched captives shuffled through the dimly lit corridors, hurrying to the fetid latrines. In the absence of mirrors, they spared themselves the torment of seeing their wretched visages, their heads shaven clean, a stark symbol of their damned existence. Clad in threadbare garments, the souls marched outside, braving the oppressive heat that enveloped the infernal realm. They converged with other platoons on the scorched parade grounds, a desolate expanse where their infernal punishments took shape. The platoon captain, a towering demon with bat-like wings, addressed the tormented gathering, his voice dripping with malice. \\"Welcome to the training grounds of eternal suffering,\\" the platoon captain snarled, his voice resonating through the sulfurous air. \\"Here, you will endure physical torment that matches the depths of your sins. You will run, you will sweat, and you will learn the true meaning of despair.\\" As the platoon captain continued his diabolic sermon, the souls stood motionless, their minds clouded with a mix of fear and resignation. The captain recited a haunting mantra, a twisted creed of survival within the infernal abyss. \\"In the fiery depths of Hell, there is no rest for the weak,\\" the captain proclaimed, his voice echoing with sadistic delight. \\"Every soul must strive to outpace their fellow tormentor or risk descending further into the abyss. Whether you be demon or damned, heed my words—when the flames rise, you must run.\\" And so, they ran. The main character, their spirit weary and broken, dragged themselves along, their every step burdened with the weight of their sins. The demonic guards, their monstrous forms towering over the tortured souls, barked commands and lashed out with fiery whips, their taunts and jeers fueling the captives' desperate resolve. The main character, their head throbbing with infernal pain, pushed forward, an embodiment of defiance amid the relentless torment. The midday respite brought no reprieve from their anguish. Instead, they were subjected to another vile meal—nauseating concoctions served on tarnished platters. The platoon captain, a demon of sadistic delight, introduced the \\"Stripes of Shame\\" with malevolent glee. The striped garments, adorned with hellish symbols of punishment, served as a constant reminder of their fallen status. The platoon captain's words dripped with venom as they explained the purpose of these garments—to humiliate, degrade, and remind the condemned souls of their eternal damnation. Chained and silenced, the souls were led like a procession of broken spirits, their striped smocks billowing in the sulfurous wind. They were herded into the accursed wagons, their limbs shackled to one another, their every movement restricted. It was during this treacherous journey, bound by the chains of their collective misery, that the main character encountered Julie Martin, a soul ensnared by her association with a wretched lover. They found solace in their shared predicament, a glimmer of camaraderie amidst the labyrinth of damned souls. Julie remarked bitterly, \\"Most girls in here have their lives tarnished by their wretched taste in companions.\\""},{"prompt":"What is the concept of quantum computing, and how does it differ from classical computing?","completion":"Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations using quantum bits, or qubits.

Bumblebees are known as social bees and live in colonies. Their nests have a yearly cycle and can contain 50 to 500 occupants. They don’t look like your typical beehive as the nest entrance of the colony can usually be found in the ground. Bumblebees work their entire lives feeding and protecting the colony, particularly the queen bee. If a bumblebee feels as if the safety of the colony is threatened or the bee is provoked, it will sting. Carpenter bees are solitary insects and are often described as harmless (to humans, but not your wooden deck!). Female carpenter bees create their nest in wood, using their strong jaws to chew through porches, doors, and other wooden materials. They prefer soft, weathered and unpainted wood. While female carpenter bees do have stingers, they rarely use them. This only occurs if the bee is seriously provoked. Male carpenter bees are very protective but do not possess a stinger.

It spun stories of amusement and intrigue, and the two grew intimately close. Whenever Penny felt low or lonely, she would clamber up to the attic, nestle by the chest, and listen to its tales.

There were orchards that grew yummy gummy fruit along the edges of the meadow where the bears' village could be found. They lived off of yummy gummy fruit and Swedish fish that they caught from the stream that flowed down the mountain. The bears never used more than needed and were always grateful to Mother Gummy Nature. When they first came to the Land of Gummy Yum, they did so with another gummy kind that they had cohabitated in their previous home of Candy Land. These gummies were known as the Gumble Wumble Worms. No one is quite sure of what exactly divided the gummy communities after they reached Gummy Yum, but divided they definitely became. The bears were taught at a young age to never venture towards the coastal jungles of Gummy Yum, where the Gumble Wumbles dwelled. Little ones of the bear community were always teasing each other with scary stories from gummy lore that told of savage gummy worms that feasted on little bears. Lemon Limey Bear and Cheery Cherry Bear were two little bears that were B.G.F.F.s or Best Gummy Friends For Life. They were both very curious bears. Since the moment they heard the stories of the savage worms, both little brave-spirited gummies had been ready to investigate for themselves. One evening, Limey arrived at Cheery Cherry's house for a planned slumber party. Cheery's parents had gone to Gummy Resort and Casino for the weekend and her older sister was put in charge of watching the younger gummies. To her dismay, Cheery's older sister eventually found that the best friends were nowhere in the house. They were headed on an exploration of the coastal jungle gummy regions. When the little gummy friends arrived at the outskirts of the jungle, they didn't even hesitate. Both of them plunged into the jungle, full steam ahead. They were so excited and exhilarated as they ran through the jungle brush, they hardly even felt it when they were eaten by an Anaconda-sized Gumble Wumble Gummy Worm that ended their sweet little gummy lives that day."},{"prompt":"Create a conversation between Yoda and his gardener.

WHEN IT COMES TO CUSTOMIZING YOUR HOUSE TO FIT YOUR LIFESTYLE, CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS OF REMODELING THE HOUSE: By changing the layout of a room with house renovations, you can customize how you utilize space. Using light fixtures in the perfect spot will change any ambiance or mood you want for that particular part of your home. A porch swing might be just what your back porch needs if it is currently not something offered within its design. A fireplace in your living room will add a focal point and cozy feel to any space and add benefits for warmth during colder winter nights. Building an addition will provide benefits for extra square footage and make use of underused space. Add a lazy susan to that awkward corner cabinet for easier access to all of your dishes without moving them around. Get rid of the off-brand appliances and update with some stainless steel as well as built-in microwaves! Large trees provide shade and privacy in your outdoor space.","completion":"Hey! I've got some tips to share for anyone looking to change up things around the house and make it more lively. First: you don't need to focus on big changes! There are lots of things you can do that can make a big impact with a small investment. Here are a few: New light fixtures (even standing or tabletop ones) can easily change the mood of a room, especially with the options at your disposal. Consider dimmable lights, RGB lights, or candelabra fixtures for example. A porch swing or other outdoor furniture can inspire you to spend more of your time outside, making a cozier environment to be in. Both of these are just scratching the surface of some of the relatively low-cost and low-effort improvements you can make at home. Something as simple as changing the layout of a room can make a big difference, too. It can change the way you manage your routine, or your workflow if you work from home in a bedroom office, for instance. As we go on, I'll talk about things that require more funds or work to do, but they're quite fulfilling to get done, and make for a much better home both for yourself (and any family that lives with you or may inherit it) or if you ever decide to sell. Something you may not often think of is cabinet accessibility in your kitchen. Surprisingly, it can make a big impact with something so seemingly insignificant, like putting a lazy susan mechanism in your corner cabinets. It makes it a lot easier to get things out since you don't have to strain yourself reaching to the back and over other things stored in them. Other kitchen improvements include updating your appliances. I know it isn't the most compelling option, but it can make a huge difference to have something more modern with better ease of use, and it looks prettier, too! Some people prefer to settle for what's usable though, and that's okay; just remember to pick what most suits your needs. If you've got a lot of unused space in your lot, there are plenty of things you can do with it. One that can have a surprising impact on the overall quality of the home is tastefully populating your yard with plants such as trees and bushes. The trees can provide shade, privacy, and places for things like swings or feeders for local birds, and bushes can be super pretty ways of accentuating spaces in your yard. One that's more complicated, but can massively increase the value of your property is adding an addition to your house. It's a great way of adding new functions and square footage, as you can have one or more extra rooms to dedicate to activities or living. Even though it requires a lot of time and work, it's very rewarding with the increase in value and use of your home: I wouldn't recommend it to newcomers, but it's a great longer-term project for experienced home improvers! Thanks for reading along. I hope these suggestions have given you ideas about how you can tailor your home to fit your needs, especially if these led you to your own creative ideas! I look forward to seeing home improvement being more commonplace, especially since it's such a fulfilling thing to do. Stay creative!"},{"prompt":"I'm visiting New Orleans next month and need some ideas on where to go while I'm there. I enjoy live music, art galleries, historic locations, and museums.

Unlike any other vertebrates, a turtle's shell is a modified ribcage and part of the vertebral column that has grown outward to fuse with the overlying skin and scales, called scutes. This unique structure provides turtles with a sturdy and resilient shield against predators, offering protection to their softer body parts. The shell's upper section, called the carapace, is domed and can deflect direct attacks, while the lower section, or plastron, safeguards the turtle's belly. Some species, such as box turtles, even have a hinge on their plastron, allowing them to completely close their shell for maximum protection. The shell also aids in camouflage and, in aquatic species, can assist in streamlining for swimming. While often perceived as a passive form of defense, a turtle's shell is a dynamic tool crucial to their survival across diverse environments."},{"prompt":"Write a post of less than 175 words about how outsourcing is a good investment in a small business.

Adalina was no ordinary fairy. No one knew why, but she had no wings. And, what’s more, she was a Princess, daughter of the Great Fairy Queen. As she was so tiny, like a flower, life was just a series of problems for her. Not only couldn’t she fly, but she hardly had any magical powers, since fairy magic comes from their delicate crystal wings. So, from an early age, Adalina had depended on the help of others for many things. She grew up thanking people, smiling and being friendly, so naturally all the creatures in the forest were delighted to help her. But when she reached the age to become Queen, many fairies doubted she could be a good Queen with such a disability. They argued and protested so much that Adalina had to agree to take a test in which she would have to demonstrate to everyone the wonders she could work. The little fairy became extremely sad. What could she do? She was hardly magic at all, and couldn't even travel far with those little legs of hers. But while Adalina sat on a stone next to the river, trying to think of something that would surprise the other fairies, the news of the test was spreading among the friendly forest animals. Before long, hundreds of creatures were by her side, ready to help her however she needed. -“Thank you so much, little friends. I feel much better with you by my side,” she said with the sweetest of smiles, -\\"but I don't know whether you'll be able to help me.\\" -“Of course we will!” answered the squirrel, -“Tell us, what will you do to surprise those foolish fairies?” -“Wow…. if only I could, I would love to capture the first ray of sunshine before it touches the Earth, and keep it in a dewdrop, so that when it was needed it could be used as a lantern for all who live in the forest. Or… I’d also like to paint a rainbow in the night sky, under the pale moonlight, so that the nocturnal creatures could see its beauty… But I don’t have any magic or any wings to keep it in…” -“Well, you must have your magic kept somewhere else then! Look!\\" an old tortoise shouted excitedly, as it flew through the air, leaving a trail of green behind it. It was true. When Adalina had been telling her friends of her deepest wishes, a wave of magic had washed over them, and there they all were, flying through the air, making a magic rainbow, and capturing not just one but hundreds of rays of sunshine within fine drops of water that filled the sky with tiny brilliant lamps. For the whole day and night you could see squirrels, mice, frogs, birds and fish leaping through the sky, filling it with light and colour, in a spectacle never seen before and that filled the forest dwellers with delight. Adalina was declared Queen of the Fairies, despite her not knowing from where such a powerful magic had come. And it wasn’t until some time later that the young Queen understood that she was the first of the Great Fairies, whose magic is to be found not in one's wings but within all one’s true friends.","completion":"Adalina was disparate. She was the only fairy who didn't have wings, and no one knew why. Furthermore, Adalina was the daughter of the Great Fairy Queen, making her a princess. Adalina was as petite as a flower. However, life didn't treat her delicately. Throughout her life, she constantly faced problems. She couldn't fly and she had barely any magical powers. This is because fairy power comes from the wings. Therefore, Adalina had to depend on others for help. She was extremely grateful for the help she would receive. She made sure that she always smiled and thanked people. Adalina was loved by the forest creatures due to her affectionate nature. When the time came for her to be Queen, many people doubted her abilities since they did not deem her as powerful. The people protested and argued against it, and Adalina felt as though she had to take a test in an attempt to exhibit the miracles she could spawn. This worried the fairy because she knew she did not have the powers expected of her. She can not even travel far distances with her small legs. Adaline sat on a stone near the river and attempted to think of a solution that would leave the fairies astonished. Eventually, the amiable forest animal heard the news of the test that Adalina would have to take. Shortly after, hundreds of the creatures came by her side, prepared to help for as long as necessary. \\"Thank you, friends. I feel better now that you all are with me.\\" she said with a beloved smile, \\"but I'm not sure whether you'll be able to help me.\\" \\"Of course, we will!\\" the squirrel answered, \\"What is your plan for surprising the imprudent fairies?\\" \\"Well, if only there was a way.

Unfortunately, I don't have the magic required or the wings to keep the dewdrop in.\\" \\"You must have your magic kept elsewhere then! Look!\\" an old tortoise eagerly shouted, as it flew through the air, leaving a trail of green behind it. The old tortoise was right. Whilst Adalina had been discussing her profound wishes, magic had taken over. They were all flying through the air, producing a magical rainbow and capturing not only one but hundreds of sunshine rays. They were confined within fine water droplets that occupied the sky with miniature gleaming lamps. Throughout the day and night, squirrels, mice, frogs, birds, and fish could be seen leaping across the sky, providing it with color and light. This performance has never been witnessed before, which captivated the forest dwellers. Adalina was appointed Queen of the Fairies, even though she was unaware of where the powerful magic had transpired. It isn't until later that the young Queen realized that she was the first of the Great Fairies whose magic was not found in their wings but within her sincere friends."},{"prompt":"Write a journal entry from a young boy about his first day of high school.","completion":"Dear Journal, Today I attended high school for the very first time. I had only seen the school in passing when Dad would drop me off at intermediate school just down the street. I always knew I would be going to this high school since it was close to the intermediate school and most of the kids who went to my school would end up going there too. I was surprised at how big the school was. There was a big square courtyard in the middle of the school called \\"the quad\\" where students would walk on their way to their classes. My classes were very far apart, literally at opposite ends of the school. I am very tired now from all the walking around. But I enjoyed my first day of high school.

Everyone seemed like they were determined to study and work hard, and hardly anyone disrupted the class during lessons. Lunch was great. There were so many different foods, and you could get more than one meal as long as you paid for it. They even had chocolate milk! I really enjoyed today's meal: roast turkey with gravy and stuffing. The cafeteria was crowded but the building was so big that there were still many seats where I could sit down to eat. I met some new people today. I also got to see my old friends from intermediate school. I have several classes with my old friends and I made new friends in the other classes. Overall, I am really enjoying high school.

Please convert the provided information into a detective's journal entry. A panel of historians set up to review the 1972 attack on the Munich Olympics is starting its three-year mission to examine what happened before, during and after the events of five decades ago on Tuesday, the German government said. In April, Germany's Interior Ministry named the eight-member international commission of experts, most based in Israel or Germany. That was part of an agreement last year with relatives of the 11 Israeli team members who were killed by Palestinian militants. The panel's first meeting was being held at the Interior Ministry on Tuesday. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser pledged that “the events surrounding this terrible attack will finally be examined thoroughly and transparently.” “The research findings should deliver answers to the many unresolved questions — answers which the German government has owed the victims’ family members and the public for more than 50 years,” Faeser said in a statement. Her ministry said there would be “regular publications and events.” In September, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier apologized for multiple German failures before, during and after the attack as he joined his Israeli counterpart and relatives of the slain athletes at a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary. Days earlier, an agreement for the relatives to receive a total of 28 million euros (30 million) in compensation headed off a threatened boycott of the event. The sum included much smaller payments made earlier. Germany also agreed to acknowledge failures by authorities at the time and to set up the expert review. On Sept. 5, 1972, eight members of a Palestinian group called Black September clambered over the Olympic village's unguarded fence. They burst into the building where the Israeli team was staying, killing wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg and weightlifter Yossi Romano. Some Israeli athletes managed to escape but nine were seized. The captors demanded the release of more than 200 Palestinians held by Israel and two German left-wing extremists in West German prisons.","completion":"Entry: 30th May, 2023 The task at hand is no common one, not a mere question of theft or deceit, but of unearthing long-buried secrets from the tumultuous past. It seems the German government, still haunted by the ghosts of the tragic 1972 Munich Olympics, has entrusted the monumental task of unraveling the events of yesteryears to a group of esteemed historians. In the spring month of April, the German Interior Ministry carefully selected an assembly of eight learned minds, mostly hailing from Israel or the Fatherland, in response to an agreement with kin of the unfortunate Israeli athletes. Lives were lost to the ruthless hands of Palestinian militants, a wound that remains open to this day. Today, under the stoic gaze of the Interior Ministry's stone walls, they held their maiden meeting. Nancy Faeser, a woman of high authority and Minister of Interior, was solemn in her pledge that the dark clouds shrouding the events of the horrendous attack would finally part to let in the light of transparency. \\"The answers which we owe to the victims' family members and the public shall finally be given, answers that have been entombed for more than 50 years,\\" she declared with firm resolve. The Ministry's plan was clear: regular publications and scholarly events to slowly but steadily lift the veil of mystery. As I recollect, the German President, one Frank-Walter Steinmeier, offered his public apologies for the German shortcomings, extending his remorse to the Israeli nation and the relatives of the fallen athletes. This was during a ceremony in September, marking half a century since the dark incident unfolded. In an attempt to ameliorate the situation, the German state proposed a settlement of 28 million euros for the bereaved, a part of which had been disbursed prior. An admission of previous authorities' inadequacies was made, as well as the promise of a deep-dive review. The shadows of that grim day on Sept. 5, 1972, remain in the annals of history. Eight members of the notorious group Black September breached the Olympic village's paltry defenses. The Israeli team's quarters became the setting for a macabre scene, with the wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg and weightlifter Yossi Romano losing their lives in the ensuing struggle. As the harsh narrative of the past unfolds, it's clear some Israeli athletes made a successful escape, while others weren't as fortunate. The truth, it seems, is still hidden in the shroud of time, and this new commission seeks to unveil it. The stage is set, and I shall keep my eye on the proceedings."},{"prompt":"President Biden is 80 years o?d this year and the olden president to hold office.

Dozens and dozens of excited children and sleepy parents filled the building. The facility contained three different pools, and all of them were child depth. In some lanes, newborn babies bounced in the arms of their parents, splashing and giggling. In other lanes, slightly older children were learning to take their first paddles all on their own. The little girl in our story was one of those “first paddlers”. She loved jumping and splashing in the pool, and so doing everything on her own. She looked to the side wall where her father was sitting. “Daddy, watch this!” she shouted, before leaping off the steps and propelling towards the platform set up in the water. Daddy smiled. She had come such a long way in these classes and could now really do lots of things on her own. The first half of class involved instruction on things like flipping and back floats, but the second half of class was the little girl’s favorite part. Less instruction, and more splashing! They got to take turns jumping off the deck of the pool, only to turn around, return to the deck, and pull themselves out. She was determined to make the biggest splash she’d every done today. Her leap was so big, and her splash was so giant, it was hard to argue she didn’t succeed. Class ended with a “washing machine” where all the kids hang on the teacher while she spins them around in the water. Everyone giggles and laughs at that one. Leaving the pool, she ran back to her daddy who was waiting with a towel to make her dry and warm. A quick rinse, and change of clothes, and it might be time for the two of them to grab a post class treat. The little girl loved these fun Sunday mornings spent just with her dad."},{"prompt":"Write a blog post listing the 5 best-selling games on PlayStation 1.

The Texas House of Representatives has voted to impeach Attorney General Ken Paxton, an unprecedented move following a legislative probe that faulted the third-term Republican for a yearslong pattern of corruption, including abusing his office’s powers, retaliating against whistleblowers and obstructing justice. Under state law, Paxton is now temporarily suspended from his duties as attorney general and will await a Senate trial. The vote was 121-23, with two members voting “present.” “The evidence is substantial. It is alarming and unnerving,” said GOP Rep. Andrew Murr, chair of the General Investigating Committee, during his closing statement following hours of debate. The committee recommended 20 counts of impeachment against Paxton. Democrat Rep. Harold Dutton was one of the members voting present. He said the impeachment vote had been rushed. “The process by which we’re getting this done seems to be abbreviated to the point that it just encroaches on due process,” said Dutton. Paxton denied wrongdoing in a Friday news conference, but focused his statements against the impeachment this week on his record as a key opponent of President Joe Biden. Paxton’s office has filed dozens of lawsuits against the Biden administration. The now-suspended attorney general called the impeachment a “politically motivated sham” in a statement just minutes after the vote. “The ugly spectacle in the Texas House today confirmed the outrageous impeachment plot against me was never meant to be fair or just,” he said. Paxton said he was never given a chance to present evidence refuting the findings of an investigation that he abused his office. He has cast House Speaker Dade Phelan, a Republican who presides over a chamber where his party currently holds 85 seats to Democrats’ 64, as a “liberal.” He continued his attack on Phelan saying, “Phelan’s coalition of Democrats and liberal Republicans is now in lockstep with the Biden Administration, the abortion industry, anti-gun zealots, and woke corporations.” The Office of the Attorney General issued its own “comprehensive report” about the allegations following the impeachment vote, saying it “unequivocally refutes incorrect testimony” against Paxton. The office also released a report it commissioned from an outside law firm, although the report from Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard and Smith LLP notes it is based only on information and testimony provided by the attorney general’s office. Republican Governor Greg Abbott can appoint a provisional replacement while Paxton is temporarily suspended. Paxton would be reinstated if he is acquitted at his Senate trial. The impeachment vote had its origins in an investigation launched in March by the General Investigating Committee of the Texas House after Paxton had asked the legislature to approve 3.3 million in government funds to settle a lawsuit with four whistleblowers who were fired from his office. That investigation led the committee – a five-member panel investigating corruption in state government – to approve 20 articles of impeachment Thursday, setting up the vote in the full House. During the debate Saturday, Rep. Charlie Geren, who is a Republican, claimed Paxton had threatened fellow House members. “I would like to point out that several members of this House, while on the floor of this House doing the state’s business, received telephone calls from General Paxton personally threatening them with political consequences in their next election,” Geren said. Opponents of the impeachment largely declined to address the allegations against him, instead focusing on the investigation leading up to the proceedings. “I don’t think today is about whether there’s guilt or innocence. It’s about the process,” said Rep. Tony Tinderholt. “I’m not here to defend Ken Paxton,” Rep. John T. Smithee stated on the floor. He went on to say, “What you’re being asked to do today is to impeach without evidence. It is all rumor. It is all innuendo. It is all speculation.” Paxton’s impeachment is a stunning rebuke of a Republican official in a state where the GOP controls all levers of state government. Voters in Texas shrugged off the swirling scandals around Paxton last year, handing him a third term in November’s election. Paxton had earlier fought off multiple opponents for the GOP nomination, including Bush family scion George P. Bush, the state land commissioner, whom he easily bested in a runoff. Paxton has long been a controversial figure who has clashed with Texas legislative leadership. A conservative who has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump, he led a lawsuit in 2020 seeking to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election. He retains support within the Texas GOP. In a statement Friday, state party chairman Matt Rinaldi blasted Phelan for what he called a “sham impeachment.” “The voters have supported General Paxton through three elections – and his popularity has only grown despite millions of dollars spent to try to defeat him. Now the Texas House is trying to overturn the election results,” Rinaldi said, adding that he was looking to the “principled leadership” of the Senate to “restore sanity and reason for our state.” In Texas, no attorney general has ever been impeached and removed from office. The only two elected officials to lose office as a result of impeachment were Gov. James Ferguson in 1917 and District Judge O.P. Carrillo in 1975. For Paxton to be removed from office, two-thirds of the Texas Senate’s members who are present will have to vote to convict him. His wife, Angela Paxton, is a state senator representing a Dallas-area district. It’s not yet clear when the Senate, where Republicans have a 19-12 majority over Democrats, will conduct its trial. The state’s legislative session is scheduled to end Monday.","completion":"The Texas House of Representatives has shockingly voted to impeach third-term Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton.

The vote was 121-23, with two members voting “present.” Even more shocking, this was primarily a case of Texas conservatives investigating one of their own. Rep.

Paxton said he was never given a chance to present evidence refuting the findings of an investigation that he abused his office. Paxton has pointed out House Speaker Dade Phelan, is quite possibly a “liberal.” saying, “Phelan’s coalition of Democrats and liberal Republicans is now in lockstep with the Biden Administration, the abortion industry, anti-gun zealots, and woke corporations.” The Office of the Attorney General issued its own “comprehensive report” about the allegations following the impeachment vote, saying it “unequivocally refutes incorrect testimony” against Paxton. The office also released a report it commissioned from an outside law firm, although the report from Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard and Smith LLP notes it is based only on information and testimony provided by the attorney general’s office. The impeachment vote had its origins in an investigation launched in March by the General Investigating Committee of the Texas House after Paxton had asked the legislature to approve 3.3 million in government funds to settle a lawsuit with four whistleblowers who were fired from his office. Opponents of the impeachment largely declined to address the allegations against him, instead focusing on the investigation leading up to the proceedings. “I don’t think today is about whether there’s guilt or innocence. It’s about the process,” said Rep. Tony Tinderholt. “I’m not here to defend Ken Paxton,” Rep. John T. Smithee stated on the floor. He went on to say, “What you’re being asked to do today is to impeach without evidence. It is all rumor. It is all innuendo. It is all speculation.” Many cannot help but wonder if the time and effort was worth it here, given his massive popularity. Paxton had earlier fought off multiple opponents for the GOP nomination, including Bush family scion George P. Bush, the state land commissioner, whom he easily bested in a runoff. Some might wonder if this was borne of jealousy from less popular members of the Texas legislative branch. Paxton has long been close with former President Donald Trump, and led a lawsuit in 2020 seeking to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election. Just like with the voters, Paxton retains plenty of support within the highest ranks of true Texas GOP leaders. In a statement Friday, state party chairman Matt Rinaldi blasted Phelan for what he called a “sham impeachment.” “The voters have supported General Paxton through three elections – and his popularity has only grown despite millions of dollars spent to try to defeat him. Now the Texas House is trying to overturn the election results,” Rinaldi said, adding that he was looking to the “principled leadership” of the Senate to “restore sanity and reason for our state.” It’s not yet clear when the Senate, where Republicans have a 19-12 majority over Democrats, will conduct its trial. This may all be merely an attempt for low level Texas RINOs to gain attention for themselves."},{"prompt":"What are some food and drinks I can make using coffee or with a coffee flavor?","completion":"There are more ways to use coffee in food and drink than one might think. Below is a variety of ideas for recipes to utilize a delicious coffee flavor. - Coffee smoothie: You can use any common smoothie ingredients you like, but banana, cocoa, dates, and milk are good ingredients to start with. - Espresso martini: You can’t go wrong with this classic cocktail. All it takes is freshly brewed espresso, coffee liqueur, and vodka. - Irish coffee: You can make this from scratch, or you can just mix Bailey’s Irish cream into any coffee beverage, hot or iced. - Coffee cake: This cake is a classic coffee-flavored sweet thought to go well with coffee or tea. - Tiramisu: Similar to coffee cake, tiramisu is a classic dessert that comes to mind when thinking of coffee-flavored desserts. - Chocolate cake: Many classic chocolate cake recipes mix coffee into the batter or replace water with coffee to add an extra richness to the flavor profile. - Coffee-flavored waffles: To get the flavor for this one, you’ll need espresso powder to mix into the batter, and perhaps more to sprinkle on top of the finished product. - Coffee ice cream: If you have an ice cream maker, all you really need is instant coffee, sweetened condensed milk, and cream to create coffee-flavored ice cream. - Coffee-rubbed steak: Ground coffee beans combined with some of your favorite seasonings and spices make an excellent rub for a steak. - Bourbon and maple sweet potatoes: For this one, you’ll roast the sweet potatoes and then a coffee reduction is utilized in a delicious sauce mixed with syrup and bourbon. - Pulled pork: If cooking this in the slow cooker, you can add a bit of brewed coffee to really enhance the flavors and leave behind a scrumptious gravy. - Bacon jam: Wherever you want to use this jam is up to you, but the bacon flavor mixed with coffee and bourbon (amongst other ingredients) is a surefire way to mix up any cheese board or sandwich. - Salted honey and chocolate bark: This one may require a bit of extra work, but this sweet and salty candy is a delicious use of crushed coffee beans."},{"prompt":"Write a 300-350 word 3-4 paragraph story about a boy who is getting into collecting pennies and finds a key-date penny","completion":"The sun has risen on a calm Saturday, and morning is here.

The rings are a real showstopper, the atmosphere is wild and unpredictable, and the planet's temperature is colder than a Yeti's nose. All in all, it's an out-of-this-world experience that's worth the long trip. Just make sure to pack some thermal undies, patience, and a sense of humor. I like to call Saturn our solar system's *Lord of the Rings*. It's such an amazing planet, Saturn delivers! Saturn is like the Queen Bee of the solar system, with blinged-out rings that put the most extravagant of diamonds to shame. Those rings, made of countless particles of ice and rock, create a sparkling spectacle that makes Saturn the most fashion-forward planet in our neighborhood. And let's talk about Saturn's love of earth tones. Saturn is a beautiful blend of yellow, brown, and beige. Its colors swirl and sway, putting on the most beautiful show for all to see. But the atmosphere, with winds that can reach up to 1,000 mph, makes you think that Saturn is angry. It throws massive storms that can last for months. As for Saturn's hospitality, well, let's just say that this planet isn't exactly a bastion of warmth. With an average temperature of -285 degrees F, you'd better bring all of the space blankets if you want to visit. I can't review Saturn without mentioning Saturn's sense of humor. It's got a bit of a reputation for being a prankster, thanks to its habit of playing tricks on astronomers throughout history. First, it was Galileo, who mistook the rings for \\"ears\\" on the planet. Then it was Christiaan Huygens, who thought the rings were two separate planets until he clarified and saw that they were discs around the planet. So, in conclusion, while there are a few cons in the meteorological categories, Saturn is mostly \\"pros\\". I would highly recommend a trip there if you're looking to visit a planet that's a little bit flashy, mysterious, and a whole lot of fun!"},{"prompt":"I am planning a surprise vacation for my best friend's birthday.

Here is the article In Christopher Nolan’s The Prestige, we follow the lives of two magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale respectively. We get introduced to them as two young men who want to make it big in the showbiz of magic until something goes terribly wrong which causes them to become dreadful rivals of each other. This ruthless competition causes both of them to become obsessed with each other. What is the secret of the other? What is their trick? Can it be surpassed? Needless to say, this obsession doesn’t bode well for either of them. The most common advice on competition is two-fold: “competition is for losers” and “compete with your past self.” Both sound great but aren’t always super helpful. Let me elaborate. Your ultimate goal is to become a monopoly and get out of the rat race. That is what the first adage is all about. This essentially means: don’t play others’ games. Do things differently. Create your own game. This is good advice but you don’t always have the luxury to create your own rules, especially when you are only trying to get promoted before your (rival) friend. The second adage is about having a growth mindset. Competing with others can be stressful and in fact degrade our performance. We should instead measure ourselves against our past selves and see how far we have come. This will definitely give us a sense of accomplishment. Also, we should measure ourselves against our future ideal self. This will give us a sense of purpose.","completion":"In the film 'The Prestige' by Christopher Nolan, the two antagonists in the story are magicians who become dreadful rivals.

Starting the morning off right can help you have a good attitude for the rest of the day and can lead to completing more organization and cleaning tasks. 2. Clean out the fridge weekly. This should be done the night before trash pick up for maximum efficiency. Throw out everything that won't be eaten to make room for new groceries and to make it easier to see your food options. 3. Put aside 20 minutes for cleaning and organizing every day. Instead of putting everything off to do at once, take small steps toward your goal every day. Spend 20 minutes on one task, such as cleaning out one corner of the bedroom or kitchen counter. 4. Empty the dishwasher every morning. Completing this task in the morning will make it easier to load the dishwasher after meals later in the day when you have less energy. 5. Start a load of laundry before work.

Part of this is because of the rise of streaming. While 30 Rock was never a ratings winner in its day, people have consistently discovered it years later on Netflix and Peacock. But it’s also the way that the show’s astute satirization has aged so well. This past winter, for example, saw the premiere of MILF Manor on TLC, a show with more than a passing resemblance to the 30 Rock cinematic universes’s MILF Island. The “MILF Island” episode comes in the series’ second season, a high point in a show full of them. It’s a season that also sees Jack Donaghy’s relationship with Congresswoman Celeste “CiCi” Cunningham (Edie Falco), Carrie Fisher’s guest appearance, “Werewolf Bar Mitzvah,” Sandwich Day, and the whole cast coming together for a rousing performance of Gladys Knight & the Pips’ “Midnight Train To Georgia.” The latter moment comes at the end of “Episode 210,” an installment that serves both as a midseason premiere and a makeshift finale. The script was the final one written before the 2007-08 writers’ strike, and when the episode was filmed in November, no one knew when they would be able to return to production. The strike wasn’t a surprise; the series included a joke four episodes prior about a news crawl on MSNBC being affected by it. “Episode 210” was filmed a month before the strike officially kicked off, so it stands to reason that there was enough time to plan a gag to go out on. The whole episode builds to this gag. When a cappuccino machine finds a home on Kenneth’s desk, he becomes addicted to caffeine, eventually dubbing New York the “21st-century city of Sodom,” and now that he’s been “sodomized,” he chooses to pack it up and board the train back to his home in Stone Mountain, Georgia. Cue Gladys Knight, who herself had been mentioned previously in the episode.","completion":"The previous writers' strike took place in the years 2007 and 2008, and the season two 30 Rock episode \\"Episode 210\\" was the final script written before the strike began.

The cold was a shock to his system and he complained endlessly about how much he hated the Artic and would rather live in hell. As we mushed over the Dawson Trail one Christmas Day, the weather was particularly bitter. The cold seeped in through our heavy parkas and stung like nails. Sometimes, if we closed our eyes for too long the lashes would freeze them shut and we'd be temporarily blinded. Everyone on the expedition was unbearably cold, but it was only Sam McGee who whined aloud. That night, we built our camp and fed the dogs. The men and I packed in like sardines beneath the snow and bundled in robes to fight against the cold. Nights in the Artic are often starry and beautiful, and that night was no exception. I was watching the stars twinkle and glow when Sam McGee leaned over to me and informed me that he expected to die on this trek and that he had a request of me. Sam was so sorrowful that I humored him as he moaned about the frigid cold eating him to the bone.

Keep it under 400 words and make it conversational in tone.","completion":"Tips for Kids and Teens to Catch Some Quality Sleep Long-term sleep disturbances and deficits can be detrimental to your kids’ health. Try our proven sleeping tips to ensure your child is getting enough restful sleep and developing good sleep hygiene. *Don't be a Clock Watcher Tell your child to stop staring at the clock and counting down the time that’s left for them to wake up. Either turn the clock around or put it out of sight. Obsessing about how much time you have left to sleep can be a major distraction. *Wind Down with a Routine Set a fixed routine before bed to signal your brain that it's time to call it a night. Try taking a bath, reading, or doing some light stretching to get your body and mind ready for sleep. *Sleep-Friendly Foods What you eat can impact your sleep quality. Avoid sugary, or spicy foods before bed. They can cause indigestion, especially in heavy foods. Go for sleep-friendly snacks like bananas, almonds, or a warm cup of chamomile tea. *Nap Smart If you don't want to throw off your nightly sleep schedule, timing your naps during the day is key. Don’t nap too late in the day or for too long. Keeping naps around 20-30 minutes can help you feel refreshed without interfering with your nighttime sleep. *Boo Busters Encourage your kids to think of a brave, confident superhero who can fight off any nighttime fears that might come their way. This will help them fall asleep easier and avoid nightmares. *Quiet Quackers Are your kids kept awake by the sounds of the outside world? Give them earplugs or a noise machine to block out any distracting sounds and help them drift off to sleep peacefully. *Tick-Tock Timers It's good to have a proper bedtime every day to train your body to know when it's time to sleep. Set a consistent sleep schedule for your child. Start with a set bedtime that allows them to get the recommended amount of sleep for their age. *Dreamy Drifters Some kids may feel restless or anxious before bedtime. You can tell them to try gentle stretches. Deep breathing exercises and mental visualizations can also calm the mind and prepare the body for quality sleep."},{"prompt":"How many sizes of soccer balls are there?","completion":"FIFA officially recognizes five soccer ball sizes: - Size 1: Measures 18 - 20 inches, but can sometimes vary - Size 2: Measures 20 - 22 inches, used to practice ball control - Size 3: Measures 23 - 24 inches, \\"Junior\\" - SIze 4: Measures 25 - 26 inches, \\"Youth\\" - Size 5: Measures 27 - 28 inches, \\"Standard\\" FIFA regulations also dictate that balls be inflated between 8.5 and 15.6 psi."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this review as questions and answers.

Four players are required for this game, and they're paired up into two teams. It's a relatively simple game, but what makes it unique is that it's played with only a partial deck. Most people use a 24-card deck, while others use a British Euchre set with 25 cards. The object of the game is to be the first team to reach a certain number of points, and you win these points by grabbing tricks. - Spades. This game is often played with two teams of two, but it can also be played with just two players. During each hand, players estimate how many tricks they think they can take with the hand they've been dealt - keeping in mind that spades are wildcards. Get ready to wager against your opponents! - Oh Pshaw. This game doesn't require partners, so it can be played by three to seven players. Each consecutive hand will have more cards as cards are progressively dealt as the game goes on. The trump card is important and changes every round. This is a lively game that will keep you on your toes! - Pitch. This is another single-player game that can be played with three to seven players, but it can be adapted to play with two teams of two. It involves bidding on tricks, and the player with the highest bid becomes the pitcher. There are a lot of complicated rules and scoring methods in this game, so it would be a good choice for a regular card night that allows the players to get a lot of practice!"},{"prompt":"Write an intense drama about two roommates deciding who gets the last slice of pizza.

They bought their weekly pizza and began to idly take slices, enjoying it immensely. But when it came down to the last slice, they crowded around the box and stared each other down. \\"Thinking of taking the last slice, are we?\\" James said in an accusatory tone. He knowingly placed his hand close to the box, as if making clear his challenge. \\"Yes, I was. We wouldn't want the pizza to go to waste, would we?\\" Patrick responded icily, as he responded by placing both hands on the table close to the box, one-upping James' gesture. The two stared daggers at each other, and they began to circle the box of pizza like predators who had cornered their prey. This would go on for at least ten minutes, and with each minute their stress and intensity grew, as they knew the pizza would not stay fresh and warm for too long.

His father, Junius Brutus Booth and his brothers Junius Brutus and John Wilkes, the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln, were actors. Traveling with his father, Edwin Booth observed the acting in that period the bombastic. In 1849, he made his stage debut as Tressel to his father’s Richard III.

Like most entrepreneurs, I struggled through my first year of building a business. I launched my first product without having any idea who I would sell it to. (Big surprise, nobody bought it.) I reached out to important people, mismanaged expectations, made stupid mistakes, and essentially ruined the chance to build good relationships with people I respected. I attempted to teach myself how to code, made one change to my website, and deleted everything I had done during the previous three months. To put it simply, I didn’t know what I was doing. During my Year of Many Errors I received a good piece of advice: “Try things until something comes easily.” I took the advice to heart and tried four or five different business ideas over the next 18 months. I’d give each one a shot for two or three months, mix in a little bit of freelance work so I could continue scraping by and paying the bills, and repeat the process. Eventually, I found “something that came easily” and I was able to focus on building one business rather than trying to find an idea. In other words, I was able to simplify. This was the first thing I discovered about figuring out what to focus on. If you want to master and deeply understand the core fundamentals of a task you may, paradoxically, need to start by casting a very wide net. By trying many different things, you can get a sense of what comes more easily to you and set yourself up for success. It is much easier to focus on something that’s working than struggle along with a bad idea.","completion":"Attempted to teach me how to code -> Made one change to my website.

Turn off the Tech: Instead of starting your day scrolling through social media or emails, put down your phone and give your brain a break. Allow your mind to fully wake up and gather thoughts before immersing yourself in the digital world. 2. Mindful Me Time: Dedicate some time each morning to self-care activities such as yoga, meditation or journaling. By putting yourself first, you set the tone for a more productive and focused mindset throughout the day. 3. Simplify Your Style: Plan your outfit the night before and lay out your clothes to eliminate any wasted time trying to decide what to wear. It helps you efficiently streamline your mornings. Avoid meal prep during your morning routine by organizing your breakfast the night before. Overnight oats or a pre-packed smoothie will save you time and set you up for a healthier start to your day. 4. Give thanks: Start each day with a moment of reflection to appreciate the good things in your life. A little gratitude can boost your mood and put you in a more positive frame of mind. 5. Step out: Whether it's for a quick walk or just to stand and take in the fresh air, getting outdoors can do wonders to awaken your senses and help you feel more alert. Incorporate light stretches or exercise into your morning routine. Even 5 or 10 minutes of movement can energize your mind and body while setting an efficient tone for the day ahead. 6. Start with Your Bed: Surprisingly, taking a few minutes to make your bed can give you a sense of accomplishment and order, setting the tone for a more productive day.

This classification contains all extinct and extant animals. They do not produce their own food. 2. Plants: Plants are complex multi-celled autotrophic organisms. This means they produce their own food through a process called photosynthesis. 3. Fungi: Fungi are multi-celled organisms. They do not produce their own food. 4. Protista: Protista are single-celled organisms. They are more complex than both eubacteria and archaebacteria. 5. Eubacteria: Eubacteria are single-celled organisms found almost everywhere, from within living organisms to ecosystems such as the ocean, hot springs, dry deserts, and soil. 6.

Nikola Tesla’s Early Years Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father was a priest in the Serbian Orthodox church and his mother managed the family’s farm. In 1863 Tesla’s brother Daniel was killed in a riding accident. The shock of the loss unsettled the 7-year-old Tesla, who reported seeing visions—the first signs of his lifelong mental illnesses. Did you know? During the 1890s Mark Twain struck up a friendship with inventor Nikola Tesla. Twain often visited him in his lab, where in 1894 Tesla photographed the great American writer in one of the first pictures ever lit by phosphorescent light. Tesla studied math and physics at the Technical University of Graz and philosophy at the University of Prague. In 1882, while on a walk, he came up with the idea for a brushless AC motor, making the first sketches of its rotating electromagnets in the sand of the path. Later that year he moved to Paris and got a job repairing direct current (DC) power plants with the Continental Edison Company. Two years later he immigrated to the United States. Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison Tesla arrived in New York in 1884 and was hired as an engineer at Thomas Edison’s Manhattan headquarters. He worked there for a year, impressing Edison with his diligence and ingenuity. At one point Edison told Tesla he would pay 50,000 for an improved design for his DC dynamos. After months of experimentation, Tesla presented a solution and asked for the money. Edison demurred, saying, “Tesla, you don’t understand our American humor.” Tesla quit soon after. 1. The shock of his brother’s death turned him into a mystic—at age seven. The defining event of young Nikola’s childhood was the day he witnessed the death of his older brother Dane in a riding accident. In the years following the tragedy, Tesla (the son and grandson of Serbian Orthodox priests) began seeing visions […] Nikola Tesla and Westinghouse After an unsuccessful attempt to start his own Tesla Electric Light Company and a stint digging ditches for 2 a day, Tesla found backers to support his research into alternating current. In 1887 and 1888 he was granted more than 30 patents for his inventions and invited to address the American Institute of Electrical Engineers on his work. His lecture caught the attention of George Westinghouse, the inventor who had launched the first AC power system near Boston and was Edison’s major competitor in the “Battle of the Currents.” Westinghouse hired Tesla, licensed the patents for his AC motor and gave him his own lab. In 1890 Edison arranged for a convicted New York murderer to be put to death in an AC-powered electric chair—a stunt designed to show how dangerous the Westinghouse standard could be. Buoyed by Westinghouse’s royalties, Tesla struck out on his own again. But Westinghouse was soon forced by his backers to renegotiate their contract, with Tesla relinquishing his royalty rights. In the 1890s Tesla invented electric oscillators, meters, improved lights and the high-voltage transformer known as the Tesla coil. He also experimented with X-rays, gave short-range demonstrations of radio communication two years before Guglielmo Marconi and piloted a radio-controlled boat around a pool in Madison Square Garden. Together, Tesla and Westinghouse lit the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and partnered with General Electric to install AC generators at Niagara Falls, creating the first modern power station. Nikola Tesla’s Failures, Death and Legacy Play Video In 1895 Tesla’s New York lab burned, destroying years’ worth of notes and equipment. Tesla relocated to Colorado Springs for two years, returning to New York in 1900. He secured backing from financier J.P. Morgan and began building a global communications network centered on a giant tower at Wardenclyffe, on Long Island. But funds ran out and Morgan balked at Tesla’s grandiose schemes. Tesla lived his last decades in a New York hotel, working on new inventions even as his energy and mental health faded. His obsession with the number three and fastidious washing were dismissed as the eccentricities of genius. He spent his final years feeding—and, he claimed, communicating with—the city’s pigeons. Tesla died in his room on January 7, 1943. Later that year the U.S. Supreme Court voided four of Marconi’s key patents, belatedly acknowledging Tesla’s innovations in radio. The AC system he championed and improved remains the global standard for power transmission.","completion":"1) Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Croatia. 2) In 1894, Tesla was photographed with his friend Mark Twain. 3) Between 1898 and 1900, Tesla live in Colorado Springs. 4) Tesla earned 2.00 a day for digging ditches in New York."},{"prompt":"Please write three short paragraphs as writing prompts.

Mention that the coyote was scared off by the homeowner's cat and give helpful suggestions from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.","completion":"A coyote entered a Woodland Hills home through a doggie door in the middle of the night and was scared off by a cat. The incident happened around 4 a.m. on May 5, 2021, at a home on Marlow Circle Boulevard. The homeowner, Mia Sands, said her brother was sleeping when he heard the doggie door open. He looked around and saw his two dogs, but no one else. Then, he heard his cat, Lily, meowing and screaming. He went to investigate and saw a coyote standing in the living room. The coyote was startled by the sight of the man and ran out the doggie door. Sands said she was relieved that no one was hurt, including her cat. She said Lily is a 14-year-old cat who is not used to being around coyotes. Sands is warning other pet owners in the area to be aware of coyotes. She said she will no longer leave her doggie door open at night. Coyote experts say that humans are mostly to blame for the increase in coyote encounters. They say that people should remove items that attract coyotes, such as garbage, fruit, and pet food. They also say that pets should not be fed outdoors and that all food should be brought inside at night. If you see a coyote in your area, you should try to scare it away by making noise, throwing rocks, or spraying it with a hose. You should never approach a coyote, as they can be aggressive.

Come up with the restaurant name and dishes for it.","completion":"When I have a craving for my favorite water-based apex predator, Frank's Fins is my first choice! It's always a popular spot, but somehow there's always a seat available when I swing by, and the service is always fantastic. The servers are friendly and attentive without being too imposing, I've never had to ask for a refill on my beverage or my shark fin soup. And speaking of the shark fin soup, it's a revelation! The broth is so flavorful, and the fins are always the perfect texture, not too chewy and not too crunchy. But that's not the only amazing dish on the menu, trust me! On my last visit, I got the seared shark steak and the \\"Sharky's Special Shark Nachos.\\" The steak was perfectly done and so flavorful, and who would have guessed that shark meat pairs so well with nacho cheese? The next time I come, I'm definitely getting either the sharkburger or Grandma's Sharkloaf. They both sound absolutely mouthwatering! You would think that the same meat over and over might get boring, but not at Frank's! I have to say, I'm really enjoying the new decor! The harpoon and netting theme has a real nautical vibe with an edge to it, and Sharky makes for a hilarious mascot, even if he might be a bit frightening for any little ones that come with the family. All in all, Frank's Fins has stolen my heart (and my taste buds)!"},{"prompt":"I recently became the band leader in my adult band and I want to give our band a new and unique name. Can you come up with some band names using each of the special characters here: !@#%^&* (each rock band name should use each special character once). We like to sing about drinking together with friends and our genre is country music, if that helps.","completion":"Not a problem! With consideration to your band's genre and theme of music, here are some band names that use each of those special characters: !@#%^&* 1) Dr!nkn' This name is a play on words for one of the popular themes in country music: drinking. The exclamation point also represents the surprise and excitement of drinking with your friends. In terms of art, the exclamation point may also symbolize someone on their head, upside down, symbolizing the wacky adventures that may proceed during a night of drinking. 2) @L@B@M@ This name substitutes all the letter A's in the word \\"Alabama\\", with the special character, \\"@\\". Having multiple instances of this special character may create a neat illusion of the band's name swirling and spinning. 3) NeedleInA# This name mimics the common saying of, \\"looking for a needle in a haystack\\". The word \\"needle\\" is a double entendre and may refer to an actual needle of a record player or a physical needle, while the word \\"haystack\\" was replaced with the special character \\"#\\", loosely resembling a compressed haystack. Haystacks are also commonly found on farms and in barns. 4) outhwamp With many southern states in America having swamps as part of their geographic terrain, this band name references that landscape while replacing the letter S's in \\"SouthSwamp\\", with the special character, \\"\\". The special character also may resemble a slithering snake, an animal commonly found in swamplands. 5) 100%Hennessey Similar to the band name Dr!nkn', this name references Hennessey, an alcoholic brandy popular in the South. The \\"100%\\" portrays a complete and focused dedication to having fun, going all out, and drinking with friends, which are themes in some popular country music songs. 6) Sun^Overalls^ This band name interprets the phrase \\"Sun's up, overall's up\\", meaning that at sunrise, a farmer would pull up and wear their overalls to begin their day on the farm. The word \\"up\\" was replaced with the special character, \\"^\\", symbolizing an up direction pointing north, thus creating the band name, Sun^Overall^. 7) Moon&Shine Similar to Dr!nkn' and 100%Hennessey, this band name references moonshine, a high-proof whiskey, traditionally made illegally, especially in the South where it continues to remain popular. This band name bifurcates the word \\"moonshine\\" into two independent words, moon, and shine, reattached with the special character, \\"&\\", and pronounced simply: moonshine. 8) Southern* This band name takes the name \\"Southern Star\\" and replaces the word \\"Star\\" with the special character, \\"*\\", resembling a star in the night sky. Although Southern Star is not intentionally referencing anything in particular, the stresses on the consonants make the pronunciation of this band name easy and fun to say, with intentional stress placed on the \\"S\\" letters in this band name."},{"prompt":"I am decorating vases for an area in my home. The vases are clear. Can you give me 4 ideas for decorating these vases? Don't include spray painting.","completion":"Of course! Here are 4 ideas for decorating your vases. 1. Rocks: Fill the vase with some rocks. You can layer the rocks based on coloring. For example, the first layer can consist of white rocks. The second layer could be earth-toned rocks. 2. Flowers: Using fake flowers, create a unique bouquet inside the vase. A tip for making this decoration pop is to use different colored flowers as well as different types of flowers. Find flowers that come in a bouquet, then snip individual stems and place them inside the vase. 3. Glitter: Cover a portion of the vase (or the whole vase) with glue. Sprinkle your favorite glitter combo onto the vase and leave it to dry for a couple of hours. 4. Stacking: With a glue gun, you can turn one vase into a taller vase. Take one vase, and flip it upside down so that the opening faces the floor. Then hot glue the bottom of another vase and set it on top of the vase you have on the floor."},{"prompt":"Can you tell me what the slang term GOAT means?

The audience is retailers considering carrying boiled peanuts.","completion":"Boiled peanuts, already a staple in some southern states, are a delicious and nutritious snack food. Served warm, boiled peanuts have the soft consistency of cooked pinto beans. The peanuts are boiled in the shell in a broth made of salt and spices. There are cajun spiced peanuts, plain salty peanuts, and Old Bay flavored peanuts. Boiled peanuts are already so successful in states like Georgia that they can be found in most convenience stores, kept hot in self-serve crockpot-style warmers. Boiled peanuts retain all the natural flavors and nutrients of other snack peanuts but without the added calories of oil. They can be sold by the cupful, so consumers can fill their cups as much or as little as desired. This saves the retailer considerable costs due to the variation in customer preference. Boiled peanuts arrive at the retailer in safety-sealed cans, requiring very little prep by store staff. These unique snacks attract repeat customers in the way snacks like potato chips, beef jerky, and dry salted nuts have been doing for decades. They have a long shelf life, meaning your store won't lose money in expired inventory. If you're starting to see the value in stocking boiled peanuts, consult one of our helpful sales associates to get up-to-date pricing and take advantage of limited-time offers."},{"prompt":"What is the meaning of anachronism?","completion":"'Anachronism' refers to something or someone that is out of place in terms of time or chronology."},{"prompt":"What is the synonym of repulsive?","completion":"A synonym of 'repulsive' is 'revolting'."},{"prompt":"How many vowels are in the English alphabet?","completion":"There are five vowels in the English alphabet."},{"prompt":"Conceptualize a magic spell for an upcoming video game.

Zareb takes in the splendor of the mansion he’s entering. The wait-staff bow to him as they welcome the adopted heir to the Hanlon Empire. Diana Scott continued her interview of Zareb Hanlon, asking him about how his life changed after meeting his grandfather and growing up under his care. Zareb indulged deeper in his memories and disclosed how it was his grandfather who taught him the importance of keeping the family first and taking care of everybody under his wing. It was Connor Hanlon, Zareb’s grandfather who groomed Zareb and trained him to be a cutthroat competitor in business and made sure Zareb’s personality was better than the best. Connor Hanlon made him train from the best coaches in Mix Martial Arts and Krav Maga, even Connor McGregor trained alongside Zareb.

The meal is a bacon double cheeseburger with fries and a Coke.","completion":"This was not my first time visiting this establishment. However, after making a recent buzz in marketing, I decided to revisit it with a new mindset. The service was incredible. I waited but a few minutes before I was handed my food and allowed to choose any of the spots in the restaurant. From that point on, I did not see any staff at all for the remainder of my meal. This gave me a sense of privacy and respect for my experience. The dining room was open with windows on three of the four walls giving abundant natural light and allowing me to gaze over the manicured vista outside. Upon revealing my food, I knew I would be in for a treat. My first course consisted of French-fried potatoes, hot out of the fryer and with just the right amount of salt. A tasting of different dipping sauces was provided, including ketchup, honey mustard, and barbecue. Each tasting gave a new flavor profile to the crisp fries and their fluffy interior. Moving on to the main course, I was served a cheeseburger with two patties, American cheese, crispy bacon, lettuce, tomato, and the restaurant's proprietary secret sauce. The presentation of the sandwich was beautiful with the glistening of the meat and fixings nustled softly in the bosom of the fluffy sesame-seed-covered buns. My first bite sent me to heaven. I was blown away by the balance of flavor and texture with the heartiness and tenderness of the ground beef patty and the cheese melding the ingredients together. The bacon was grilled to a satisfying crunch. The real star was the secret sauce that added a rush of flavor washing over my palate. I had my selection of pairings, and I choose a lemon-lime carbonated pop that satisfied my thirst and refreshed me. Finally, I had a pure white vanilla ice cream swirl for dessert. The vanilla was a welcome taste as the creamy texture coated my mouth with satisfaction and sugar. The only complaint I have is that a proper sommelier might better help me make a beverage selection instead of leaving me to my devices. Overall, I greatly enjoyed my meal.

Write the story using stereotypical sailor speech, from the perspective of the sailor who caught the monster.","completion":"Let me spin ye a yarn, a yarn such as ye never heard. It was quite a few years ago when I set out into the storm. Rain battered my bare hands as I tried to set the riggings right, and waves threatened the sanctity of my vessel. Into a black column of roaring cloud, I went. It was a struggle against the devil himself. And then it was calm. I lie in the eye of the storm, where neither rain nor wind bothered nobody. There, I cast my line. I had my heart set on one beast of the sea, and the bait was set to match. Three weeks past I'd caught a marlin, 8 feet long, and had kept it on ice till this moment. The God of Storms was a hungry beast and would eat no less. Aye, that's what they called her: the God of Storms, a monster whose churning limbs cast storms into the very sky. Why'd ye think this part of the world was so stormy? Well, in fishing sometimes there ain't much to do but wait, and so I did. But for every minute that I waited, the far side of the storm drew nearer. Naturally, I latched my line to the ship and rowed as best I could to keep pace, but the wall drew ever nearer. Soon, I felt the cold wind nipping and stray drops of rain. The wind spun the boat despite all my strength. I was lost to the storm again. But only for a moment! A terrible pull on the line shot my boat back into the eye of the storm. My oars snapped from my hand and shattered against the strength of the sea. It could only have been the God of Storms! We struggled there for a day and a night. With all my strength, I fought the beast and pinned an entire storm to that one spot on the sea! Equally matched, the beast rose for a moment above the churning waters. I lobbed my harpoon, striking the beast right in its vast crimson eye. It screamed with a voice ye could never imagine, but the retaliation was terrible. With one swipe, the beast splintered my boat and we both sank below. When I came to, it was on a sandy shoal, the beast and the storm long gone."},{"prompt":"What is the maximum level you can reach in Final Fantasy IX (9)?","completion":"The maximum level that can be reached in Final Fantasy IX is level 99.

Her owner comes home and discovers what happened. Write it in the first person.","completion":"I sat patiently by the door wagging my tail. I'd heard the car door shut and the crunch of my human's footsteps on the gravel outside. When she finally opened the door, I leaped up to greet her. \\"Hi, Tasha! Who's a good girl?\\" My owner greeted me with lots of scratches and pats. Good, she was happy to see me. Maybe she wouldn't be too upset by the mess I had made in the living room. It was time to make myself scarce. I tucked my tail between my legs and sat under the kitchen table. \\"Out of sight, out of mind,\\" I thought to myself. Soon enough, though, my owner discovered the mess I had made. She called out, \\"Tasha!\\" very sternly, and I obeyed sheepishly, looking at the mess of fluff and torn cushions I had created in my hyper state this morning. She merely looked at me, then the cushions, then back at me. I began to wag my tail slowly and approached her, head down. Presently, I looked up at her beseechingly. \\"Bad girl!\\" she said, pointing to the cushions. I know! I know! I dropped my eyes to the floor, ashamed of myself. I slunk back under the table and watched as she cleaned up the mess and discarded the cushion. It was sad for me when my human was displeased."},{"prompt":"You're an absurdist and storyteller.

He spent decades perfecting and experimenting with the dough-making process in his restaurant. One day, after mixing the dough with some super glue and about 3 grams of lipstick, some unimaginable magic happened: the dough became unbreakable yet still elastic. Zack believed the lipstick must have triggered some multi-universe interferences causing physical rules to stop applying to that piece of dough. Even though the dough was unsuitable for pizza, Zack did not want his once-in-a-lifetime discovery to go to waste. He immediately proposed a space program and received grants from NASA by turning his dough into a pizza-shaped trampoline! Since it was unbreakable and still elastic, it could store an unlimited amount of energy and release it. Some initial field tests suggested that Zack's pizza worked like a mega slingshot, sending astronauts into space without requiring a rocket. Zack quickly capitalized on his success and built many launching platforms. Humankind finally turned space-borne by re-imagining an old dish."},{"prompt":"What foods can I eat that contain antioxidants?","completion":"Here are some foods containing antioxidants that you can eat: 1.

Were there shouts, screams, or tears? Was there pleading from the nanny? Did the child cry out in fear?

In the Edo period (1603 - 1867), the kimono started growing into an art form, increasing in value. Families handed them down to their children as family heirlooms. From the Meiji period (1868 - 1912), Japan was heavily influenced by outside cultures, with the Japanese government encouraging citizens to adopt Western-style clothing. Today, Japanese people generally reserve kimono for special events and occasions, and kimono is considered formal clothing."},{"prompt":"I'm arguing with my dad about what the biggest freshwater fish in North America is.

Use hashtags and descriptions so that your tweets show up in searches. People won't find your content if you share pictures with no text. 3.

About three years ago, I decided to take my little pupper, Eddie, to MacArthur Park for exercise and relaxation. I was impressed by the amount of grass and field that Eddie could play on; it was amazing! There were water fountains in multiple areas of the park that the other dogs could drink out of; Eddie was thankful for that because he had been running around for so long that he frequently became thirsty. Also, in some areas of the park, some vendors served two different kinds of foods: meals for dog owners who wanted a quick bite to eat while they watched their dogs and snacks for the dogs themselves. The prices for these foods were fantastic value: lots of food for a great price! I appreciated how well-kept the grass was, as it seemed very well-manicured and free from dog poop. It seems all dog owners who come to the park are well-informed of the requirement that they pick up after their dogs, and it showed in the cleanliness of the park itself. In addition, there were many park benches with shade above them for owners who wanted to take a break from the festivities. I remember on the day that Eddie and I went to the park, there was a live band playing in the center of the park, and there were people who brought blankets, sleeping mats, and lawn chairs for themselves and their dogs to sit on while they listened to the music. It was a wonderful day for Eddie and me, and I'll never forget it. Overall, I would recommend anyone with a dog who is looking for a safe, friendly, comfortable place to relax while giving your dog a treat and a day out. Please consider going to MacArthur Park. It is one of, if not the, best parks in this area."},{"prompt":"How did the Polynesian practice of surfing evolve into a modern international sport?","completion":"The sport of surfing, known as he'e nalu in Hawaiian, has a history that stretches back over a thousand years. Its origins are deeply rooted in the Polynesian culture, and its evolution into a modern international sport is a fascinating journey marked by cultural exchange, innovation, and the human spirit's connection with nature. In ancient Polynesian society, surfing was more than a recreational activity. It was deeply ingrained in their culture and had significant social and religious implications. High-ranking individuals often demonstrated their prowess and status through surfing. Furthermore, they believed that the gods could make waves, and riding these waves was a way to connect with the divine. Surfing first became known to the Western world in the 18th century through the accounts of explorers. Lieutenant James King, completing the journals of Captain James Cook upon his death in 1779, wrote about the Hawaiians' ability to ride the ocean waves on planks of wood, marking the first written account of surfing."},{"prompt":"In a few sentences, explain investing using this: Investing Investing involves purchasing assets, usually stocks and bonds, to earn a return on the money invested.

He'd owned this 1985 Ford truck since his father handed it down to him in high school. At that time, the truck was seemingly on its last leg. Hank’s father thought it would be good for Hank to start with a clunker—that way, Hank would have to make repairs and become familiar with regular maintenance. His father had hoped that owning this beat-up truck would make Hank a humbled and grateful owner of whichever vehicle he purchased next, likely a newer model. However, that was over thirty years ago, and Hank had yet to purchase a replacement vehicle. Hank would take what he learned from working on the old truck and start his own mechanic shop in town. His clientele was a fairly general audience to begin with, but over time, he would come to niche down to servicing classic vehicles and helping passionate owners restore old cars and trucks. Hank was never interested in a new paint job or sourcing the cosmetic parts of his own truck that had broken off over the years; all Hank needed was to know the truck was mechanically sound, nipping every problem in the bud as soon as it arose. Standing in front of his truck that day with Larry still trying to console him, however, Hank knew he would never drive the truck again. Hank was at a loss for words as, to him, this truck was a family member. For a while, he did not know what to do. Then, an idea hit him. Now, if you drive past Hank’s mechanic shop, out front you will see that old truck from his high school days parked right out front wearing his shop’s name as a badge of honor for making a good thing last as long as it could."},{"prompt":"Who played the characters of Ariel and Prince Eric in the newest Little Mermaid movie?

The final event should bring about the end of the world somehow. Make each of them super metal in terms of tone.","completion":"Okay, can do that! Here are seven world-changing events ranging from subtle to earthshattering: 1. People everywhere start having nightmares about a skull in the sky. This acts as a warning to the players that the end of the world is coming. 2. Several plagues sweep the land, including diseases, locusts, frogs, etc. This can shake things up for the party by upending the status quo in the game world. 3. Storms of oddly-colored lightning roll in from the ocean with thunderclaps that sound like legions of screams. This creates a doomsday atmosphere that can also complicate adventuring in certain areas. 4. Earthquakes open rifts in the ground in various places, spewing monsters out into the land. More monsters mean more danger. 5. The moon cracks open, revealing the image of a skull underneath its surface. Every night, the skull laughs audibly for all to hear, creating a sense of foreboding while shaking things up. 6. The sun melts from the sky, plunging the world into an eternal night. This puts pressure on the players by giving them a strict time limit before everything ends. 7. A great being from beyond the stars arrives to swallow the world.

Oak: Oak trees are large, resilient, and powerful. This name would suit a male dog, particularly one of a large or giant breed, who is loving, loyal, and protective. 6.

I started with Crash and Spyro on the PlayStation. I’ve always enjoyed thinking about games from a critical lens. When I first started playing, I enjoyed Crash more than Spyro, but I also knew they were both great games. I always wondered “Why is that? What would make me like one more than the other? What is it about Spyro that gives it that edge?” It wasn’t until many years later, when I stumbled across a video essay comparing them, that I realized that it was the level of openness. Spyro featured open worlds to explore, meet colorful characters, and collect collectibles, whereas Crash had narrow levels and tight, punishing, yet rewarding platforming. Ever since then, I’ve always had an interest in sharing my thoughts on video games in hopes that it might help others understand their thoughts more. Two of my favorite games are The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Outer Wilds. Both games offer a sense of freedom and open-ended puzzle-solving that I’ve rarely found anywhere else. Both games are totally different, yet so similar in the sense that from the beginning of the games, the ending is accessible if you have the skills or knowledge to accomplish it. I’m excited to start this blog and to have a space where I can share more and more of my thoughts on video games!

Here is a list of four fun things to do in the Moroccan Sahara desert. Discover Desert Wildlife Many animals and reptiles call the Sahara Desert home such as the desert fox and the desert mouse. These normally shy animals are hard to spot but they can be lured out of their dens and their burrows with food. Save some of your food from dinner and place it somewhat away from the campfire. Animals are quick to sniff out a meal and will gladly follow the scent back to camp. Stay quiet and be patient and you may get some great pictures of a desert fox up close! Surf the Dunes Desert dunes not only look like water waves but can be surfed as well. Decide whether you want to ski, surf or snowboard down the dune then grab your board and walk up to the top. The ride down a steep dune is fast and matches the fun of surfing on a wave. You can stand up on the board or sit down and enjoy the ride. You'll want to bring your own board or rent one before setting out to the dunes. And remember to bring your hat, sunglasses, sunscreen and plenty of water to drink. Deserts are hot! Spa Break Desert Style If you're tired and sore from sand surfing and camping, you can find relief in a sand bath. Akin to the mud baths found in day spas, sand baths are said to ease aches and pains and restore your peace of mind. At the small village of Merzouga, which is near the Moroccan-Algerian border, you can join the locals in an early morning sand bath. After digging a hole in one of the dunes, you lie covered in sand and watch the beautiful sunrise for a maximum of 30 minutes. Watch the Stars It's quiet out in the desert. Deafeningly so. It's also inky dark so the stars shine brightly in the night sky. There's no light pollution to interfere with the view or traffic noise to bombard your ears. Just watch as dusk gives way to night and the stars take center stage. In addition to stars, you can see planets and identify constellations. Downloading a star-gazing app is a great way to identify what you're seeing in the night sky."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this news headline as a traditional haiku poem: Analysis: Experts are frantically sounding the alarm over AI.

It should be less than 400 words.","completion":"It seems today there is debt and loans everywhere you look to the point where in the United States, it could actually hinder you if you have never had any. Not having had any debt will mean you have poor credit history and may make it difficult to get a mortgage or loan. With this reliance on debt, we must understand how to effectively pay off debt so it doesn't snowball and create a far bigger problem later on. This article will look at key ways to ensure your debt doesn't spiral and stays under control. First, you have to keep paying that minimum. Not paying that minimum will only ensure next month's minimum is even more significant, and so on and so forth. Not at least paying the minimum, you consign yourself to more debt as your interest grows with each passing month. The worst thing about this is you don't get anything in return. You literally have the pleasure of more debt for not paying the minimum payment last month. Credit card debt comes with high-interest rates, which means the money you saved in a low-yield savings account could be better used to pay off existing debt. For example, a debt of 100 with an interest rate of 23% annually. After a year, that balance would equate to 123. If you had 100 in a savings account offering just 5% (Unusually high), you would only gain 5. If these two scenarios ran parallel to each other, then you would be net negative 18. The better thing to do is pay off the debt and lose nothing. Too many people get engrossed by the balance, but the interest rate is essential. Interest compounds quickly. In some cases where two balances are in the same ballpark, it may be more beneficial to pay off the higher interest rate regardless of whether it is the larger balance. You can use many online calculators to work this out for you. You are going to war with your finances here. Have tactics and strategies to get the upper hand. Whether it's a payment schedule or an order of what debt you will pay down when having something to remind you of your plan. This will help you when you want to buy something new instead of reducing that debt. A strategy helps you stay on track."},{"prompt":"What does SEO stand for?

It fits the bill for a great introduction to one of literature’s most popular characters, Sherlock Holmes, and the mystery genre as a whole. This is the first book in the Sherlock Holmes series, in which Dr. Watson meets Holmes, and they embark on their first difficult (and deadly) case. You’ll be able to teach your students about the themes of enforcing justice, revenge, observation, and deduction. Of course, there’s enough suspense to keep everyone in class on the edge of their chairs.

They grow best with cooler temperatures and filtered sunlight, and the tomato plants shelter them from the intense summer heat and sunshine. In return, the low-growing leafy greens minimize weed growth and protect the soil, keeping it from drying out too quickly. Practice succession planting for a continuous harvest of tasty salad greens throughout the growing season. Plant a second round of seeds two or three weeks before your first crop is spent. That way, the mature plants shelter the new seedlings as they emerge. When the seedlings are about three inches tall and have at least six leaves, carefully pull out the old plants so the fresh crop can grow."},{"prompt":"Chatbot, can you explain how 3D printing can be useful to aerospace engineers?","completion":"3D printing technology has improved significantly in the past few decades. Where they used to be primarily good for rough prototyping and novelty hobbies, 3D printers can now create industrial-grade items with very favorable properties. Though many 3D printers are only equipped to create small plastic objects, some of the more advanced devices can generate large metal or composite-material components that are strong enough to withstand the rigors of flight. The most common styles of printers for the industry are selective laser sintering (SLS), fused deposition modeling (FDM), and stereolithography (SLA) devices. The SLS style is particularly important since it can build up objects from metal powder. A new metal-capable style called Directed Energy Deposition (DED) is also growing in popularity for both the construction and repair of metal parts. 3D printers create parts by adding material a little bit at a time. Traditional subtractive manufacturing methods, by contrast, start with a larger structure of raw material and remove portions until the final part has the right shape and configuration. This makes subtractive manufacturing wasteful by nature. An efficient 3D printer will waste significantly less raw material. That’s good for both the environment and the manufacturer’s budget. But the aspect that’s most valuable in aerospace is the technology’s ability to minimize weight. A 3D printer only needs to print the minimum amount of material to maintain structural integrity. Sometimes that’s difficult or even impossible for traditional methods to achieve. Printers can build hollow (and thus lightweight) structures without needing to join multiple pieces together. Since they can print complex shapes, they can also be used to replace many parts with just one. This eliminates many fasteners from the design, further reducing weight and complexity. And since machine failures often start from corners or part joints, this also means the structure has fewer weak points. There are a number of other, more subtle or subjective benefits as well. Suffice it to say, the aerospace industry has largely embraced this expanding technology. Some companies like Relativity Space even create high-performance rocket engines almost entirely via 3D printing."},{"prompt":"Come up with a set of questions that an interviewer would ask God if he/she/it were to agree to be interviewed.

This blog should have a pleasant, inviting tone and should motivate the reader to look for additional information about the region.","completion":"While there are a great many scenic and interesting places to visit in Washington and Oregon, these four locations will provide you with a sense of the landscape and culture of the region. 1. Orcas Island, Washington. Orcas Island is one of the San Juan Islands in the Puget Sound. A visit to the island can be a day trip, or you can overnight there. Traveling to Orcas by ferry allows you to take a car or not. Or you can fly by small plane. The island holds much of the charm of Western Washington in a small concentrated space. 2. Cannon Beach, Oregon. Cannon Beach is one of the most beautiful places on the Pacific Ocean in Oregon. Many charming restaurants and shopping areas can be found in and around Cannon Beach as well as opportunities to hike and commune with nature. This can be a day or overnight since it is just a few hours from the cities along the Interstate 5 corridor. 3. Columbia River Gorge. The Columbia River forms the border between Washington and Oregon. When you leave Portland on Interstate 90 headed east, you will drive from the green rainforest of the west side of the Cascade Mountains to the dry desert and irrigated farmland of the east side of the mountains. Opportunities to see Mt. Hood and Mt Adams will be likely on a clear day as well as what's left of Mt St. Helens, which erupted in 1980. Stay on the Oregon side of the river because a stop at Multnomah Falls and a stop in Hood River are worth the time they take. 4. Columbia River Wine Region. As you leave the Columbia Gorge, you will be on the border of Eastern Washington and Eastern Oregon. Turn north into Washington on Interstate 84 toward the town of Kennewick, and you drive right into some of the finest wineries in the United States. Spend an afternoon or days on end exploring this wine region and the many local wineries where you can relax with a glass of red or white, whichever you prefer.

Hundreds of times, he'd believed. But this one might have been too far. The urgent, pleading voice of the new 28-year-old recruit blasted through his intercom again. \\"Repeat.

Agent Sam, pleading for help, would not be claimed, helped, or recognized by the US Government in any capacity. He did not technically exist in the United States census or social security records. This would be explained away as a bureaucratic error. Lancert needed a third option. This reminded Lancert of when he served in the Army.

Buying a car can be a big deal. The choice of car will be informed by several factors. Here are some considerations to make when deciding on which vehicle to purchase: - Affordability: consider how much the car will cost, both in terms of the purchase price as well as the maintenance costs. Some questions to consider include, how much will the insurance cost for this make and model of car? How often will the car need to be serviced? Are spare parts affordable/ easily accessible? What other consumables will be required for the car? - Intended use: consider the likely frequent use of the vehicle. Will you need it mostly for in-city or off-road use? What is the general state of the roads on which you will drive? What purpose will the vehicle serve? How many people are likely to use the vehicle at any given time? These considerations will help you decide on the type of car you may need. - Individual ability: consider the transmission type that you prefer or are licensed to drive. What class of vehicle are you authorised to drive? Does your license permit you to drive a manual or automatic transmission vehicle, or both? Which transmission type do you feel most comfortable or confident driving? - Fuel type: consider the car's required fuel type. Is the required fuel readily available and/or affordable? Are there any local or statutory regulations regarding fuel type that you need to adhere to? - Safety features: it is a good idea to consider the safety features of the vehicle you would like to purchase. As a bare minimum, seatbelts should be available and in working order. What else is important to you, safety-wise? - State of the vehicle at purchase: would you like a brand new or preloved vehicle? For each alternative, consider purchasing from reputable dealers. Putting thought into these considerations will help you make an informed choice and enjoy your new vehicle.

We are keeping some of his ashes in an urn, but I need some ideas for what I can do with the rest of them. I need 6 ideas, and I would love at least 3 of them to be more creative/unique/unconventional. Thank you!","completion":"I'm sorry to hear about your father's passing, but it's wonderful you want to do something special with his ashes. Here are 6 ideas: 1. Scattering: Scattering ashes is a very popular way to commemorate your loved one. If he had a favorite place or somewhere the two of you enjoyed spending time together, you could scatter them there. It may bring you comfort to know he is somewhere he loved dearly. Of course, you should always check the regulations and rules concerning the disposal of human remains in your chosen location before you go ahead with this decision. 2. Jewelry: Many people opt to wear jewelry containing the ashes of their loved ones to feel close to them, such as rings or necklaces. There are many options to choose from to suit your style and taste. You can buy a pendant necklace with a hollowed-out center and funnel a small pinch of his ashes inside, or you can have a piece custom-made to incorporate the ashes right into the metal. Some companies even make it possible to convert ashes into a man-made diamond, which you can then have placed in any setting you prefer. To add a personal touch, you can get the jewelry piece engraved, perhaps with your loved one's name or a sentimental saying. 3. Trees: For lovers of nature, this is a wonderful way to use their ashes. The remains are planted in a biodegradable urn along with soil and a sapling which are then planted in the ground. Over time, the tree absorbs nutrients from the ashes as it grows, which means the ashes will forever become a part of the tree. 4. Fireworks: For someone outgoing with a bright and bubbly personality, fireworks would make the perfect send-off. Some companies make fireworks that incorporate ashes so you can have an unforgettable and beautiful fireworks display to remember your loved one with. 5. Ashes tattoo: For fans of body art, this is a unique and permanent way to commemorate a loved one. For this process, some of the ashes would be mixed with tattoo ink and used to complete the tattoo as normal. The design of the tattoo is up to you, but some wonderful commemorative tattoo ideas include a portrait of your loved one, lyrics to their favorite song, a beloved phrase or saying of theirs, or their name. It is worth noting that this isn't a standard request and not all tattoo artists would be willing to perform such a task. You should take your time to research artists who have significant experience with this style of tattoo. 6. Vinyl: If your loved one was a huge music fan, this is the ultimate way to commemorate them. The ashes of your loved one can be pressed into a vinyl record with the audio of your choice. It will look and play just like a standard record. You can use their favorite song or even a recording of their voice if you have one."},{"prompt":"Write a one-paragraph story about a waitress realizing she can return to school to get a better job.

Today I will share some tips to get your human to pay attention to you while they are working on their computer. Whether they are working from home or talking to another human, it’s important to be able to get their attention when you want it. So, grab some treats, and let’s dive in! Here are some tips: 1. Try putting your head in your human’s lap and looking at them adoringly. If you are a smaller dog, you can put your paws on their leg or jump into their lap if there is room. This will almost always guarantee a pat on the head or, sometimes, a kiss. Often, humans will tell you that you are \\"such a good dog\\" or that you are \\"so pretty\\" 2. Go and get your ball or any toy that you like to play with and drop it at their feet. This will not always get your human to play with you, but it will sometimes work if they are ready for a break. 3. If you have a cat in the house, it is always a good idea to initiate a play session, causing the cat to tear around the house while you chase it. This will distract your human and get them to pay attention to you. 4. Barking or whining is always an option, but often this seems to irritate the human, which should be avoided if possible. However, sometimes it is necessary if they are not responding to other cues. There you go, my furry friends! Remember to use positive reinforcement; this is a powerful tool in training and will encourage your human to repeat desired behaviors in the future. You can reward your human in many ways, including something as simple as a kiss on the hand or lying at their feet.

Write a plan of action for each tip on how you will implement them in your classroom to improve your students' learning experience and engagement.","completion":"Creative Ways to Keep Your Students Engaged Are your students losing interest in your lectures? Is it tough to get them engaged and attentive during classes? Well, here are some ways to create more interactive and exciting lessons that will engage your students deeply. 1. Arrange Group Discussions Organize the students into small groups, and give them a topic to discuss. Encourage them to share their perspectives, ask open-ended questions, and facilitate the discussion during class. After the discussion, you can ask a few students from each group to share their key takeaways from the discussion with the entire class. 2. Brainstorming You can encourage brainstorming by giving students a problem they need to solve or a question they need to answer. Then ask them to generate as many ideas as they can. Give them enough time to explore various possibilities without criticizing any of the ideas. Afterward, discuss each idea with the entire class and assess their effectiveness. 3. Regularly Test Students You should make sure that you frequently test your students. Try pop quizzes or regular assignments. Give them feedback on their results and offer remedial tips for areas with low scores. 4. See Smartphones and Tech as Tools We get it; smartphones can sometimes feel like the bane of a teacher's existence. But instead of trying to fight against them, why not incorporate them into your lessons? There are tons of awesome educational apps out there that can turn your students' phones into valuable learning tools. Having them use their phones in class may make them less likely to sneakily check social media while they're supposed to be listening to you. 5. Start with a Warm-Up Just like athletes need to warm up their muscles before diving into a game or competition, students benefit from a warm-up activity to get their brains engaged and ready for learning. A quick review of a key concept, a thought-provoking question, or even a silly icebreaker game can get your lesson started on the right foot. 6. Use Self-Paced Work Not all students learn or work at the same pace, so allowing them to move through the material at their speed can be a huge benefit. Personalized assignments or online modules give your students the power to work independently."},{"prompt":"Help me compose a positive response to an email inviting me to join the neighborhood book club.

Keep the steps as simple and easy to follow as possible without taking away from the final product.","completion":"Introducing the coveted caramel macchiato. If you've ever visited a Starbucks or even your local coffee shop, you've seen this popular coffee drink on the menu. What most partakers don't realize is that the sweetness in this drink comes from the vanilla syrup mixed with the espresso base, rather than actual caramel. Either way, follow the steps below and you'll be able to treat yourself to this delicious beverage any time, day or night, and most importantly, without hurting your pockets. Appliances: For this recipe, we'll be using a standard Keurig coffee maker and a hand-held electric milk frother. You can also use a French press if you have one at your disposal. Ingredients: Espresso k-cup Milk (whole, 2%, nondairy, etc. It's up to you) Vanilla coffee flavoring syrup (We like Torani's) Caramel sauce 1. Prepare your espresso: Put the K-cup in your Keurig coffeemaker and chose the smallest setting. Since the standard Keurig is not built to reach the kind of pressure we need for authentic espresso, we'll be using a stronger version of coffee instead. 2. Flavoring: Add 1 or 2 pumps (more if you're a little bit extra) to the espresso. 3. Froth: Using your electric frother, frother 1/2 to 1 cup of milk and pour this into your flavored espresso. 4. Drizzle: Last, and most importantly, top your frothed milk with an ample drizzle of caramel syrup so that it looks just like the Starbucks version. 5.

The writers, who are represented by affiliated branches of the Writers Guild of America, have said that the streaming era has eroded their working conditions and stagnated their wages despite the explosion of television production in recent years, for much of which Netflix has been responsible. The W.G.A. had been negotiating with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of all the major Hollywood studios, including Netflix, before talks broke down last week. The writers went on strike on May 2. Negotiations have not resumed, and Hollywood is bracing for a prolonged work stoppage. Last week, at a summit in Los Angeles a day after the strike was called, one attendee asked union leaders which studio has been the worst to writers. Ellen Stutzman, the chief negotiator of the W.G.A., and David Goodman, a chair of the writers’ negotiating committee, answered in unison: “Netflix.” The crowd of 1,800 writers laughed and then applauded, according to a person present at that evening who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strike.","completion":"Television and film writers are striking due to their working conditions and wages.

The book is set in two halves, with each half from the perspective of two protagonists, Sylvie and Dan. Sylvie is a young woman, and Dan is a middle-aged man. It is set in a post-apocalyptic world where a mysterious disease has wiped out most of the plants in the world. The book is entitled \\"Seeds of Hope\\"","completion":"Washington state, 2029. It has been three years since a mysterious disease, nicknamed \\"The Reckoning\\", wiped out 95% of the vegetation on Earth. Widespread starvation and death followed. Towns and cities became desolate concrete jungles. Internet and cellular communication ceased to exist, with radio being the only remaining way for people to contact one another. The world's elite abandoned their people to live a life of luxury and safety in Caelum, a space station orbiting the Earth. Below, the surviving population struggles to sustain themselves. Once vibrant cities are now home to three groups of people: Honest survivors, mostly living in groups. Many of them form communes, where they grow and harvest the few remaining species of plants that didn't succumb to The Reckoning, mainly a handful of fruits and vegetables. Then there are gangs of outlaws. Never staying in one place too long, they band together, travelling between towns and cities. Brutal and heavily armed, they will loot, steal and kill whoever they need to ensure their survival. Finally, there are merchants, solitary and nomadic individuals who travel across the country selling anything of value, including rare and extremely hard-to-find packets of seeds. Sylvie is a 28-year-old woman living a solitary existence in Seattle. She lost her mother shortly after The Reckoning started. Wary and untrusting, she shunned the idea of living in a commune in favor of going it alone. However, Sylvie has a secret - she is the daughter of a world-renown botanist. Her father was working at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault when The Reckoning hit. The world lost touch with those at the vault shortly after. She knows if her father still lives, he can help repopulate the world's plant life, but the only way to find out is to get to the vault, a seemingly impossible task. Dan is a 41-year-old former soldier. After losing his wife and sons, he became the head of a commune just outside of Seattle, known as Wisteria. All that matters to him is the survival of those who entrusted him to lead them - until a chance meeting with Sylvie. After he discovers who her father is and her plans to travel to the vault, the two of them set out on a long and dangerous journey to help restore order and life to the world."},{"prompt":"Could you write me a React hook to merge a new state object with the current state object?

Such channels are important parts of the electrical conduction system of the heart and form a component of the natural pacemaker. First described in the late 1970s in Purkinje fibers and sinoatrial myocytes, the cardiac pacemaker \\"funny\\" (If) current has been extensively characterized and its role in cardiac pacemaking has been investigated.[1][2][3] Among the unusual features which justified the name \\"funny\\" are mixed Na+ and K+ permeability, activation on hyperpolarization, and very slow kinetics.[1] Function The funny current is highly expressed in spontaneously active cardiac regions, such as the sinoatrial node (SAN, the natural pacemaker region), the atrioventricular node (AVN) and the Purkinje fibres of conduction tissue. The funny current is a mixed sodium–potassium current that activates upon hyperpolarization at voltages in the diastolic range (normally from −60/−70 mV to −40 mV). When, at the end of a sinoatrial action potential, the membrane repolarizes below the If threshold (about −40/−50 mV), the funny current is activated and supplies inward current, which is responsible for starting the diastolic depolarization phase (DD); by this mechanism, the funny current controls the rate of spontaneous activity of sinoatrial myocytes, and thus the cardiac rate. Another unusual feature of If is its dual activation by voltage and by cyclic nucleotides. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) molecules bind directly to f-channels and increase their open probability.[4] cAMP dependence is a particularly relevant physiological property, since it underlies the If-dependent autonomic regulation of heart rate. Sympathetic stimulation raises the level of cAMP-molecules which bind to f-channels and shift the If activation range to more positive voltages; this mechanism leads to an increase of the current at diastolic voltages and therefore to an increase of the steepness of DD and heart rate acceleration. Parasympathetic stimulation (which acts to increase probability of potassium channels opening but decreases the probability of calcium channel opening) decreases the heart rate by the opposite action, that is by shifting the If activation curve towards more negative voltages. When vagally-released acetylcholine (ACh) binds to muscarinic M2 receptors, which promotes dissociation of βγ subunit complexes, leading to direct opening of the G-protein–gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Girk/Kir) IKACh.[5]","completion":"There's something called a \\"funny current\\" in your heart that helps it beat. It's like electricity that flows through channels in your heart. It's important for keeping your heart's rhythm steady. When the current is activated, it starts a phase that helps your heart beat regularly. It's controlled by different things, like chemicals in your body, which can make your heart beat faster or slower."},{"prompt":"Could you please rephrase the given description into a fairy-tale style narrative about the life and journey of meteoroids in the solar system? Meteoroids are lumps of rock or iron that orbit the sun, just as planets, asteroids, and comets do. Meteoroids, especially the tiny particles called micrometeoroids, are extremely common throughout the solar system. They orbit the sun among the rocky inner planets, as well as the gas giants that make up the outer planets. Meteoroids are even found on the edge of the solar system, in regions called the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud. Different meteoroids travel around the sun at different speeds and in different orbits. The fastest meteoroids travel through the solar system at a speed of around 42 kilometers (26 miles) per second. Many meteoroids are formed from the collision of asteroids, which orbit the sun between the paths of Mars and Jupiter in a region called the asteroid belt. As asteroids smash into each other, they produce crumbly debris—meteoroids. The force of the asteroid collision can throw the meteoroid debris—and sometimes the asteroids themselves—out of their regular orbit. This can put the meteoroids on a collision course with a planet or moon. Other meteoroids are the debris that comets shed as they travel through space. As a comet approaches the sun, the “dirty snowball” of the comet’s nucleus sheds gas and dust. The dusty tail may contain hundreds or even thousands of meteoroids and micrometeoroids. Meteoroids shed by a comet usually orbit together in a formation called a meteoroid stream. A very small percentage of meteoroids are rocky pieces that break off from the Moon and Mars after celestial bodies—often asteroids or other meteoroids—impact their surfaces. Meteoroid impacts are probably the largest contributor to “space weathering.” Space weathering describes the processes that act upon a celestial body that doesn’t have an airy atmosphere, such as asteroids, many moons, or the planets Mars and Mercury. Meteoroids crash into these bodies, creating craters and throwing space dust (more meteoroids) back into the solar system. Most meteoroids are made of silicon and oxygen (minerals called silicates) and heavier metals like nickel and iron. Iron and nickel-iron meteoroids are massive and dense, while stony meteoroids are lighter and more fragile.","completion":"Once upon a time, in the vast kingdom of the Sun, there were countless pebbles of rock and iron, known as meteoroids, swirling and whirling around their radiant ruler. They were found everywhere: mingling with the rocky realms of inner planets, frolicking among the gas giants of outer domains, and even wandering at the kingdom's farthest boundaries, the enigmatic realms known as the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud. These brave adventurers hurtled around the Sun at varying speeds, with the swiftest among them zipping through space at a breathtaking 42 kilometers per second. Their birth was a story of cataclysm and creation. Many were born when the asteroids, the boulder-sized subjects of the Sun dwelling between Mars and Jupiter, collided with great force. These collisions, in their chaos and beauty, birthed showers of crumbly debris, our valiant meteoroids. The impact was so strong, it could send the newborns and sometimes even their asteroid parents spinning off their usual path, setting them on a daring voyage towards a planet or moon. Meanwhile, other meteoroids were the lost children of the comets. As a comet raced towards the Sun, it would shed layers of gas and dust, leaving behind a trail of tiny meteoroids. These siblings of circumstance would stick together, forming a close-knit assembly known as a meteoroid stream. And then there were the few, the proud, the fragments of the Moon and Mars. These splinters were torn away from their parental bodies when an asteroid or another meteoroid crashed into them. This perpetual dance of impact and creation, this 'space weathering', was the order of the cosmos. Meteoroids would collide with these bodies, crafting craters and flinging even more cosmic dust back into the solar kingdom. Most meteoroids, the heroes of our tale, were crafted from silicon and oxygen, with a sprinkling of heavier metals like nickel and iron. While the iron meteoroids were hefty and dense, their stone kin were lighter, yet brittle. Thus is the life and the journey of meteoroids, the minute marvels of our grand solar system. The end, or perhaps, just the beginning."},{"prompt":"I feel like a failure. I'll never be good at anything.","completion":"You are not a failure. You were born for success.

Please give me 5 suggestions.","completion":"Decorating a small room can seem daunting, but with the right accessories and approach, you can make your small room feel cozy and comfortable. Here are 5 ways you can accomplish this: 1. Use mirrors - Mirrors give a perception of depth to a room, making it appear larger than it truly is. Consider putting up a mirror or two in strategic places in your room that fit in with your overall design. 2. Plants - Houseplants (either real or fake) can add a certain level of charm and a tropical feel to your room. Put a houseplant in an open corner of the room or hang it from the ceiling. Bonus points for fake plants, as upkeep is minimal since they do not need to be watered. 3. Accessories with dual purposes - To keep clutter to a minimum, use furniture that can have dual purposes. For instance, having a nightstand with drawers near your bed can act as a table for you to put a lamp on as well as a storage area for small things like books or other knickknacks that would otherwise go on the top of the nightstand and clutter that area. Or, use rolling storage bins that can fit under your bed to store excess clothing and other items to free up much-needed space in your closet. 4. Make use of lighting - Use lighting to set the mood in your room. Soft lighting can add a sense of intimacy, while bright lights can cause you to feel alert and active. You could use color-changing lights that can do both types of lighting, or you can have dedicated lighting (such as LED light strips) as accents in certain areas of your room. 5. Put up pictures - Consider decorating your empty walls with still-life pictures or paintings. Having an empty wall can make a room feel less cozy, but putting up some pictures will give you something to look at."},{"prompt":"Create a haiku about love between two women","completion":"Love is love they say I will never stop loving My gentle woman"},{"prompt":"Can you name all the Brontë sisters that wrote novels, including their birth and death dates?

Here are five active dog breeds you might want to consider: 1. Australian Shepherd: The Australian Shepherd is an active herding breed that comes in a variety of colors, including merle. They have lots of energy and few health problems genetically, which make them great hiking companions and give them a chance at a long life. However, they can be very vocal and struggle with separation anxiety, so it's important to get a handle on training early. 2. Border Collie: The Border Collie is one of the most famous working dogs in the world and is very active. However, as they are used to having a job, you will need to provide lots of enrichment and stimulation, or your dog might become bored. 3. Poodle: The Poodle is a hunting dog favored by many due to its dense coat that doesn't shed much, making it ideal for people with allergies. However, as Poodles are highly intelligent, they need to have a lot to do, or they can also become destructive and vocal. 4. Husky: The Husky is a breed with tons of energy which means that if you need a buddy to join you on long weeks, they can be ideal. However, they're very vocal and escape artists. If you don't have at least a six-foot privacy fence, you'll be unable to leave your dog unattended in the backyard, as it might run off—especially if it isn't getting enough exercise. 5. Corgi: For something a little smaller, you can look at a Corgi. People often overlook this breed because of its short stubby legs, but as they were bred for herding, they're highly energetic and playful, which makes them great companions. However, they can be stubborn to train.

I'm looking to get recommendations on healthy vegetables to add to my diet. I'm just looking for vegetables with the highest micronutrient value.","completion":"Sure, can! Let me recommend 4 vegetables to add to your diet: 1) Carrots - Loaded with beta-carotene, which your body converts to vitamin A, carrots are one of the top vegetables to consume. Vitamin A is beneficial for night vision. Additionally, they also contain vitamin K, vitamin C, potassium, and a reasonable amount of fiber. 2) Broccoli - Broccoli is loaded with vitamins A, C and K. In addition, the phytochemical sulforaphane is in broccoli, which may help to prevent certain types of cancer. On top of all of that, it contains lutein, beta-carotene and zeaxanthin, which may decrease the risk of age-related macular degeneration. Given the cancer-preventing properties, this has to be on the list. 3) Mushrooms - Mushrooms are rich in B vitamins, niacin, riboflavin and pantothenic acid. These help in the formation of red blood cells, aiding digestion and maintaining healthy skin. The bioactive compounds in mushrooms may also help with cognition, heart health, and disease prevention. 4) Kale - Kale contains a variety of vitamins like A, B6, and K. It also has several minerals like potassium, calcium, copper and magnesium. This puts it by numbers alone, above most other vegetables. Just a half cup of kale gives you 440% of the recommended daily value of Vitamin K and 10% of the daily value of calcium."},{"prompt":"Summarize by providing four ways a person with vertigo can use self-care for treatment.

Introduce some ancillary characters (you can choose names for these characters). Use 3 paragraphs.","completion":"\\"Tili and Wills\\" is a children's TV series that tells the story of two dogs. Willow, affectionately nicknamed \\"Wills,\\" is a majestic fawn and white six-year-old Great Dane, who lives with her two human parents, Patrick and Jessica.

For example, the episode \\"Purrfect Pals,\\" where Tilian and Willow befriend Ori, the new cat next door, helps to encourage empathy and befriending others, even though they might be very different from us. Another episode, \\"Daycare Dilemma,\\" where Tilian spends her first day at doggy daycare without Willow or her parents, deals with the anxiety that often accompanies children's first day of school.

I am struggling with monthly payments and want a step-by-step guide to pay it all off.","completion":"It can be difficult to manage debt. Here are some tips for paying it off: Step 1: Make an emergency fund. Whether it is 500 or 3000, emergencies happen. It is important to first have some cash saved on the side so you stop using debt. Step 2: Use the snowball method to pay off debt. Put your debt in order from smallest to largest. Start paying as much as possible to the first/smallest debt and the minimums for the rest. Once the first debt is paid off, take what you were paying on that, and apply it to the next debt. Do this until you have everything but your home paid off! Step 3: Start saving for a fully funded emergency fund. Think about all of your expenses and have 3-6 months saved in case something happens to your income. Step 4: Start investing. Many suggest applying 15% of your income to investing. If your employer matches, max out their contributions. Step 5: Save for your children's college fund if applicable. Step 6: Pay off your home early. Start paying at least one extra payment a year and your mortgage will quickly dwindle. Step 7: Continue building your wealth and give whenever possible. Enjoy your money and life."},{"prompt":"From the passage below, extract the ranks in the common taxonomy that it describes. Output these ranks, one to a line, in order of most general to most specific. Output a blank line, and print a comma-and-space-separated list of animals mentioned as being in the order Carnivora. Do not include the red fox in the list. Print these animals in the order in which they are mentioned in the passage. Enclose the list in square brackets []. Do not mention any animal more than once. In biology, taxonomic rank is the relative level of a group of organisms (a taxon) in an ancestral or hereditary hierarchy. A common system of biological classification (taxonomy) consists of species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, domain. While older approaches to taxonomic classification were phenomenological, forming groups on the basis of similarities in appearance, organic structure and behaviour, methods based on genetic analysis have opened the road to cladistics. A given rank subsumes under it less general categories, that is, more specific descriptions of life forms. Above it, each rank is classified within more general categories of organisms and groups of organisms related to each other through inheritance of traits or features from common ancestors. The rank of any species and the description of its genus is basic; which means that to identify a particular organism, it is usually not necessary to specify ranks other than these first two.[1] Consider a particular species, the red fox, Vulpes vulpes: the specific name or specific epithet vulpes (small v) identifies a particular species in the genus Vulpes (capital V) which comprises all the \\"true\\" foxes. Their close relatives are all in the family Canidae, which includes dogs, wolves, jackals, and all foxes; the next higher major rank, the order Carnivora, includes caniforms (bears, seals, weasels, skunks, raccoons and all those mentioned above), and feliforms (cats, civets, hyenas, mongooses). Carnivorans are one group of the hairy, warm-blooded, nursing members of the class Mammalia, which are classified among animals with backbones in the phylum Chordata, and with them among all animals in the kingdom Animalia. Finally, at the highest rank all of these are grouped together with all other organisms possessing cell nuclei in the domain Eukarya. The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature defines rank as: \\"The level, for nomenclatural purposes, of a taxon in a taxonomic hierarchy (e.g. all families are for nomenclatural purposes at the same rank, which lies between superfamily and subfamily).\\"[2]","completion":"domain kingdom phylum class order family genus species [foxes, dogs, wolves, jackals, bears, seals, weasels, skunks, raccoons, cats, civets, hyenas, mongooses]"},{"prompt":"I'm thinking about trying out some new hairstyles but I'm not sure what kinds there are. Can you please give me 5 examples of new hairstyles I can try? I'm a man with long hair.","completion":"Sure thing! Here are 5 hairstyles you can try out for long hair: 1. Man-bun - Long hair works for the man-bun hairstyle, which is a version of the female bun. It involves putting your hair up into a bun or top-knot so it is not hanging down on your neck or in your eyes. 2. Clean-cut - Maybe you're tired of having long hair and want a completely different look. In that case, cut your hair short using electronic clippers until the hair is at your desired length (1/4 to 1/2 inches in length is a good look). 3. Wavy look - If your hair is very long, consider cutting it to medium length (shoulder-length) and perm your hair so it becomes wavy. 4. Spikey hair with a fade - Cut your hair medium-length and spike it with styling gel at the top, then cut it until it \\"fades\\" downward toward the neck where the hairline disappears; do the fade around the entire head. 5. Pompadour - If you want the best of both worlds, get a pompadour haircut. This entails cutting the hair short into a fade around the head and leaving the hair longer at the top just above the forehead."},{"prompt":"Write me an engaging twitter thread on the basics of financial planning for freelancers.","completion":"Tweet 1: Financial planning for freelancers is vital to career success. Irregular income, lack of employment benefits, and ever-changing industries are all reasons freelancers should prepare for the future. In this thread, we will go over some steps you can take. Tweet 2: Set financial goals. Setting financial goals allows freelancers clarity on what they are working towards. Without financial goals, freelancers can lose track of what is essential for long-term financial security. Goals serve as a constant reminder. Tweet 3: Set a realistic budget. Once you have your goals in place, the next step is to produce a budget that keeps you living within your means. You can ensure your budget is realistic by using your minimum income level to combat the nature of irregular income. Tweet 4: Build an emergency fund. An emergency fund is pivotal to your security as a freelancer. Clients come and go, and work can dry up quickly. Protecting against this can be the difference between a successful freelancer and one who finds themselves in debt. Tweet 5: Retirement plan. Not having a contract with clients means freelancers do not get the benefits of a company pension. This means freelancers must take action and create a retirement plan themselves. A versatile portfolio with regular contributions is easy enough to set up! Tweet 6: Q&A I hope you all enjoyed this thread.

Quick weight loss can sound pretty enticing. That's especially true when fad diets and social media make it seem more realistic than it really is to drop 10 pounds in 10 days. In fact, \\"yo-yo dieting\\" or \\"weight cycling\\" is associated with an increased risk of death. The truth is, for many people, it's not easy to lose weight for a myriad of reasons, including life-stage, body composition, physical activity, genetics and hormones, among other factors. Plus, weight is not the end all be all and is only one of several factors that impact our overall health. Extreme calorie restriction and excessive exercising is something our nutrition and fitness experts would never recommend for health reasons, but they also note that you'll likely gain all of your weight back faster than you lost it if you try those approaches. Losing weight by improving your overall diet and lifestyle is without a doubt the healthiest way to go.","completion":"The author explains that quick weight loss is unhealthy with the following information: Weight cycling may increase the risk of death, and you’re more likely to gain the weight back with extreme calorie restriction and excessive exercise."},{"prompt":"Turn the facts in this paragraph into a series of questions with answers Over 5,000 previously unknown sea creatures, including sea sponges, worms and urchins, were discovered in a pristine, almost untouched area of the Pacific Ocean that might soon become the site of mineral mining operations. Large-scale environmental surveys were previously conducted there from the late 1970s to early 1990s, but only compiled lists with informal species names and very few formal species descriptions. Scientists now compiled these informal lists and published their results in a peer-reviewed study on May 25 in the journal Current Biology. According to their estimates, they found a total of 5,578 different species in the region, an estimated 88%–92% of which were described for the first time ever. The region where all of the new species were discovered is called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a 6 million sq. km. area roughly twice the size of India, lying between Hawaii, Kiribati, and Mexico in the central and eastern Pacific. “We share this planet with all this amazing biodiversity, and we have a responsibility to understand it and protect it,” Muriel Rabone, a deep-sea ecologist at the Natural History Museum London, told the website Eurekalert. In the course of decades of exploration missions in the CCZ, over 100,000 creatures were recorded. The researchers found that only six of these had ever been seen in other regions, after combing through all the files. The most common species they found in the remote region were arthropods (invertebrates with segmented joints), worms, echinoderms (spiny invertebrates like sea urchins), and sponges. “There are some just remarkable species down there. Some of the sponges look like classic bath sponges, and some look like vases. They’re just beautiful,” said Rabone of the CCZ samples. “One of my favorites is the glass sponges. They have these little spines, and under the microscope, they look like tiny chandeliers or little sculptures. There are so many wonderful species in the CCZ, and with the possibility of mining looming, it’s doubly important that we know more about these really understudied habitats.” The rise in global demand for metals like cobalt and nickel has created unprecedented interest in deep-sea habitats which possess mineral resources. Exploration of the CCZ for minerals began in 1960, and today 1.2 million sq. km. are divided up and assigned to 17 companies for future deep-sea mining. The scientists expect the overall number of species in the region to continue to climb, as vast areas of the CCZ still haven't been explored.","completion":"How many previously unknown sea creatures were discovered in an untouched area of the Pacific Ocean?

Immediately, my spacesuit’s microphones relayed the whistle of the planet’s brisk breeze. It seemed a shame I couldn’t draw a deep breath of it and smell the pristine air, but the hydrogen cyanide that made up 30% of the planet’s atmosphere would have made that a bad idea. Instead, I drank in the scene with my eyes. The horizon to the north was dominated by jagged lavender peaks that ended just below blue clouds. Toward the east were immense rock formations that would put all of Earth’s national parks to shame. Each one was striated with layers of burgundy, ochre, crimson, and the occasional thin line of teal that made everything pop. Between those rocks and my ship was a broad floodplain full of orange soil. Only a small stream of yellow liquid flowed down from the mountains at the moment, but it was clear that this whole landscape could change in a hurry when the rains came. No sight I’d ever beheld could compare and I knew I’d probably never feel such an incalculable sense of awe again. And all this was in spite of the fact that there were no plants to speak of. No forests framed the landscape. No wildflowers pocked the surface. Not a speck of life could be found anywhere. As of this moment, I was the only human - and indeed maybe the only living thing - to have ever looked upon it. I felt a slight pang of shame for daring to intrude upon this pristine perfection.

I really want to install a pool in my yard. Can you tell me a bit about the different types of pools?","completion":"Sure! Here are the different types of pools you might want to consider: 1. Inground Pool: Inground pools are permanent structures built into the ground. They offer a wide range of design possibilities and can be customized in terms of shape, size, and materials. 2. Above-Ground Pool: Above-ground pools are installed on top of the ground with a framework made of metal, resin, or wood. They are more affordable and easier to install compared to inground pools. 3. Infinity Pool: Infinity pools, also known as vanishing-edge or negative-edge pools, create the illusion of the water extending to the horizon. They feature at least one edge that spills over into a catch basin, giving a seamless blend with the surrounding environment. They're expensive but popular due to their aesthetic appeal. 4. Lap Pool: Lap pools are specifically designed for swimming laps and exercise. They're long and narrow, allowing swimmers to swim continuously without interruptions. Lap pools can be either inground or above ground, and they usually have a consistent depth throughout the pool. 5. Swim Spa: A swim spa is a combination of a small pool and a spa. It features a powerful current that allows you to swim in place, providing the benefits of swimming and hydrotherapy. Swim spas are smaller than traditional pools, so they can fit more easily in your yard. 6. Hot Tub: Hot tubs, also known as spas or jacuzzis, are small, heated pools designed for relaxation, hydrotherapy, and enjoyment. They often have built-in jets that provide massaging and therapeutic effects. Hot tubs can be either inground or above ground and are usually small."},{"prompt":"Give me a one sentence summary of the main point of the following excerpt: Livestreamed events Pre-Covid, online events were reserved for the technologically savvy.

Brain infection: Brain infections such as meningitis or encephalitis can cause non-epileptic seizures. 3. Severe general illness 4. Lack of sleep 5. Low sodium levels in the blood: Low sodium levels can be caused by taking medicine that makes the patient urinate. 6. Legal or illegal medication or drugs: Certain medications including medicines to treat pain or depression or illegal substances such as amphetamines or cocaine can trigger non-epileptic seizures. 7.

'And beyond the Wild Wood again?' he asked: 'Where it's all blue and dim, and one sees what may be hills or perhaps they mayn't, and something like the smoke of towns, or is it only cloud-drift?' 'Beyond the Wild Wood comes the Wide World,' said the Rat. 'And that's something that doesn't matter, either to you or me. I've never been there, and I'm never going, nor you either, if you've got any sense at all. Don't ever refer to it again, please. Now then! Here's our backwater at last, where we're going to lunch.' Leaving the main stream, they now passed into what seemed at first sight like a little land-locked lake. Green turf sloped down to either edge, brown snaky tree-roots gleamed below the surface of the quiet water, while ahead of them the silvery shoulder and foamy tumble of a weir, arm-in-arm with a restless dripping mill-wheel, that held up in its turn a grey-gabled mill-house, filled the air with a soothing murmur of sound, dull and smothery, yet with little clear voices speaking up cheerfully out of it at intervals. It was so very beautiful that the Mole could only hold up both forepaws and gasp, 'O my! O my! O my!' The Rat brought the boat alongside the bank, made her fast, helped the still awkward Mole safely ashore, and swung out the luncheon-basket. The Mole begged as a favour to be allowed to unpack it all by himself; and the Rat was very pleased to indulge him, and to sprawl at full length on the grass and rest, while his excited friend shook out the table-cloth and spread it, took out all the mysterious packets one by one and arranged their contents in due order, still gasping, 'O my! O my!' at each fresh revelation. When all was ready, the Rat said, 'Now, pitch in, old fellow!' and the Mole was indeed very glad to obey, for he had started his spring-cleaning at a very early hour that morning, as people WILL do, and had not paused for bite or sup; and he had been through a very great deal since that distant time which now seemed so many days ago.","completion":"As the bird soared above, it observed the Mole's unease and his swift decision to abandon any mention of impending trouble, aware that it violated animal etiquette. The topic was dropped promptly. Curiosity piqued the bird's interest as the Mole inquired about what lay beyond the Wild Wood. The Rat responded, describing a realm of indistinct blues and dimness, where hazy shapes resembling hills or mere illusions blended with what might be smoke from distant towns or simply wisps of cloud. The Rat dismissed it, asserting that the Wide World beyond the Wild Wood held no significance for them. It was a place neither had ventured into nor desired to if they possessed any semblance of reason. The Rat implored the Mole to never bring it up again. With that, they arrived at their secluded backwater, their chosen spot for lunch. Leaving the mainstream behind, they entered what initially appeared to be a small, enclosed lake. Verdant grass sloped down on either side, revealing glimpses of snakelike brown tree roots beneath the tranquil surface of the water. Up ahead, the silver cascade and frothy churn of a weir greeted them, accompanied by the incessant drip of a restless mill wheel. The mill wheel, in turn, supported a gray-gabled mill house that emanated a comforting, muffled hum, intermittently interrupted by cheerful, clear voices. The sight was so breathtaking that the Mole could only lift both forepaws in awe, gasping, \\"O my! O my! O my!\\" The Rat skillfully guided the boat to the bank, securing it firmly. He assisted the still unsteady Mole in stepping ashore and retrieved the luncheon basket. As a favor, the Mole requested permission to unpack the contents himself. The Rat gladly obliged, sprawling on the grass, enjoying a moment of rest while his enthused companion laid out the tablecloth and arranged the mysterious packets one by one. With each new revelation, the Mole continued to gasp in amazement, exclaiming, \\"O my! O my!\\" At last, when everything was prepared, the Rat encouraged, \\"Now, dig in, my dear friend!\\" The Mole eagerly complied, grateful for the invitation, as he had been engrossed in spring cleaning since the early hours of the morning, forsaking both sustenance and rest.

It should be five paragraphs and make him a middle schooler.","completion":"As soon as that school bell rang young Jimmy jumped out of his chair and out the doors. Fifth grade was such a drag and he couldn't wait to get home, turn on some cartoons, and eat his favorite snacks. Luckily, his house was just across the street. Entering the house, Jimmy shucked off his shoes, tossed his backpack to the floor, and ran to the kitchen. First, he turned on the little television his Mom kept on the countertop. Then he opened up the cupboard to search for his Oreo cookies, the one thing he had been waiting for all day. Except they weren't there. Nearly frantic Jimmy started calling out for his mom before realizing she wasn't home. That's when he saw it on the table. His mom had already set out a tray of cookies with a note telling him to enjoy himself and to be a good boy. An empty glass stood next to the plate piled high with cookies and Jimmy quickly filled it with milk from the fridge. This was the best part. Sitting down, his feet barely touching the floor, Jimmy dunked an Oreo into the milk. He let it soak up for a few seconds before consuming it in one all-too-big bite. Every cookie was a different adventure and a different creation. Sometimes he would eat the cream first, and sometimes he wouldn't even dunk them at all. Then, staring at his last two cookies, a new idea came to him. Picking both cookies up, he put them directly into the milk and let them sink to the bottom. After a minute passed. Jimmy grabbed a spoon and plunged it into the milk. He tried to fish out his cookies only to find nothing but crumbles. Disappointed at first he poked around more and stirred up the dregs. The milk turned from a pristine white to a muddier brown as chocolate bits danced, swirled, and mixed in. Marveling at his new concoction, Jimmy took the spoon out and gave it a sip. Then another sip, and then he drank the whole thing in one go. This was better than any cookie he had eaten. An Oreo milkshake! What a discovery. Jimmy set the glass down satisfied and with dreams in his head of making another one tomorrow after school."},{"prompt":"The Python code below is giving me a long decimal number for the 2 variables.

Label each list. Learning disability, learning disorder, or learning difficulty (British English) is a condition in the brain that causes difficulties comprehending or processing information and can be caused by several different factors. Given the \\"difficulty learning in a typical manner\\", this does not exclude the ability to learn in a different manner. Therefore, some people can be more accurately described as having a \\"learning difference\\", thus avoiding any misconception of being disabled with a lack of ability to learn and possible negative stereotyping. In the United Kingdom, the term \\"learning disability\\" generally refers to an intellectual disability, while conditions such as dyslexia and dyspraxia are usually referred to as \\"learning difficulties\\".[6] While learning disability and learning disorder are often used interchangeably, they differ in many ways. Disorder refers to significant learning problems in an academic area. These problems, however, are not enough to warrant an official diagnosis. Learning disability, on the other hand, is an official clinical diagnosis, whereby the individual meets certain criteria, as determined by a professional (such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, speech language pathologist, or pediatrician). The difference is in degree, frequency, and intensity of reported symptoms and problems, and thus the two should not be confused. When the term \\"learning disorder\\" is used, it describes a group of disorders characterized by inadequate development of specific academic, language, and speech skills.[7] Types of learning disorders include reading (dyslexia), arithmetic (dyscalculia) and writing (dysgraphia).[7]","completion":"Professionals who can diagnose a learning disorder - psychologist - psychiatrist - speech language pathologist - pediatrician Types of learning disorders - dyslexia (reading) - dyscalculia (arithmetic) - dysgraphia (writing)"},{"prompt":"Write an original free verse poem from a cat’s perspective of a dog.","completion":"Big paws and bad breath You are such a mess You belong outside where the wild things are You jump on everyone Drool everywhere and have gas that could knock out a cow The humans love you, and I don’t know why Because your fur is everywhere Drool all over the windows And you bark all of the time They should love me more All I do is sit and purr I even kill the bugs in the house Cats will always be better than dogs You may be man’s best friend But we are a woman’s best friend"},{"prompt":"Write a short blog post about a person who likes to run, and is explaining their approach to running.","completion":"I like to run. I never used to like it when I was younger, but as I get older I find myself enjoying running immensely. Running becomes a great form of moving meditation that also serves as a fantastic workout. But I wasn't born with the ability to run, I had to learn how to run. Yes, running is pretty simple, but efficiency in running is something that requires a lot of practice. Here's what I have noticed in the years since I started running that has helped me to improve: 1. Start low, and work your way up - I started running based on time, rather than distance. My beginner's routine was a mix of running and walking, made up of 60- to 90-second runs interspersed with 60-second rest periods over 7 or 8 cycles. As I ran longer minutes, I was gaining more distance, and after some time I was able to switch to distance running where I would run based on how far I wanted to go. 2. Low and slow is the key - running slowly and ensuring I got my running form correct were keys to my improvements in running. Low-impact running, not going all-out trying to break records or push my body unnecessarily, helped me to build on my weekly mileage. 3. Relax and breathe - relaxing your body during a run is important to conserving energy over long distances. Also, learning to breathe while running (such as cadenced breathing or breathing with a certain tempo) helps to ensure you're getting enough air into your lungs while still being able to work your body. 4. Finding the zone - when I run, I am sometimes able to reach a specific \\"zone,\\" where I am running and not expending much energy, yet I am still getting a workout. It feels like being on autopilot, where my body can act accordingly while my mind can meditate on things like my surroundings, the music I'm listening to, or whatever I want to think about that day. This zone takes time to reach because it requires training the body to reach a certain level of fitness before you can be comfortable with running multiple miles and not being tired. But once you've reached it, it will feel like you're gliding effortlessly."},{"prompt":"Can you rewrite this story differently and give it a dark twist? My Brother and I got along great.

The so-called deal to raise the debt limit reached by President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy fails to address America’s addiction to out-of-control spending. At a time when we’re staring down the barrel of a once-unthinkable 32 trillion national debt, our leaders are attempting to pull another fast one on the very people that they’re supposed to be fighting for. Exactly no one in Washington was elected to abdicate responsibility by putting off difficult decisions for another day, but this proposal does exactly that. Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie’s vote in the Rules Committee to advance the measure to the House floor in the end will turn out to be a consequential mistake. Massie supplied the critical 7th vote for the deal because the package includes language he pushed that is supposed to make it more difficult for members of Congress to abuse the spending process if they don’t pass appropriations bills on time again. Massie’s idea is well-intentioned, but the idea that the Washington uni-party won’t find a loophole is naive.","completion":"Recently, the president of the United States, Joe Biden, and the House Speaker, the elected representative for what makes up part of the lower chamber of Congress called the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy did not mention America's spending issue.

Cats prefer the indoors: Felines do not require long, boring walks and are perfectly content gazing out the window as opposed to being out there. 4. Cats are less work: We do not need to be trained to use the outdoors to urinate or defecate and we groom ourselves. 5.

The story should center on her discovery of her becoming a boy. The girl's name should be Maya and she should be living with her extended family.","completion":"It was a regular morning in the village. Maya woke up at the sound of the first cockcrow, stretched, and drank a glass of water. Being the first to awake, Maya went out to the corridor and shouted \\"Good morning!\\" Surprisingly, her voice sounded thicker than normal. She doubted if she was the one who shouted. \\"Good morning!\\" She shouted again and her voice came out as thick as a man's. Maya's family members began to step out of their rooms to the corridor to begin their daily activities. Surprisingly, most of them just passed by and gazed weirdly at her. It was strange. Maya couldn't understand why she felt like a stranger in her family. Suddenly, someone tapped her from behind. It was her grandpa. \\"Who are you?\\" He asked. \\"And who are you here to see?” \\"It's me Grandpa, Maya,\\" she answered. Clearly, her grandpa didn’t recognize her. \\"Maya? More like this young boy has had a drink,\\" he said sarcastically and laughed a little. \\"Young boy.\\" That phrase lingered in Maya's head. She wondered why her grandfather didn't recognize her. As she thought, it began to make sense why her family didn't recognize her, why her voice sounded masculine when she shouted earlier, and why her grandpa called her a boy! Maya ran to her room to view her reflection in the mirror. She could hear footsteps chasing after her as they assumed she was an impostor. Maya locked the door behind her the moment she got into her room. She looked in the mirror and couldn't recognize the person she saw. Her pajamas were the same, but she wasn't. Her hair was short, her shoulders were broader and her chin seemed chiseled. The person in the mirror looked like a boy. Maya slapped her face to ascertain that it wasn't a dream. She reached out to the reflection in the glass and the reflection simultaneously did the same. It was confirmed, the boy in the mirror was her and it wasn't a dream. Maya let out a scream that shook the house. \\"Ahhh!\\" The persistent knocking on her room's door stopped and the house became still. She didn't know how she had changed into a boy, but she was certain this was going to be the weirdest day of her life."},{"prompt":"Write an email from Ronald W.

Eat out less - Not only does eating out cost more than cooking at home, but there is also the cost of gas to travel to and from the restaurant. You may also be paying a premium to have food delivered to your door. Avoid these extra costs by buying food at the grocery store and making hearty meals at home. 2. Use less electricity - Turn off lights when you're not in the room, open windows or use a fan instead of an electric air conditioner, and turn off the television and other electronics when they're not in use. 3. Use the tap, don't buy bottled - Avoid purchasing numerous bottles of water unless it cannot be avoided (in the airport, for instance). Instead, drink water from the tap with the option to use a filter. Also, buy a reusable water bottle and carry it with you when you need a drink on the go. 4. Spend less time in the shower - You can either take shorter showers or you can opt for a \\"military\\" shower by turning off the tap between soapings. 5. Change your mode of transportation - If you own a vehicle and the gas is costing you too much money, consider using public transportation (bus, rail, or subway). Alternatively, you can get a bike or use another form of self-propelled transport (skateboard, push scooter, etc). 6. Use prepaid phones - Consider switching to phone cards or prepaid phone plans for your cellular data, text, and calls to avoid making a monthly payment. Using prepaid phones allows you to only pay for the data and calls that you use. 7. Cut the cord - Stop paying for cable or satellite dishes that add a bunch of unused channels into your bill to justify the high price. You may be paying hundreds of dollars a month for cable or satellite, but you might also be watching only a handful of the 1000+ channels offered in your monthly package. Get rid of them. 8. Recycle - Recycle the items that you can recycle, especially the ones that pay you money to turn them into your recycling center (i.e. aluminum cans, plastic and glass bottles). You could be throwing away money by throwing these items out with your regular trash."},{"prompt":"Have any female graduates of West Point been killed in action?","completion":"1LT Laura Margaret Walker graduated from the U.

He experimented with electricity and invented an electric battery. When he connected wires to his battery and a piece of carbon, the carbon glowed, producing light. His invention was known as the Electric Arc lamp. And while it produced light, it didn’t produce it for long and was much too bright for practical use. Over the next seven decades, other inventors also created “light bulbs” but no designs emerged for commercial application. More notably, in 1840, British scientist Warren de la Rue enclosed a coiled platinum filament in a vacuum tube and passed an electric current through it. The design was based on the concept that the high melting point of platinum would allow it to operate at high temperatures and that the evacuated chamber would contain fewer gas molecules to react with the platinum, improving its longevity. Although an efficient design, the cost of the platinum made it impractical for commercial production. In 1850 an English physicist named Joseph Wilson Swan created a “light bulb” by enclosing carbonized paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. And by 1860 he had a working prototype, but the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate supply of electricity resulted in a bulb whose lifetime was much too short to be considered an effective producer of light. However, in the 1870’s better vacuum pumps became available and Swan continued experiments on light bulbs. In 1878, Swan developed a longer lasting light bulb using a treated cotton thread that also removed the problem of early bulb blackening Summarize the text as it relates to the design of the light bulb.","completion":"The first electric light was invented in 1802 by Humphry Davy.

I've been tasked with making some sweet treats for my family's Halloween party and I need ideas. They should obviously be Halloween-themed. I have to make a couple of desserts so I'd need at least 6 ideas and I can pick the one I like best. They should be hand-held desserts so ideas like an entire cake won't be useful to me. Please also include a way to make each of the recipes gluten free.","completion":"No problem! Here are 6 ideas for your Halloween desserts: 1. Frankenstein's Monster Crispy Rice Treats: This is a fun dessert that is easy to make and doesn't require the use of an oven. First, make up a batch of crispy rice treats by melting butter and marshmallows on the stovetop. Once melted, add some crisped rice cereal and green food coloring, then stir to combine. Leave to set in a rectangular pan, then cut into uniform rectangle shapes. Take some melted dark or milk chocolate, and dip the top part of the treat into the chocolate to resemble hair. Add edible candy eyeballs for the eyes, and use black icing to pipe on a smile and some scars. To make the recipe gluten-free, ensure that the rice cereal you're using is a gluten-free variety. 2. Mummified Cookies: These cute cookies are easy to make. Take a sugar cookie, either store-bought or homemade. Make a simple frosting of powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and milk (no food coloring needed) and pipe it onto the cooled cookies in a zig-zag motion. Use candy eyeballs or black icing for eyes. Bake your sugar cookies at home using gluten-free flour to make the recipe gluten-free. 3. Monster Cake Pops: Make some cake pops using whichever cake flavor you'd like (or use multiple flavors). Once they have cooled completely, melt some white candy melts or white chocolate at a low temperature. Separate them into bowls and add different food coloring to each bowl (you can use whichever colors you'd prefer, but colors such as bright blue, green, or orange would be great for these pops) and coat the cake pops in the coating. Once the coating has set, decorate them with candy eyes and Halloween sprinkles. To make the recipe gluten-free, use gluten-free flour to make your cake pops, or you can substitute the cake with giant marshmallows. 4. Spooky Pull-Apart Cupcakes: Pull-apart cupcakes are a great way to feed a crowd without having to make an entire cake and cut it into pieces. Bake some cupcakes at home or purchase store-bought plain cupcakes that aren't already frosted. Then, you will assemble your cupcakes so they are sitting together in the desired shape. For example, if you were making a pumpkin pull-apart cake, you would assemble the cupcakes into a circular shape. Then, take your frosting and frost the cupcakes as though you were icing an entire cake. You can keep this as simple or make it as extravagant as you want. Some ideas for a Halloween-inspired pull-apart cake include a pumpkin, a ghost, or a tombstone. When guests want to eat a part of the cake, all they have to do is remove one of the cupcakes! Bake your cupcakes at home using gluten-free flour to make the recipe gluten-free. 5. Mini Cobweb Cheesecakes: Make miniature vanilla cheesecakes (baked cheesecakes would work best for this recipe) in some Halloween-themed cupcake liners. Once the cupcakes have cooled in the fridge, take some black icing or melted dark chocolate, and use a piping bag to pipe a cobweb pattern onto the top of each cheesecake. For an extra spooky touch, you can add a candy or chocolate spider on top of the cobweb. To make the recipe gluten-free, you can leave out the crust on your cheesecakes, or make the crust using gluten-free cookies or graham crackers. 6. Graveyard Pudding: Take small plastic cups and fill them with chocolate pudding about 3/4 of the way up. Take some crumbled chocolate cake or chocolate sandwich cookies like Oreos, and use them to top the pudding to resemble the soil. Then take half a cookie that is rectangular or semi-rectangular in shape, such as a Milano cookie. Pipe \\"RIP\\" onto the cookies using icing or melted chocolate, then stick it on top of the soil to resemble a tombstone. You can also add some gummy worms on top of or inside the pudding mix. To make the recipe gluten-free, ensure the cake and/or cookies you are using for the soil and tombstones are gluten-free varieties."},{"prompt":"Write a short poem, no more than twenty lines, about a dog waiting for its owner to come home.

At first, its roots were shallow, unable to find purchase in the cracked and sun-hardened ground. This plant was stubborn though and determined to find a way to survive where no plant had ever survived before. It soaked up the sun’s harsh rays during the day and weathered the nighttime frost and waited patiently for the day when the rain would finally bless the brittle valley. When it did, the droplets were such a relief to the parched little plant, but it knew that it needed to make this water last. And so, for the rest of the storm, it focused all of its energy on pulling the water that fell upon its stem inward. Weeks passed and the land dried back up, but the plant remained cool and content with its core full of water. The ground below could feel the moisture emanating from the plant’s roots and tugged at them, pulling them deeper and deeper, and the plant grew strong. For many years this system worked without fail, but life was evolving rapidly and new creatures were moving to the valley every day. These creatures were not able to store their water in the same way this plant was, but they were able to use their beaks and claws to chip away at it, revealing the water inside and taking it for themselves. The plant knew that it needed a way to protect itself - its own version of beaks and claws. So it concentrated once again, and eventually produced a long pointy leaf that would pierce anything it came in contact with. One of these spines gave way to another and another until one day, the plant was completely covered in them. Nothing bothered the plant again and it lived peacefully in that valley for more than a hundred years, Eventually, though, it became lonely and longed for a companion to teach its secrets to and a crown of beautiful white flowers sprouted from its head. Tiny creatures were intoxicated by the smell of these flowers and got close enough to spread their pollen, allowing the plant to reproduce. Over time the land became covered with this one plant’s children. Humans came around and gave a name to them - the cactus. They were prized and cultivated and praised for their ability to adapt and survive in harsh conditions."},{"prompt":"Hello.

Number each paragraph and use these names for the title of each paragraph and put it over the paragraph. Focus more on feral cats rather than house cats. Start the article with a brief unnumbered paragraph two sentences long about feral cats and house cats.","completion":"The main difference between feral cats, also called strays or alley cats, and house cats is the amount of time they spend in the company of humans. While house cats spend most or all of their lives living inside a house surrounded by people, feral cats have little if any contact with humans. 1. Sociability Anyone who has run afoul of a feral cat will tell you they are very anti-social. Most feral cats will run away from humans at first sight. They also hiss, spit, and will claw if someone gets too close. Most feral cats live together in a colony and have no use or interest in people. However, feral kittens can be domesticated if taken from the colony or rescued before they are four months old. After that, there is very little chance to domesticate a feral kitten. 2. Behavior Modification Modifying a feral kitten's behavior is challenging but quite possible. Depending on the kitten's temperament, it can take as little as two weeks before the kitten learns to trust people and positively interact with them. If the feral kitten is skittish or afraid, it will take longer but is still very doable. The main requirement is to be patient with the kittens and committed to their domestication. 3. Trap-Neuter-Release The TNR program was designed to control the feral cat population. The cat is trapped, neutered then released back into the wild, preferably back to its colony. Along with neutering, the cats receive the rabies vaccine and usually have the tip of one ear cut off to mark that they have been neutered. Although the program has helped reduce the feral cat population, more cats need to go through the TNR program to effectively reduce their numbers."},{"prompt":"Come up with a list of 10 video game heroes and 3 video game villains, and then write a short story about the heroes fighting the villains for a powerful artifact.","completion":"Heroes: 1.

The villains guarded a magical key that was said to unlock a chest containing a powerful artifact that could resurrect all the heroes from all the game franchises and bring them to the battlefield to assist the 10 heroes and vanquish evil for good. Link struck the first blow, shooting a flaming arrow at Gannon's head. GLaDOS created an energy field around the villain group, causing the arrow to glance harmlessly away from them. Then, The Flood began running toward the heroes in a swarm, attempting to overwhelm them with their numbers. Mario and Luigi were the first to move; they were charged with entering the sewers underneath the villains' forcefield via pipes and coming up behind them to grab the magic key.

Mental Health Improvement through Exercise and Diet. \\"Creating and maintaining healthy boundaries is a life skill. It requires a confidence that allows us to feel as though we deserve to be respected, and though it seems many of us are born with it, often it slowly wanes over time. As our childish innocence falls to the side, we try to figure out who to be, how to be, and what to believe. The trust we have in ourselves dwindles as we become more insecure and vulnerable to judgments, made both by others and ourselves, which in turn causes us to give our power away. We struggle to understand our value, to find a clear path to acceptability in the world around us. The constant bombardment of ‘look this way’ and ‘talk that way’ threatens to undermine creativity and self-expression, while the access we have to each other’s personal lives gives free rein to an overwhelming amount of unsolicited advice. Despite that, our boundaries are still there, hidden within us, waiting only for the time when we will recognize them. When we bring them into consciousness we start to believe that it’s okay to have them. We all know what lines we want others to respect and value, no matter how adept we are at enforcing them. We allow ourselves to get lost in the chaos surrounding us—whether we’ve had a hand in creating it or not—and berate ourselves for not being up to the impossible task of meeting everyone else’s expectations. So often, guilt, at the very thought of telling people no, stops us in our tracks. Something as simple as telling our loved ones that we don’t want to be touched talked to, or interrupted seems too bold, too rude. But is it? When we consider the repercussions of allowing others to push and take without relief, we are worse for it. And have less to give, both to ourselves and to our community. There is no joy in a person who has no say in their own life. And without joy there can be very little love to share. We inadvertently give control to whoever is willing to take it, all the while perhaps taking the same from others in the name of trying to help them. So, what do we do? How do we get back to a place where we know that it is our right to determine how we exist and what we are willing to accept? There is so much information available at this time and so many different lifestyles to choose from. Now, possibly more than ever before, we are able to truly live the life that we design. One that gives us meaning and purpose, where we feel like we are truly living from our hearts and souls. Through practices such as meditation and journaling, we are able to dig deep, explore our wants and needs, and uncover the set of boundaries that is perfect for us. Given that we are the ones culpable for the lives we create, it’s about time that we started doing so. One of the greatest gifts we can give is to be our authentic selves, living our best lives out loud and without shame. Living from that space, we inspire people in a way we never could if we allowed the world at large to dictate us into becoming people pleasers. And, we all know from experience that the people we admire the most are the ones that are just themselves, and allow others to be the same; the ones who respect themselves and others in deep and heartfelt ways. This can be a scary thing to do, and we must acknowledge that there is often a lot of fear that must be overcome. We may not want to face confrontation and conflict, or to make strained relationships even more tumultuous. We can also get caught in the trap of feeling like we should be able to go with the flow in life and learn from all that is presented to us. Although, being open to synchronicities and spiritual messages doesn’t mean that we have to allow others to treat us in unacceptable and uncomfortable ways—rather, we need to ensure we always remain in the driving seat in the creation of our own reality. Part of living with intention is claiming our power and living in ways that are loving toward the self. We’ve all been guilty of letting others push us around and take too much. We’ve all felt the pain and anger of having our boundaries trampled. It can be hard to understand how people can treat us badly, so disrespectfully, especially if they are or were loved ones. Yet, very few of us can claim to have never stepped on toes or pushed in where we didn’t belong. It is human nature to give and take, and we all fail occasionally as we strive to find balance. And that’s okay. It is not only understandable but reasonable to expect that we will not always be successful at maintaining our boundaries, or respecting those of others. It’s when unhealthy patterns develop that we must get more serious about starting the sometimes tough, but honest discussions that will allow us to navigate our way out of those habits. As silly as it may feel to schedule conversations, it’s ideal to set aside time so that everyone involved is calm, focused and has intentionally thought over what they might want to share. Genuine inner reflection will also show us where we may be the ones not respecting boundaries. And it is our responsibility, both to the other party and to ourselves, to do something about it. Encouraging our loved ones, including our children, to take personal responsibility and implement their own boundaries is a vital part of healthy, upward spiral relationships. We can be an example for others by not taking their power (even when it feels like they’re trying to force us to) and by claiming full responsibility for our own lives. As our confidence in maintaining our own boundaries grows through awareness and practice, so too will the overflow. Our loved ones won’t be able to help but treat us differently, because we will be different. The entire dynamic of our relationships will change as a result. At the end of our lives, as we look back on all that we accomplished, all who we have loved, and all that held meaning in our hearts, there will be very little room for guilt over having put up boundaries for our own wellbeing, but there could be a lot of regret if we don’t. \\"","completion":"I would classify this under \\"2.

She is in the literature department and studies old texts as her area of focus. She translates and interprets old Japanese texts for modern readers and explores how these texts have affected the culture on a deep level. While this is her area of study to get a job, her secret passion is fiction. She reads copious amounts of fiction and writes her own tales under the pen name Nagumo Ryuunosuke. She is popular in online circles for her complex and meaningful stories. All seems to be going well in her life until something strange happens when she starts a new series. Her series is based on a parallel universe where special abilities exist. In this world, Kokona has the ability to \\"realm walk,\\" using the space between worlds to move about and affect the world around her. As her ability grows, she is able to move further into the space until she finds another reality. At the same time, an evil organization is attempting to break this barrier and cross into another reality. Kokona is the first one to reach the other side, though, and must get help to stop the organization. Kokona appears before Hori, and suddenly, her story is more than just fiction. Kokona ends up reading the fiction Hori wrote and is disturbed.

And is Kokona real, or is it all just a dream?"},{"prompt":"I want you to write a blog post to cover practical tips to help readers lose weight in a healthy and sustainable way. It can be some changes to the daily life and cover things like nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle changes.","completion":"Simple Ways to Achieve Your Weight Loss Goals You’ve been trying a slim-down strategy but nothing seems to work. Here are some simple ideas to shed some pounds that are sure to work: 1. Morning Munchies: Skipping breakfast might save you some time, but it won't save you any pounds. Eating a balanced breakfast jumpstarts your metabolism and keeps cravings at bay, preventing you from overeating later on. 2. Toss the Treats: Stocking up on junk food is like inviting temptation to take control of your body. Remove the trigger foods and replace them with healthy snacks like fruits, nuts, or veggies. 3. Stay Hydrated: Water work wonders! We quickly mistake thirst for hunger. Always keep a reusable water bottle and sip it away whenever you feel like it. 4. Fiber is Your True Friend: High fiber means you’ll feel fuller for a long time. For weight loss, it means you’ll avoid overeating. Try vegetables and whole grains. Choose a quick, nutrient-dense option like a smoothie bowl or whole-grain toast with avocado. 5. Fruits and veggies: Good for your health, great for your waistline. Include them in every meal, swap your snacks for fruit, and make them the star of your plate. 6. Three square meals: Skipping meals will leave you hungry and more likely to overeat. Stick to regular meal times, and balance your plate with a variety of healthy foods. 7. Break a sweat: Get moving! Take a daily walk, a dance class, or something more intense. Being active will burn calories and boost your metabolism way faster. 8. Label language: Learn to decipher food labels to make informed choices. Beware of hidden sugars, salts, and unhealthy fats. Look for foods low in saturated fat and sugars. 9. The size matters: Use smaller plates to trick your brain into feeling full with less food. This simple switch can cut down on portion sizes and keep you from overeating."},{"prompt":"write a funny poem about the real housewives of new york and reference how it recently got canceled","completion":"Simple and small, Yet big and tall, The apple of our eyes, And everyone's asking why.

Can you help me come up with some creative ways to eat more veggies? Make sure your ideas have some degree of explanation.","completion":"Absolutely, I'm happy to help with that. Here are five creative ways to add more vegetables to your diet: 1. Include them in a smoothie. There are many delicious and healthy smoothies that incorporate vegetables as part of a balanced breakfast or snack. One popular example is a kale, pineapple, and banana smoothie with a bit of dairy or non-dairy milk. Some other ideas are to substitute kale for spinach or to try something completely different like a beet or carrot smoothie. 2. Roast them in the oven. Roasting vegetables with a bit of salt, pepper, and oil can be a great way to add flavor and texture without much effort. Some great roasting vegetables include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower. 3. Make appealing salads to go. A new social media-inspired health trend is to prepare attractive-looking salads in convenient and ready-to-go containers such as mason jars. The salads are put in the container in layers with dressing at the bottom, followed by vegetables that are not vulnerable to water such as chopped broccoli, cauliflower, cucumbers, tomatoes, and carrots. After that, you can add leafy vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage, spinach, and kale. You can also add a lean protein like chicken, some nuts, or even a bit of fruit depending on what you're in the mood to eat. 4. Spiralize them and use them instead of noodles. Spiralized zucchini, summer squash, or even beets can be a great change of pace for a plate of pasta with tomato sauce. Use them exactly as you would regular pasta for a delicious and healthy low-carb meal. 5. Add them to desserts. If you're looking for something indulgent, consider carrot cakes, pumpkin pies, and sweet potato puddings as some sweet treats that incorporate vegetables. If you would prefer something a bit healthier overall, you might be interested in trying roasted beets in chocolate pudding cakes, kale in carrot muffins, or zucchini in coconut chocolate cookies, to name a few possibilities. I hope that these ideas inspire you to find new and creative ways to add vegetables to your diet.

Can you give me a bullet list of the contrasts in relatively simple terms? I don’t expect each bullet point to be particularly short, but try not to let the explanations drag on either. It should be succinct but accessible.","completion":"- Powder bed fusion (PBF) machines require a very large amount of powdered build material even for a design that itself doesn’t take up much volume. The 3D object is built up layer-by-layer by depositing a layer of powdered material (often metal) on a build surface called a “bed” and melting or sintering the portions of it that correspond with the final item’s solid structure. A new layer of powder is then spread over that, and the next “slice” worth of material is sintered on top of the previous one. In the end, the entire print bed volume will be filled with powder, much of which is not fused. - By contrast, directed energy deposition (DED) printers funnel powder through nozzles mounted around their energy source (a laser, electric arc, or electron beam). The energy source melts a small portion of the underlying structure and adds the new powder to that position, building it up by a small amount. Since the powder is only added to the point of construction, it uses far less powder than PBF printers. - Like most 3D printers, PBF machines can only print top-down. Overhanging parts can, however, be supported by the previous layers of unsintered powder below and don't technically require support structures to be printed. Many DED printers can also print without building support structures, but they do so by rotating the print nozzle head at angles that most printers cannot achieve. - In most cases, the build volumes of both types of machines need to be flooded with inert gas to prevent melted material from oxidizing. Some DED printers have fewer strictures and can get away with only blowing the inert gas over the melted section below the nozzle. Electron-beam DED printers are more restrictive, however, and require the build volume to be evacuated to a near vacuum so that the electron stream does not interact with gas molecules on its way to the powder. - DED printers can typically be built with larger print volumes than can PBF machines. - Of the two, DED is the newer technology, so fewer operators have the skills necessary to make the most of these machines."},{"prompt":"I want a small python function that adds a 20% error after any number in a piece of text.

There should be five questions and answers, each with kid-friendly facts that don’t include too many difficult vocabulary words. Begin the FAQ with a short paragraph as an introduction to snow owls.","completion":"Snowy owls are native to the Arctic Tundra, but where they fly, hunt, and nest changes with the seasons. The owls prefer colder climates, so they change ranges as the weather warms. It’s kind of like having a summer home and a winter home but for snowy owls. Here are five more interesting questions and answers about snowy owls! Do Snowy Owls Have Families? Yes, snowy owls have families! When a pair of snowy owls mate, the mom and dad stick together for a little while to raise the babies. The mom lays up to 9 eggs, and both owls will protect the nest from predators. When the babies, also known as owlets or chicks, are born, the dad will hunt to gather food while the mom will stay to guard the nest. What Do Snowy Owls Eat? Lemmings are a favorite food for snowy owls, but they also eat a wide range of rodents and small mammals. If there are no lemmings, rabbits, or mice to be found, the snowy owl will hunt for fish, perching birds (like finches and sparrows), and large insects. What is the Average Lifespan of a Snowy Owl? The average lifespan for snowy owls in the wild is up to 10 years. While snowy owls in captivity, such as in zoos or nature preserves, can live 20 years or longer in a controlled, safe environment. How Do Snowy Owls Talk to One Another? Snowy owls are communicative birds! They interact with one another through hoots and whistles when content or attempting to mate, but they hiss or clap their beaks when angry or annoyed. Are Snowy Owls Quiet or Noisy? Where many birds, like hawks, will screech when diving to snatch food from the ground, snowy owls are sneaky and quiet. They don’t want to scare their prey away, so they swoop down to capture smaller animals before their prey knows what’s happened."},{"prompt":"I need a poem about a girl whose mother has abandoned her.

She resents and blames her mother, The hurt and pain continue to smother, Her heart grows cold and bitter, Her spirit was shrouded by a dark winter. Yet slowly the girl starts to heal, Learning to trust, love, and feel, She battles to find her true purpose, Taking steps forward, feeling nervous.

He did not explain any more than that. Can you tell me what exactly a social activist job is and maybe give me some examples in a list?","completion":"Social activism has been around for a long time now, but it was not always called social activism. Social activism is simply finding ways to make society a better place. This could be through your actions, doing positive things, or inactions, stopping doing something that could negatively affect society. Someone who wants to work in a social activist job will get a job that helps or serves society somehow. There are many different jobs that your child can go into that will accomplish this goal. Here are a couple of examples. • Disability Advocate. Someone who is a disability advocate works with people with disabilities and their families to ensure that the person with disabilities is getting what they need out of their healthcare. They know what they are eligible for. • Healthcare Advocate. Your child may become a general healthcare advocate. In this case, they would help with insurance questions and problems, patient complaints, and educating patients on their rights. Healthcare is a serious matter and can be very confusing, making the job of an advocate essential to the general public. • Food Program Coordinator. This job is a huge job for anyone interested in social activism. The help may help a community by organizing food banks or food programs. Food insecurity is already a very significant issue, and it is growing. This is a way to give back to a community or help make it a better place. • College Access Counselor. The level of someone's education can have a huge impact on someone's earning potential throughout their life. A college access counselor helps people apply for colleges and scholarships and helps make the overall process more manageable."},{"prompt":"Please write a few scenes for me that depict a family, including the protagonist Alex, driving in a car on a rainy day.

The general sensory overload he had hoarded would not be aided by an added Jacob. \\"The ammo was said to be found during the airport's routine screening.\\" Alex, seated directly behind his mother, could sense her silent agitation. She strapped and de-strapped herself, frustrated at the small bleeps of information the radio leaked, and she hit buttons senselessly. Despite his father's repeated consolations, she mindlessly raved on. Maybe waking Jacob up wasn't that bad an idea. Too bad pushing him across the car would be caught in the rearview mirror. Alex could only will him to wake up which was, of course, much to no avail. \\"In other news, William Tomlinson is donating.\\" He leaned his head against the cold grubby window and watched the raindrops form glassy globes as they trickled down the car door. A red bicycle passed by, a wet dog in a bush, three puddles and four bigger ones, an alarming shriek and a cry, and the droplets skidded backward. The shriek was his own, the cry was his mother's.

She just ignores me when I try giving her commands.","completion":"Yes! Here are some ways to get your dog to listen to you: 1. Treats: Most dogs are food-motivated, so finding some yummy treats is a great way to get them to listen to you. You can also use their kibble if your dog is on a special diet or can't have too many treats. Every dog is different, so make sure you consider what treats your dog loves best. 2. Toys: If your dog has a favorite toy, you can also use this as motivation. Make sure your dog is aware of you holding the toy when you ask them to do something. 3. Practice Without Distractions: If you're having trouble getting your dog to listen to you in a place where there are plenty of distractions, like in the park or on a busy street, try practicing somewhere without distractions first. At home is ideal, as there should be nothing out of the ordinary. 4. Start Easy: Make sure you start with easy commands and build up. Use the ones your dog already knows well when trying to motivate them to listen to you. 5. Use a Long Leash: If training recall, make sure you attach a long leash to your dog until their recall is solid. This will prevent them from running off. 6. Always Use Positive Reinforcement: Lastly, don't punish your dog for not listening to you. This can result in your dog being fearful of you or aggressive towards you and failing to understand what you want from them. Praise your dog for doing the right thing, and try not to react when they don't. Every dog is different, so finding out what motivates your dog is important. It's also important to be understanding of their age, as a small puppy is much less likely to respond to you every time than an adult dog who's had plenty of practice."},{"prompt":"As Pluto, write a sad haiku about no longer being classified as a planet.

Do not generate any questions that can be answered with simply a yes or no. The Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown on January 17, 1893, after a group of 13 Caucasian businessmen and lawyers staged a coup d'état against Queen Liliuokalani and her government. The group called themselves the Committee of Safety — six citizens of the Kingdom and seven foreign residents of Hawaii (five Americans, one Scotsman, and one German). Their ultimate goal was annexation to the United States. It would be five years, however, until that goal was achieved. The plan to overtake Hawaii’s monarchy had been brewing for decades. It flared up during the reign of Queen Liliuokalani, Kalakaua’s sister who succeeded him as monarch on January 29, 1891, after the king’s death. In early 1892, a secret group — the Annexation Club — was formed by Lorrin A. Thurston, a leading politician, lawyer, businessman and native-born citizen of the Kingdom. The club’s goal was to be ready to act if the queen carried out their worst fear – proposing a lenient constitution to replace the restrictive one forced on Kalakaua in 1887. That document, the Bayonet Constitution, had been authored by Thurston and it had severely limited the monarch’s power. After much agitation and maneuvering on both sides of the political fence, on January 14, 1893, the queen informed her Cabinet that she intended to propose a new constitution. The Annexation Club quickly learned of her plans and formed the Committee of Safety from among its members. They were able to gain the support of the US government minister John L. Stevens and Captain G. C. Wiltse of the USS Boston, the fully armed US warship anchored in Honolulu Harbor. The queen’s Cabinet refused to support her and any new constitution she offered. In an effort to ease tensions, Liliuokalani issued a proclamation that any changes she would seek to the constitution would be accomplished within the framework of the current one. But it was too late to turn back the rising tide of the businessmen who saw their opportunity to finally do away with the monarchy. On January 16, 162 US sailors and marines were landed. The next day, the Committee of Safety issued their proclamation declaring martial law, deposing the queen, and establishing the Provisional Government until such time as union with the US could be attained. At the urging of her Cabinet, the queen surrendered her power to the US government and departed the Palace for her private home nearby. By midnight, almost all of the 17 foreign consuls in Honolulu had recognized the new government, including Stevens and Japanese Consul-General Saburo Fujii. The newly formed government immediately sent envoys to Washington DC to seek a treaty of annexation. Likewise, the Royalist faction sent envoys to plead the queen’s case. In the end, an annexation treaty was sent to Congress, but upon the inauguration of Grover Cleveland as US President in early March, the treaty was quickly withdrawn. Meanwhile, the Japanese Navy warship HIJM Naniwa, arrived in Honolulu on February 23, 1893, to provide protection for Japanese citizens and express Japanese concern after the overthrow of the monarchy. The cruiser remained in Honolulu until May 11, 1893. In December 1893, President Cleveland criticized the involvement of American troops in the coup as a misuse of the power of the United States. Senate hearings followed, but Congress did not act to either restore the monarchy or annex Hawaii. With their goal of annexation stalled, the leaders of the Provisional Government decided to form themselves into the Republic of Hawaii. On July 2, 1894, their new constitution was ratified and Sanford B. Dole, who had been president of the Provisional Government, was endorsed as president for a six-year term. Dole, a Hawaiian citizen from a missionary family, was a cousin to James D. Dole, who would arrive in the islands from Boston in 1899 and develop the pineapple industry. The constitution of the Republic of Hawaii required voters to swear allegiance to the republic. Native Hawaiians refused, but foreigners who had sided with the overthrow were allowed to vote. Strict property and other requirements prevented most Hawaiians and all Asians from voting. The following month, a delegation of Royalists went to Washington again in an effort to convince Cleveland to restore Liliuokalani to the throne. It was too late, was the reply. The president had done all he could and turned the entire affair over to Congress, who continued to do nothing. The US had officially recognized the new government; there was nothing more to be done. Realizing that their only hope was to take matters into their own hands, on January 6, 1895, after months of planning, several hundred Native Hawaiians and other Royalists mounted a counterrevolution to restore the monarchy. However, due to lack of organization and government spies in their midst, within three days the attempt had failed. The insurgents were arrested and imprisoned. On January 16, 1895, Liliuokalani was arrested at her private home, Washington Place, taken to her former Palace, now the capitol of the Republic of Hawaii, and imprisoned in an upstairs room. The next day a search of her home turned up a cache of arms and munitions buried in her garden.","completion":"Sure, here are 25 questions with answers listed below, taken from the provided article. 1) Question: When was the Kingdom of Hawaii overthrown?

It will include both scientific and anecdotal evidence. I didn't do a loading phase but my husband did, just explain this.","completion":"Narrator: If you're watching this video, you may be wondering what a creatine loading phase is, how to do one, and if it's necessary or not. We will get to all of these things as well as discuss my own personal experience with different creatine supplementation methods. Narrator: My husband and I decided to try creatine supplementation for the first time. He did a loading phase before switching to a daily maintenance dose and I did not, I just started with a daily maintenance dose. If you just want to hear about this personal experience, go ahead and skip to about [time stamp] in this video. Narrator: A loading phase of creatine is when you take a large amount of creatine in a short amount of time to saturate your muscles quickly with creatine. Narrator: Most people's baseline muscular creatine stores are only at around 60-80%, so this means that we can increase the creatine in our muscles by roughly 20-40% through supplementation. Narrator: The standard dosing recommendation for a creatine loading phase is 20-25 grams for 5-7 days. Now, this is a GENERAL recommendation, and your exact amount in grams could fall outside of this range depending on your weight. A more precise calculation is your body weight in kilograms multiplied by 0.3. Narrator: After the initial loading phase, muscles can remain saturated with just a daily 3-5 gram maintenance dose. Narrator: Research indicates that if you don't want to do a loading phase, you don't have to in order to reap the benefits of creatine. It will just take approximately 28 days as opposed to 5-7 days to fully saturate your muscles with creatine. Narrator: In my husband's case, he wanted to see benefits from creatine sooner rather than later, so he took 20 grams of creatine for 5 days straight, then followed this loading phase with a daily maintenance dose of 5 grams.

She was born and raised in a suburb of London, England in 1988. She has created and sold several best-selling albums of the 21st century. Her style is unique and cherished by many. She has an outstanding voice with emotional piano melodies in the genre of pop and soul. She primarily capitalized on the artist name \\"A Dell\\" because of a deal with Dell Inc in 2009. The founder of Dell noticed the songwriter's unique talents and capabilities. He wanted to represent the Dell brand by using her unique musical talents and gifted voice. He worked with her to create many best-selling hits: \\"Hello Dell,\\" \\"Rolling in the SSD,\\" \\"Someone Like Dell,\\" and \\"Set Fire to Microsoft.\\" Each of these Grammy-nominated hits was powerful. They communicated strong branding and messages of Dell, Inc. She would go on to help earn Dell Inc at least 500 billion in goodwill over her tenure. Microsoft and Apple strongly opposed the leverage that Dell had over her, but she was never going to stop telling people to buy a Dell."},{"prompt":"Who published the Compendious Dictionary of the English Language and when was it published?","completion":"The Compendious Dictionary of the English Language was published in 1806.

I'm sure that by now everyone has heard of the new lipstick Morphe has dropped, and I was one of the first lucky ones to be able to test it out! To start, the packaging is gorgeous. Morphe's original black packaging is back at it again, which makes this lipstick look as daring as ever. The shade is called \\"Red and Thorned,\\" and it is a striking, burgundy red color. After the first swatch, I was amazed to see how pigmented the lipstick is. The real test, however, was to see if it was as transfer-proof as Morphe claimed it would be. And let me tell you guys: I have eaten a burger, fries, brushed my teeth in this lipstick, and it's still on my lips! You guys need to try this out! Not to mention, the lipstick is also offered in a variety of shades. Morphe strikes again!"},{"prompt":"Write me a simple passage about a basketball team losing a playoff series, give it a slightly sad/melancholy vibe, please.","completion":"Giannis stood at the free-throw line. He knew he had the team's entire season riding on this. The score was 122 to 121. Giannis's team, \\"The Ducks,\\" had been down for just about the whole game. This was the closest they had brought the score down to, and there were only 5 seconds left on the game clock. Giannis had already dropped 40 points on 67% efficiency and, by most metrics, had been having a stellar game, except when it came to free throws. For the entire series, he was about 20% for free throws, which was beyond embarrassing for a star of his caliber. He tried to dismiss this, though, as he loaded up and prepared to shoot his first shot. He completely missed it. Nervous, he knew he had only one more chance to save his team's season, and he wasn't going to let this go to waste. As he thought this, he loaded up again to fire his second shot. He then proceeded to miss the second one as well. With that, he knew that he had no chance now of keeping his team in contention."},{"prompt":"Beauty standards exist all over the world. Everyone wants to keep looking better and better, even if they're already beautiful. However, some people don't know where to start.

Make sure all the tips are basic and can be understood by someone who knows nothing about fashion.","completion":"Here are three fashion tips for beginners: 1) Wear clothes that complement your hair and eye color.

You're also more likely to find outfits that fit your body type if you try new things. 3) Keep up with the trends. You don't need to spend all your money to keep up with the trends. Even having one or two clothing items that match the modern trends will help you stand out more."},{"prompt":"I decided to put my mom on my phone plan.

Lately, their neighbor's kids had been hanging out in front of the house and revving their car engines. Mike found it very annoying and complained constantly. Olivia just took out her hearing aids and enjoyed the peaceful evenings anyway. One evening Mike decided to go down and give the kids a piece of his mind. He was sick and tired of the noise. Olivia didn't want him to go, she worried that losing his temper was bad for his heart. She placed a blue-veined hand on Mike's arm and asked him not to go. Mike shook her hand off and stomped out of the house, determined. \\"Mike, wait!\\" Olivia called after him, trying to catch up. Mike turned around just in time to see his wife trip and lose her balance in the street. He rushed to her side to help her. Olivia moaned in pain and clutched her ankle. \\"I think it's broken.\\" Now Mike was even angrier, his frustration at the kids' noise and worry for his wife coalescing into a white-hot ball in his chest. He cursed loudly. Olivia gasped and said \\"Mike!\\" Mike helped Olivia up to get her out of the street, barely able to support her slight weight. \\"Are you OK, Miz Gretner?\\" a young voice said. Mike looked up to see one of the kids responsible for making the noise. Just as he was about to bark at him, the kid bent down and scooped Olivia up in his arms easily. \\"Where do you want to go, Mr. Gretner?\\" The kid asked. \\"The car, she thinks it's broken. I'll take her to the ER.\\" Mike gestured toward their car in the driveway. \\"Sure thing. Are you OK to drive her? You look a little pale.\\" the kid seemed very concerned. Mike nodded and realizes his anger was gone, leaving only a sick feeling. \\"Yes, I'm fine. Thank you for your help.\\" Once they'd gotten Olivia comfortably in the car, Mike took her to the hospital. As he drove he realized how relieved he was to have help with Olivia.

It sounded as though someone was knocking on the door. Presently, his eyes opened, and the noise persisted. Dennis sat up. Yes, there was definitely something tip-tapping on the front door. He went to investigate and was astonished to see a hand protruding through the broken glass of his front door. He took a deep breath, steadying himself. It wasn't fair to judge prematurely that this person was intending to rob him, so he waited patiently as the hand flopped around, looking for the handle. The thief flicked the lock and pushed the door open gently. \\"Good evening, sir!\\" Dennis said cordially, and the thief started violently.

A moment later, the two were sat with steaming cups of tea. \\"So, what brings you to my humble abode?\\" Dennis asked. \\"Uh, someone forgot their keys and needed help getting into their house. Must have gotten the wrong house number.\\" The thief's eyes darted around the room. \\"Of course,\\" Dennis said, \\"And that must be why you have that set of keys.\\" He gestured to the lock-picking kit the thief had clumsily tied to a keyring on his belt. \\"Uh, yeah.\\" \\"And why, pray tell, do you have a ski mask?\\" \\"It helps me focus,\\" the thief said quickly. \\"Less distraction that way.\\" \\"Naturally, but you should really be careful.\\" Dennis waggled a finger at him. \\"People 'round here might take you for a thief.

Thanksgiving is a good opportunity to do this. Here are a few ideas to keep in mind as you plan your gathering this year: 1.

You can then honor the place of your gathering as you speak at the table before you eat. 2. Eat Indigenous Foods - Although it may take some real research, try to learn about the foods that would have been prepared by indigenous people in the area, and add those dishes to your menu. 3. Learn Local History - Take the time to learn the history of the place where you live, although it will most likely be difficult to know about.

Localize Your Content. It's important to personalize your ads so that they target your intended audience, but consider going further by including the name of the city or the location of the target within the ad in order to really customize their experience. 3. Identify the Most Important KPIs. Key performance indicators or KPIs are metrics that help you measure the success of your marketing campaigns. Whether you are looking at clicks, conversions, or some other indicator, ensure that your business is tracking the right numbers in order to understand what's working and what isn't. 4. Conduct A/B Testing Regularly.

This planet’s gravity was softer than we were used to, allowing us to take great bounding steps across its surface. Soft orange dust puffed up around our feet with each step. It was beautiful, and very different than home. Oh, the things you can discover when you go somewhere new! Lloyd took even bigger leaps than I did. It must be convenient to have four legs! The big, round helmet around his head made him look a little goofy. But my friendly llama did love to put on that space suit! And he always had fun when we got down to a new planet. To prove my point, he brayed contentedly and took another leap up to the top of a small boulder. I smiled inside my own space helmet. I certainly understood how Lloyd felt. The landscape was exciting and unusual. Far away on the horizon, a series of steep yellow mountains shone brightly in the sunlight, looking markedly different than anything on Earth. I shook with anticipation, wondering what we might discover out there. Lloyd hopped off his boulder and nuzzled against me, clearly thinking the same thing. I looked at my sensor tablet. It indicated that the planet was full of life – creatures and plants that no Earthling had ever met. Perhaps it’s a shame that we landed in the orange desert, but at least that meant we would not come down on top of some unfortunate space squirrel. Pulling my eyes from the view, I hazarded a glance back at our tall rocket ship. “You locked the doors, right Lloyd?” I hollered to my friend. The tall llama nodded his head inside his bubble-shaped space helmet. I was happy to see that Lloyd’s smile was as wide as mine. He knew what was next. “Good!

Provide 1 paragraph that answers each question.","completion":"What is solar roofing? Solar roofing is a residential solar energy option. Solar roofing is meant to upgrade a standard roof replacement by adding solar shingles as part of the roofing system. This provides the home with solar-powered energy, just like a standard solar panel array. Solar shingles convert sunlight into energy, providing a source of power that is independent of the local power grid. How is this different from solar panels? Although solar roofing provides the home with solar energy, they are not solar panels at all. They are solar shingle that is installed much like a standard asphalt roof. Solar panels are installed onto the roof using a rack mount. Solar shingles are installed directly to the decking of the roof, and they are part of a comprehensive roof replacement that includes both solar shingles and standard asphalt shingles. What are the benefits of solar roofing? Solar roofing provides renewable residential solar energy. This protects against rising energy costs because there is no cost associated with the energy produced by solar roofing. Solar roofing also provides a sleek appearance that many prefer over bulky solar panels, and the installation process is faster. Additionally, some homeowners experience damage to their roofs from solar panels, and this damage is not covered by the roof warranty. With solar roofing, you have a product that is certified as a solar panel and as a roofing shingle, so both are covered by a warranty if damage were to occur."},{"prompt":"I'd like to plan a hiking trip but I'm not sure where to start.

She made up her mind some time ago that although she did not know which kind of plane she wanted to fly, she would still be determined to become a pilot. The school bus honked two times before Dina and her brother Lin rushed out of their house leaving a steady stream of snail snot behind them.

Hieroglyphics uses pictures, but it isn’t picture writing. Because the symbols used in hieroglyphic writing look like little pictures of people, animals and objects, it’s easy to assume that the hieroglyphs represent those things. Instead, some hieroglyphs signify sounds in the ancient Egyptian language, just as the characters in the Roman alphabet do. Others are ideographic signs, which represent concepts but don’t have a sound attached. 2. Hieroglyphic writing is linked to elite tombs. \\"The earliest hieroglyphic writing is commonly found on grave goods found in royal tombs at Abydos that precede the historical period,\\" explains Peter F. Dorman, a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute. \\"Since hieroglyphs are pictorial, the link with early formal art is indelible, especially the representation of the king with his royal titulary, which can be seen on commemorative monuments placed in the earliest temples.\\" Though the system was eventually used for other types of writing, hieroglyphs never lost their initial connection with elite contexts in commemorative settings like temples and tombs, Dorman explains. People who weren't royals also sometimes used hieroglyphics in their private tombs and monuments, provided they were wealthy enough to afford the services of stone carvers. 3. Ancient Egyptians used other forms of writing. Because hieroglyphic writing was so complicated, the ancient Egyptians developed other types of writing that were more convenient. Hieratic writing, a cursive script that was written on papyrus with a pen or brush, or upon a piece of limestone called an ostracon was invented for use primarily on papyrus, a more fragile material. But, Dornan says, it rarely made the jump to formal monuments. Demotic, another form of writing that was developed in the 800s B.C., was used for everyday documents, as well as for literary works. 4. Hieroglyphic writing has odd quirks. Hieroglyphic writing doesn't have any spaces between the words, and there's no punctuation. That means that readers have to have a good grasp of ancient Egyptian grammar and know something about the context of a message in order to be able to tell individual words, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and chapters apart. Additionally, unlike modern English, hieroglyphics aren’t necessarily read horizontally from left to right. Hieroglyphics could be written either from left to right, or right to left, and vertically as well as horizontally.","completion":"Despite having a pictorial appearance, hieroglyphics were utilized to represent sounds and concepts in elite contexts like tombs and temples. As more practical writing methods emerged, such as hieratic and demotic, hieroglyphics began to disappear. They were challenging to read due to lacking spaces and punctuation, and they required an understanding of ancient Egyptian grammar. Hieroglyphics could be written in various directions, including horizontally, vertically, left-to-right, and right-to-left."},{"prompt":"Create an acrostic email for the word- bills.","completion":"Budgeting is not always easy I do not know where all the money will come from Lists of the bills- payment plans too Living to pay bills and hopefully get ahead So many saying to work more- shouldn’t 40 hours be enough?"},{"prompt":"Is the following statement hateful?

Dead people can never tell us about the horrors of war, but we can often infer its horror through written accounts, word-of-mouth, and sometimes even journalism. Journalism is an interesting field that can also be very dangerous depending on the assignment. Sometimes, journalists need to document reality in areas such as natural disaster zones and even war zones. War zones are scary places to find yourself in, with all the bombings and shooting going on around you. If you ever find yourself in a war zone, find shelter and barricade yourself to protect yourself from getting hurt. Getting hurt can be terrible, and it can also happen when you least expect it. For instance, one time I got hurt by simply getting out of bed one morning without stretching beforehand. I ended up pulling my hamstring and having to stay in bed for a couple of days after it occurred. This reminds me, stretching is very important for your body. If you don't stretch before doing exercise or just move your body, you can hurt yourself pretty badly. That's why I always make sure to do a full-body stretch first thing in the morning. I also stretch frequently throughout the day so I can stay limber. Limber...limber...lumber...lumber is made from trees. Usually, trees that are fully grown and straight will be chosen from a copse of trees and cut down to make lumber for houses and other projects requiring wood planks. Planks are a great exercise for your core muscles. To do planks, you get into a push-up position. However, instead of doing a pushup, you remain at the full lean-and-rest position with your body straight and resisting the urge to sag at the waist. This will ensure you are engaging the core muscles and working them sufficiently. I like to do about a minute per plank."},{"prompt":"I want you to summarize this paragraph in just 2 sentences for me.

However, there were many other inventors such as Elisha Gray and Antonio Meucci who also developed a talking telegraph. The telephone’s basic concept is simple: It transmits sound from one point to another. The microphone, which transforms our voice into an electrical signal, is its core technology. This electrical signal is then transmitted via a network of wires and cables to the telephone receiver, which converts the signal back into sound waves.\\"","completion":"Once upon a time, a very clever man named Alexander Graham Bell made something we now know as the telephone.

As water runs down through the earth, it picks up silica from sandstone, and carries this silica-rich solution into cracks and voids , caused by natural faults or decomposing fossils. As the water evaporates, it leaves behind a silica deposit. This cycle repeats over very long periods of time, and eventually opal is formed. Visualise the inside of an opal, like a bag of marbles. The marbles are the silica spheres. Smaller spheres are more commonly forming, and tend to defract the purple/ blue/ green colours. Larger spheres are rarer forming, and tend to show off the yellow/ orange/ pink and red colours. Hence why these are the rarer colours to find in Australian Opal.","completion":"Opal is a special gemstone that is formed in a unique way. Imagine that opal is like a bag of marbles inside the Earth. These marbles are made of a shiny material called silica. Silica is a special kind of sand. When it rains, the water soaks into the ground and collects some of the silica from the sand. Then, the water travels through tiny cracks and holes in the Earth's rocks. These cracks can be made by things like fossils or natural breaks in the rocks. As the water with the silica inside it moves through these cracks, something magical happens. The water starts to evaporate, which means it turns into a gas and disappears. But when the water goes away, it leaves behind the silica it carried. Over a very long time, these silica deposits build up and form beautiful opal. The size of the silica spheres inside the opal is what gives it its colors. Smaller spheres make colors like purple, blue, and green. These colors are more common in opal. But larger spheres are rarer and make colors like yellow, orange, pink, and red. That's why you don't see those colors as often in opal."},{"prompt":"Can you write a story about a girl who sings karaoke and realizes she is destined to be a star?

At its basic and most primitive form, politics was the art of managing the affairs of the community. As populations grew and become increasingly complex and diverse, they also began to interact more often with each other. This was a catalyst for exponential growth in the field of political science, giving rise to things like foreign policy, diplomacy, and especially warfare. The emergence of new empires and nations created new political systems, such as republics, monarchies, and democracies. Of course, in each political arena, there were many ideas as to what was best for everyone, which also led to new ideologies, including conservatism, socialism, and fascism.

What this means is that Jeet Kune Do (which means \\"Way of the Intercepting Fist\\") is a martial art that takes from other martial arts that which is useful and discards that which is useless. It employs any means to win a fight in the context of hand-to-hand combat - kicking, punching, grappling, biting, eye gouging, and so on. It is what today's martial artists would call \\"mixed martial arts,\\" or MMA for short. But it is not necessarily a martial art as we know it. Most, if not all, martial arts are crystallizations made up of sets and forms that prohibit and restrict their practitioners and make them contort their bodies into unusual positions like the \\"horse stance\\" or \\"cat stance.\\" Real fighting entails using your body to its fullest potential; locking it up in forms and stances only restricts the body from realizing its full potential. For instance, while you're getting into your horse stance, your opponent might kick you in your exposed groin. Jeet Kune Do is about being fluid, stopping or intercepting an attack with your weapons (fist, foot, etc.), and ending the fight as quickly as possible. Being fluid means becoming like water; it is yielding, and yet it is powerful enough to move large objects and crash with ferocity. It is also a mindset: instead of anticipating an opponent's attack, you simply \\"react\\" to it using your weapons and the skills you developed through practice and training. Intercepting means stopping an attack with a counterattack as it is being initiated. One of the most relevant examples of this concept in Jeet Kune Do is the use of the \\"stop kick.\\" The stop kick is used against an opponent when the opponent is lunging forward toward you in an attack; the side thrust or front thrust kick can literally stop the opponent in their tracks and prevent them from advancing further while also striking them in turn. Training up to this concept looks something like this: 1) learning to block; 2) learning to strike; 3) learning to block then strike; 4) learning to block and strike at the same time; 5) learning to strike without blocking by moving off the line of attack and moving into the opponent where they are open or exposed."},{"prompt":"List the steps of developing keywords with brief descriptions for each step.","completion":"Sure!

The plane was leaving in four hours, so she gave herself enough to get comfortable and check in once she got there. Suddenly, the train stopped and she was flung forward a bit. Over the speakers was an announcement. \\"Sorry for the inconvenience, ladies and gentlemen. We seem to run into a bit of a problem with the train engine, and it will take about an hour to fix. We apologize for any trouble incurred by this, and we will try to fix this as fast as possible.\\" Aqua was angry. Did they think to look at the train engine before starting for the day? There was nothing she could do, so she sat back down in her seat and looked outside. It was unnaturally foggy; you couldn't see anything outside. Aqua was getting a little curious. She stood up and paced back and forward in the train car that no one but her was in. Curiosity turned into fear as suddenly, the train doors slid open without a warning. Aqua heard the train doors slide open without an announcement. She started to get scared. \\"What is happening? she thought. She walked over to the door and looked outside. The fog was so deep that a flashlight couldn't penetrate it. What was once fear turned back into curiosity as Aqua tried to walk outside. It felt like there was no ground to stand on, but the fog was firm enough for Aqua to stand on. She kept walking and walking, making sure to stay close to the train. The fear was settling in, she didn't know where she was and there was no one in the train cars next to her as well. She tried to go back to her train car but there was this sudden, mesmerizing light in her path. The next thing Aqua knew, she saw space in front of her and below her, the town that she left.

It would simplify the building process and ensure structural stability. However, the Store Street Aquaduct had to be built on a 45-degree skew. The builders pleaded with the city planners. They needed a workaround to avoid the skew, but the bureaucrats wouldn't say yes. William Jessop had been an engineer for Benjamin Outram, the lead architect for the project. Jessop suddenly remembered that his old boss, William Chapman, had already laid the roadwork they needed to travel on. Back in 1787, Chapman had a problem to deal with when he was building bridges for the Kildare Canal. When looking at the blueprints on a grid, Chapman suddenly realized he could use create a falsework parallel to the arches that would sustain the structure even with the odd skew. His work turned out successful, but Jessop and Outram had to perfect his plan if they wanted to successfully build the Store Street Aquaduct. Using the timber falsework method, the two builders marked out the position of the courses at the crown and the courses across the remainder of the arch. With that, thanks to Chapman's keen insight and Jessop's quick thinking, Outram completed the Store Street Aquaduct which still exists today."},{"prompt":"I made a lot of money in this recent market crash.","completion":"Congrats!

Plank The plank is the most renowned exercise that targets your entire core. A plank is an exceptional way to strengthen your abs and your obliques and work your deep muscle to increase your overall stability and power. To perform a plank, start in a pushup position, then move down to rest your weight on your forearms with your hands touching so that your arms can form a V shape. From this position, maintain your straight posture and avoid your stomach sagging. Hold the position for as long as you can. It won't be long before you feel the burn. 2. Side plank Pay particular attention to your obliques by performing a side plank as an alternative to a normal plank. Start by getting into a standard plank position. Next, rotate your body so that one side of your body faces the sky. Squeeze your core with one leg straight out and your body stiff in a straight line. Squeeze your core and hold the pose for as long as possible before switching sides. Make sure to try equal lengths on both sides so that you don't get muscle imbalances. 3. Reverse Crunches Crunches are a great exercise for your core, but this variation adds a slight degree of difficulty if you are finding standard crunches too easy. This exercise works the lower abs, in particular. Start in a standard crunch position, lying down with your knees bent. Keep your hands flat on the ground next to your hips. To perform the exercise, lift your pelvis and knees towards your face. Return to the starting position and repeat as many times as you can. 4. Flutter kicks Sometimes the lower abs can get less attention, but flutter kicks can help to address that. This exercise makes sure you strengthen a common area of weakness. Lay flat on the ground with your arms flat and legs stretched out. From here, lift your feet about 6 inches off the ground and hold them there. Once you have done this, start lifting right and left. Lift each leg about a few inches each time. Ensure to maintain good posture and bring each leg to rest before moving to the next. 5. Arms high sit-ups Everyone knows sit-ups, and those who work their abs a lot may be easy by now. This exercise gives your abs a killer workout that they won't forget. It is as easy as starting in a sit-up position. From here, raise your hands straight up to the sky, flatten your hands, and reach for the sky. Now perform a sit-up as you normally would. This is going to be a lot harder than a standard sit-up so make sure your form is correct to achieve maximum results."},{"prompt":"Could I get an acrostic poem about everyone's favorite dessert, chocolate?!","completion":"Cocoa in a hot mug is great for a long, cold day, Hiding in the cupboard is a chocolate bar screaming your name, Of course, there’s white chocolate for those who don’t like dark, Chocolate comes in all shapes and flavors for everyone to enjoy, Only the best desserts have the decadent delight, Late at night, sneak a bite, Add hazelnut or vanilla on top, The best taste on the planet, Everyone can enjoy!"},{"prompt":"Where do apples grow?","completion":"Apples grow on trees."},{"prompt":"Can you buy a house with Cryptocurrency?","completion":"Some companies allow that."},{"prompt":"How many teeth does an adult have?","completion":"Humans have 32 teeth."},{"prompt":"Write a simple blessing for a child that can be cross-stitched as a gift for the child's parents to welcome a new baby.

Miss Clark said those were \\"germs.\\" Their real names were \\"bacteria.\\" They were tiny things that were alive that were so small you couldn't see them without a microscope. She said that's what made Ginella's eye hurt. The medicine was to stop the bacteria from making more bacteria. Without the bacteria, her eyes would get better. That night, when she went home, the first thing she did was wash her hands. Her mom said she could sing while she did it so that she knew how long to wash her hands.

When Jerry leaves an upscale clothing store without making a purchase, he feels guilty and claims he will return with a friend to get their opinion of a jacket he doesn't like. The sales clerk Craig Stewart, who sports a long ponytail, looks skeptical. Jerry returns with Elaine just to prove Craig wrong. Craig flirts with Elaine in front of Jerry, making him feel emasculated. Moreover, Elaine strongly endorses the jacket, thereby pressuring Jerry into buying it. Craig promises Elaine a discount on a Nicole Miller dress, but claims it sold out immediately after and is being restocked. George and Kramer begin parking at a discount parking lot. After picking up his car George discovers a condom inside and suspects prostitutes are servicing their clients inside the cars. The lot loses Kramer's keys, forcing him to use another customer's Mary Kay pink Cadillac Eldorado and sleep in Jerry's apartment. George questions the prostitutes hanging around. He offers one of them money for information, but is caught by Susan. Susan has no trouble believing him when he explains, to his frustration since he was hoping she might call off their wedding due to his seeming infidelity. The lot refuses to refund George's money, denying the prostitution allegations, and says George cannot reclaim his car for several days because it is parked in the back. George and Susan have a houseguest, Susan's friend Ethan, who is the \\"Wig Master\\" for a production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Ethan's co-worker, the show's costume designer, lends Kramer the technicolor dreamcoat. Wearing the coat, a woman's large hat blown off by the wind, and a silver-handled walking stick Elaine gave him after writing about it for the Peterman catalogue, Kramer goes to pick up the Cadillac. He finds a prostitute servicing a client in the car. When he ejects them, she starts attacking him over the fee he has cost her. Police arrive and assume Kramer to be a pimp due to his attire and fight with a prostitute, and arrest him. Fuming about Craig's slight toward him, Jerry unsuccessfully attempts to return his jacket in order to deny Craig the sales commission. When Jerry is lunching with Ethan, a friend of Ethan's stops by and sets up a get-together with him; Jerry demands to know why he assumed he and Ethan were not together. Jerry suspects Craig is just promising the discount on the dress in order to keep seeing Elaine. She doesn't believe it, especially when Craig promises the same discount to a male friend. When Elaine is over at Craig's apartment, his manager calls; she confirms from him that the dress has been in stock all along. In revenge, Elaine cuts off Craig's ponytail to sell for wig hair.","completion":"• Jerry leaves a store without buying anything, he says he'll come back with a friend • The store clerk does not believe him • Jerry comes back with Elaine to prove the sale clerk wrong • The sales clerk flirts with Elaine causing Jerry to feel emasculated • Elaine likes the jacket so Jerry buys it • The salesman promises Elaine a discount • George and Kramer park at a discount lot • George discovers a condom in his car and suspects prostitutes have been using it • George tries to get info from prostitutes • The lot loses Kramer's keys • Susan's friend, Ethan, visits and gives Kramer a coat from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat • Kramer, dressed in the coat, with a hat and cane tries to get his car and fights with a prostitute • Kramer gets arrested • Jerry tries to return the jacket, but cannot • Jerry is lunching with Ethan when a friend of Ethan's comes by and asks him out which Jerry again feels emasculated by • Jerry suspects the sales clerk is lying to Elaine about the discount • Elaine asks the salesman's manager about a dress the salesman said was out of stock but the manager says it is in stock • Elaine enacts revenge by cutting off the salesman's ponytail"},{"prompt":"Write me part of a song about growth even in the face of difficulties.

Categorize the topic of the article. Category options: Comedy, Politics, Science, Health State legislatures are wrestling with how much to restrict or expand abortion access after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. Here is a snapshot of pending and passed legislation seeking to restrict or protect access in 2023, including details on a law that took effect in North Dakota this week broadly banning abortion and the defeat of abortion ban bills in South Carolina and Nebraska. RESTRICTIONS FLORIDA: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban this month, which includes exceptions for rape, incest, human trafficking and the life and health of the mother. It cannot take effect until the state Supreme Court rules on the constitutionality of the 15-week ban that is currently in place. IDAHO: Idaho Governor Brad Little signed a bill this month that makes it illegal to help a minor cross state lines to get an abortion without the permission of a parent or guardian. Offenders would face two to five years in prison. The Republican-led state is currently enforcing a near-total abortion ban, with exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother. MONTANA: The Republican-led legislature has passed a bill seeking to overturn a 1999 state Supreme Court ruling that found that the state constitution protected a right to abortion. That ruling has prevented lawmakers in the conservative state from restricting abortion further than the current 24-week limit. The bill awaits Republican Governor Greg Gianforte's signature. The full legislature has also passed a bill that would ban most second trimester abortions by prohibiting a common surgical procedure. If signed by the governor, it would take effect immediately. Planned Parenthood has sued to block the measure. NEBRASKA: Lawmakers in Nebraska's 50-seat unicameral legislature failed to pass a six-week abortion ban on Thursday, after the chamber did not amass enough votes to end debate on the bill. Much of the debate centered on one member's proposed amendment to allow abortions up to 12 weeks. Abortion is currently legal in the state up to 22 weeks. NORTH CAROLINA: House Republicans have introduced a bill to ban abortion from conception, except to preserve the life or health of the mother. Abortion is currently legal up to 20 weeks. If it passes the legislature, the bill would likely be vetoed by the Democratic governor and would need Democratic lawmakers' backing to override the veto. NORTH DAKOTA: North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum on Monday signed a bill that bans abortion with exceptions for cases where the mother's life or health are at serious risk. The law, which took immediate effect, also makes exceptions for rape and incest victims, but only during the first six weeks of pregnancy. The measure passed despite the state Supreme Court's decision last month not to revive a previous version of the near-total ban, after finding that the state constitution protects abortion rights in some cases. SOUTH CAROLINA: The Republican-led House of Representatives is considering a six-week abortion ban that the Senate has passed, despite the fact that the state Supreme Court recently struck down a six-week abortion ban in a 3-2 vote. The Senate tabled discussion of a near-total abortion ban on Thursday after it had been approved by the House. The chamber voted to delay considering the bill until the next legislative session in January 2024, after a two-day filibuster by the five women senators who felt it was too severe. TEXAS: While abortion is completely banned with very limited exceptions in Texas, Republican state representatives have introduced legislation that would compel internet providers to block websites that supply abortion pills or provide information on how to obtain an abortion. UTAH: Republican Governor Spencer Cox in March signed legislation to prohibit the licensing of abortion clinics, which abortion rights advocates say would effectively eliminate access in the state. Abortion is currently banned after 18 weeks in Utah. WYOMING: The Republican-led state legislature passed a bill in March banning the use or prescription of medication abortion pills, and Republican Governor Mark Gordon signed it into law. It is due to take effect July 1. Abortion is currently legal until viability, about 24 weeks, while a state court is reviewing a challenge to a near-total \\"trigger\\" ban, which was took effect when Roe v. Wade was overturned. PROTECTIONS CALIFORNIA: A Democratic state senator has introduced a bill to protect doctors who prescribe medication abortion pills to patients in other states. MICHIGAN: Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation this month repealing a 1931 bill that criminalized abortion. ILLINOIS: Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker in January signed a law protecting abortion providers and out-of-state patients from legal attacks waged by other states. MINNESOTA: Democratic Governor Tim Walz in January signed legislation passed by the Minnesota legislature's new Democratic majority that codifies abortion rights in state law, as well as a right to contraception and fertility treatment. The Democratic-led House passed a bill to shield abortion providers and patients from other states' legal attacks, and the Senate is considering it. OHIO: Abortion rights supporters are trying to collect enough signatures to put a constitutional amendment on the November 2023 ballot that would assert a right to abortion. Abortion is currently legal up to 22 weeks.","completion":"The topic of the article is politics."},{"prompt":"Change the characters to girls. Change Horse to Philippa and Max to Rachie So Saturday morning we met at the High School subway station. I got there first. Stuffed in my dad’s army surplus knapsack was a blanket, a pillow, a paper bag with three white-bread peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches – that is, lunch, supper, and Sunday breakfast. My pockets were full of stick matches. I had an old flashlight, and since I lived by the Scout’s motto – Be Prepared – I had brought along an umbrella. Finally, being a serious reader, I had the latest Marvel Family comics. Horse arrived next, his arms barely managing to hold on to a mattress that seemed twice his size. As for food, he had four cans of beans jammed into his pockets. Max came last. He was lugging a new knapsack that contained a cast-iron frying pan, a packet of hot dogs, and a box of saltine crackers – plus two bottles. One bottle was mustard, the other, celery soda. He also had a bag of Tootsie Rolls and a shiny hatchet. “To build a lean-to,” he explained. Max’s prize possession however was an official Scout compass. “It’s really swell,” he told us, “You can’t ever get lost with it. Got it at the Scout store.” “I hate that place,” Horse informed us. “It’s all new. Nothing real.” “This compass is real,” Max retorted. “Points north all the time. You can get cheaper ones, but they all point all different directions.” “What’s so great about the north?” Horse said. “That’s always the way to go,” Max insisted. “Says who?” I demanded. “Mr. Brenkman, dummy.” Horse cried. “Anyway, there’s always an arrow on maps pointing the way north.” “Cowboys live out west,” I reminded them. They didn’t care. On the subway platform, we realized we did not know which station we were heading for. To find out, we studied the system map, which looked like a noodle factory hit by a bomb. The place we wanted to go (north) was at the top of the map, so I had to hoist Horse onto my shoulders for a closer look. Since he refused to let go of his mattress – or the tin cans in his pockets – it wasn’t easy. I asked him- in a kindly fashion – to put the mattress down. No sooner did he find the station – 168th Street – than our train arrived. We rushed on, only to have Horse scream, “My mattress!” He had left it on the platform. Just before the doors shut, he and I leaped off. Max, however, remained on the train. Helplessly, we watched as his horror-stricken face slid away from us. “Wait at the next station!” I bellowed. “Don’t move!” The next train took forever to come. Then it took even longer to get to the next stop. There was Max. All around him – like fake snow in a glass ball – were crumbs. He’d been so nervous he had eaten all his crackers. “Didn’t that make you thirsty?” “I drank my soda.” I noticed streaks down his cheeks. Horse noticed them too. “You been crying?” he asked. Naw,” Max said. “There was this water dripping from the tunnel roof. But, you said don’t move, right? Well, I was just being obedient.” By the time we got on the next train – with all our possessions – we had been traveling for an hour. But we had managed to go only one stop. During the ride, I got hungry. I pulled out one of my sandwiches. With the jelly soaked through the bread, it looked like a limp scab. Horse, envious, complained he was getting hungry. “Eat some of your canned beans,” I suggested. He got out one can without ripping his pocket too badly. Then his face took on a mournful look. What’s the matter?” I asked. Forgot to bring a can opener.” Max said, “In the old days, people opened cans with their teeth.” “You saying I don’t know history?” Always kind, I plopped half my sandwich into Horse’s hand. He squashed it into his mouth and was quiet for the next fifteen minutes. It proved something I’d always believed: The best way to stop arguments is to get people to eat peanut butter sandwiches. They can’t talk. Then we became so absorbed in our Marvel Family comics we missed our station. We got to it only by coming back the other way. When we reached street level, the sky was dark.","completion":"So on Saturday morning, we all gathered at the High School subway station. Being the early bird, I arrived first. In my dad's army surplus knapsack, I had packed a cozy blanket, a soft pillow, and a paper bag filled with three delicious white-bread peanut butter and jelly sandwiches—a perfect combination for lunch, supper, and Sunday breakfast. My pockets were filled with stick matches, and of course, I carried an old flashlight. Being a firm believer in the Scout's motto, \\"Be Prepared,\\" I had even brought along an umbrella. And being an avid reader, I made sure to bring the latest edition of the Marvel Family comics. Philippa arrived next, struggling to maintain her grip on a mattress that seemed twice her size. As for food, she had ingeniously managed to cram four cans of beans into her pockets. Rachie came last, carrying a brand-new knapsack that contained a sturdy cast-iron frying pan, a packet of hot dogs, a box of saltine crackers, and two bottles—one filled with mustard and the other with celery soda. She also proudly displayed a bag of Tootsie Rolls and a shiny hatchet, explaining that it would come in handy for building a lean-to. However, her most prized possession was an official Scout compass. Excitedly, she shared, \\"This compass is absolutely amazing. It never fails to point north, no matter what. I got it at the Scout store.\\" \\"I despise that place,\\" Philippa grumbled. \\"It's all new, nothing authentic.\\" \\"But this compass is real,\\" Rachie insisted. \\"It always points north. Sure, you can find cheaper ones, but they tend to point in all different directions.\\" \\"What's so great about the north?\\" Philippa questioned. \\"That's always the way to go,\\" Rachie declared. \\"Says who?\\" I challenged. \\"Mr. Brenkman, you silly. Besides, there's always an arrow on maps pointing the way north.\\" \\"But cowgirls live out west,\\" I reminded them, although they seemed unfazed by my remark. On the subway platform, we suddenly realized that we didn't know which station we were supposed to head to. To figure it out, we studied the system map, which resembled a tangled mess of noodles. The desired destination (north) was at the top of the map, so I hoisted Philippa onto my shoulders for a closer look. It wasn't easy since she stubbornly clung to her mattress and the tin cans in her pockets. In the kindest way possible, I asked her to set the mattress down. Just as she located the station—168th Street—our train arrived. We hurriedly boarded, but to our horror, Philippa screamed, \\"My mattress!\\" She had left it behind on the platform. With split-second timing, she and I leaped off just before the doors closed. Unfortunately, Rachie remained on the train, and we helplessly watched her panic-stricken face vanish into the distance. \\"Wait at the next station!\\" I shouted. \\"Don't move!\\" The next train seemed to take an eternity to arrive. And once it finally did, it took even longer to reach the next stop. There was Rachie, surrounded by crumbs that resembled fake snow in a glass ball. She had been so nervous that she ate all her crackers. \\"Didn't that make you thirsty?\\" I asked. \\"I drank my soda,\\" Rachie replied. I noticed streaks on her cheeks, and Philippa observed them too. \\"Have you been crying?\\" Philippa inquired. \\"Nah,\\" Rachie responded. \\"There was water dripping from the tunnel roof. But you said not to move, right? Well, I was just being obedient.\\" By the time we boarded the next train, lugging all our belongings, we had been traveling for an hour, yet we had only managed to cover one stop. As we rode, my stomach growled, signaling hunger. I reached into my bag and pulled out one of my sandwiches. The jelly had soaked through the bread, giving it a rather unappetizing appearance, resembling a limp scab. Philippa, feeling envious, complained that she was also getting hungry. \\"Why don't you eat some of your canned beans?\\" I suggested. She fumbled and managed to retrieve one can without tearing her pocket too badly. However, a mournful expression appeared on her face. \\"What's the matter?\\" I asked curiously. \\"I forgot to bring a can opener,\\" Philippa admitted, disappointment evident in her voice. Rachie chimed in, \\"You know, in the old days, people used to open cans with their teeth.\\" \\"Are you suggesting that I don't know history?\\" Philippa retorted defensively. Always one to be kind, I handed Philippa half of my sandwich. She gratefully accepted it and squished it into her mouth, silencing her hunger for the next fifteen minutes. It proved something I had always believed: the best way to quell arguments is to offer people peanut butter sandwiches. They simply can't argue with their mouths full. Lost in the captivating world of the Marvel Family comics, we became so engrossed that we missed our intended station. We had to backtrack and take the train in the opposite direction to finally reach our destination. When we emerged onto the street level, the sky had turned dark, casting an eerie atmosphere around us."},{"prompt":"My wife and I are looking for a movie to watch tonight with our two young children.

I want to do it with the help of mental challenges. But don’t suggest anything that involves using any brain training apps or games.","completion":"Here are some intensive and fun mental workouts to exercise your brain without using apps and games: 1. Expand Your Lexical Resources: A promising way to give your brain a workout is to learn new words. Reading books, articles, or even browsing online can expose you to new vocabulary that you can integrate into your everyday speech. 2. Dancing: Dancing is a fun way to exercise your body and your brain. By memorizing dance steps and coordinating movements, you challenge your brain's ability to learn and recall new motor skills. 3. Play Mind Games with a Friend: Engage in thought-provoking discussions or engage in debates with a friend to build your critical thinking skills. Listening to another person's perspective challenges your mind to analyze new information and think from different viewpoints. 4. Unleash Your Linguistic Prowess: Learning a new language broadens your cultural horizons and challenges your brain to absorb and recall unfamiliar words and grammar rules. You can learn from a tutor or self-study. 5. Flow with Tai Chi: Tai Chi is the perfect activity for you if you want to give your brain an excellent workout while also promoting relaxation. This ancient Chinese practice involves precise and deliberate movements that improve balance, coordination, and mindfulness by engaging your brain and body simultaneously. It's also a low-impact activity that's accessible to people of all ages and fitness levels. 6. Teach with Passion: Have you ever thought of becoming a teacher? While you don't have to become a professional educator, teaching someone else a new skill gives your brain a good workout. It requires you to understand the material, and it necessitates patience, creativity, and communication skills, all of which are beneficial to your cognitive abilities. 3. Sense it All: Did you know that using all of your senses regularly can help keep your brain sharp?

Margaret Cavendish may have published the very first science fiction novel in 1666, The Blazing World. It features animal-human hybrids, an empress of a parallel planet, and time and space travel, at a time when such speculation was still considered heretical. Inspiration for sci-fi writers often stemmed from their fascination with science and space exploration. Incredibly, some authors were spot-on forecasted technologies way before their time, particularly Jules Verne. He offered space travel, tunneling through the earth's core, and deep sea exploration. Sci-fi provides a welcome form of escapism, too. During World War I, the Tom Swift series described wartime technologies that were desperately needed in real-life (aerial warships, surveillance cameras, and tanks that could cross trenches). These stories appealed to readers' optimism in the midst of loss. Dystopian Fiction has regained popularity during these times of uncertainty in political, technological, global economic, and human rights infringements. The Handmaid's Tale and 1984 are prime examples due to recent changes in governmental leadership and debates about global immigration policies. As long as people dare to dream about the future, science fiction will remain popular.","completion":"1. Aerial Warships 2. Surveillance cameras 3. Tanks that could cross trenches"},{"prompt":"Classify this review as either positive or negative and explain your response: Last year, I committed to reading one memoir every month and have since enjoyed some fascinating, real-life stories, some of the celebrity kind, but mostly about ordinary people and their extraordinary experiences. This account by Michelle Zauner disappointingly falls into neither category. In terms of “memoir,” it mostly revolves around the death of her mother from colon cancer, with some references to the challenges of being biracial and connecting with her Korean roots. By far the greatest part of the book, however, is taken up by descriptions of Korean food: buying the ingredients, preparing and cooking them, and then eating the final dishes. Whole pages devoted to gushing prose about this or that culinary experience. Okay, so food was the thing that connected Zauner to her mother. But, I got that message within the first two chapters. I didn’t need it rammed down my throat ad nauseum. About half way through, I started skipping the “foodie” pages completely. Zauner can write; there’s no doubt about that. The chapters describing her mother’s slow decline and death are visceral and poignant. But, the book as a whole feels terribly self-indulgent. There is nothing in it that is particularly remarkable; no profound insights or lessons. My feeling is that Zauner wrote this “memoir” as a form of personal catharsis. And if she achieved this, then I’m happy for her. For me, though, the hype is totally overblown. Except, perhaps, if you’re keen to know how to cook authentic Korean food. Thanks for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful. You can find more candid book reviews on my Amazon profile page.","completion":"This is a negative review. The reviewer is disappointed with Michelle Zauner's memoir, finding it lacking in fascinating stories and celebrity experiences.

Please give me basic descriptions of each style and make the suggestions appropriate for someone who doesn't know much about makeup.","completion":"It's cool that you're getting into makeup! Here's a list of some different makeup styles. 1. Matte - Matte Makeup is easy to do, and it works well in humidity or oily skin. What makes this makeup style stand out is that it doesn't use products with gloss. Everything used in this style is Matte and lasts a long time. 2. Dewy Glow - The Dewy Glow makeup style has a fresh appearance that isn't greasy. It's sort of an in-betweener, going between no makeup and a full face. Dewy Glow makeup is a little flushed, so it helps to use shimmery blush on your cheeks, and lip gloss will help make your lips look juicy. 3. Airbrush - The airbrush makeup style doesn't use regular sponges or brushes. It uses an airbrush. Airbrush makeup looks high-definition, and it can provide variety in textures, shades, and finishes. You can use airbrush makeup in a sheer or heavy way, and it lasts up to 16 hours. Therefore, it's great if you need your makeup to stay for a long time. 4. Monochromatic - Monochromatic makeup is what it sounds like, it uses one tone. You can use the same palette to cover your lips, eyes, and cheeks. This makeup style is nice because it doesn't take much effort but looks balanced. 5. Alternative - Alternative makeup is creative and challenges societal standards of beauty. Alternative makeup uses lots of deep and bold colors, and it's meant to stand out. Alternative makeup can be done with falsies, heavy eyeliners, and vivid lip colors."},{"prompt":"Write an apology letter to my mom as if you are Elmo.

It came with instructions to plant in an area with full sun and acidic soil with plenty of drainage. I'm not really sure how to describe it, the only way I can think of it is as a sort of aggressive lily or slightly flaccid amaryllis. I have found a nice spot in the garden, and initially, it seemed to be doing well, however, after just a short time, it has started to wilt. Could you please help? Yours with hope, Wilted Wendy Dear Wendy, From the description offered by the seller, this may well be a variety of the well-reported 'Audry 2' exotic plant species. These are fascinating plants that, if kept in check, can be a delightful and colorful addition to any sun-soaked border. The merchant was right to point you toward well-draining soil, as they do not like having damp feet. They require a lot of nutrients to keep going, though, so make sure you offer it plenty of plant food, at least weekly, when watering around the roots. Occasionally it will want animal products delivered through what looks like its mouth at the top of the plant, and you can either prick a finger to provide some blood or, if you prefer, catch small animals and insects to feed it. Be very careful, as this is an invasive species that can spread uncontrollably if allowed to.

While some clouds are drab and homogeneous, others are fluffy like cotton. Some clouds are located close to the surface, while others are near the troposphere. By considering the elevation of the cloud's base relative to the Earth's surface, most clouds can be categorized into three classes (high, middle, and low). The classification of other clouds is based on their distinctive qualities rather than their height, such as whether they originate above mountains (lenticular clouds) or beneath other clouds (Mammatus clouds). Cloud Types: High Clouds (5 - 13 km or 16,000 - 43,000 ft): •Cirrus clouds •Cirrocumulus clouds •Cirrostratus clouds Middle Clouds (2 - 7 km or 7,000 - 23,000 ft): •Altocumulus clouds •Altostratus clouds Low Clouds (surface - 2 km or surface - 7,000 ft): •Stratus clouds •Stratocumulus clouds •Nimbostratus clouds Clouds with Vertical Growth (surface - 13 km or surface - 43,000 ft): •Cumulus clouds •Cumulonimbus clouds Unusual Clouds (not grouped by height): •Lenticular clouds •Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds •Mammatus clouds"},{"prompt":"I am trying to teach my kids that while being beautiful and handsome is great, there is more to strive to be in life.

Please rewrite these sentences into something that is easy to understand. Restate the medical terms into everyday words. The Rabies virus, like the vast majority of other pathological microorganisms, attempts to perpetuate itself with general and reservoir host-specific mechanisms, which ultimately confer a considerable epidemiological plasticity. The pace and phenotype of rabies infection are mostly written in the virus genome, whilst transmission is strongly favoured by aggressive behaviours (i.e., a biting inclination) of rabid hosts (37). Despite incidence and mortality of rabies disease have both markedly declined during the past three decades (Fig. 1), and irrespective of whether the genetic code of Rabies virus can be naturally (i.e., by ecological opportunities and viral adaptation) or artificially (i.e., by genetic engineering) modified, we need to think “out-of-the-box”, in that the generation of a “Zombie virus” cannot be firmly excluded according to the currently available biological evidence (38). Wavefront velocity of rabies disease propagation has been calculated in wild animals (e.g., foxes, skunks, raccoons and vampire bats) at around 10-40 km per year (37). However, in densely populated towns, where natural landscape barriers would be minimal, the human-to-human contagion may increase by several orders of magnitude, thus easily assuming apocalyptic proportions and creating a new generation of pseudo-human creatures, who have completely unleashed their already existing part of zombie within (39). In keeping with this conjecture, an interesting simulation of an imaginary Zombie outbreak reveals that most of the US population would turn into Zombies within one week from appearance of the first case, whilst only some remotes zones in Montana and Nevada would remain infestation-free one month afterwards (40).","completion":"The rabies virus, like most deadly viruses, can change the way they act in response to environmental changes. The rabies virus is transmitted by an infected animal biting another animal because that is the way the virus evolved. The number of people bitten by rabid animals and the number of people dying from rabies has dramatically declined over the past 30 years. However, scientists are concerned that the rabies virus could, through natural mutation or genetically engineered mutation, change into a virus that would turn infected people into \\"zombies\\". Wild animals, such as foxes, skunks, raccoons and vampire bats usually transmit rabies in about a ten-mile area. Unfortunately, there are no natural barriers, such as forests or rivers, to keep infected animals from entering our crowded cities. It would be easy for a wild animal carrying the mutated rabies virus to bite a person and kick off a zombie apocalypse. Like any rabid animals, infected people would bite and infect those around them, thus creating a race of zombies. A simulation of such an event projected that it would only take about a week from the first bite before most of the US population became zombies. For people living in remote areas of Nevada or Montana, it would only take a month before the zombies found them and turned them into zombies."},{"prompt":"Write a creative snapshot of a story depicting a summer evening on a farm with a full moon, when everything feels magnetic but changes suddenly, and the protagonist is about to meet someone important but not quite yet.","completion":"She carried the rocking chair out to the side porch and sat down for the evening, facing the open pasture south of her home, and stared down to the strip of woodline. The sun, descending down the meadow of the next hill, thinned the silhouettes of the cedar trunks. Three railed fences crossed the pasture stream and squared to a barn open on the other side. The August moon rose orange and full in the haze of dusk and mimicked a binary sunset. But all she thought of was tomorrow's work. She sipped the stew in her bowl and ate a chunk of potato from the spoon. Though she was hot from the day's chores, a stew was convenient to brew come morning and be ready by dinner, and it softened the gamey rabbit cuts in a bath of salted broth and lard. The hens made their way back up the run and cooed through the screened window. Ludor, a Jersey cow, swatted her tail at flies landing on her backside and watched the sunset from the other side of the fence. Her calf would be here very soon. The woman stood up from her rocker and leaned against the porch post. More firewood would be chopped tomorrow, but at last, she sighed a relieving breath and opened to summer's ambience as the cool mountain air was pulled in.

Can you provide me with some tips for potty training? The more the better, so give me a list of at least 5 but more if possible.","completion":"1. Follow a consistent schedule. Always feed your dog at the same time every day. This helps to develop a routine of when the dog will need to go outside, and you can anticipate when those times will be. 2. Confinement. When you are in the house, the puppy should either be in a crate or immediately next to you. An easy way to accomplish this is to attach their leash directly to you - perhaps hook it on your waist. This means the puppy cannot sneak away and have an accident without you noticing. 3. Crate. If you cannot watch your puppy closely, give them time in a crate that is not too large. Puppies do not like to eliminate where they sleep and should not have an accident in the crate. Keep the duration of this relatively short during the day, and take the puppy outside to relieve themselves immediately upon leaving the crate. 4. Frequency. Initially take your puppy outside often - this means after every time the puppy eats or drinks and every 30 minutes to an hour during the day during the early stages of housebreaking. 5. Relief area. If possible, take your puppy to the exact same area to relieve themselves, and only spend 5 minutes outside. If the puppy does not relieve itself within 5 minutes, go back inside and play for 5 minutes and then go outside and try again. This helps the puppy to learn that outside is for relieving only and inside is for playing. 6. Cue. Choose a word or a command to tell your puppy to go to the bathroom. For example \\"Go Potty\\" or \\"Go Busy.\\" Start by saying the command after the puppy has started relieving itself. In later days, say it before the puppy begins so it can identify what you want it to do. 7. Praise. Always praise your puppy for a job well done. This can be with a treat or just verbal praise, but get excited and let your puppy know how great it is that they are going to the bathroom where you want them to. 8. No yelling. When your puppy inevitably has an accident inside the house, do not yell or scold. The dog will not understand why you are upset, and it won't teach them anything. Simply clean up the mess and vow to watch them more closely the next time."},{"prompt":"What is the measurement of computer mouse speed called?

The study found a link between severe sleep apnea in older adults and greater amounts of a specific biomarker in the brain—one that could increase people’s risk of dementia or stroke. More research will be needed to understand this connection, however. Sleep apnea is a condition in which a person stops breathing during sleep. This causes the brain to wake the person just enough to start breathing, only for the cycle to start again once the person falls back asleep. There are two main forms of sleep apnea, obstructive and central. Obstructive apnea happens when airway muscles physically block a person’s breathing, while central apnea is when the brain forgets to signal the body to breath (a third mixed form has features of both). Though not all snoring is linked to obstructive sleep apnea, it’s a common sign of the condition (snoring in general is caused by a narrow airway while sleeping). The constant interruptions caused by apnea also make it hard for people to get a restful night’s sleep, which can then affect their physical and mental health in varying ways. Sleep apnea, especially when severe, has been linked to a greater risk of many other health problems, including cardiovascular disease. In this new study, published Thursday in the journal Neurology, scientists wanted to get a better understanding of how the condition could possibly affect the brain. They looked at data collected from 140 older adults with obstructive sleep apnea who had participated in an earlier study. These volunteers had undergone an MRI brain scan and were monitored overnight in a sleep lab. They were divided into three groups based on their diagnosed degree of sleep apnea, but all of them were thought to be free of dementia at the start and end of the study period.\\"","completion":"Here are the key points from this article: A study has found that sleep apnea can lead to very serious health problems, specifically in older adults. Firstly, there are three types of sleep apnea - obstructive, central, and a mix of both. Obstructive is when airway muscles block someone's breathing, and central is when the brain doesn't send signals to the body to breathe. The health risks include cardiovascular disease, dementia, or even strokes depending on the severity.

The app is primarily known for its short-form videos and viral dance challenges. Many children and even adults have been hooked on the short style of videos and the entertainment it provides. Although TikTok is used by many people to share their struggles and experiences, it has harmed many people's lives. Attention span has been reduced due to the short format videos, and watching a long video exceeding 2 minutes or reading a paragraph can be difficult for some who lose track of what they are doing. This affects a person's mental health, as it reduces their ability to stay focused for long periods of time, which can create anxiety outside of short format videos such as TikTok. Another problem that is slowly creeping up is that TikTok has contributed to a lot of people's confidence and self-esteem dropping. This is because they are exposed to videos that portray the 'perfect body' or 'perfect life.' Young people see these videos and reflect on themselves, which can hugely decrease their confidence, hence having a massive effect on a young person's view of the world and themselves. In terms of who it would affect most, it would be younger children, as they are the ones who are easily influenced. Seeing thousands of videos in the span of a few hours can have a toll on a young person's mind, which is curious, and views.

Five tenants of the Iowa apartment building that collapsed on Sunday are still unaccounted for, city officials admitted during a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. More than 36 hours after the rear section of a six-storey apartment complex on 324 Main Street collapsed, Davenport Mayor Mike Matson revealed that local police have been unable to locate five residents. “The Davenport Police Department has been working diligently to account for the [residents] of the building ... Five individuals are still unaccounted for, two of those we believe to possibly be still in the building,” Mr Matson said. Mr Matson’s statement comes amid protests by family members outside of the site of the collapse after the city announced plans to begin a demolition process. On Tuesday morning, a crowd gathered in front of the building with signs reading “Corruption Collapses Communities” and chanting “Save Branden, save Ryan!” Experts said the structure, built in the 1900s is extremely unstable. Because of the layout of the building, with the rear brick part holding together much of the steal structure, officials said there were likely no void spaces where trapped victims could have shielded. Authorities said its brittle condition is worsening with time and the possibility of another collapse is now imminent. “We want to get everyone out, we want to do it right now,” Fire Marshal J Morris said as he broke down in tears at Tuesday’s press conference. “So understand, it’s not that we don’t want to do this ... it’s that we have to do it in a safe manner.”","completion":"Q: How many tenants are still unaccounted for from Sunday's Iowa apartment building collapse?

Someone said I should have a few tools around for gigs. Give me a list of tools I should keep in a bag in case something goes wrong on stage.","completion":"Here is a list of tools you should have in your gig bag: - A small multi-screwdriver. This can be handy for tightening loose screws on equipment or making sure the knobs on your gear are secure. There are hobbyist screwdrivers that have multiple tips stored in the body or shaft. In a pinch, you could even use the mini toolset for repairing eyeglasses. These sets are often cheap and low quality, but the screwdrivers tend to be good enough for a quick fix on stage. - A flashlight. While there may be stage lighting during the performance, if you need to make a quick repair, it is better to have a small but effective light source of your own, in case of emergencies. You can certainly use the big bulky one from home, but a pen light might be more effective and easier to use when you need to hold tools as well. If hands-free is your thing, you could also get a headlamp, which usually has a small strap attached to it. But if you have a modern cell phone, you probably already have an app that turns on the camera flash. - Pliers. A small pair of pliers can work wonders for a bent jack or for cutting and replacing a broken string. They don’t need to be too big, and you can usually find a small set of two or three at your favorite hardware store. - Allen/hex key set. These might not be completely necessary for certain players, but Allen screws are used on a lot of musical equipment, so it would be a good idea to have a set around. While you can buy keys as a set for a toolbox, keep on the lookout for a set that looks like a Swiss Army knife, commonly called a Gui-Tool. These specialty tools often have screwdriver bits built in, making it a very effective multi-tool to have in your arsenal. Although there are far more tools available, this should get you started and have you prepared for many unforeseen circumstances at your show.

For each of your tires, remove the air valve cap on the tire and put it somewhere close so you do not lose it. 3. Push the tire pressure gauge onto the valve stem until you hear air coming out. Press for one to two seconds. 4. Read the pressure. 5. Compare the gauge reading to the recommended tire pressure. If you do not know, this can be found in your vehicle's manual. Replace the tire valve cap. 6. Repeat for each wheel. Inflating a Car Tire 1. Park your car close enough to the air compressor so that you can reach each tire with the compressor's hose. 2. Remove the valve cap from the tire and store it somewhere secure. 3. Push the hose nozzle down onto the valve stem. You should notice the tire inflating as well as feel the air flowing through the hose. 4. When you think it's enough, remove the hose and use the pressure gauge to see what the new pressure of the tire is. If not enough, continue to inflate that tire until the correct psi is achieved. 5.

Focus on the recommended size and materials.","completion":"The size and shape of chicken coops is usually determined by the number of chickens to be housed. A general rule of thumb is to allow at least four square feet of space per chicken. If your flock will have limited access to the outdoors, you should look at chicken coops that provide up to ten square feet of space per chicken. Built-in features like roosts and nesting boxes will make your chickens comfortable and encourage them to lay plenty of eggs. Adding a fenced run that is a great way to let your birds enjoy the outdoors while protecting them from predators. Building materials are another important consideration when shopping for a chicken coop. Avoid building materials that may rot, harbor pests or be toxic to chickens. At the same time, you want to choose a material that is sturdy and durable. Repurposed wood is perfectly acceptable if you're building your own coop, but you need to make sure that the lumber you use is treated to prevent wood rot and mold.

After a Big Ten Championship season and an impending trip to the Rose Bowl game in Pasadena that year, Brutus was not originally scheduled to make an appearance in California. In the end, Ohio State’s Athletics department made the decision to send Brutus to the Rose Bowl, and Ohio State’s cheerleading and spirit team took control of the mascot, where he has been lovingly cared for ever since. In the 1980s, Brutus received another update to his look: a baseball cap with an “O,” his signature scarlet and gray striped shirt with the “00” on the back and some slim-fitting sweatpants. In the 1990s, his upper-body beefed up.

What are some ways I can earn additional income without being tied to a specific schedule or having to meet a minimum number of work hours per week? Give me at least 2 suggestions that are related to writing/editing.","completion":"No problem; here are some ways to earn additional income where you can set your own schedule and work minimal hours: -Drive for a ride-share service - If you have a car in decent shape and a good driving record, you can sign up to drive for Uber or Lyft. With these platforms, you can set your own schedule. -Sign up with a delivery service - Many delivery services like Instacart will allow delivery drivers to set their own schedules. -Take surveys online - There are many different platforms that pay users low rates to take surveys online, such as MTurk, Prolific, Springboard Panel, and Ipsos. The pay rate is usually relatively low, but you'll have a lot of freedom to set your own schedule and decide which surveys are (or aren't) worth your time. -Sign up for pet-sitting services - Platforms like Rover.com allow you to market yourself as a dog walker or pet sitter. You can visit other people's homes to check on their pets or host their pets at your home for a single day or multiple overnight stays. You'll have the power to decline any offer that doesn't suit your schedule. -Sign up for focus groups - With focus groups, you can get paid just to share your opinion on products or entertainment. These groups often require you to be present in person or virtually for specific hours, but you can always decline if the scheduled time doesn't work for you. The same is true of signing up for mock juries. -Become a mystery shopper - There are several different services that will pay you to visit stores and businesses as an undercover quality control analyst. Typically, they'll provide you with a checklist of things to review in the store and very clear instructions. All you have to do is visit the spot in question on your own time, follow the directions, and get paid. If the directions require you to make a purchase, the company will reimburse you. -Sell arts and crafts - If you've got a hobby (or more than one) that produces marketable products, consider selling them on platforms like Etsy, eBay, or Shopify. If your schedule is unpredictable, consider setting a shop policy that informs buyers that you're only available to ship items and respond to customer inquiries on certain days/times each week. You can also sell these items on your own website or at craft vendor fairs. -Re-sell used items - There are plenty of websites and brick-and-mortar stores where you can sell your used clothes, electronics, furniture, appliances, and more. -Sign up for a copywriting platform - You may want to do some research on these platforms to determine which is the best fit, as some do require their writers to meet a monthly minimum of work hours. Some don't, though, and will simply list available short-term copywriting projects for you to take or leave as you see fit. -Start your own small business - You can work with clients as a writing coach, editor, or in any other capacity you feel qualified to. It will be up to you to determine when you meet with clients and for how long. You can also set your own pay rate."},{"prompt":"I want the beginning of a slightly magical modern-day story about a toothbrush trying desperately to be together with toothpaste, no dialogue is needed","completion":"Night came, and as the man finished brushing his teeth, he put his toothbrush in a cup, turned off the lights, and went to bed. But things still stirred in that house; you see, the toothbrush was glad to have served its purpose once more, but it longed to be together with the tube of toothpaste just across the bathroom counter. Its heart ached to be close to the toothpaste, and it was gleeful for the mere moments in which they would be together before spending so much time apart -- until the next time the man needed to brush his teeth. And all it could do was stare longingly, wishing it had the means to reach the object of its affection. With such a strong desire, something must have taken pity on the poor toothbrush, as sparkles hit the bristles of the toothbrush, and suddenly, it could move! Well, nudge really, but this was more than the toothbrush was ever capable of before, and it wasted no time. The toothbrush nudged, nudged, and nudged again, hoping to escape the confines of the cup the human placed it in. It struggled and struggled until it was able to use its weight and force to knock the cup down, giving it the chance to nudge right out of the cup. It made moves, making sure its handle was completely out of the cup, before nudging itself towards the tub of toothpaste. However, it came across a possible problem; between it and the toothpaste was a large chasm, known as the \\"sink\\". If it fell into the sink, there was no way it would be able to get itself out, not until the human awoke and made use of it once more. The toothbrush could try to get around it, but it would have to travel around the outside, and there was a chance it could fall onto the floor too. That might be an even worse fate, as no doubt if the human found it on the floor, it could very well be thrown away, forever separated from its beloved toothpaste. Yet it was clear, there was only one option. It was not going to return to the cup, it was already too late for that. The only path ahead was around the sink, risking falling to the floor, to reach the only thing it ever wanted to be close to."},{"prompt":"Create a concise emergency broadcast script for a CNN host announcing an extraterrestrial pandas invasion!","completion":"[Emergency Broadcast Script] CNN HOST: Good evening.

You have to pray in the middle of the village fountain at least once a day. It is said that the fountain will eventually bless a woman of the village and give her supernatural powers. Enough power to help defend the village from the dragon that lords up in the mountain. Kotone prays that she isn't the one that receives this power. Every day her wish gets granted, but this one day, she wasn't so lucky. The fountain starts to glow, and from below, a geyser shoots up and douses the village in rain. Kotone steps back and looks at herself. She is glowing, her dark hair starts to levitate, and the water starts to surround her. She was picked as this generation's healer. The village folk all walk out and look at her, fascinated and scared. An older woman starts to walk up to Kotone and says to her \\"You have received the blessing of the goddess, and now you must undertake the trial of healers like the women from generations past.\\" Kotone didn't want this, but she couldn't refuse. Her destiny was already decided. The trial was to take part tomorrow, in the forest close to the village. The trial was a simple one. Escape a well and return to the village within seven days and pray. Kotone has never done training like this. She was only given a day's worth of food and two books. One was the history of the women that received the blessing. The other was more practical, detailing how to use her newly found power. She has doubts about if she can do this. She walks to the well with various members of the village surrounding her so she can't run away. Along the way, one of the men collapses out of nowhere. Everyone, including Kotone, ran to the man's side. It looks like he has contracted an illness that started to show signs now. At this moment, Kotone comes up with an idea.

Ron Francis signed a contract to remain general manager of the Seattle Kraken on Wednesday, running through the 2026-27 season. The 60-year-old has been Kraken GM since they joined the NHL as an expansion team for the 2021-22 season. Seattle clinched a Stanley Cup Playoff berth this season and advanced to Game 7 of the Western Conference Second Round, a 2-1 loss at the Dallas Stars. The Kraken went 46-28-8 to clinch the first wild card into the postseason from the West and eliminated the defending Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche in seven games in the first round. Seattle finished 27-49-6, the third-worst record in the League, in its first NHL season. \\"Every year is different; every year is unique. There's always challenges,\\" Francis told NHL.com on April 11. \\"But I think for us, it's certainly been more gratifying than the first year.\\" Francis was Carolina Hurricanes GM from 2014-18 and worked in their front office for 12 seasons before the Kraken hired him July 18, 2019. Seattle stood pat before the 2023 NHL Trade Deadline on March 3 but set NHL records in wins and points (100) for a second-year team and for the greatest improvement from a team's first to second season (19 wins, 40 points). Seattle moved 18 spots in the standings, second-most this season behind the New Jersey Devils (plus-25). Forward Jared McCann (40 goals) and center Matty Beniers (24) were the only two Kraken players to top 23 goals for a team that averaged 3.52 goals per game, which tied the Devils for fourth in the NHL. Beniers is a finalist for the Calder Trophy, voted as NHL rookie of the year, along with Buffalo Sabres defenseman Owen Power and Edmonton Oilers goalie Stuart Skinner. \\"I think every GM, his goal starting is to get into the playoffs,\\" Francis said. \\"Certainly, it's no different for me and my team. The biggest thing for us to be able to show improvement from where we were last year as a new franchise in a new market, trying to show our fan base that, hey, we're getting better, we're moving in the right direction was what we were trying to accomplish. I might be lying a little bit if I said I saw it going this well, but it has and that's a kudos to our players and our coaching staff and the effort that they've put in to get to this point.\\" Francis, a center who played 22 NHL seasons, was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2007.

On April 20, 2023, a new SpaceX rocket called Starship exploded over the Gulf of Mexico three minutes into its first flight ever. SpaceX is calling the test launch a success, despite the fiery end result. As a space policy expert, I agree that the “rapid unscheduled disassembly” – the term SpaceX uses when its rockets explode – was a very successful failure. A large rocket standing next to a tower. The full Starship stack comprises a Starship spacecraft (in black) on top of a rocket dubbed Super Heavy (in silver) and is nearly 400 feet (120 meters) tall. Hotel Marmot/Flickr, CC BY-SA The most powerful rocket ever built This launch was the first fully integrated test of SpaceX’s new Starship. Starship is the most powerful rocket ever developed and is designed to be fully reusable. It is made of two different stages, or sections. The first stage, called Super Heavy, is a collection of 33 individual engines and provides more than twice the thrust of a Saturn V, the rocket that sent astronauts to the Moon in the 1960s and 1970s. The first stage is designed to get the rocket to about 40 miles (65 kilometers) above Earth. Once Super Heavy’s job is done, it is supposed to separate from the rest of the craft and land safely back on the surface to be used again. At that point the second stage, called the Starship spacecraft, is supposed to ignite its own engines to carry the payload – whether people, satellites or anything else – into orbit. An explosive first flight While parts of Starship have been tested previously, the launch on April 20, 2023, was the first fully integrated test with the Starship spacecraft stacked on top of the Super Heavy rocket. If it had been successful, once the first stage was spent, it would have separated from the upper stage and crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. Starship would then have continued on, eventually crashing 155 miles (250 kilometers) off of Hawaii. Read news coverage based on evidence, not tweets During the SpaceX livestream, the team stated that the primary goal of this mission was to get the rocket off the launch pad. It accomplished that goal and more. Starship flew for more than three minutes, passing through what engineers call “max Q” – the moment at which a rocket experiences the most physical stress from acceleration and air resistance. A cloud of fire and smoke in the sky with pieces falling Earthward. The Starship spacecraft and Super Hheavy rocket were unable to separate during the flight, so engineers blew up the full rocket. AP Photo/Eric Gay According to SpaceX, a few things went wrong with the launch. First, multiple engines went out sometime before the point at which the Starship spacecraft and the Super Heavy rocket were supposed to separate from each other. The two stages were also unable to separate at the predetermined moment, and with the two stages stuck together, the rocket began to tumble end over end. It is still unclear what specifically caused this failure. Starship is almost 400 feet (120 meters) tall and weighs 11 million pounds (4.9 million kilograms). An out-of-control rocket full of highly flammable fuel is a very dangerous object, so to prevent any harm, SpaceX engineers triggered the self-destruct mechanism and blew up the entire rocket over the Gulf of Mexico. All modern rockets have mechanisms built into them that allow engineers to safely destroy the rocket in flight if need be. SpaceX itself has blown up many of its own rockets during testing. Success or failure? Getting to space is hard, and it is not at all unusual for new rockets to experience problems. In the past two years, both South Korea and Japan have attempted to launch new rockets that also failed to reach orbit. Commercial companies such as Virgin Orbit and Relativity Space have also lost rockets recently. None of these were crewed missions, and in most of these failed launches, flight engineers purposefully destroyed the rockets after problems arose. SpaceX’s approach to testing is different from that of other groups. Its company philosophy is to fail fast, find problems and fix them with the next rocket. This is different from the more traditional approach taken by organizations such as NASA that spend far more time identifying and planning for possible problems before attempting a launch. The traditional approach tends to be slow. The development of NASA’s Space Launch System – the rocket that will take astronauts to the Moon as part of the Artemis program – took more than 10 years before its first launch this past November. SpaceX’s method has allowed the company to move much faster but can be costlier because of the time and resources it takes to build new rockets. SpaceX engineers will look to identify the specific cause of the problem so that they can fix it for the next test launch.

He has been playing them and watching them with his dad since he was a baby. Now, at eight years old, he wants to be on as many teams as he possibly can. His parents said he could play three at a time, and he chose baseball, lacrosse, and soccer for the spring/summer season. Playing three sports in a season is a juggling act for both Rodney and his parents. He loves every minute of it, but it often consumes his days. Last Sunday, Rodney had a lacrosse game at 10 a.m., a baseball game at 12 p.m., more baseball games if they won the first one, and a soccer game at 7 p.m. What a day! His mom got him to his lacrosse game at 10 because his dad is the baseball coach and had to go to the fields early. Rodney scored two goals, ran to the car to change his clothes, and off they went to baseball. Rodney's team won the first game, and he hit three RBIs. His team then won their game at 2 and were off to the championship game at 4. Rodney hit a home run and was so pleased! The team won and was going for ice cream to celebrate, but Rodney refused to miss his soccer game. Off Rodney went to soccer, and his day was finished around 8:30 p.m. It was a whirlwind of a day, and they'll do it all again next weekend. They all know they can't keep up this pace forever, but Rodney's parents want to do everything they can to support his interests as he grows."},{"prompt":"I’m designing a crossword puzzle with the theme of snack foods.
