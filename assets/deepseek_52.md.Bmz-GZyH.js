Electronic alerts (e-alerts) for AKI have attracted interest as a tool to facilitate this. Initial feasibility has already been demonstrated; this review will discuss recent advances in alert methodology, implementation beyond single centres and reported effect on outcomes.', 'On-going descriptions of e-alerts highlight increasing variation in both detection algorithms and alert processes. In England, this is being addressed by national rollout of a standardized detection algorithm; recent data have shown this to have good diagnostic performance.

Alec Miran, the special events producer for the Gorbachev visit, had been negotiating with the Chinese to try to stay on the air.

Based on the sentence \\"Two dogs in harnesses running in tall grass.\\", is the sentence \\"The dog are not on the asphalt.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Based on the initial sentence, \\"Two dogs in harnesses running in tall grass,\\" we have information that indicates a specific situation involving two dogs - they are in harnesses and are running in tall grass. Now, considering the second sentence, \\"The dog are not on the asphalt,\\" the focus is slightly different - it talks about a dog (or potentially multiple dogs, assuming a typo leading to \\"The dogs are not on the asphalt\\") and highlights that these dogs are not on the asphalt. While the first sentence does not explicitly mention anything about asphalt, it does give us information about the dogs' environment. As they are running in tall grass, one can logically infer that the environment they are in is likely to be a field, a meadow, or a similar natural setting, which would strongly suggest the absence of asphalt. It is essential to consider the context and the possible scenarios before making any conclusions. Here's an analysis of potential situations: 1. If the second sentence is taken to mean a general statement that seems unrelated to the first sentence: In this case, we cannot definitively conclude whether the two sentences are related or unrelated. 2. If the second sentence refers to the same dogs as the first sentence: In this case, we can reasonably infer that the sentence \\"The dog(s) are not on the asphalt\\" is true. This is because the second sentence complements the information provided in the first sentence - if two dogs are running in tall grass, it is highly likely that they are not on the asphalt. In conclusion, if we assume that the second sentence refers to the same dogs mentioned in the first sentence, we can assert that \\"The dog(s) are not on the asphalt\\" is a true sentence. The primary reasoning behind this conclusion is that the two dogs in question are running in tall grass, which suggests a natural setting where asphalt is unlikely to be present."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Seeking a fresh start, he plans an escape - a vacation to the charming, historic city of Charleston, South Carolina. John's marriage has been on the rocks, so he takes this opportunity to embark on the trip alone, hoping to find solace and a way to ease his guilt over Mark's death. Upon arriving in Charleston, John is captivated by its beauty and rich history. He makes the decision to stay at a charming bed and breakfast surrounded by ancient oaks and cobblestone streets. The owner, Mrs. Ella Whitmore, a 60-year-old widow with a love for old-world charm and historical tales, warmly welcomes John. Act 2: During his stay, John starts exploring the city, visiting the famous Battery Park and Drayton Hall. While having lunch in a quaint cafe, he overhears a conversation about a mysterious local legend that dates back to the 1700s. Intrigued by the story, John delves into the history of Charleston and discovers that the city is believed to have connections to the early Freemasons. John soon finds himself pulled into the world of Charleston's Freemasons, learning that they allegedly buried a priceless relic – an ancient, powerful jewel – somewhere in the city. However, before John sets out on his quest to find the hidden treasure, he encounters a beautiful antique shop owner named Grace during one of his daily strolls. The two immediately hit it off and begin to bond over their love for Charleston's history. Act 3: As the mysteries of the relic unfurl, John becomes significantly more involved in solving the riddle of its location. While exploring the city's underground tunnels with Grace's help, John stumbles upon Mark's old Freemasonry medallion, only to learn that Mark's ancestors were also linked to the order. John's belief that Mark's death and their visit to Charleston were fated grows stronger, as does his love for Grace. A shadowy group of men - the current protectors of the ancient relic - are revealed to be watching John's every move, willing to do whatever it takes to keep the priceless jewel's location a secret. Enigmatic warnings begin to appear around them, encouraging John to turn back, lest he meets a fate similar to Mark's. Act 4: Unfazed by the veiled threats and driven to uncover the truth, John and Grace soon find themselves in a dangerous game of cat and mouse against their foes. They outwit the shadowy group, following clues and solving riddles that lead them closer to the relic. As John and Grace discover the truth, the rival group corners them, but they are miraculously saved by Mrs. Whitmore, who reveals herself to be a descendant of the original Freemasons and the protector of the hidden jewel. With the relic finally in their possession, John, Grace, and Mrs. Whitmore make the decision to keep the jewel's existence a secret, guarding it from those who wish to harness its power. John, having found love, closure, and a renewed sense of purpose in Charleston, returns to New York City with Grace and a newfound appreciation for life, love, and the mysteries hidden within the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Determine what type of paint remover you will use. Article:","completion":"Title: Choosing the Right Paint Remover for Your Project Introduction: When it comes to removing paint from various surfaces, having the appropriate paint remover is an essential part of the process. With numerous paint removers available in the market, selecting the right one for your project can be a daunting task. This article will guide you through the process of determining the most suitable type of paint remover to use, considering factors such as the type of surface, the paint being removed, and safety concerns. Step 1: Examine the surface Before choosing a paint remover, it's crucial to examine the surface that requires paint removal closely. The type of surface will play a significant role in determining the most appropriate paint remover for successful and safe paint stripping. - For wooden surfaces, consider using a solvent-based paint remover, followed by sanding to achieve a smooth result. However, be cautious of potential damage to the wood if used too aggressively. - For metal surfaces, chemical paint removers are a common choice. These removers break down the paint's bond with the metal surface, making it easier to clean off. - For more delicate surfaces like plastic or fiberglass, it is best to choose a non-abrasive paint remover to avoid damaging the surface. Step 2: Identify the type of paint Understanding the type of paint that needs to be removed is also a vital factor in choosing the right paint remover. Different paint types require different removal methods for optimal results. - For oil-based paints, a solvent-based paint remover is typically the most effective option. - For latex or water-based paints, a water-based paint remover will often suffice, proving to be less harsh on surfaces. - For more stubborn paint types like epoxy or polyurethane, a stronger paint remover may be necessary, such as a chemical-based remover. Step 3: Consider safety concerns Safety should always be at the forefront of any project. When working with paint removers, take into account any potential hazards or health concerns associated with using these products. - Opt for eco-friendly or low-VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) options when available. These paint removers will have fewer harmful fumes and lessen the environmental impact of your project. - Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, goggles, and a mask when handling paint removers, particularly those with strong chemicals. - Read and follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully, ensuring proper use and disposal of the paint remover. Step 4: Test the paint remover Before committing to a specific paint remover, it's always wise to test it on a small, inconspicuous area of the surface. This will help you gauge its effectiveness and ensure that it does not cause any damage to the surface in question. Conclusion: Ultimately, selecting the right paint remover for your project requires thoughtful consideration of various factors such as the type of surface, paint, and safety concerns. Through careful research and testing, you can ensure that you choose a paint remover that effectively and safely completes your project."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose Long term smoking shrinks the blood vessels happens, how will it affect the salt does not separate. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"The process you've described is distillation, which is a common method for desalinating water, or removing salts and other impurities. Your question seems to inquire about the relationship between long-term smoking and effects on this desalination process, and specifically on the separation of salt from water. To answer your question, let's first understand what long-term smoking does to the human body. Among many other detrimental health effects, long-term smoking indeed restricts the blood vessels. This condition is also known as vasoconstriction. While vasoconstriction has severe physiological implications, it does not directly affect the process of water desalination at a factory or plant. The typical water desalination process includes steps such as pre-treatment, desalination, post-treatment, and waste disposal. The desalination step often involves heating the saltwater solution to a high temperature, causing the water to evaporate while leaving the salts and other impurities behind. The water vapor is then collected and condensed back into liquid form, while the salt is typically separated manually and removed. This process is largely mechanical and chemical in nature. The primary driving factors in the separation of salt from water in this process include temperature, pressure, and the inherent physical and chemical properties of the components involved (water, salt, and any other compounds present). Human physiological states like those induced by long-term smoking, such as vasoconstriction, do not interact with these factors. This differs to situations where human physiological changes might influence a process; for example, how dehydration might affect kidney function, or how vasoconstriction might affect blood flow. In comparison, the process of mechanical desalination in a factory is independent of changes in human physiology. In summary, the supposed perturbation of long-term smoking and resulting vasoconstriction would have no effect on the separation of salt from water in a factory desalination process. It's crucial to understand that while long-term smoking has serious health implications, including vasoconstriction, these physiological effects don't influence industrial processes like desalination."},{"prompt":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who suggested that clarinetists, by virtue of their not being tied to the melody as much as cornetists and trumpet players, could explore harmonies , can you please find it?

Gioia points to \\"a characteristic streak of obstinacy\\" in Beiderbecke that provokes \\"this chronic disregard of the tried-and-true.\\" He argues that this stubbornness was behind Beiderbecke's decision not to switch from cornet to trumpet when many other musicians, including Armstrong, did so. In addition, Gioia highlights Beiderbecke's precise timing, relaxed delivery, and pure tone, which contrasted with \\"the dirty, rough-edged sound\\" of King Oliver and his protégé Armstrong, whose playing was often more energetic and whose style held more sway early in the 1920s than Beiderbecke's. Beiderbecke's playing - both as a cornetist and a pianist - had a profound effect on a number of his contemporaries.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person that has their name changed in Denise Waverly? The film opens in the year 1958, where steel heiress Edna Buxton enters a talent contest. Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit.

Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"While these two sentences appear to convey similar information, there are subtle differences in their meaning and structure. Let's break each sentence down to analyze the variations: 1. \\"He refugeed and returned to Italy, where he retired for two years to private life.\\" - In this sentence, the subject \\"he\\" is described as taking refuge, which implies facing a situation requiring asylum or protection. - The individual returns to Italy, with the sentence specifying that the return to Italy is related to the act of taking refuge. - Upon returning to Italy, the subject retires to private life for two years. This indicates a withdrawal from public life or professional responsibilities during that period. 2. \\"He retired to Italy where he escaped and returned to private life for two years.\\" - In this sentence, retirement is the initial action, and the individual retires specifically to Italy. - Instead of seeking refuge, the subject escapes, which implies evasion or fleeing from something. This escaping could be related to their retirement, but it is not explicitly stated. - As with the first sentence, the subject participant returns to private life for two years, presumably after escaping, and withdraws from public or professional engagements. To summarize, both sentences convey the idea that the subject returned to Italy, retired from public life, and experienced two years of private life. However, they differ in other aspects. Here's how: - Sentence 1 directly links taking refuge with returning to Italy, and implies this was an act of seeking protection or asylum. - Sentence 2 focuses on escaping rather than taking refuge, suggesting the subject evaded an undesirable situation instead. Additionally, retirement is mentioned as the initial action in sentence 2, separate from the escape. These nuances change the overall interpretation of each sentence and as such, the statements don't mean exactly the same thing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Reinaldo Arenas","completion":"Title: \\"Breaking Free: The Life of Reinaldo Arenas\\" Genre: Biographical Drama Step 1: Introduce the main character The movie begins with a striking portrayal of Reinaldo Arenas (played by an upcoming Latin actor), a Cuban poet, novelist, and playwright, growing up in rural poverty during the 1940s and 1950s. We see a young Reinaldo exhibiting an incredible talent for writing and a passion for literature. Step 2: Establish the historical context The film depicts the early days of Fidel Castro's revolution, which initially captivated and inspired Arenas, as well as other Cuban intellectuals, who believed that it would bring positive changes to the lives of ordinary people. The film highlights the optimism of the era by showcasing the excitement and fervor surrounding the revolution. Step 3: Introduce the main conflict As the regime becomes increasingly repressive, particularly towards intellectuals and LGBTQ+ individuals, Arenas finds himself a victim of the very revolution he once supported. He is targeted, marginalized, and persecuted, not only for his fierce intellect and subversive words, but also for his homosexuality. Step 4: Show the impact of persecution The movie delves into the harsh realities faced by Arenas under the repressive regime, including his escape from prison, hiding from authorities, and eventual exile from Cuba. Throughout this gripping narrative, the film showcases the resilience and strength of Reinaldo Arenas, who clings to his art as a means of survival, even in the face of immense suffering. Step 5: Focus on the creative process While the movie's main plot follows Arenas' personal struggle for freedom, it also celebrates his creative accomplishments and offers audiences a window into his revolutionary literary work, including the writing of his autobiography, \\"Before Night Falls.\\" We see Arenas' unrelenting dedication to writing, unapologetically sharing his experiences and ideas with the world despite the odds against him. Step 6: Depict Reinaldo Arenas' final years The film concludes with a portrayal of Arenas' life in exile in the United States, as he battles the double-edged sword of newfound freedom and a diagnosis of AIDS. In the face of this adversity, Arenas continues to write and share his work with the world, refusing to ever let go of the hope for a better Cuba. Step 7: Tie the movie back to the source material In the final scene, Reinaldo Arenas completes his autobiography, \\"Before Night Falls,\\" the very book which inspired this movie. This poetic and powerful ending serves as a testament to Arenas' indomitable spirit, ensuring that his legacy will continue to inspire future generations. Throughout the film, we emphasize the transformative power of art, the endurance of the human spirit, and the importance of standing up for one's beliefs, even in the face of great adversity. This movie not only tells the extraordinary story of Reinaldo Arenas, but also captures the universal struggle for freedom and self-expression."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Captain Nairic, an undercover intelligence officer, was abducted, tortured, and murdered in May 1977 by the IRA. His remains, like those of many other victims, have never been found. The Disappeared: The term \\"the Disappeared\\" refers to a group of people who are believed to have been abducted, murdered, and then secretly buried by militant organizations during the Troubles between 1969 and 1998. The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains, established in 1999, is dedicated to locating and identifying the bodies of the Disappeared. To date, 16 victims out of a total of 20 listed have been found and returned to their families for burial, while four others, including Captain Nairic, remain unaccounted for. Captain Robert Nairic - A Tragic Tale: Robert Nairic, a 28-year-old captain in the British army's Grenadier Guards, was working as an undercover intelligence officer when he was abducted by the Provisional IRA from a pub in South Armagh on May 14, 1977. He had entered the pub alone, using a fake identification and posing as Danny McErlane while attempting to gather sensitive information. Nairic was taken to another location, where he was brutally tortured for several hours before being shot dead. His captors hoped to extract crucial information about other undercover operatives in the area, but Nairic did not divulge any details. His battered body was later discovered near the border with the Republic of Ireland. To this day, the exact location of his remains remains a mystery. The Appeal for Public Help: As part of the ongoing search efforts, the ICLVR has released an appeal for any information that may lead to the discovery of Captain Nairic's remains. The Commission has had previous success in locating the bodies of other victims with the assistance of information from the public, and they are hopeful that someone may hold the vital clue needed. Geoff Knupfer, the lead investigator with the ICLVR, stated, \\"His killers know where they put his body. Only they can tell us, either directly or indirectly through a third party, the ICLVR or a trusted individual, where it is so we can find him, take him back to his family and provide a Christian burial.\\" The Commission guarantees complete confidentiality to anyone who provides information and reiterates that their sole purpose is to recover the remains of the victims, not to pursue criminal prosecutions. This appeal is a chance for those with knowledge of Nairic's final resting place to step forward without fear of reprisal. The Ongoing Search for Closure: The search for Captain Robert Nairic and other Disappeared victims highlights the painful legacy of the Troubles, and the ongoing effort to provide closure to the families who have suffered for decades. The Commission, along with the victims' families, can only hope to bring some measure of solace and resolution through the discovery and return of their loved ones' remains. Conclusion: The urgent appeal for information in locating the remains of Robert Nairic is an important reminder of the ongoing commitment to providing justice and closure for families of the Disappeared. As the search continues, it is essential that any information, no matter how small, is used to finally bring peace to those who have been waiting for so long. It is the responsibility of those who have knowledge of the whereabouts of the victims to come forward and help end this painful chapter of Northern Ireland's history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these mean the same? In order to preserve the neutrality of Malaysia , the Sabres were flown to Singapore via Thailand . In order to maintain Malaysia 's neutrality , the Sabres were flown to Thailand via Singapore .","completion":"No, these two sentences do not mean the same. There are differences in both the intended action and the route taken by the Sabres. Let's break them down and see what each sentence means: 1. In order to preserve the neutrality of Malaysia, the Sabres were flown to Singapore via Thailand. 2. In order to maintain Malaysia's neutrality, the Sabres were flown to Thailand via Singapore. While both sentences mention the overarching goal of preserving or maintaining Malaysia's neutrality, they differ in the following aspects: 1. Action difference: In the first sentence, the word \\"preserve\\" is used, expressing the effort to keep something in its original state and prevent any changes. In the second sentence, the word \\"maintain\\" is used, indicating the ongoing effort to sustain Malaysia's neutrality. Although similar, \\"preserve\\" conveys a stronger need for protection, while \\"maintain\\" suggests a more active and continuous process. 2. Route difference: In the first sentence, the Sabres' destination is Singapore, and they travel there via Thailand. This means that the Sabres pass through Thailand on their way to Singapore. In the second sentence, however, the destination is Thailand, with the Sabres passing through Singapore on their way to Thailand. These two flight paths are distinctly different and lead to different end locations. In conclusion, the two sentences are not the same in meaning due to differences in the actions taken for Malaysia's neutrality and the route taken by the Sabres. The first sentence suggests a stronger protection of neutrality and a flight path from Malaysia, through Thailand, and finally to Singapore. The second sentence implies an ongoing effort to maintain neutrality and a flight path from Malaysia, through Singapore, and then to Thailand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It replaced the Peerages of England and Scotland, until it was itself replaced by the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1801. - A baronet (or ; abbreviated Bart or Bt) or the rare female equivalent, a baronetess (, or ; abbreviation \\"Btss\\"), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown. The practice of awarding baronetcies was originally introduced in England in the 14th century and was used by James I of England in 1611 as a means of raising funds. - Thomas Thynne , 1st Marquess of Bath KG ( 1734 -- 1796 ) was a British politician who held office under George III serving as Southern Secretary , Northern Secretary and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland .

It came into being when the Parliament of Ireland passed the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 and proclaimed King Henry VIII of England as King of Ireland. The territory of the Kingdom had previously had the status of a lordship of the Crown. - The partition of Ireland was the division of the island of Ireland into two distinct jurisdictions, Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. It took place on 3 May 1921 under the Government of Ireland Act 1920. Today the former is still known as Northern Ireland and forms part of the United Kingdom while the latter is a now sovereign state also named Ireland, formally known as the Republic of Ireland. - The Chief Secretary for Ireland was a key political office in the British administration in Ireland.

Cressida Dick said the former US National Security Agency contractor’s disclosures, printed by The Guardian newspaper, caused ‘enormous damage’ and ‘hand[ed] the advantage to terrorists’. The Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner added: ‘The so-called Snowden revelations have made our work more difficult. The actions he took helped to signal to people who may try to do us harm how to avoid surveillance and other techniques. Former CIA agent Edward Snowden made the world a more dangerous place. through leaking secret surveillance techniques, a top officer has warned. ‘In my view that is not going to make the world safer, it is going to make it more dangerous. It has affected public confidence in our abilities to do a job that I believe we do carefully, proportionately and using our powers sparingly within the law.’ Speaking to a meeting of police chiefs in her last days as Britain’s top counter-terrorism officer, Miss Dick said the police were ‘staring into the abyss’ because of a political deadlock over access to sensitive internet communications. Terrorists and other top-level criminals were taking advantage of rapidly changing technology to evade the security services. Cressida Dick, Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner, told police chiefs that the leaks had affected public confidence in police abilities. Politicians must get to grips with laws allowing police to use so-called ‘communications data’, Miss Dick said, adding that terrorist investigations will be hampered unless police and spies can retain data, including internet browsing and emails. She said: ‘I believe that as technology changes, we are beginning to stare into the abyss. Make no mistake, continuing erosion of this capability without the necessary legislative changes will severely impact on our ability to continue terrorist investigations.’ Asked about the outbreak of extreme violence in Iraq, Miss Dick said the security services were watching the ‘ghastly conflagration’ closely. She said: ‘It is clearly an enormous world-changing event which will have all sorts of ramifications and it may or may not heighten the risk to the UK of terrorism.’ She added that police had no information yet that British jihadists have travelled from Syria to join the wave of barbaric Islamist fighters. But she said police were conscious that hundreds of Britons fighting the regime of Bashar al-Assad could move and threaten other areas in the world. Miss Dick also appealed to the Government to leave terrorism units in the hands of police forces, including the Met, rather than hand them to the National Crime Agency. She said a ‘messy divorce’ risked making the police response to complex terrorist threats less effective and more difficult to co-ordinate.

Here is a news article: CLOSE The FBI arrested one of its most wanted suspect arrested in El Paso on Sunday. Rudy Gutierrez/El Paso Times FBI Most Wanted suspect Terry A.D. Strickland was captured Jan. 15 in El Paso. Above, Strickland walks into the El Paso County Jail escorted by the FBI agents who captured him. (Photo: MARK LAMBIE/EL PASO TIMES) For the second time in less than a year, a Milwaukee homicide suspect has been arrested after being added to the FBI's \\"Ten Most Wanted\\" list. Terry A.D. Strickland, 24, who is wanted in a double killing, was captured early Sunday in El Paso, Texas, the FBI announced. When he was added to the most-wanted list last month, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said he was accused of having \\"cold-bloodedly killed\\" two innocent men, Maurice Brown Jr. and Michael Allen Reed. Strickland was among a group of men arguing in front of a Milwaukee home July 17 when witnesses saw him go inside the house, emerge with a gun and fire into the small crowd, officials said. Strickland then approached Brown, 38, who was laying on the ground, and shot him multiple times before turning to Reed, 39, and shooting him in the head, according to authorities. Strickland fled in a black SUV, abandoning his 18-month-old daughter who was inside the house, officials said. \\"I am ecstatic that he's been arrested for the murder of my son,\\" said Reed's mother, Janice Reed, on Sunday after a reporter told her the news. \\"My son can rest now,\\" she added. Flynn described the crime as \\"vicious\\" and \\"unnecessary.\\" \\"Neither individual posed the slightest threat to Mr. Strickland, but they paid with their lives for occupying the same space,\\" he said. After the FBI got a tip on its public access line, agents learned on Saturday that Strickland was possibly living in El Paso. Law enforcement officers worked throughout Saturday and into Sunday to locate him before arresting him at 5:10 a.m. during a traffic stop, according to a news release from the FBI. Strickland was arrested without incident. Strickland had been arrested earlier in 2016, before the double homicide, after he reportedly pointed and aimed a gun at another person, police said. The victim did not cooperate and charges were not filed. Strickland was the second Milwaukee homicide suspect added to the FBI's most-wanted list within a six-month period. Last summer, Shanika Minor was arrested in North Carolina within a week of being added. She is charged with fatally shooting her mother's nine-months-pregnant neighbor, Tamecca Perry, hours after Minor confronted the woman with a complaint about loud music. Minor was the seventh Wisconsin fugitive to appear on the FBI list since its inception in 1950 and the first from Milwaukee. Her jury trial is scheduled to begin in February. A reward was paid out to an individual who provided information leading directly to Minor's arrest, an FBI official said last month.

He has been charged in Milwaukee with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide and with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. Jail records do not list an attorney to comment on his behalf. Authorities said Strickland was among a group of men arguing in front of a Milwaukee home July 17. Witnesses saw him go inside the house, emerge with a gun and fire into the small crowd. Authorities said Strickland fatally shot Maurice Brown Jr., 38, who was on the ground, then turned to Michael Allen Reed, 39, and shot him in the head. \\"It was vicious,\\" Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said when Strickland was added to the FBI's most-wanted list last month. \\"It was unnecessary. Neither individual posed the slightest threat to Mr. Strickland, but they paid with their lives for occupying the same space.\\" Authorities have said Strickland fled from the shooting in a black SUV, abandoning his 18-month-old daughter inside the house, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The FBI said agents were led to Strickland after receiving a tip that he may be temporarily living in El Paso.

Question: Who is the carrier of Ananka's soul? Title: The Mummy's Ghost Movie plot: In Egypt, Yousef Bey (John Carradine) journeys to a remote temple in answer to a summons from Andoheb, High Priest of Arkham (George Zucco). Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

It is also keen on promoting / selling you some products like thera-bands. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","completion":"This review depicts the product in a somewhat unflattering light, primarily for the following reasons: 1. Limited practical applications: The reviewer clearly states that, while the book is useful for developing self-awareness about one's body, it lacks practical exercises to help improve one's dance. This implies that the book may not meet the expectations of readers looking for a more comprehensive guide on dance-related exercise and improvement. 2. Focus on promoting products: Another negative point mentioned in the review is the book's emphasis on promoting or selling additional products, such as thera-bands. This could be off-putting for potential readers, as it may raise concerns about the author's motivation and the overall value of the book's content. 3. Comparison to another work: The reviewer compares this book to Mary Bond's \\"New Rules of Posture.\\" By doing so, they suggest that the book has similarities to another work but does not provide unique insight or a fresh perspective on the subject matter. This could be interpreted as the book lacking originality and offering only an average contribution to the field.

This indicates that the book may still be of value to readers interested in gaining knowledge about body awareness and may provide a foundation for further exploration of dance techniques and exercises. In summary, this review paints the product in a primarily unflattering light, mainly due to shortcomings in providing practical dance exercises and an emphasis on promoting additional products. However, there is still some value to be derived from the book's focus on developing body self-awareness. Overall, potential readers should weigh both the positive and negative aspects of this review before deciding whether this book could effectively meet their needs and expectations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, retired Marine General John Kelly, is one of the U.S. military's longest-serving commanders and the most senior officer since 9/11 to lose a child in combat. Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Kelly took a tough tone on border security, warning Congress last year about the risks of smuggling rings in Mexico and Central America that spirited \\"tens of thousands of people,\\" including unaccompanied children, \\"to our nation's doorstep.\\" He also clashed with the Obama administration over plans to close Guantanamo and the Pentagon's order that opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces like the Navy SEALs.

Wheeler had been expecting and openly hoping for war with Nazi Germany for a year prior to the outbreak of hostilities; he believed that the United Kingdom's involvement in the conflict would remedy the shame that he thought had been brought upon the country by its signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938. Volunteering for the armed services, he was assigned to assemble the 48th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery at Enfield, where he set about recruiting volunteers, including his son Michael. As the 48th swelled in size, it was converted into the 42nd Mobile Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment in the Royal Artillery, which consisted of four batteries and was led by Wheeler – now promoted to the rank of colonel – as Commanding Officer. Given the nickname of \\"Flash Alf\\" by those serving under him, he was recognised by colleagues as a ruthless disciplinarian and was blamed by many for the death of one of his soldiers from influenza during training. Having been appointed secretary of the Society of Antiquaries in 1939 and then director in 1940, he travelled to London to deal with society affairs on various occasions. In 1941 Wheeler was awarded a Fellowship of the British Academy. Cole had meanwhile entered into an affair with a man named Clive Entwistle, who lambasted Wheeler as \\"that whiskered baboon\\". When Wheeler discovered Entwistle in bed with his wife, he initiated divorce proceedings that were finalised in March 1942.In the summer of 1941, Wheeler and three of his batteries were assigned to fight against German and Italian forces in the North African Campaign. In September, they set sail from Glasgow aboard the RMS Empress of Russia; because the Mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces, they were forced to travel via the Cape of Good Hope, before taking shore leave in Durban.

Translate this to English?","completion":"We have great difficulty in gaining sufficient knowledge of this transnational crime because our law enforcement agencies are organized nationally and operate within their own borders. The statement highlights the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in tackling transnational crime. Transnational crime refers to criminal activities that span across multiple countries, which can include activities such as human trafficking, drug smuggling, cybercrime, and terrorism. These types of crime require a high level of coordination and cooperation between law enforcement agencies in different countries to effectively address them. One of the obstacles mentioned in the statement is the national organization of law enforcement agencies. Each country typically has its own set of rules, regulations, and law enforcement bodies that govern and oversee crime within their respective borders. This includes the police, customs, immigration, and other similar agencies. Their main focus is on maintaining order and safety within their jurisdiction, which can often limit their ability to tackle criminal activities that involve other countries. To effectively address transnational crime, there needs to be strong cooperation and communication between the law enforcement agencies of various countries. This can occur through information sharing, joint investigations, mutual legal assistance, and other collaborative efforts. In particular, international organizations like INTERPOL or Europol can play a crucial role in coordinating efforts to tackle transnational crime. These organizations facilitate communication and cooperation between law enforcement agencies across different countries, providing essential support and resources in the fight against transnational criminals. Furthermore, addressing transnational crime requires a comprehensive approach that combines the efforts of law enforcement, justice, and other relevant sectors. This includes implementing preventive measures to reduce opportunities for criminals to exploit cross-border vulnerabilities, strengthening border control and security, and capacity building to enable countries to effectively investigate, prosecute, and dismantle transnational criminal networks. In conclusion, tackling transnational crime is a complex and challenging task for law enforcement agencies, especially due to their national organization and limited jurisdiction. Encouraging collaboration and cooperation between countries, as well as leveraging resources provided by international organizations, are necessary steps to overcome these challenges and effectively combat transnational criminal activities. This requires not only a strong commitment from governments, but also comprehensive strategies that combine preventive, operational, and legislative measures to dismantle criminal networks and ensure a safer and more secure global community."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: Does red go with brown shoes? To answer this question, it is best to analyze the color combination from the perspective of fashion and personal style preferences. Red is a bold and vibrant color that can create a strong contrast when paired with different hues. Brown, on the other hand, is an earthy, neutral color that serves as a solid base for various color combinations in clothing. In regards to whether red goes with brown shoes, the answer is generally yes. Red is considered a warm color, just like brown, and warm colors tend to complement one another. However, the appropriateness of combining red with brown shoes depends largely on the shade of red being used and the style or shade of the brown shoes. For instance, a darker shade of red like burgundy pairs well with dark or medium-brown shoes, while a bright red may look out of place. Additionally, the formality or casualness of the outfit also plays a role in determining the suitability of this color combination. Question 2: Why don't brown shoes go with grey pants? Brown shoes can be considered as versatile when it comes to pairing with various color outfits. However, grey pants may not always be the most compatible choice for brown shoes. This is primarily due to the differences in color temperature. Grey is a cooler color, while brown is warm, and combining the two can sometimes create a clash or lack of harmony. That being said, this does not mean that brown shoes and grey pants are never a suitable combination. It depends on the specific shades and tones of both components. Darker shades of grey like charcoal can work well with dark or medium-brown shoes, though lighter shades of grey may not be as compatible. The key to successfully pairing brown shoes with grey pants is to consider the individual clothing items, occasion, and overall outfit ensemble. Now, let's address whether questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing: While questions 1 and 2 are both focused on color combinations and fashion, they are not asking the same thing. The main difference between two questions is that question 1 inquires about the compatibility of red clothing with brown shoes, while question 2 explores the reasons behind the potential incompatibility of brown shoes with grey pants. Both questions address different aspects of color coordination, but they do not pose the same question or seek the same answer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He has two research proposals in front of him, case A and case B. Both are looking for further funding. Case A research has been replicated by other researchers, but case B research could not be replicated by others. He needs to decide which research should get further funding. But I can use this background: Soon after the original study was published, other researchers tried to replicate the research. However, it could not be replicated. No other studies could find a link between the vaccine and autism. As a result, scientists became convinced that the original results were incorrect. Eventually, investigators determined that the original study was a fraud. They learned that its author had received a large amount of money to find evidence that the vaccine causes autism, so he faked his research results. If other scientists had not tried to replicate the research, the truth might never have come out. You can read more about this case at the URL below. What is an answer for this question: In case A, did the scientist more likely of less likely commit a fraud than the scientist in case B? A:","completion":"In case A, where the research has been successfully replicated by other researchers, it is less likely that the scientist committed fraud compared to the scientist in case B, where the research could not be replicated. The process of replicating a study is crucial in the scientific community to ensure the validity of the findings. When a study can be replicated, it increases confidence in the original findings, suggesting that the data and methods used were accurate, reliable, and not manipulated or falsified. In case A, since the research was successfully replicated, it implies that the scientist's work was genuine and well-founded. On the other hand, in case B, the inability to replicate the study raises questions about the accuracy and integrity of the original research. While it doesn't definitively prove fraud was committed (as there may be other factors contributing to the failure to replicate), it does increase the likelihood that misconduct or manipulation could have occurred in the original study. In summary, based on the information provided, the scientist in case A is less likely to have committed fraud compared to the scientist in case B. However, replication is just one aspect of evaluating scientific credibility, and other factors should also be considered when making funding decisions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: If bee population size infleunces the bees' survival chance, then what influences the survival chances of bees? Answer choices: - population name - the environment - the flavor of their honey - population size - temperature - Temperature changing - local weather changes - the number of stripes Answer:","completion":"The survival chances of bees are influenced by a combination of factors, which include, but are not limited to, population size. Several elements have a considerable impact on the well-being and sustainability of bee populations, ensuring their successful survival and long-term thriving. Below is a detailed analysis of these factors: 1. Population Size: As mentioned in the question, population size plays a significant role in determining the survival chances of bees. A larger population ensures greater genetic diversity, which is necessary for overcoming various environmental challenges, fighting diseases, and adapting to changes in their surroundings. 2. The Environment: The quality of the environment in which bees live is crucial for their survival. This includes the availability of diverse flora for foraging, nesting sites, and a habitat that is conducive to their well-being. A degraded environment may lead to reduced food supply, loss of habitats, and increased exposure to pesticides, which negatively affect bees' health. 3. Temperature: Bees are cold-blooded insects heavily influenced by external temperatures. Numerous bee species have specific temperature tolerances, with optimal temperatures for foraging activities ranging between 55-90°F (13-32°C). Extremely cold or hot temperatures can hinder their ability to forage for nectar, reproduce, and maintain the necessary climate within their colonies. 4. Temperature Changing: Rapid fluctuations in temperature or extreme temperature changes, particularly due to climate change, can have severe repercussions for bees. Such alterations can disrupt their foraging patterns and nesting cycles, leading to colony stress as well as loss of food sources due to changing flowering times in plants. 5. Local Weather Changes: Similar to temperature, local weather events such as heavy rainfall, drought, and storms can negatively affect bees' ability to forage effectively and gain sufficient nutrients. Erratic weather patterns can lead to the destruction of nesting habitats and compromise the colony's overall health and survival. 6. Pesticides and Chemicals: Exposure to pesticides and harmful chemicals can have profound implications for the survival of bees. The presence of these substances can weaken their immune systems, disrupt their navigation abilities, impair reproduction, and even lead to direct mortality, consequently affecting the population's survival chances. 7. Diseases and Parasites: Bee populations are susceptible to various diseases and parasites, such as the Varroa mite, Nosema, and American Foulbrood. These diseases can decimate entire colonies, weaken bee populations, and reduce their resilience and survival chances against other environmental challenges. In conclusion, the survival chances of bees are influenced by a multitude of factors involving the environment, temperature, local weather changes, parasites, and exposure to chemicals. While the flavor of their honey and the number of stripes may be aspects that make bees unique, these characteristics do not directly determine their survival chances. Protecting and preserving bees hinges on reducing the impact of detrimental influences in their habitats, allowing them to thrive and maintain healthy populations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When I was a lot younger. I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live. Making my life extremely hard for no more reason than having my work stolen. If I wasn't so tough, and for a few people left who have at least some integrity, I would be dead now, like the rest of their victims.

Article: If you hear the sound of a handset beeping in a bag or pocket, you could be forgiven for thinking that someone has received a text message. But nowadays there are so many different ways of messaging someone that it could spell the death of the traditional text as we know it. Text messaging, or texting, is the art of sending a short, electronic message between two mobile phones or tablets . Users pay a certain amount to send messages via SMS--short message service. But in the last few years, messaging in this way has been on the decline . The rise of smartphones and tablets has seen an increase in the use of instant messaging apps , which take the place of traditional texts. Using wireless Internet connections, people can send limitless numbers of IMs to their friends for very little cost. Unlike traditional mobile texts, the user usually only has to pay to download the app once, after which each message they send is free. Web developers soon _ . Instant messaging apps have become popular all over the world. WhatsApp in America and Europe, WeChat in China and Kakao Talk in South Korea are but a few which have attracted hundreds of millions of people, who use the apps to chat to their friends in real time. These apps allow people to send picture messages for free--something which previously was quite costly. Research company Informa said that almost 19 billion messages were sent per day using chat apps in 2012, compared with 17. 6 billion SMS texts. And it expects the chat app market to grow t0 50 billion per day by 2014. So does this really mean the end for communication by text? Pamela Clark--Dickson from Informa doesn't think so. She says that there are a large number of people who use normal mobile phones, particularly in developing countries, who prefer the SMS messaging tool. There is an awfully big base of mobile phone users who are still going to find that SMS is the best messaging experience for them for a while. ,. Question: What can we learn from the last paragragh?

Review: This is not your usual Anne Perry, which is not an endorsement but more of a warning. From almost the very beginning of the story the author browbeats you with the one clue that if you know anything about flowers you will know who did the crime and how. There is very little suspense and no character development and by the end you couldn't care less if the beautiful (an adjective repeated constantly) Countess Zorah Rostova did the crime or not.Referencing the audio version, the narrator does an admirable job with the narration and the male voices but he wasn't very good when it came to portraying the female characters lending a, if not intended, comedic slant to the book. Answer: A:","completion":"The tone of the product review provided is predominantly negative. Several aspects contribute to this negative tone. 1. The title \\"Oh my, please save me\\" indicates that the reviewer is exasperated and looking for relief, which suggests a negative experience with the product. 2. The phrase \\"not an endorsement but more of a warning\\" further establishes that the reviewer did not enjoy this Anne Perry book and wants to caution potential readers. 3. The reviewer's criticism of the novel's plot, specifically the lack of suspense and character development, highlights their dissatisfaction with the story's construction. The statement \\"by the end you couldn't care less if…the Countess Zorah Rostova did the crime or not\\" implies that they found the book unengaging and tedious. 4. The repetitive use of the adjective \\"beautiful\\" to describe a character is criticized, suggesting an overemphasis on this trait at the expense of substantial character development. 5. While the reviewer acknowledged that the narrator of the audio version did an \\"admirable job\\" with the narration and male voices, they pointed out that the portrayal of female characters was lacking, leading to unintentional comedy rather than drama. Overall, these criticisms come together to create a significantly negative tone in the product review, indicating that the reader had an unfavorable experience with the book and would not recommend it to others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question given this paragraph: A whole molecule may also have a separation of charge, depending on its molecular structure and the polarity of each of its bonds. If such a charge separation exists, the molecule is said to be a polar molecule (or dipole); otherwise the molecule is said to be nonpolar. The dipole moment measures the extent of net charge separation in the molecule as a whole. We determine the dipole moment by adding the bond moments in three-dimensional space, taking into account the molecular structure. For diatomic molecules, there is only one bond, so its bond dipole moment determines the molecular polarity. Homonuclear diatomic molecules such as Br2 and N2 have no difference in electronegativity, so their dipole moment is zero. For heteronuclear molecules such as CO, there is a small dipole moment. For HF, there is a larger dipole moment because there is a larger difference in electronegativity. When a molecule contains more than one bond, the geometry must be taken into account. If the bonds in a molecule are arranged such that their bond moments cancel (vector sum equals zero), then the molecule is nonpolar. This is the situation in CO2 (Figure 7.27). Each of the bonds is polar, but the molecule as a whole is nonpolar. From the Lewis structure, and using VSEPR theory, we determine that the CO2 molecule is linear with polar C=O bonds on opposite sides of the carbon atom. The bond moments cancel because they are pointed in opposite directions. In the case of the water molecule (Figure 7.27), the Lewis structure again shows that there are two bonds to a central atom, and the electronegativity difference again shows that each of these bonds has a nonzero bond moment. In this case, however,. Q: Why do homonuclear diatomic molecules have zero dipole moment? Choices: - no electrical attraction - no activation energy - at homeostasis - no difference in electronegativity A: Answer:","completion":"Homonuclear diatomic molecules have zero dipole moment because there is no difference in electronegativity. In order to understand why homonuclear diatomic molecules have zero dipole moment, it is essential to know the concepts of molecular polarity and dipole moments. A polar molecule is a molecule that has a separation of charge, meaning that one end of the molecule has a slightly positive charge while the other end has a slightly negative charge. This separation of charge occurs when there is a difference in the electronegativity of the atoms forming a bond. Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond. In a homonuclear diatomic molecule, both atoms are of the same element and thus have the same electronegativity. This means that the electrons in the bond between the two atoms are equally shared, and there is no separation of charge. Consequently, the molecule does not have a dipole moment. In contrast, heteronuclear diatomic molecules like CO and HF have atoms with different electronegativities. In these molecules, the more electronegative atom pulls the electrons in the bond closer to itself, creating a charge separation and resulting in a nonzero dipole moment. In summary, homonuclear diatomic molecules have zero dipole moment because of the absence of any difference in electronegativity between the bonded atoms. Since both atoms attract the bonding electrons with the same strength, there is no net separation of charge, making the molecule nonpolar and resulting in a zero dipole moment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: College Loans by States Face Fresh Scrutiny A recent state audit of the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, a quasi-government corporation, found that it too had paid millions of dollars in bonuses, perks and severance packages to top executives. “They did not act like a state agency at all,” said Susan Montee, the Missouri state auditor. “They really had the mindset that they were a for-profit business.” In a response to the audit, the authority’s chief executive, Raymond H. Bayer Jr., said the lender had new board members and senior managers “strongly rededicated to accountability, efficiency and transparency at all levels of the organization.” Keith New, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania authority, said the company had adopted new policies on compensation and spending. But Chuck Ardo, a spokesman for Pennsylvania’s governor, Edward G. Rendell, said he was reserving judgment. “Unless they show him that students are their first priority, then he thinks that they need to be privatized,” Mr. Ardo said. State-affiliated student loan corporations came into existence when low-cost student loans were not widely available. Some guaranteed loans before the federally guaranteed student loan program was created in 1966. Others bought loans from banks, enabling them to lend more. Over the years these agencies evolved dramatically. They became so lucrative that a rash of them were acquired by private companies. Roughly 30 remain. Kathleen Smith, president of the Education Finance Council, which represents nonprofit and state-affiliated loan companies, said that the lenders performed a vital function and that the conduct of only a very few had drawn scrutiny. But in Pennsylvania, Missouri and Iowa, state officials have been asking whether the agencies have forgotten their purpose. State Senator Michael Connolly, a Democrat, said of Iowa Student Loan, “If they’re going to act like an aggressive profit-making corporation and pay their C.E.O. a quarter of a million dollars a year and pay their board members 1,000 a meeting, then maybe we should cut them loose.” The chief executive of Iowa Student Loan, Steve McCullough, strongly defended the corporation and said it had helped students go to college as federal and state aid stagnated. He has pledged to make the corporation more transparent by giving the state an annual report and formally opening board meetings to the public. He attributes debt burdens to rising tuition and relatively low family incomes in Iowa. “Iowa Student Loan does not control the factors that cause the need for students to borrow,” Mr. McCullough said. Part of what has drawn attention to Iowa Student Loan is its dominance. At Iowa State, more than 90 percent of students who take out private loans borrow from Iowa Student Loan; at the University of Northern Iowa, about 80 percent do. Originally set up to purchase loans made by banks, Iowa Student Loan in 1987 began to offer consolidation loans, which allow students to combine loans and simplify repayment. In 1992 Iowa authorized the corporation to work with a state agency to offer “Iowa Partnership Loans,” private loans not backed by the federal government. The sector is fast-growing and largely unregulated, and was the focus of recent state and federal investigations that turned up perks and rewards paid to college financial aid officers and universities to promote certain loan companies. Iowa Student Loan’s efforts echo such practices. The Des Moines Register, after a legal battle, obtained internal corporation e-mail messages dating back to 2003 through the state’s public disclosure law showing the lender’s zest for growth. The newspaper separately documented how the corporation had arrangements with colleges and universities to assume some of the costs of assisting students in taking out its private loans — an effort that appeared to pay off. For years, Iowa State University routinely included the corporation’s private loans in students’ financial aid packages although they are generally the most expensive way to pay for an education. State officials say that other Iowa colleges followed the same practice. Private loan volume has grown more than tenfold nationwide in the past decade, but in Iowa the increase is more than five times greater, according to the Iowa College Student Aid Commission, an agency that oversees the federal loan program in the state. Mr. McCullough said that statistic exaggerated growth because the company’s private loan program started out very small. Students who appeared at a legislative hearing this fall said they thought that the private loan was the only or the best option available. “The financial aid office never talked about anyone but Iowa Student Loan,” Taleen Brady, a senior at Iowa State, said in an interview after testifying. She took out a 5,000 loan, paying a 9 percent origination fee for her first year of college. The next year, after talking to the director of the university’s financial counseling clinic — which is outside the financial aid office — she switched lenders and got a loan with a much lower fee. Looking back, Ms. Brady was blunt in her assessment of the financial aid office. “It was very deceptive.” Roberta L. Johnson, director of financial aid at Iowa State, said she had ended the practice of including private loans in financial aid awards shortly after she took over in 2003. She said, “Since we changed it, we have seen our student debt levels start to drop slightly.” The average debt of student borrowers graduating in Iowa in 2006 was 23,680, compared with a national average that year of 18,918, according to Robert Shireman, executive director of the Project on Student Debt, a nonprofit organization financed largely by the Pew Charitable Trusts. Mr. McCullough said that the reimbursements to colleges did not cover all the costs of handling the Iowa Partnership loans and that the lender offered the payments because although the loan program was authorized by statute and required counseling and other services to students, the state provided no financing. “We are certain that the marketing of the Iowa Partnership loan program in no way influenced students or parents to increase their borrowing,” Mr. McCullough said. He said the company stopped making the payments this year. Iowa did not just authorize Iowa Student Loan to go into the private loan business, it cut its risk. The Iowa College Student Aid Commission for years bought defaulted private loans from the corporation. Mr. McCullough said the state proposed the arrangement to try to make money, by paying a small fraction of face value for the loans and then trying to collect. But a report by the Iowa College Student Aid Commission in November said the agency did not expect to recoup 6.2 million it had spent to buy the loans. The commission no longer buys such loans. Iowa Student Loan’s board members are appointed by the governor. Gov. Chet Culver, who took office in January, is waiting for the state attorney general to report on Iowa Student Loan’s structure before making appointments. The state’s auditor has recommended the removal of some board members because they also hold state regulatory positions, posing a conflict of interest.

One butler scurrys in to say, Your daughter is in a fit of raging madness Ossi, in the other room, has destroyed the room by throwing everything onto the floor. Mister Quaker oddly jogs through the house to see Ossi on the other side of the mansion. When Mister Quaker peeps in, Ossi throws newspapers at him. He asks, Why are you throwing those newspapers? and the brat replies with, Because all of the vases are broken. Ossi is clearly angered, and in a big mess. She shows her father a newspaper that says the Shoe cream kings daughter has married to a count. This is what Ossi is upset about. Mister Quaker is not impressed but tells Ossi that he will buy her a prince. With this, Ossi cant contain herself, jumps up, and hugs her dad ever so enthusiastically. She is so happy, she could smash the house with joy! We then meet Seligson, the matchmaker, who is dealing with a woman with a turned up nose. She complains about the price and how all of the bachelors have imperfections. She then leaves unsatisfied. As she exits, Ossi enters the room smiling and hands the matchmaker a note from Mister Quaker.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1881, Edgar Rice Burroughs attends the funeral of his uncle, John Carter, a former American Civil War Confederate Army captain, who died suddenly. The body is put in a tomb unlockable only from the inside. The attorney executing the will hands Burroughs Carter's journal, which he reads, hoping to find clues about Carter's death and the reason he is the willed heir. The bulk of the film enacts what Burroughs reads. While prospecting in the Arizona Territory in 1868, just after the Civil War, Carter is arrested by Union Colonel Powell, who seeks his help in fighting the Apache and insists that Carter owes it to his country. Carter refuses, stating that any debt was paid when he lost his family. Carter escapes from his cell but is pursued by Powell and his cavalry. After encountering a band of Apaches, Carter and the wounded Powell take refuge in a cave, which turns out to be the object of Carter's earlier search: the \\"Spider Cave of Gold\\". A mysterious priestly being, a Thern, appears in the cave at that moment, and surprised by Carter's presence, immediately attacks him with a knife; Carter kills him but accidentally activates the Thern's powerful medallion, and is unwittingly transported to the ruined and dying planet of Barsoom, later revealed to be Mars. Due to Barsoom's low gravity and his own relatively high bone density, Carter is able to perform incredible jumps and feats of strength. He is captured by the Tharks, a clan of four-armed Green Martians led by their \\"Jeddak\\" (chieftain), Tars Tarkas. Tars instructs Sola to watch over Carter, leading to her feeding him a liquid that enables him to understand the Martians' language.

Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on.

The additional nectar they collect would be stored in the hive, where worker bees would process it into honey. However, it is essential to consider other factors that could potentially impact honey production. These include the available nectar from flower sources, the specific species of bees, environmental conditions, and the overall health of the bee colony. Furthermore, consuming more food in the form of nectar could also result in an increase in the production of beeswax. In turn, this could lead to the expansion and strengthening of the hive's structure. In summary, the hypothetical scenario of bees consuming more food may increase honey production. However, one must also take into account the many other interconnected factors that influence both honey production and overall hive health."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But now he can ' t wait to visit the barber's - for two reasons: losing his two - foot - long golden hair will mean that strangers stop mistaking him for a girl; the hair will be donated to charity to provide a wig for a child with cancer. Mrs. Edney, who works in a restaurant, says, \\"Elijah has always had beautiful hair, so I let him grow it as he w8nted. It' s like silk. But now it is at a stage where people mistake him for a girl and he wants it cut into a boy's haircut. \\" Mrs. Edney and her husband want to collect enough money-PS350-to process Elijah's hair for a sick child. She says, \\"I couldn't bear to see all Elijah's beautiful hair go to waste and my mum mentioned charities that have human hair made into wigs. \\" Mrs. Edney says, \\"If we can raise the amount we want, it will mean a family will not have to pay for the wig and can receive it for free. When you've got children yourself, you hope that if they lost their hair someone would do the same for them by donating their hair. \\" The two-foot-long hair will be donated to the Little Princess Trust to make a wig for children suffering cancer. Elijah keeps telling people he is giving his hair to poor princesses and he is so excited about it. A spokesman for the Little Princess Trust says, \\"We're very grateful to anyone who decides to have their hair cut to donate it to the Little Princess Trust. As a result of hair donations like this, the charity receives real-hair wigs for free to pass on to families whose children have sadly lost their own hair through cancer treatment. \\" Why has Mrs. Edney let Elijah's hair grow so long? A) Because Elijah has beautiful hair. B) Because she likes long hair. C) Because Elijah looks nice with long hair. D) Because she wants to donate his hair to charity. Answer:","completion":"A) Because Elijah has beautiful hair. Justification: In the provided text, Mrs. Edney says, \\"Elijah has always had beautiful hair, so I let him grow it as he wanted.\\" This indicates that she allowed Elijah's hair to grow so long because she thought it was beautiful. Option D \\"She wants to donate his hair to charity\\" cannot be chosen as the reason because the decision to donate the hair came after it has already grown long and not as the reason for letting it grow."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Heavy metal music and WWE blend perfectly. That was never more true than for Triple H and the band Motorhead. Triple H loves Motorhead and was especially fond of the band's frontman, Lemmy Kilmister, who died Monday at 70, mere days after receiving a cancer diagnosis. Triple H likes the band's music so much, in fact, that when it came time for entrance/walkout music, nothing quite seemed to sound right. He wanted the music to sound like Motorhead, and after near misses, he asked WWE composer Jim Johnston to see if the band would allow him to use their music. A marriage was made and Triple H continues to walk out to \\"The Game.\\" Here's Triple H speaking about his music choice, and the band actually playing live for him at WrestleMania 21. Summary:","completion":"Sure, kiddo! So there's a man named Triple H who is a big star in WWE, which is a show where very strong men pretend to fight.

Sadly, Lemmy got really sick and passed away. This made Triple H very sad. But, Triple H wanted to keep loving Motorhead's music, so when he enters the WWE stage, instead of normal entrance music like other fighters, he chose a song from Motorhead called \\"The Game\\" and he walks out to it!

Here are possible answers to this question: - floral arrangement - girl's hair - box - car - typewriter I believe the correct choice is \\"floral arrangement\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"While all of the choices mentioned can have a ribbon tied around them, the most common and popular option among these is definitely a \\"box\\" containing a present. Ribbons are frequently used to create an appealing and visually attractive appearance for gift boxes, adding a touch of elegance and charm that is often associated with the act of gift-giving. Here's why the choice of a \\"box\\" is more accurate than the other options provided: 1. Gift boxes: The primary purpose of tying a ribbon around a present is to elevate the aesthetics of the gift, making it look more appealing and exciting for the recipient. Ribbons are versatile and can be used to create various styles of bows, knots, and wraps that can easily signify that the box contains a special and thoughtful gift. 2. Floral arrangements: While it is true that ribbons are often used in floral arrangements, they generally serve as an accessory or a complementary decoration rather than being the main focus of the gift. In most cases, the flowers themselves represent the actual present, with the ribbon accentuating the bouquet's beauty but not being the primary element. 3. Girl's hair: Ribbons can, of course, be used as hair accessories for girls, but in the context of tying a ribbon around a present, this choice is not relevant. Ribbons in hair may be used for aesthetic or practical purposes, such as holding the hair in place or adorning a particular hairstyle, but it is not typically associated with gift-giving. 4. Car: Tying a ribbon around a car is a less common practice and is often reserved for very special and rare occasions, such as gifting a car for a major birthday, graduation, or other significant events. While it is possible to tie a ribbon around a car as a present, the frequency and prevalence of this practice are considerably lower compared to using ribbons for gift boxes. 5. Typewriter: Similar to the car option, a ribbon tied around a typewriter is an unusual and rare choice in terms of gift presentation. While it might be a suitable decoration for a vintage or collectible typewriter, it is not a common practice typically associated with gift-giving. In conclusion, the most accurate choice for what people usually tie a ribbon around as a present is a \\"box.\\" Gift boxes with ribbons signify thoughtfulness, care and are often associated with the joy of gift-giving, creating a delightful experience for both the giver and the recipient. The other options provided, while possible, do not represent the common and popular practice of using ribbons in the context of gift-giving."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Unknown Illness Kills Nine Chinese Farmers\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Controversial Infection: The Unknown Illness That Killed Nine Chinese Farmers In what presents a gripping narrative of the fragility of life and the unanticipated predicament of medical anomalies, an unknown illness has recently affected a community of Chinese farmers, claiming nine lives. This incident, as startling as it is tragic, brings into stark relief the loopholes in global public health systems and our readiness to handle unforeseen medical emergencies. These nine farmers, native to the same Chinese region, were plagued by similar symptoms that ravaged their bodies, leading to their untimely demise. The strange and yet to be named disease began to manifest in the victims through high fever, a confusing and somewhat chilling subset of unknown respiratory complications, and an unshakeable malaise. Despite the best efforts of local doctors, the farmers' health plummeted rapidly, pointing to the severe and much-debated nature of this unknown illness. As it stands, standard diagnostic tests have proved inconclusive and unable to identify the pathogenic agent or agents involved. The incident, predominantly isolated to the agricultural community, has generated different viewpoints among experts. While some believe the illness might be caused by a new strain of a known virus or bacteria, others speculate a zoonotic disease, an illness directly transmitted from animals to humans, given the victims' close contact with livestock and produce. Nonetheless, the Chinese Health Authorities are working intently, sharing information with international health organizations to solve this medical puzzle. This unfolding situation is eerily reminiscent of the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, originating from the same country, which started as a mysterious virus before engulfing the world. It emphasizes the urgent need for thorough research, crisis management, and preventive measures when dealing with such unknown diseases. The government and health authorities in China are indeed no stranger to efficiently handling such health crises. The stringent protocols and measures they put in place during the COVID-19 outbreak helped to control the spread of the disease in the country relatively quickly. However, this recent, unknown illness raises novel challenges as the country's disease surveillance and public health agencies struggle to identify and contain its spread. For rural Chinese residents, particularly those working as farmers, this incident serves as a grim reminder of health risks posed by their profession and ecosystem, pushing them to demand better health and safety regulations. Though the incident has thus far remained within the confines of rural China, it carries potentially significant implications for global health security. In an interconnected world, any unchecked health crisis, unbounded by geographical limits, could quickly become a global concern. As such, the entire international community needs to harness scientific cooperation and solidarity to support the Chinese medical community's efforts to solve this mystery. This unfortunate incident also underscores the importance of global health as a shared responsibility. It accentuates the need to prioritize healthcare investment and reinforce public health systems and protocols to more quickly identify, manage, and prevent such unusual illnesses. Unknown or mysterious diseases, like the one that killed the nine Chinese farmers, while adding to the challenges faced by existing healthcare systems, also reignite the conversation regarding healthcare evolution. They spur us towards advancements in medical technologies, pushing healthcare professionals, researchers, and societies to adopt new practices, procedures, and strategies that push us forward towards more proactiveness and preventive measures. As we pause to mourn the tragic loss of the nine Chinese farmers, it becomes crucial to use this incident as an opportunity for global health organizations and governments to reflect, learn, and bolster our preparedness for future health crises. While we hope for immediate answers and solutions, it is apparent that the complex task of identifying and controlling the unknown illness will require time, extensive research, and international cooperation. They say patience is a virtue, but in this case, it could also be the key to saving countless lives. Let this unfortunate incident serve as a reminder that we must remain vigilant, agile, and unified in our response to global health threats. Let it be a wake-up call that strengthens our dedication to ongoing research, fosters deeper global cooperation, and enhances our collective health security."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Robert was watching the local news when he saw a report about a wildfire. The report stated that there was a brush fire in the southwest part of Texas, where it was currently daytime. When he switched the channel, he saw another report about a different wildfire. This one was a forest fire in the northwest part of Seattle, where it was currently nighttime. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which wildfire, the one in Texas or the one in Seattle, will have higher intensity? Hint: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The wildfire in Texas will have a higher intensity. This is because the intensity of wildfires increases during daytime hours due to factors such as lower humidity, increased temperatures, increased wind speeds, and sunlight warming the ground. The Texas wildfire is occurring during daytime, while the Seattle wildfire is happening during nighttime, when the intensity of wildfires tends to decrease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So when did people start dying?” he began in this afternoon’s tweetstorm. “At what point do you recognize that what they are doing is a political agenda couched in the nice language of journalism?” “They say all these people died in the storm in Puerto Rico, yet 70% of the power was out before the storm.

Can you imagine if I said that…story of the year! @IngrahamAngle — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2018 As Trump loses his mind on , Hurricane Florence rescue efforts continue in the Carolinas. As of time of writing, five deaths in North Carolina are being attributed to Florence. A mother and her baby died when a tree fell on their house around 9:30 AM local time Friday. The father was pulled alive from the home and taken to a local hospital with serious injuries. A 78 year-old man died while trying to plug in a generator, reportedly connecting two extension cords outside in the rain. And a 77 year-old man died Friday morning when he was blown over in severe wind while taking care of his dogs. Trump’s Hurricane Maria mania has been going on for days. He first boasted of the “incredible unsung success” the administration achieved handling last year’s hurricane in Puerto Rico, when a reporter asked, this past September 11, if there were lessons learned from that storm as he commemorated the 17th anniversary of the terrorist attack that killed 3K in NYC, Virginia and Pennsylvania. Trump shot back that the Hurricane Maria response was an “unsung success.” Researchers, if not Trump, have blamed Maria and aftermath for nearly 3K deaths that followed in Puerto Rico. Breaking from presidential tradition, Trump has spent the days that followed high-five-ing himself for his administration’s response to the hurricane that slammed Puerto Rico last season, though, he says, he was hampered hampered by San Juan Mayor Carmon Yulin Cruz, and the whole “island” thing. We got A Pluses for our recent hurricane work in Texas and Florida (and did an unappreciated great job in Puerto Rico, even though an inaccessible island with very poor electricity and a totally incompetent Mayor of San Juan).

Boxwood miniatures seemed to have served three original functions: aids to private devotion, luxury objects of status, and novel playthings. Later they became precious family heirlooms passed from generation to generation, but as medieval art fell out of fashion in the early modern period, their provenance was often lost. The earliest record of a collection is the 1598 inventory of the dukes of Bavaria, which contain several boxwood miniatures.Of the surviving works, over one hundred re-emerged in the 19th century Parisian antiquarian market, then the leading market for medieval art. During this period, they were acquired by collectors such as the British collector Richard Wallace (1818–1890), who purchased Count van Nieuwerkerke's (1811–1892) entire collection, including two boxwood prayer nuts, the Vienna-born collector of objets d'art Frédéric Spitzer (1815−1890), and Ferdinand de Rothschild (1839–1898). Spitzer was not a purist and commissioned metalsmiths to produce modern versions, or copies, of a variety of medieval artworks. Today, there are four surviving boxwood carvings he had augmented for the market.When the American financier J. P. Morgan purchased Baron Albert Oppenheim's collection in 1906, he acquired four boxwood miniatures, including a triptych with the Crucifixion and Resurrection, and a prayer nut showing the Carrying of the Cross, all of which are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

The answer is:","completion":"The last step of the process is generating electricity and transmitting it to the power grid for distribution to consumers. After the turbines spin due to the force of steam, they are mechanically connected to an electric generator. The spinning motion of the turbines is converted into electrical energy by the generator through the principle of electromagnetic induction. In the generator, a rotating magnetic field is created by the spinning of turbines, which induces an electric current in the stationary coils of copper wire (known as stator windings) that are wrapped around the generator's interior. The flow of electrons through the copper wires generates electricity. This alternating current (AC) is generated at a specific voltage and frequency determined by the design and operational parameters of the power plant. After electricity is produced, it must be stepped-up in voltage using a transformer to efficiently transmit it over long distances through power lines. High voltage transmission minimizes the losses incurred due to resistance in the electrical cables. Once the electricity reaches its destination, it is stepped-down to a lower voltage using another transformer, making it suitable for local distribution and safe for residential, industrial, and commercial use. In summary, the last step of the process involves converting the mechanical energy of the spinning turbines into electrical energy, which is then transmitted to the power grid and distributed to consumers for various applications and purposes.

Article: Yang and Wu styles of tai chi are probably the most popular forms of tai chi. The Wu style is a variant of the Yang style. In addition, they're the most commonly practiced forms of tai chi worldwide. These styles use wide slow flowing movements which make them the best styles for beginners. Yang and Wu styles are also great for helping those overcome tension or stress in their lives. Both use meditation as part of the practice Because both Yang and Wu styles are so popular, the majority of classes, DVDS and videos will incorporate these two styles of tai chi most frequently. This is a more active form of tai chi and may not be for everyone. It doesn't necessarily fall into the slow, gentle flowing movements of some tai chi practices. The Chen style of tai chi uses some explosive and fast moves - like jump kicks. This may be out of the fitness range of some people. If you're already fairly fit or athletically inclined (or looking for a more exciting form of tai chi) consider the Chen style. The Chen style uses wide, expansive movements that can be hard on the knees and lower back. Be careful when performing this style. Tai chi is an easy type of exercise to do. However, it's very different from any other more traditional forms of activity. It's important to meet with a trained teacher, if possible, so you know how to do tai chi correctly. A tai chi teacher will be able to guide you during a class or individual session. They can teach you how to breath and use your breathing to promote calmness. A good way to find a decent teacher is by talking to that teacher's students but also speaking to the teacher yourself. Ask about the classes, the personality of the teacher, and how the classes are conducted. Although it's important to learn correct form and how to maximize the benefits of tai chi, if you cannot afford to take a tai chi class or cannot find one, you have very little risk of injury or other adverse effects by doing this exercises yourself. Since tai chi isn't a overly popular form of exercise, you might have some difficulty finding a local teacher or class. However, tai chi is easy enough that you can do it in your own home. There are many tai chi videos and DVDs that you can purchase so you can perform this exercise in the privacy of your own home. When purchasing your DVD decide whether or not you should be purchasing one for beginners, pregnant women, older adults or those with special health problems. Many tai chi practices are designed for a very specific condition. There are also many tai chi videos online. You can download many videos or go to websites for live streaming. This may be a good option if you don't want to settle only one DVD. Many forms of exercise require specialty equipment or clothing. Tai chi doesn't require specialty clothing, however tai chi teachers do recommend the following: Wear clothing that allows you to comfortably flow through the series of movements. Do not wear restrictive clothing that feels tight or prohibits a full range of motion. Yoga pants, running shorts and other more traditional exercise clothing is permitted. Wear comfortable, flat bottomed shoes or go barefoot. Whatever works for you. Avoid wearing jewelry or watches as they may interfere with some of the movements done with partners. Once you've gotten into a routine of doing tai chi or have found that you enjoy this practice, set yourself up for doing at least 20 minutes of practice per session. It's typically recommended to do at least 20 minutes of practice as it is believed that this allows your blood to flow through your entire body in this time period. This is an essential part of tai chi practice. It is also believed that it takes 20 minutes for your body to be fully warmed up and have increased blood flow to all your muscles. It is thought that this is responsible for the \\"good or happy feelings\\" many practitioners experience at the end of a tai chi workout. Like any new exercise routine, it can take a few tries to get the moves and routine down. Be patient with yourself as you experience and try out this new alternative form of exercise. Although tai chi isn't considered a difficult or high-intensity physical activity, it is something very different from most traditional forms of exercise. Be patient with yourself as you grow and learn in your practice. In addition, it may take time for you to get the breathing down and be able to quietly meditate as you move through the movements. This also takes time and practice. It's recommended to set a regular time each day to practice so you become more proficient in this relaxing form of exercise.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the sentiment of the following review? Holy CRAP was this place packed today!! It's gotten astronomically popular since it arrived in this location about two or three years ago, and despite being a decent-sized establishment, if you arrive dead on at midday you're in for at least a five to ten min wait unless you're lucky. Just like I wrote in my review of Vogue Bistro, I felt like I wasn't dressed appropriately, although this time it was because while I was wearing brown camo cargo pants and a grey t-shirt, seemingly everyone else there - both typical patrons and servers alike - were dressed like they were starring in a Wiggles on-stage production. I'm a big fan of the Chicken Tikka Masala, which I've been ordering ever since it was an experiment listed on a sheet of A4 paper attached to the main menu; it's now a regular item. I also get the caramelized cauliflower with tahini which is utterly delicious. I'm NOT a big fan of cheap, sh1tty tattoos though, and I saw a whole stack of those too. Today was more or less a day like any other. Met the wife here, sat down, were promptly served our food. I went for the lavosh shawarma wrap instead of my usual since I'm trying to cut down on carbs (a very slight cutdown.. whatever!) but did get the cauliflower too. The cauli was different today. For a start, they brought it out on a full-sized plate, whereas it's normally served on a side-item-sized plate. Was fine with me as the wife usually shares it. While the lavosh wrap was absolutely delicious as I remember it being, the tahini sauce that went along with the cauli was weirdly sweet. Like it had sugar or syrup mixed in with it. Usually it's a more tan color and savoury, but this time it was more on the amber/orange side. When the server passed by I asked him whether the recipe had officially changed - he said no, and that they might have overdone one of the ingredients in the kitchen, but he definitely noticed the difference in color too. I said I was asking because I wouldn't order it again if it tasted the same, but I'm a big fan of the usual sauce. He said he'd check with the kitchen. Not more than a couple of minutes later he comes back carrying a giant dessert plate with a slice of duo-tone baklava on it, covered in giant sultanas (aka golden raisins, I believe) and dusted in cinnamon powder by way of compensation. Jesus on a pogo stick. Chevy Chase could have tobogganed down a snowy hill on the bastard. It was delicious - I shouldn't have eaten it but I did. Even the wife, who isn't a big fan of baklava, took a couple of bites and proclaimed that it was the best baklava she had ever had. Very nice of them to do this, especially being so busy. Double-size side item plate and a comped dessert for two - you folk in Liberia are sure missing out! Definitely coming back (I would have anyway, I had no major problem with the meal). I thoroughly recommend this place, it's a great all-round location if you want reasonably healthy macrobiotic stuff in a funky kind of atmosphere, long as you don't mind some of the saddest tattoos you'll probably ever see. They thoroughly deserve their high rating and a Yelp ambassador should consider giving them one of those \\"People love us on Yelp!\\" stickers that are inexplicably given to other places such as Mr Goodcents. Although, if you want proper fresh Greek, Greek Wraps just up the road trumps them. I'd rock up there for a chicken kabob wrap on their freshly baked pita any day of the week. And no, owner of Chicago Gyros, they didn't pay me to say that. BTW, Greek Wraps did a giant renovation around Christmas last year, the place is almost literally three times bigger. Now if only Haji Baba's would renovate that rancid cesspit they call a restroom..","completion":"This review talks about a very popular restaurant where the person enjoys eating Chicken Tikka Masala and caramelized cauliflower with tahini.

How to spray paint furniture Choose the spray paint you will use. Make sure it is the right spray paint for the type of furniture you are trying to paint. You can purchase special spray paint for outdoor furniture.","completion":"Step 1: Prepare the workspace To spray paint furniture, it is important to set up a well-ventilated workspace, preferably outdoors or in a well-ventilated garage. Lay down a drop cloth or tarp to protect the floor from paint overspray. Make sure the area is free of dust and debris that could mix with the paint while spraying. Step 2: Clean the furniture Before spray painting, clean the furniture thoroughly with a mild detergent and water to remove dirt, grease, and any existing paint chips. This will ensure the paint adheres properly to the surface. Allow the furniture to dry completely before proceeding to the next step. Step 3: Remove any hardware from the furniture Take off any knobs, handles, hinges or other hardware from the furniture. By doing this, you ensure that these parts won't get any paint on them and can be reattached later with ease. Step 4: Sand the furniture pieces Lightly sand the entire piece of furniture using a medium-grit sandpaper to create a smooth surface. This will help the spray paint adhere better to the surface. Wipe off the dust with a damp cloth and let it dry before proceeding to the next step. Step 5: Apply a primer (if necessary) If the furniture is made of a dark or porous material, apply an appropriate primer before spray painting. This will reduce the number of paint coats needed and ensure even coverage. Allow the primer to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. Step 6: Shake the spray paint can Shake the spray paint can for at least 1-2 minutes until you can hear the ball(s) inside the can moving freely. This ensures that the paint is properly mixed and ready to use. Step 7: Test the spray paint Before applying the paint on the furniture, test the spray paint on a piece of cardboard or scrap material to ensure the color and nozzle are working well. Step 8: Apply the spray paint Hold the spray paint can about 10-12 inches away from the furniture and apply the paint using a sweeping motion to create even coverage. Apply multiple thin coats, allowing each coat to dry for a few minutes before applying the next. This will help prevent drips and provide a more uniform finish. Step 9: Allow the paint to dry Let the spray paint dry for the recommended time according to the manufacturer's instructions. This typically ranges from a few hours to overnight. Step 10: Reattach hardware and enjoy Once the paint is dry, reattach any hardware that was removed, and your furniture is ready to use. Enjoy your newly spray-painted furniture and the refreshed look it brings to your space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

To begin with, the statement \\"Emperor Harsha of Kannauj succeeded in reuniting northern India during his reign in the 7th century, after the collapse of the Gupta dynasty.\\" only tells about one specific event occurred during the 7th century. It doesn't represent the overall historical changes from the 5th to the 13th centuries. Moreover, the main question \\"What declined from the 5th to 13th centuries?\\" includes a broad and long span of time and expects explanation on what went into decline or dropped significantly during these centuries. It might be a society, culture, a dynasty, economy, etc. Looking into the statement, the only identifiable decline is the \\"collapse of the Gupta dynasty\\", which happened before the 7th century when Emperor Harsha reunited northern India. However, this doesn't provide enough context about what happened from the 5th century to the 13th century. It leaves out the changes in the 5th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries.

This would cause the battery to drain without the engine running to recharge it. Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. The owner was sitting in the car with the engine off. 2. During that time, the owner was listening to the radio, which consumes electrical power. 3. The car engine was not running, so the alternator was not generating electricity to recharge the battery. 4. As a result, the battery drained its stored energy to power the radio. 5. The battery's stored energy had become too low, which rendered it unable to provide the required power to start the engine when the owner tried to start the car.

If your guinea pig has a respiratory infection, he may have trouble breathing. Sounds of troubled breathing include wheezing and clicking noises.","completion":"Additionally, observe your guinea pig's behavior and posture, as these can also indicate potential respiratory issues. A sick guinea pig may appear lethargic, hunched over, or show signs of discomfort when attempting to breathe. Pay close attention to any discharge from the nose or eyes, as this could signify an infection. Rapid, shallow breathing or open mouth breathing could also indicate respiratory distress. Another sign to watch out for is a decrease in appetite or weight loss, which can be a consequence of strain caused by the respiratory problem. Regularly monitoring your guinea pig's activity level, cage cleanliness, and overall health can help you identify any respiratory issues early on, ensuring you can provide prompt and proper treatment for your beloved pet.

Given the question: Information: - Chronology (from Latin \\"chronologia\\", from Ancient Greek , \\"chrónos\\", \\"time\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time. Consider, for example, the use of a timeline or sequence of events. It is also \\"the determination of the actual temporal sequence of past events\\". - Diffuse reflection is the reflection of light from a surface such that an incident ray is reflected at many angles rather than at just one angle as in the case of specular reflection. An illuminated \\"ideal\\" diffuse reflecting surface will have equal luminance from all directions which lie in the half-space adjacent to the surface (Lambertian reflectance). - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Ice is water frozen into a solid state. Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color. - Snow pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when it precipitates from clouds and accumulates on surfaces, then metamorphoses in place, and ultimately melts, slides or sublimates away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts, seasonally, and causes runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater. - Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz). - The hexagonal snowflake , a crystalline formation of ice , has intrigued people throughout history . This is a chronology of interest and research into snowflakes . Artists , philosophers , and scientists have wondered at their shape , recorded them by hand or in photographs , and attempted to recreate hexagonal snowflakes . - A spectrum (plural \\"spectra\\" or \\"spectrums\\") is a condition that is not limited to a specific set of values but can vary, without steps, across a continuum. The word was first used scientifically in optics to describe the rainbow of colors in visible light after passing through a prism. As scientific understanding of light advanced, it came to apply to the entire electromagnetic spectrum. - A snowflake is either a single ice crystal or an aggregation of ice crystals which falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a dust particle in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete in crystal form. Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small crystal facets. - Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future. Time is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - A timeline is a way of displaying a list of events in chronological order, sometimes described as a project artifact. It is typically a graphic design showing a long bar labelled with dates alongside itself and usually events - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. What entity does 'timeline of snowflake research' has the relation 'instance of' with?

UPDATED:. 15:23 EST, 18 February 2014. Victims of the payment protection insurance pay-outs scandal are more likely to have spent their compensation on holidays or a new car than squirrelled the money away into savings, research suggests. Nearly one quarter (24 per cent) of people who have had a PPI payout said they put the money towards a holiday, a survey for the website VoucherCodesPro.co.uk found. On average, successful claimants said they had received £2,810 - but those who spent the money said it took just two and-a-half weeks typically before all the cash was gone. According to recent figures, Lloyds' PPI costs now total a potential £9.825bn. For all banks the bill is approaching £20bn. Nearly one quarter of people who have had a PPI payout said they put the money towards a holiday. One fifth (22 per cent) of those who had received compensation said they had used the cash to buy a new vehicle and a similar proportion (19 per cent) bought a home appliance. Only around one in seven (13 per cent) people who received compensation put the money they had received into savings, while 17 per cent used it to pay off household bills. One in 10 (10 per cent) splashed out on new clothes and one in 20 (5 per cent) compensation recipients treated themselves to new shoes. PPI, which will cover a borrower’s loan repayments if they stop being able to earn money for some reason, is the biggest scandal that the financial ombudsman has ever seen. The ombudsman still gets around around 6,000 new PPI complaints a week from consumers who have been unable to come to an agreement with a financial firm. The ombudsman still gets around around 6,000 new PPI complaints a week from consumers. The insurance was often added on to loans or credit cards without people realising. Some people were given the 'hard sell' or found such policies were unsuitable for their circumstances. According to figures from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) a total of £13.3 billion has been paid out in PPI compensation since January 2011. VoucherCodesPro.co.uk surveyed more than 2,000 people from across the UK who had purchased PPI at some point, of which nearly one quarter (22 per cent) said they had received compensation arising from a mis-sold PPI claim. Those who received compensation were allowed to select more than one answer when asked what they had spent the money on. PPI was designed to protect borrowers' payments. If the borrower lost their job, had to take maternity leave or suffered from loss of income that they could not make repayments the insurance would have protected them to cover the costs until the policyholder is able to again. The misselling of PPI grew into the biggest financial scandal in the UK within the past five years and has cost banks millions of pounds. Action wasn't taken until 2005 when the Financial Service Authority (FSA) took over regulation of the general isurance market. Citizens Advice also issued a complaint to the Office of Fair Trading. That complaint included evidence of:. Excessively high prices.Only partial protection, with many exclusions which prevent many seemingly reasonable claims.Mis-selling, including high pressures sales tactics.A slow and often unfair claims process when consumers were eligible to claim. In January 2009, a year after the OFT handed its investigation over to them, the Competition Commission recommended that sales of PPI be banned alongside lending products such as credit cards and loans. In August 2010, the FSA published its PPI consultation paper which recommended that banks who had engaged in mis-selling should compensate all the customers who had been sold products using the same methods. The British Banking Association (BBA), a trade body for all UK banks, appealed against the FSA rules by seeking a judicial review to have them annulled or curtailed. By May 2010, 30 per cent of all cases coming in to the Financial Ombudsman Service concerned PPI.","completion":"A recent study conducted by VoucherCodesPro.co.uk found that victims of the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal were more likely to have spent their compensation on luxuries such as holidays or a new car than savings. Out of the respondents, 24% reported using the compensation for a holiday and 22% for a new vehicle. In comparison, only 13% put the money into savings, while 17% used it to pay off household bills. The average claimant received £2,810 in compensation, which was typically spent within two and-a-half weeks. The PPI scandal is the biggest the financial ombudsman has ever seen, costing banks billions and resulting in multiple regulatory actions and complaints, including some from Citizens Advice and the Office of Fair Trading."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Write a summary based on this article: Wednesday morning, we published a piece in which David Chase told writer Martha P. Nochimson that Tony Soprano had survived the series finale of The Sopranos. The finale, which ended with a famous cut to black that left Tony in a state of suspended animation, had been famously picked apart by theorists who insisted the character was dead and others who said he lived and still others who said, hey, maybe it didn't matter. It was, by far, the biggest open question in TV history. Now, through his publicist, Chase has said: A journalist for Vox misconstrued what David Chase said in their interview. To simply quote David as saying,\\" Tony Soprano is not dead,\\" is inaccurate. There is a much larger context for that statement and as such, it is not true. As David Chase has said numerous times on the record, \\"Whether Tony Soprano is alive or dead is not the point.\\" To continue to search for this answer is fruitless. The final scene of The Sopranos raises a spiritual question that has no right or wrong answer. This is something of a classic non-denial denial. Chase is not contesting that he said Tony isn't dead. He is contesting a broader, and unmentioned, context (and, indeed, Chase has tiptoed up to the edge of the line of providing a definitive answer as to the final scene numerous times before, before retreating as quickly as possible). It would not be the first time a source went a bit further than they meant to on the record. Nor would it be the first time Chase has answered a question about one of the central ambiguities of the series in frustration, just because he's sick of being asked about it. But Chase is right that it is the context the quote is in that matters here. And the context Nochimson puts Chase's quote in is almost identical to what Chase's publicist says. Says Chase's publicist: \\"As David Chase has said numerous times on the record, ‘Whether Tony Soprano is alive or dead is not the point.' To continue to search for this answer is fruitless. The final scene of The Sopranos raises a spiritual question that has no right or wrong answer.\\" And writes Nochimson: \\"Though you wouldn't know it from watching Hollywood movies, endings are by nature mysterious. There is the instability of loss in an ending as well as the satisfying sense of completion. American television before Chase, with the exception of David Lynch's Twin Peaks, one of Chase's avowed key inspirations for the art of The Sopranos, built a craft that dispenses with the destabilizing aspects of an ending. The true art of closure will not tolerate such a boring decision. Moreover, the art of closure forbids merely telling the audience in words that there is loss, since words can create the illusion of safety and control. Chase's art seeks a silent level of knowing more profound than words. He believes we already know if we open up to that deeper part of us.\\" The entire point of Nochimson's essay is that even though Chase answered her query about Tony's death, it doesn't matter. If the fictional character of Tony Soprano lives or dies is not the point, because The Sopranos itself is no more. Somewhere, the characters live on, even if Tony is not among their number. But we don't get to see what they're up to. The story, of course, has been boiled down — even by us — to the one sentence where Chase finally answers Nochimson point blank, despite the presence of an entire piece discussing Chase's background, his influences, and our lack of comfort with ambiguity in storytelling. This makes sense, because we're in the news business, and what's newsworthy here is Chase appearing to confirm something many have long suspected. But even if Chase had never issued a statement, or even if he had issued a statement saying, \\"I meant every word!\\" it would not have quelled the debate about The Sopranos' finale. Nor should it have. The thing about the endings of TV series is that many of us watch them with a sort of anticipation that they will \\"answer\\" the question of whether we were right to spend years and years watching the show. The thing is, however, they almost never do. Viewers go into the finale of Lost expecting a series of answers to their queries about a mysterious Island and end up, instead, with a metaphysical rumination on life and death. Or they go into the finale of The Shield expecting a blazing gun battle and, instead, get a muted goodbye. Or they go into the finale of Breaking Bad and get more closure than a famously messy show usually provided. All of these finales disappointed at least some viewers, who found themselves lost in the ideal of an ending they would never get, one they perhaps couldn't even imagine the contours of but, instead, could sort of sense on their peripheral vision. The Sopranos bucked against that trend by refusing to end. And it's driven many of us nuts over the years, whether we just wondered if our cable went out after that famous cut to black or got involved in lengthy arguments on internet forums about the meaning of Chase's camera angles. By leaving Tony in that state of suspended animation, The Sopranos forever left us with him. Is it any wonder viewers tried to construct an ending they were denied? I would argue that's entirely not the point, and that's what Nochimson argues in her article as well. I fully believe that she's reported accurately what she and Chase discussed (and, selfishly, I loved the idea of a definitive answer, even if it only were present to allow people to discuss all of the other things the series did brilliantly). But nothing is proved by a one-word answer to a complicated question; instead, it only opens more questions. To suggest otherwise is to wipe our hands of all of the unsettling questions that final scene suggests, just as much as the insistence by many \\"Tony's dead!\\" proponents that anyone who disagreed was willfully misreading the series does. To suggest otherwise is not just to pretend that we can understand The Sopranos on some definitive level but that there must be a tidy answer for everything in life, no matter how banal. And I like to think we all know that's not true. That's part of what David Chase taught us. ||||| Reports of Tony Soprano's non-death are apparently premature: David Chase, creator of \\"The Sopranos,\\" has released a statement debunking a very long and very difficult-to-decipher piece that appeared Wednesday on Vox.com, which reported that Chase had finally confirmed that Tony — in fact — did live after the screen went blank on June 10, 2007, when 13 million (or so) viewers kicked their sets or called up their cable service to complain. No need to go into details here — they are not interesting, trust me — but the Vox story got a blast of Internet love Wednesday because Chase had apparently sort of said that Tony did live, and not die. While the relevance of an answer to this question has long escaped me, it still, so to speak, lives in the minds of many who for some reason just want to know.

In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question. You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Frank Vega (Danny Trejo) is a decorated Vietnam War veteran who had led a difficult life. His old girlfriend married someone else and had two kids while he was fighting for his country, he is unable to get a job anywhere, and ended up making a living selling hot dogs for most of his life until a hot dog van took away his customers. Frank spent much of the rest of his life as a drifter, until one day, he becomes famous on the internet when he beats up two abusive skinheads on a bus, is given the nickname \\"Bad Ass,\\" and is celebrated by everybody around him; people make T-shirts and graffiti with his face on it, police give him ride-alongs and he ends up on talk shows.Three months later, Frank's mother, Juanita (Tonita Castro) passes away, leaving him her house and dog. Frank's best friend, Klondike Washington (Harrison Page), moves in with Frank and entrusts him with a USB flash drive for his late mother's safe deposit box. Klondike goes out one night for cigarettes and is murdered in a dark alley by two thugs, leaving Frank heartbroken. Frank meets a boy named Martin (John Duffy), who lives next door to Frank with his mother, Amber Lamps (Joyful Drake), and abusive father, Martin Sr. (Chris Spencer). Officer Malark (Patrick Fabian) assures Frank that the police department are working on finding the men who killed Klondike, but after watching the news and learning that the police solved a different murder in a faster time span, Frank realizes that the police are doing little to nothing about Klondike's murder.Frank decides to solve the mystery himself, and investigates the alley where Klondike was shot. He finds a spent bullet casing and a pendant with a woman's picture in it. Frank takes them both to a pawn shop where the shopkeeper (Duane Whitaker) tells him it belongs to a man named Terence (Erik Betts), whose wife's picture is in the pendant. After returning the pendant to Terence's wife, he asks where Terence is, and she tells him that he is playing basketball with some friends. After Frank beats up some of Terence's friends, they tell him that a man named Renaldo might know where Terence is. Frank goes to Renaldo's apartment and meets his roommate, who tells Frank that Renaldo is at a bar across town. After beating up some of the bar patrons who try to throw him out, Frank finds Renaldo and extracts the information that Terence is hanging out with his girlfriend. Frank finds her working at a massage parlor but she is uncooperative, so he follows her after her shift. After breaking into her house, he finds Terence and tortures him for information about his boss (who ordered Klondike's murder) by sticking Terence's hand in the kitchen's garbage disposal. Terence reveals that Klondike was killed by a drug lord named Panther (Charles S. Dutton) for the flash drive he had been given earlier, which contains details of a secret project to dig oil wells in the neighborhood on behalf of Mayor Williams (Ron Perlman).Before confronting Panther, Frank saves Amber and Martin from their abusive husband/father and ends up becoming their neighborhood friend. Amber invites Frank over for a home-cooked meal, and Frank gets all dressed up for it. At dinner, Frank asks Amber if he can have a matchbook of hers as a memento, and she gives it to him. They are about to kiss when Martin, Jr. walks in on them, so they do not. Frank insists that Amber and Martin stay at his place until he can repair her front door.The next day, Frank gives the flash drive to Officer Malark and tracks down Panther at his hideout. But he is knocked unconscious, captured, and then tortured for information about the location of the flash drive by being hooked up to an electrocution device. He is shocked multiple times, like he was in Vietnam, but Frank still refuses to surrender the flash drive. Panther takes Frank's wallet, learns Frank's address and believes Frank is hiding not only the flash drive but a loved one there as well, due to Frank's insistence that there is nothing to find. Panther leaves his men to continue torturing Frank, but Frank breaks free from his restraints and throws a lit matchbook (the one he got from Amber) at some oil drums stored in the room, setting the building on fire and causing explosions. Panther escapes but Frank gives chase. They both steal buses and duel, damaging many other vehicles during their chase, and ultimately demolish both buses. While chasing Panther again on foot, Frank comes across the two skinheads he beat up on the bus earlier. The skinheads try to undo their previous humiliation at Frank's hands by using their cell phone to record themselves beating up Frank, but Frank overpowers them again and resumes his chase. Panther arrives at Frank's house, finds Amber, and threatens to kill her for the flash drive, but Frank arrives in time to intervene. Their fight spills out into the front yard, and just as Panther is about to go after Frank again, Amber jumps on his back and slows him down enough for Frank to get up and beat Panther senseless.Panther is arrested, as is Mayor Williams when his connection to Panther's scandal is revealed on the news. Frank, Amber and Martin all live happily ever after., Question: Where is Renaldo?","completion":"Renaldo is at a bar across town."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia. A former magazine journalist has penned a book about her double life as a high-class escort and a mother. It is believed Samantha X, who will appear on Channel Seven's Sunday Night to talk candidly about her profession to spruik her novel, Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort, is Amanda Goff. Ms Goff has worked at InStyle, Prevention and New Idea magazines. The 40-year-old is a mother-of-two by day and a sex worker by night. High-class escort Samantha X was identified as former magazine journalist Amanda Goff. Ms Goff (pictured here three years ago) used to work at InStyle, Prevention and New Idea magazines but is now a private escort. 'When I look back on how I juggled the two lives, I am astounded,' Ms Goff tells Sunday Night reporter James Thomas. Despite the stigma surrounding the profession, the escort said friends and peers had been very supportive of her transition into the industry in 2012. A former colleague of Ms Goff told Daily Mail Australia they were not surprised to learn of the woman's double life. 'I'm not shocked at all - she's always been a bit close to the edge. She follows her own rules. 'And I'm not surprised she's going on TV and saying it's her - I think she's always secretly wanted to be famous,' the colleague said. 'I think she's always wanted a life that's bigger than what she had. To be famous and rich. And using something to catapult her into the limelight. 'She's always been very bold and goes for what she wants. She's very single-minded. I always thought she used her looks and her boldness to get what she wants.' The 40-year-old is a mother-of-two and started escorting in 2012, two days after she visited a brothel. Ms Goff (left and pictured right in the front row, far right) said most of the parents at her children's school know what she does for a living and are supportive. She will appear on the Channel Seven program in an exclusive interview on Sunday night. Ms Goff told the program she volunteered at the tuckshop of her children's school and most of the parents there knew what she did for a living. 'Do you think your profession defines you as a parent?' she said. 'I don’t think that because you’re a neurosurgeon you’re necessarily a good parent. 'I don’t think that if you are a criminal, you’re a bad parent.' Ms Goff started her career at an exclusive brothel in Sydney and 18 months later she moved into private escorting as Samantha X. 'When I look back on how I juggled the two lives, I am astounded,' Ms Goff tells Sunday Night reporter James Thomas (pictured) Goff charges 800 an hour or 5,000 a night for her services, and said she can teach married couples a thing or two. The mother has penned a book about her double life called Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort. She charges 800 an hour for her services or 5,000 for an entire night. But Ms Goff reassures people that it is not as glamorous as it seems: 'You'd think for 12 hours we'd be having sex all night, but that is so far from the truth.' After her time sleeping with married men who pay her more than three times the average weekly salary, she thinks she knows the secret to a happy marriage. Ms Goff said listening was key as many men complained they were not being heard to by their spouse. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A former magazine journalist, Amanda Goff, has written a book about her double life as a high-class escort and a mother.

This house Would Lift the Ban on Ivory Trading What argument could one make about this debate topic?","completion":"Imagine a big elephant with beautiful, long, white tusks. Those tusks are made of a special material called ivory. Some people like to use ivory to make pretty things like statues or jewelry. For a long time, many elephants were hurt or killed because people wanted their ivory. This made a lot of people very sad. So, some important people decided that buying and selling ivory should not be allowed. This is called a \\"ban\\" on ivory trading. They thought this would help save the elephants. However, now there's a big debate about whether the ban should be lifted, which means allowing people to buy and sell ivory again. One argument for lifting the ban is that it would help countries with lots of elephants make money. That money could be used to protect the elephants and their homes. Some people also say that lifting the ban would make it easier to control how much ivory is used, and that could be better for the elephants. But, other people worry that if the ban is lifted, more elephants will be killed because people will want their ivory. They think the ban helps to keep the elephants safe. That's why people have different opinions about whether or not to lift the ban on ivory trading."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Photos were taken by wildlife photographer Margot Raggett who was on safari at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. The lion that looked worse off was in reality the victor in the battle - and he immediately moved his lioness away. Article:","completion":"Title: A Tale of Victory and Love: The Triumphant Lion's Battle for His Lioness at Ol Pejeta Conservancy Introduction The animal kingdom is full of astonishing events and captivating displays of survival instincts, territorial dominance, and the relentless pursuit of companionship. One recent remarkable occurrence took place at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, where a lion emerged bloodied but triumphant after fighting off a rival to win back his lioness. The compelling photographs capturing this raw, emotional encounter were taken by renowned wildlife photographer Margot Raggett, offering an incredible insight into the fierce, passionate nature of lions and the intensity of the battles they face to protect what is dear to them. The Battle for Lioness Love and Loyalty It is a common occurrence in the wild for lions to engage in fierce fights to establish dominance and secure the right to mate with a lioness. In this case, the lioness had made an attempt to stray, perhaps lured by the prospect of uniting with another dominant male. The sight of his partner attempting to leave incited the lion's instincts to fiercely defend his territory and stake his claim on her loyalty. The intense and ferocious battle that ensued between the two lions was indicative of the power and tenacity these creatures possess when fighting for what they perceive as rightfully theirs. Both lions engaged in a relentless struggle as they clawed, roared, and bared their teeth in an endeavor to assert their dominance and win the prize that was the right to the lioness. A Bloodied Victor and His Protective Pursuit While both lions sustained injuries during the battle, it was the original lion who emerged battered, bloodied, but as the ultimate victor. Contrary to the appearance of his injuries, he proved stronger and more resilient than his rival, securing his place as the dominant male within the pride. Immediately following his triumph, this resilient lion wasted no time in whisking his lioness away from the scene of the epic clash. This purposeful and protective action suggests that he understood the significance of his victory, as well as the constant potential threats that could arise. Relocating his lioness was more than an endeavor to protect her from immediate danger, but also a symbol of his strength, devotion, and unwavering commitment to their union. Margot Raggett's Captivating Photographic Record Wildlife photographer Margot Raggett's astonishing photographs offer a unique glimpse into the intimate, brutal, and inherently instinctual world of lions in their natural habitat. The images capture the raw emotion, physical power, and sheer determination of these creatures as they engage in battles that quite literally determine their place within the social hierarchy and their ability to continue their bloodline. The photographs not only encapsulate the lion's victory, but also demonstrate the sublime beauty of the animal kingdom and the striking intensity of its inhabitants. Raggett's work is a testament to the undeniable power that photography has to reveal the hidden world of our planet's wildlife and the incredible resilience of its inhabitants. Conclusion The events captured by Raggett's photographs at Ol Pejeta Conservancy serve as a remarkable illustration of both the animal kingdom's stunning beauty and the harrowing challenges faced by its inhabitants. A lion's victorious battle to protect his lioness is a testament to the animal's enduring resilience and instinctual drive to mate, dominate, and survive within the wild. Through this captivating account, we are reminded of the astonishing complexity of nature and the enthralling narratives that unfold in its heart every single day."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 1: Understand the premise The premise states: \\"From here you can climb to the top of the Basantapur Tower and look down on the rooftops of Old Kathmandu.\\" This tells us that there is a vantage point (Basantapur Tower) from where one can have a panoramic view of Old Kathmandu. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis is \\"Old Kathmandu used to be a marketplace where people traded their grown foods to each other.\\" This statement is about the past and implies that Old Kathmandu had a marketplace for exchanging agricultural products.

The premise provides information about the location and view of Old Kathmandu from Basantapur Tower, while the hypothesis discusses the historical significance and purpose of Old Kathmandu.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: It's not easy being a teenager---nor is it easy being the parent of a teenager. You can make your child feel angry, hurt, or misunderstood by what you say without realizing it yourself. It is important to give your child the space he needs to grow while gently letting him know that you'll still be there for him when he needs you. Expect a lot from your child, just not everything. Except for health and safety problems, such as drug use or careless driving; consider everything else open to discussion. If your child is unwilling to discuss something, don't insist he tell you what's on his mind. The more you insist, the more likely that he'll refuse to talk. Instead, let him attempt to solve things by himself. At the same time, remind him that you're always there for him should he seek advice or help. Show respect for your teenager's privacy . Never read him his mail or listen in on personal conversions. Teach your teenager that the family phone is for the whole family. If your child talks on the family's telephone for too long, tell him he can talk for 15 minutes, but then he must stay off the phone for at least an equal period of time. This not only frees up the line so that other family members can make and receive calls, but teaches your teenager moderation . Or if you are open to the idea, allow your teenager his own phone that he pays for with his own pocket money or a part-time job. Question: Why is it not easy being a teenager or a parent of a teenager? Options: A: Because the teenager is very naughty. B: Because the parent always expects a lot from the child. C: Because you can make your child feel hurt, or misunderstood by what you say without realizing it yourself. D: Because the teenager wants his or her own space.

Tammy and Rob rode a tandem bike down the hill. They hit a large rock and fell. Tammy wound up in the hospital and was diagnosed with a serious brain injury. Rob suffered only a mild concussion. Which person was less exposed to external mechanical force? Hint: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Rob was less exposed to external mechanical force. Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. Both Tammy and Rob fell during the accident, which implies that they were both exposed to some degree of external mechanical force. 2. Tammy suffered a serious brain injury, which, according to the hint, typically occurs when an external mechanical force causes a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, or as a result of an object penetrating the skull. This suggests that Tammy experienced a significant amount of force during the incident. 3. Rob only had a mild concussion, which, in comparison to Tammy's serious brain injury, suggests that the external mechanical force impacting Rob's head or body was less severe. 4. Based on the severity of their respective injuries, it can be deduced that Rob was less exposed to external mechanical force than Tammy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Balch Creek begins in the Forest Park neighborhood in unincorporated Multnomah County near the intersection of Northwest Skyline Boulevard and Northwest Thompson Road at the crest of the West Hills. It flows generally east about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) to its confluence with the Willamette River, a major tributary of the Columbia River. The creek drops from 1,116 feet (340 m) above sea level at its source to 46 feet (14 m) at its mouth, a total of 1,070 feet (330 m). Most of this occurs in the first 2.5 miles (4.0 km). In the hills, the stream gradient (slope) generally ranges from 15 to 30 percent interspersed with sections of less than 15 percent along the middle reaches.From its source, the creek runs east on private property near Forest Park, a large municipal park in Portland, before turning briefly south about 3 miles (5 km) from the mouth. Soon thereafter, the stream receives an unnamed tributary on the right bank and turns southeast on private property along Northwest Cornell Road. It enters the city and the Audubon Society of Portland simultaneously about 2 miles (3 km) from the mouth, receives two more unnamed tributaries on the right, and flows northeast, entering the part of Forest Park known as Macleay Park.For about 0.25 miles (0.40 km) the creek parallels Wildwood Trail, the main hiking trail in Forest Park, until reaching a former public restroom known as the Stone House.

News article: Endoscope Maker Olympus Agrees To 646 Million Settlement Over Kickbacks Enlarge this image toggle caption Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty Images Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty Images Medical device maker Olympus Corp., already under federal investigation for its role in superbug outbreaks, has agreed to pay 646 million to resolve criminal and civil probes into illegal kickbacks and bribes to doctors and hospitals. Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that the company's settlement is the largest ever for violations of the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute. A portion of the company's payout, 22.8 million, will resolve similar bribery allegations in Latin America. U.S. investigators said the Tokyo-based company's \\"greed-fueled kickback scheme\\" from 2006 to 2011 used research grants, consulting deals, luxury trips, gifts of hot-air ballooning and spa treatments and free equipment to induce influential doctors to order more Olympus devices at prominent hospitals and help the company keep out competitors. The devices included gastrointestinal scopes, which have been tied to deadly outbreaks of drug-resistant bacteria. In one case, according to the federal criminal complaint, senior Olympus executives agreed to pay for three doctors to spend a week in Japan \\"as a quid pro quo\\" for a prominent California institution to switch from a competitor's products to Olympus. After the trip, one of the doctors thanked Olympus for \\"providing so much extra entertainment that we did not expect,\\" according to the government's complaint. Prosecutors declined to name any medical centers or doctors in their complaint. In other instance, Olympus gave a doctor 400,000 worth of free endoscopes and other supplies for his private practice from 2006 to 2010, prosecutors said. Olympus believed this doctor could persuade a \\"leading New York medical center\\" to spend millions of dollars on devices, according to the government complaint. This strategy appeared to pay off for Olympus. Prosecutors alleged that after a key doctor for a Midwest hospital system took a week-long trip to Japan and received a company grant, an Olympus vice president wrote an internal email in 2006 that said, \\"We have received all of the orders expected and have kept [a competitor] completely out of the [hospital] system. Hooray!\\" As part of the settlement, Olympus agreed to a corporate-integrity agreement and the appointment of an independent monitor, Larry Mackey, a former prosecutor in the Oklahoma City bombing cases. \\"Olympus leadership acknowledges the company's responsibility for the past conduct, which does not represent the values of Olympus or its employees,\\" Nacho Abia, chief executive of the Olympus Corp. of the Americas unit in Center Valley, Pa., said in a statement. \\"Olympus is committed to complying with all laws and regulations and to adhering to our own rigorous code of conduct.\\" As a result of the kickbacks, Olympus generated more than 600 million in sales and reaped gross profits of 230 million, officials said. Olympus is the leading manufacturer of gastrointestinal scopes worldwide, and it boasts an 85 percent share of the U.S. market. \\"Kickbacks are illegal because they taint buying decisions,\\" said Paul Fishman, U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, which spearheaded the investigation. \\"Doctors and hospitals should decide to purchase medical devices based solely on legitimate considerations, like quality and price. They shouldn't be tempted and swayed by free trips, free equipment, consulting agreements or research grant money.\\" Prosecutors credited the help of the former chief compliance officer at Olympus, John Slowik, who filed a whistleblower case against the company under seal in 2010. In his whistleblower complaint, unsealed Tuesday after the government's announcement, he said he was fired by Olympus for trying to end improper practices. Slowik now stands to receive about 50 million from the settlement, in accordance with federal whistleblower law, prosecutors said. Patrick Burns, acting president of the Taxpayers Against Fraud Education Fund, praised Slowik, saying he exposed illegal actions that wasted money and threatened patient safety. \\"This is exactly why we need whistleblowers — because companies cannot be relied upon to put patients before profits,\\" Burns said. Olympus was \\"funding a massive kickback scheme that channeled millions of dollars in payola to doctors and hospitals.\\" Well before Tuesday's announcement, Olympus was under fire for failing to alert U.S. regulators and hospitals sooner about the risks of infection from its duodenoscopes, a gastrointestinal scope that has proven difficult to clean of dangerous bacteria because of its intricate design. A Senate investigation released in January identified 19 scope-related outbreaks at U.S. medical centers from 2012 to 2015 that sickened nearly 200 patients with drug-resistant infections. Thirteen of those outbreaks were associated with Olympus scopes. Olympus announced in January it would recall its duodenoscopes nationwide and make repairs to better protect patients. Last year, the company disclosed it had received a subpoena from federal prosecutors seeking \\"information relating to duodenoscopes.\\" In the kickback case, federal officials said Olympus used a grants committee staffed by sales and marketing executives to dole out millions of dollars to key hospital and physician customers. In 2007, Fishman said an Olympus vice president recommended a research grant of 100,000 to a hospital's foundation. \\"Why? Because that hospital was their '#1 account in the US' and they had, and I'm quoting, 'no intention of losing it' to a competitor,\\" Fishman said Tuesday. Although prosecutors didn't identify institutions, the whistleblower's complaint did mention some physicians and hospitals by name. For instance, it recounted an October 2009 meeting between top Olympus executives and a prominent doctor at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine, about the possibility of a company grant. After the meeting, an Olympus executive in Japan emailed a counterpart in the U.S. about his opinion on the USC grant in light of \\"future business expansion (any future sales potential?),\\" according to the whistleblower's complaint. A spokeswoman for USC said she couldn't immediately comment late Tuesday. Olympus reported a general payment of 64,013 to USC's Keck Hospital in 2014 for \\"in-kind items and services,\\" according to federal data on industry contributions to doctors and teaching hospitals. Overall, for 2014, Olympus issued 5.25 million in general and research-related payments to physicians and hospitals, the federal database shows. Slowik, the whistleblower, said the company ran a \\"sham physician consultant program\\" that paid some doctors more than 100,000 annually. Prosecutors said Olympus paid one doctor 112,300 for consulting from 2006 to 2011 in order to influence the purchasing decisions of a \\"leading Southeastern medical institution.\\" The company also used \\"permanent loans\\" or \\"medical loaner scopes\\" to improperly give hospitals free equipment, inducing them to buy more products, according to federal investigators. \\"This practice enabled Olympus America to acquire monopoly power in certain segments of the medical business, ultimately resulting in customers paying inflated prices,\\" according to Slowik's amended complaint. This story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. March 1, 2016, 9:15 PM GMT / Updated March 1, 2016, 9:15 PM GMT By Tracy Connor A corporate whistleblower is set to collect 51 million — his share of a massive settlement with Olympus America to resolve charges it gave doctors and hospitals kickbacks to order its medical equipment. John Slowik worked for the imaging giant for 20 years and served as its compliance officer before he was let go in 2010, according to court papers. In a qui tam whistleblower suit, he alleged that the company ignored his efforts to stop it from giving financial rewards to hospitals and physicians for buying Olympus endoscopes, which are used to examine the digestive tract. Doctors and hospital officials got lavish junkets, fancy meals, research grants and free equipment, prosecutors and Slowik alleged. In one case, three doctors got a trip to Japan after their hospital ditched another supplier and switched to Olympus, prosecutors said. Slowik, who declined to be interviewed, claimed in court papers that when he took steps to stop the kickbacks, he was bounced from his compliance job and subjected to \\"systematic harassment\\" that made him physically ill. Under the False Claim Acts, whistleblowers who file suit on behalf of the federal government showing that taxpayers are being ripped off are entitled to a percentage of the money recovered. In the settlement announced Tuesday, Olympus will pay 310 million to settle civil claims by the federal government and state, and Slowik gets 51 million — one of the largest whistleblower awards in history. Olympus also agreed to pay 312 million in criminal penalties to avoid prosecution. The total settlement is the largest amount ever paid by a medical device company and the largest for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute, which covers medical purchases paid for by federal health care programs like Medicare. A spokesman for Olympus said he could not comment on Slowik's suit but noted that it cooperated with a Justice Department probe that began in 2011. “Olympus leadership acknowledges the Company’s responsibility for the past conduct, which does not represent the values of Olympus or its employees,\\" the company said in a statement. \\"Olympus is committed to complying with all laws and regulations and to adhering to our own rigorous Code of Conduct which guides our business processes, decisions and behavior. The Company has implemented and will continue to enhance its robust compliance program.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Olympus, a company that makes medical devices, agreed to pay 646 million to fix a problem they had when they were giving illegal money and special treats to doctors and hospitals. They did this to make doctors and hospitals choose to buy and use their medical devices over those from other companies. Olympus gave things like free trips, expensive gifts and even free equipment to doctors and hospitals, so they would keep buying from them. This is not allowed because doctors and hospitals should choose to buy medical equipment because it is good and not too expensive, not because they get special gifts from the company. A person who used to work for Olympus told the government about these wrong things that Olympus did. This person will now get 50 million from the money Olympus has to pay, because he helped the government find out about their bad actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I joined a club recently where I met a true Indian. I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared?

Given the question: Process: - Acid rain makes waters acidic - Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil - The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc - Fish and their eggs die - Frogs and plants die - Insects and other wildlife die - The ecosystem is out of balance, causing further problems - Question: suppose the diaphragm is defective happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","completion":"A: more If the diaphragm, which plays a significant role in regulating water levels in various aquatic environments, becomes defective, it can exacerbate the damage caused by acid rain in several ways. 1. Increased vulnerability to acidic water: A defective diaphragm can lead to the uneven distribution or unregulated flow of water in lakes, streams, and other water bodies. This can result in an increased susceptibility of these aquatic environments to acid rain, as they may not have the same ability to dilute or neutralize acidic precipitation. 2. Decreased capacity for natural recovery processes: A healthy diaphragm helps in maintaining proper water levels, which in turn aids in preserving aquatic ecosystems. However, if the diaphragm is defective, it can interrupt these natural recovery processes, making it difficult for the ecosystem to recover from the effects of acid rain. 3. Aggravated aluminum absorption: As mentioned in the process, acid rain causes water bodies to absorb aluminum from the soil. A defective diaphragm can lead to an increased absorption of this harmful element, causing further damage to aquatic life, including fish, frogs, plants, and insects. 4. Compromised biological diversity: A defective diaphragm can result in the loss of certain species or imbalances in ecosystem dynamics, which can lead to a domino effect on the food chain. The loss of certain species can make the food web more vulnerable to the harmful effects of acid rain, which can ultimately result in a decline in overall biodiversity. 5. Amplification of environmental threats: In addition to acid rain, a defective diaphragm can compound the effects of other environmental issues, such as pollution, erosion, and climate change. This can make it even more challenging for ecosystems to cope with and recover from the harmful effects of acid rain. In conclusion, a defective diaphragm can contribute to more damage by acid rain. It can increase the vulnerability of aquatic environments to acidic precipitation, interfere with natural recovery processes, lead to the absorption of more aluminum, compromise biological diversity, and amplify the effects of other environmental threats. As a result, it is essential to monitor and maintain the health of diaphragms to protect aquatic ecosystems from the harmful impacts of acid rain and other environmental issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: What years had rebellions in the 1760s?","completion":"Title: Rebellions of the 1760s: A Deep Dive into the Unrest That Gripped the Decade Introduction The decade of the 1760s was marked by political instability and social unrest in various regions across the globe. Various factors, such as economic difficulties, discontent with authority, and struggles for independence, fueled these uprisings. This article seeks to outline and explore some of the most significant rebellions that took place during the 1760s. Step 1: Research historical events and their context In order to provide an accurate and comprehensive account of the various rebellions that occurred in the 1760s, extensive research was conducted to gather data on specific events, their causes, and outcomes. This information helps to paint a broader picture of the historical events that influenced the decade. Step 2: Verify the credibility and reliability of sources While researching, it was important to verify the credibility and reliability of the sources being used. This ensures that the information provided is accurate and dependable, contributing to a well-written and informative article. Step 3: Organize the findings Based on the research conducted, some of the most significant rebellions that took place in the 1760s were identified. These rebellions were organized chronologically, to give a better understanding of how each unfolded and its impact on subsequent events. Rebellions of the 1760s: 1. The Pugachev Rebellion (1762-1775): Although this rebellion technically began in 1762 and lasted well beyond the 1760s, its complexity and impact on Russian society cannot be ignored. Led by Yemelyan Pugachev, this uprising initially targeted imperial Russian rule and bureaucracy but later evolved into a broader social conflict. The rebellion was eventually crushed by government forces in 1775, but not before causing significant upheaval in the region. 2. Pontiac's Rebellion (1763-1766): This conflict, which took place in the North American Great Lakes region, was a response to British policies after their victory in the French and Indian War. Native American tribes, led by Pontiac, a chief of the Odawa tribe, resisted British expansion into their territories. Brutal skirmishes took place between 1763 and 1766, resulting in thousands of death. The rebellion ultimately ended through diplomacy, with the British agreeing to modify their policies. 3. The Stamp Act Crisis (1765-1766): The Stamp Act Crisis involved widespread protests against the British government's implementation of the Stamp Act in the thirteen American colonies. The act imposed direct taxation on printed materials, leading colonists to demand greater political representation and self-governance. Although the Stamp Act was repealed in 1766 due to economic pressures, the crisis marked an important step towards the American Revolution in 1775. 4. The Maranhão Rebellion (1768-1769): This relatively lesser-known rebellion occurred in colonial Brazil, where a group of local elites plotted to overthrow the Portuguese government. The group, known as \\"Os Beckman,\\" sought to establish political autonomy for the region. However, the rebellion was swiftly crushed by the Portuguese authorities, and its leaders were executed. 5. The Wilkes Riots (1768): Occurring in London, the Wilkes Riots were the result of public outrage when radical politician John Wilkes was arrested and imprisoned for libel. Although Wilkes would ultimately be released from prison, the riots themselves served as a precursor to other uprisings in the British Isles. Conclusion The 1760s was a period rife with rebellions and unrest across the globe. From the battles for independence in the Americas to the fight against imperialism in Europe, these uprisings were fueled by economic, political, and social struggles. While not every rebellion was successful in achieving its goals, each played a significant role in shaping the trajectory of history. Today, these events remind us of the power of collective action and the importance of understanding the complex forces that drive human societies toward change."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Article: After the setback at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon took more than six weeks in planning and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt at crossing the Danube. From 30 June to the early days of July, the French recrossed the Danube in strength, with more than 180,000 troops marching across the Marchfeld towards the Austrians. Charles received the French with 150,000 of his own men. In the ensuing Battle of Wagram, which also lasted two days, Napoleon commanded his forces in what was the largest battle of his career up until then. Neither side made much progress on 5 July, but the 6th produced a definitive outcome. Both sides launched major assaults on their flanks. Austrian attacks against the French left wing looked dangerous initially, but they were all beaten back. Meanwhile, a steady French attack against the Austrian left wing eventually compromised the entire position for Charles. Napoleon finished off the battle with a concentrated central thrust that punctured a hole in the Austrian army and forced Charles to retreat. Austrian losses were very heavy, reaching well over 40,000 casualties. The French were too exhausted to pursue the Austrians immediately, but Napoleon eventually caught up with Charles at Znaim and the latter signed an armistice on 12 July.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","completion":"To evaluate the linguistic integrity of the given sentence - \\"John disappeared\\" - we must consider several aspects of language, including grammatical correctness, clarity of meaning, and adherence to the conventions of language that are generally accepted within the context of usage. Additionally, the linguistic integrity is influenced by the syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of the sentence. 1. Grammar: The sentence \\"John disappeared\\" is grammatically correct. It contains a noun (John) as the subject, and a verb (disappeared) as the predicate. The subject-verb structure aligns with the rules of the English language. Also, the tense of the verb - simple past (disappeared) - is appropriate, indicating a completed action prior to the present moment. 2. Clarity of Meaning: The meaning of the sentence is unambiguous. The reader or listener is likely to understand that the individual named 'John' is no longer present or has vanished. Ambiguity or confusion is minimized, resulting in a clear understanding of the intended message. 3. Conventions of Language: \\"John disappeared\\" follows the standard conventions of English sentence construction. It employs appropriate capitalization and punctuation, as well as the correct use of parts of speech. The sentence is simple and concise, promoting understanding without the need for extraneous or complex elements. 4. Syntax: The syntax of the given sentence is well-structured, as it arranges words and phrases in a manner that respects the rules of English grammar. The subject, 'John,' is a proper noun and precedes the predicate, 'disappeared,' a verb that correctly conveys the action of vanishing. The simple sentence does not include any additional clauses or phrases that might complicate the syntax. 5. Semantics: In terms of semantics, the sentence employs meaningful words that function together to create a coherent message. The word 'disappeared' denotes the action of vanishing or becoming invisible, which correlates with the subject, 'John'. The combined meaning of 'John' (as a specific individual) and 'disappeared' (as a certain action) results in a meaningful sentence that builds a semantic connection between the words. 6. Pragmatics: Pragmatically speaking, the sentence conveys a clear message that the intended audience should have no difficulty interpreting. The context in which the sentence appears may influence how the interpretation occurs; for example, if the sentence is featured in a mystery novel, 'John disappeared' may imply abduction or intentionality. However, the reader derives understanding from the sentence as it stands, potentially leading to additional context-based conclusions. In summary, the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"John disappeared\\" is strong. It abides by the rules of grammar, exhibits clarity of meaning, adheres to the conventions of language, utilizes an appropriate syntax, displays semantic cohesion, and maintains pragmatically interpretability. Through these components, the sentence effectively communicates a message that most English speakers can easily understand and process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Take some time to inspect the wall where you will be applying the tiles to spot any damages that exist. You should patch holes in the wall with spackling compound or joint compound and then sand the surface if you spot damaged areas. Take mild detergent and water, and clean the walls. You could use dish detergent. Remember that some adhesives won’t adhere to grease. You can also clean walls with trisodium phosphate and water. Look for this cleaner in home project stores. If you spot any oil or grease stains, clean those too. You can do so with a degreaser or a primer if a soft cloth with detergent doesn’t do the job. Let the surface dry before you continue with installation. Figure out where the tile is going to go before you actually apply it to the kitchen wall. Sometimes, it works best to center your tile around a focal point like a faucet. Mark the start and the end point for the tile so you know how much you are going to need and where you plan to put it. Lay out the tile on the floor or on a large table to make sure the layout works, then measure it to be sure it fits the dimensions on the wall. Use tile spacers to account for grout. Put tile spacers in the corners of the tiles as you lay them to create even grout lines. Some smaller tiles have small protrusions called lugs that fit into the tiles next to them to create space for the grout. Grout is a mortar or paste used to fill the spaces between the tiles, giving it a finished look. Start with the spot on the wall that you can most easily see. Then, move outward and upward from that point. Use a level or straight edge to make sure the tile isn’t crooked. You might need to cut tiles if they won’t fit. A tile cutter will work for ceramic or porcelain tiles. Natural stone or thicker glass tiles may require a wet saw. Be very careful when using any cutting instruments. Purchase powdered thin-set mortar for natural stone mosaic tile. You will want to get this ready next. If you have ceramic or porcelain tiles, you may purchase mastic adhesive instead. The mortar package will instruct you on how much water to put in the bucket, in addition to the mortar powder. Mix it. Mastic adhesive is often already mixed by the manufacturer. Let the mortar stand for about 5 to 10 more minutes, and then mix it again. Usually, you will only have a few hours to use the mortar after mixing it. Again, check the directions on the package. There are some mortars that you use right away after mixing. Again check the package for instructions as it can vary by brand! Many people suggest mastic adhesive glue for ceramic or porcelain tiles, and mortar for natural stone or other tile backsplashes. Start spreading the mortar or mastic on the wall where you will place the tiles. You will want to begin with a 2-foot section. Spread the mortar in a thin layer by using a trowel. Press it at a 45 degree angle. This method will make the mortar fully adhere to the wall. Now, use a notched edge of the trowel to add more mortar on it, and comb even ridges in one direction. Working in small sections helps prevent the mortar from drying as you apply the tile. Use the trowel to apply mastic in similar fashion. You will want to use the right trowel size. If you are using natural stone tile, you will want a notch trowel that is ¼ by ¼ inch in size. You may choose thinset/adhesive for glass tile instead or tile with adhesive on the backs.","completion":"Before putting tiles on a wall, you need to make sure the wall is clean and smooth. Fix any holes and clean off any dirt, oil, or grease. Think about where you want the tiles to go and lay them out to make sure they fit. Also, use special tile spacers to make room for the grout, which is the paste that goes in between the tiles. When you're ready, mix up some special glue called mortar or mastic, and spread it on the wall with a special tool called a trowel. Put the tiles on the glue and use a level to make sure they're straight. If some tiles are too big, you might need to cut them with a special cutter or a wet saw, but be careful! Finally, let the glue dry and fill in the spaces between the tiles with grout. This will give your new wall a finished look."},{"prompt":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film opens with a scroll saying that when Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds (1963) was released, audiences laughed at the notion of birds revolting against humanity, but when an attack perpetrated by birds occurred in 1975, no one laughed. This is followed by a pre-credits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal unit. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance she is covered with is not blood, but tomato juice. A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occur (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers, in a parody of Jaws). While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that there is no credible threat, the president puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes led by a man named Mason Dixon. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, a disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler; Navy diver Greg Colburn; Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter.

The fanged creature is known as the Kashmir musk deer, and it is native to the Himalayas of northern India, Pakistan's Kashmir region and northern Afghanistan. Only the male deer have fangs, and they use them during mating season to compete for females. A team of researchers scoured Afghanistan's Nuristan province during 2008 and 2009, and recorded five sightings of the animal. This was the first time the species had been spotted since 1948. During the survey, the researchers spotted a single male Kashmir musk deer near the same area three separate times. The researchers also recorded one female and her baby, and saw a second single female that they think may have been the same deer, without her baby. These musk deer are classified as an endangered species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List. Musk-deer meat is a local delicacy, but the species is mostly hunted for its scent glands that are more valuable by weight than gold -- some believe the glands have pharmaceutical properties, and they sell for nearly 20,455 per pound (45,000 per kilogram) on the black market, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Three decades of war have ravaged Nuristan province, and the continued violence and political instability make the black-market trade of scent glands uncontrollable. Furthermore, the species is quickly losing suitable habitat. All of the musk deer were spotted on sheltered rocky outcrops around 9,843 feet (3,000 meters) high. In the summer, they regularly trek along steep slopes that make them almost impossible to approach and keep them ly safe from hunters.

Paragraph: Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Translate to English","completion":"There are various ways to prepare dishes, such as frying, stewing, baking, salting, and boiling. In more detail, these methods of cooking offer unique outcomes and flavors, making each one worth exploring: 1. Frying: This method involves cooking food in hot oil or fat, which can be done on the stovetop or with a deep fryer. Frying is quick, which helps to retain moisture in the food and gives it a crispy, golden brown finish. Some examples of fried foods are French fries, fried chicken, and onion rings. 2. Stewing: This slow-cooking technique involves simmering food in a liquid, such as water, stock, or wine. The low heat and long cooking time allow flavors to develop and meld, while tenderizing the ingredients. Stews and soups are common examples of dishes prepared through stewing. 3. Baking: The process of cooking food in the oven using dry, ambient heat. Baking is ideal for bread, pastries, cake, cookies, and other types of dough-based products. Aside from baked goods, other foods like roasted meats, vegetables, and casseroles can also be baked. 4. Salting: This is both a preservation technique and a method for enhancing flavor. Salting is the process of drawing moisture out of food and imparting the salt's flavor into it. There are different types of salting methods, such as dry salting, brining, and curing. Examples of salted foods include pickles, cured meats, and salted fish. 5. Boiling: This basic cooking method involves immersing food in a liquid -typically water- which is brought to a boiling point of 212°F (100°C). Boiling cooks food in a relatively short amount of time while retaining its nutrients. Common examples of boiled dishes are pasta, rice, and vegetables. Each of these cooking techniques has its own advantages and suitable applications for specific ingredients and dishes.

Question: \\"What continents created the Alps?\\" Context: \\"The formation of the Alps (the Alpine orogeny) was an episodic process that began about 300 million years ago. In the Paleozoic Era the Pangaean supercontinent consisted of a single tectonic plate; it broke into separate plates during the Mesozoic Era and the Tethys sea developed between Laurasia and Gondwana during the Jurassic Period. The Tethys was later squeezed between colliding plates causing the formation of mountain ranges called the Alpide belt, from Gibraltar through the Himalayas to Indonesia—a process that began at the end of the Mesozoic and continues into the present. The formation of the Alps was a segment of this orogenic process, caused by the collision between the African and the Eurasian plates that began in the late Cretaceous Period.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"The continents that created the Alps were Africa and Europe (Eurasia), specifically through the collision of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates. The Alpine orogeny, which is the process of mountain formation responsible for creating the Alps, started approximately 300 million years ago, during the Paleozoic Era. At that time, the Earth's landmass was combined into a single supercontinent called Pangaea. As time passed, this supercontinent broke apart, and by the Mesozoic Era, the landmasses had separated into separate tectonic plates. The Tethys Sea developed between the Laurasia and Gondwana continents during the Jurassic Period. As the tectonic plates continued to move and collide, the Tethys Sea was progressively squeezed, leading to the formation of the Alpide belt, a series of mountain ranges extending from Gibraltar through the Himalayas to Indonesia. This vast chain of mountains is the result of an ongoing orogenic process that began towards the end of the Mesozoic Era and continues to the present day. The formation of the Alps, which are part of the Alpide belt, was specifically caused by the collision between the African and Eurasian plates. This started in the late Cretaceous Period, around 100 to 66 million years ago. As these plates collided, they pushed up against one another, causing the land to buckle and fold, eventually leading to the formation of the magnificent mountain range we know today as the Alps. This mountain range now extends across eight countries in Europe, including France, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, Austria, Slovenia, and Monaco, covering a distance of approximately 1,200 kilometers (750 miles). The highest peak in the Alps, Mont Blanc, reaches an impressive elevation of 4,809 meters (15,777 feet). Due to the ongoing tectonic activity, the Alps are continuously evolving, with new mountains forming and existing ones changing their appearance over time. In conclusion, the formation of the Alps is a result of the collision between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates, which are part of the continents of Africa and Europe, respectively. The Alps are a prominent segment of the larger Alpide belt, which itself is the product of the Earth's ever-changing tectonic landscape and the ongoing processes of orogeny."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

AP: Perry revokes blind trust, discloses holdings GOP presidential hopeful Rick Perry revoked the blind trust that holds his investments and revealed for the first time in 15 years where his money is invested, according to the Associated Press. Perry, governor of Texas since 2000, amended his personal financial disclosure report and sent a letter to the Texas Ethics Commission. Perry reported that he holds 25 different stocks worth 108,000 to 319,000. The AP obtained the letter and his new disclosure report through an open records request. The AP says Perry's report also lists eight municipal bond holdings and a money-market account worth more than 10,000. The governor owns real estate, which has been the subject of recent news stories about how he profited from land deals while in public office. Perry is worth at least 1.1 million, according to a previous AP story. That stands in stark contrast to Mitt Romney, Perry's leading GOP rival, who is worth more than 190 million. Perry grew up modestly. He often points out that his parents were tenant farmers and that he lived in a West Texas house that didn't have indoor plumbing for a few years.

This sentence confirms that San'doro mentioned the word \\"Gods.\\" Essentially, it conveys the same information as the premise with a more straightforward sentence structure. The hypothesis establishes that, indeed, San'doro has spoken the word \\"Gods.\\" When comparing the two statements, it is evident that both claim that San'doro referred to the concept of Gods. Therefore, if we accept the premise as true, we must acknowledge that the hypothesis is equally valid. As for the given options: 1. Yes: This option represents the stance we have established. If the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true as well. 2.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte. Question: \\"What languages spoken by the different attorneys of Neighborhood Legal Services?

Write a title for this article: NEW YORK (AP) — The NFL has fined Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch 20,000 for making an obscene gesture during last Sunday’s NFC championship game, a person with knowledge of the fine told The Associated Press on Thursday. The league did not specify what the gesture was in the win over Green Bay, but Lynch grabbed his crotch after scoring a go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter. Lynch was fined 11,000 for a similar gesture in Seattle’s win over Arizona on Dec. 21. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the fine has not been publicly announced. Lynch has a history of drawing fines from the NFL, mostly for not talking to the media as required under his contract. He was fined 50,000 in November for repeated violations of the league’s media policy. At that time, the league collected a 50,000 fine that was imposed against Lynch for violations in 2013. That fine from 2013 was held in anticipation of future cooperation from Lynch — cooperation that has not occurred. At last January’s Super Bowl media day in New Jersey, Lynch spent the session behind a barrier talking with teammates, autographing a football a young fan threw to him, and speaking only to NFL Network’s Deion Sanders and to Armed Forces Radio. He ignored many other questions asked from a distance by reporters, and also left for a short while before returning. The league and the Seahawks are discussing Lynch’s requirements for next Tuesday’s media day. Lynch also was told before last Sunday’s game he could not wear gold shoes because they were a violation of the NFL’s on-field dress code, and that he could be ejected from the game if he wore them.

Context: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation. Humanitarian assistance has been exempted from the economic sanctions, but Beasely said import restrictions has made it more complicated to bring in aid, and made... Question: After the Summit, what will Beasley do? Answer: A:","completion":"After the Summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, David Beasley, the Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP), will likely continue to advocate for increased humanitarian aid for millions of people in North Korea who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. Beasley's optimism about turning a new chapter in North Korea's history hinges on the possibility of a successful denuclearization deal. If such a deal is reached, it is expected that the international community will be more willing to provide aid and cooperate on economic investments, which would alleviate the critical living conditions in the country. While the details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, reaching an agreement would potentially lead to the end of severe U.S. led sanctions on North Korean trade. These sanctions, which currently ban 90% of the nation's trade, have been imposed due to repeated nuclear and missile tests. Import restrictions resulting from these sanctions have made it more complicated to bring in humanitarian assistance, despite being exempted from the economic sanctions. Continuing in his role as WFP Executive Director, Beasley will most likely focus on ensuring that once conditions permit, humanitarian aid efforts are accelerated in order to address the urgent needs of the North Korean population, especially in rural areas outside the capital. His recent visit to North Korea, which allowed him remarkable access to both Pyongyang and rural areas, will serve as a basis for planning and executing these aid programs. In addition, Beasley will work closely with the United Nations, international governments, and non-governmental organizations to mobilize resources and coordinate relief efforts to provide necessary food, healthcare, and infrastructure support to alleviate the suffering of millions of North Koreans. In summary, following the Summit, David Beasley will likely continue to advocate for increased humanitarian aid and monitor the situation in North Korea, focusing on developments post-denuclearization deal. If an agreement is reached, he will work on implementing and expanding aid programs, collaborating with international governments and organizations to provide much-needed relief and support for the impoverished North Korean population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Start of Sentences: The first rule of English grammar is that every sentence begins with a capital letter, hence \\"Do\\" is capitalized. 2. Personal Pronouns: In this sentence, \\"you\\" is a personal pronoun and it is not capitalized unless it starts the sentence or it is part of a title. 3. Commas and Periods: Words following commas and periods aren’t usually capitalized. In this sentence, \\"swiveling\\" and \\"ability\\" are not capitalized even though they follow commas. 4. Etc.: 'Et cetera' is a Latin phrase. It means 'and other similar things'. And it has a short form: etc. When it is written at the end of the sentence it is always followed by a period but shouldn't be capitalized unless it begins a new sentence. Capitalizing all the significant words, proper nouns or the first word of the sentence is important to ensure grammatical accuracy and to make the text easily understandable for the readers.

Players in PvP mode often use this technique to stun their enemy, making them vulnerable to skill attacks or combo. This type of attack also works on monsters to canceling any skill cast or make them flinch to make them open for any combination. Fireball Dash unleashes a huge fireball skill after running. To execute this skill, simply double tap the arrow button toward your enemy, and while running, press Z, Z, X. When you press Z, your character will slash the opponent after the dash, hitting them twice with 120%–160%. Pressing X will execute the fireball within the combo, unleashing 270% magic damage. Aerial Fireball is another approach in releasing Fireball attack. This occurs when you jump to avoid any opponent then unleash Fireball while in mid-air. To execute this combo, run toward the enemy by tapping the arrow button and then jump by pressing up, followed by X and Z. By the time you jump and pressed X, your character will swing his sword, damaging any enemies who attempts to jump with you, causing 200% physical damage. At Z, you will release your Fireball, which will cause 200% magic damage. This is best done with fast combo execution. As Magic Knight are great with mid-range attacks with their Fireball skills, enemies will attempt on doing more close-range attacks to prevent you from doing more Fireball combo. Most enemies will now dash toward at you then slash before you could swing your sword. To prevent this, use the Knockback Slash to knock them back, making them fall to the ground and vulnerable to your next combo. Simply tap on the arrows twice toward your enemy's direction to run and then press Z after the dash, followed by two more Z to attack. The first slash will inflict 120% damage if you manage to land a hit on your opponent. 160% for the second attack and 200% physical damage to the third. This combo also works on some boss. Use this skill to your advantage, for this increases your chance in surviving the game. Summary:","completion":"In the game, Magic Knights use special moves like Fireball Dash and Aerial Fireball to fight enemies and do powerful attacks while keeping a good distance, and they can also use Knockback Slash to knock enemies down and avoid getting hit."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

It will be harder to recruit and teach students if you do not have extensive playing experience. If you have been playing piano for a long time and have a significant repertoire under your belt, you are probably already qualified to teach. That said, you should still practice playing the piano daily so that your skills stay fresh and up to date. A degree is not necessarily required if you have a high playing skill level. However, most successful piano teachers are highly trained with the equivalent of a bachelor's degree in piano with coursework in piano pedagogy (instruction). Learning classical techniques is helpful for increasing overall playing skill and are necessary for aspiring concert pianists or future teachers. However, if your student wants to learn how to play jazz music in addition to classical, and you don’t know how to play jazz piano, you may not be the best teacher for them. While some students take piano lessons to show their friends their favorite pop songs, others may learn piano to make a career out of it some day.

Please write a short summary for the following article: U.S. in Control: Its Goal To Fix, Not Run, Firms When it comes to justifying state control of big corporations, Barack Obama is no Francois Mitterrand. When France's late president nationalized huge swaths of the country's financial and industrial base in the 1980s, he made no apologies. Seizing a dozen industrial conglomerates and three banks, Mitterrand insisted that government control was in the interest of the economy. He asserted that the state, which already owned much of the nation's energy and transport industries, was best able to allocate resources. Today the Obama administration finds itself in control of many of the pillars of U.S. finance and industry, but it is playing its role reluctantly. Obama's goal is to fix them, not run them, the White House says. With regard to GM, for example, one official said this week that the administration's \\"goal is to exert as little influence as possible\\" and \\"to exit as quickly as possible.\\" Yet the Obama administration, on behalf of American taxpayers, has become -- or will soon become -- the controlling shareholder of General Motors and Chrysler, mortgage behemoths Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and insurance giant AIG, not to mention the 29 banks taken over this year by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. And that puts the president in the awkward position of balancing public policy goals with the financial interests of taxpayers as investors in these ailing corporations. \\"I think it's going to have to be both,\\" said Dean Baker, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. The president \\"shouldn't seek to micromanage by deciding what cars to make if he were CEO.\\" On the other hand, Baker added, the administration \\"can't escape responsibility for whatever actions the companies do. It can't wash its hands.\\" \\"In many ways, we are in uncharted and potentially treacherous water here,\\" said N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard University who was chairman of former president George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. \\"It is almost inconceivable that the political process will be good at corporate governance. The most one can hope for is that this period will be temporary, that the federal government will sell off its equity stake to private investors as soon as possible.\\" Only two years ago, the federal government might not have needed to play this role. Private equity was riding high. When the private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management bought Chrysler, for example, its chairman, John Snow, explained that \\"carpenters fix up old houses and rebuild them. Likewise, Cerberus fixes up underperforming companies and rebuilds them.\\" Today, the federal government is using some of the same techniques and strategies as the much-maligned private-equity firms, albeit with much more muscle. \\"We're in deal mode,\\" said one person familiar with the administration's deliberations on restructuring the automobile companies, but who spoke on condition of anonymity. \\"What's going on behind the scenes is very much like any deal. People are scattered in many different rooms . . . There is a lot of paper flying about.\\" While the Obama administration has disavowed interest in managing the companies it owns, it has intervened on key issues and behaved like an active investor. It has ousted top executives such as GM chief executive G. Richard Wagoner Jr., limited pay packages after embarrassing disclosures about bonuses paid at AIG, and bent corporate policies at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac toward public policy goals in housing. Having committed 400 billion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government is directing them to carry out big parts of the Obama administration's Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan, a 75 billion effort launched last month. The program aims to restructure mortgages that borrowers cannot afford, bolster the sagging housing market and bring down interest rates on home loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have little option but to implement the policy. A regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, took charge of the companies last September and has appointed their boards and chief executives. Soon after the takeover, the regulator appointed \\"liaisons\\" to shadow top executives. It signs off on major decisions about how much to charge for mortgages and more mundane decisions such as whether executives can attend conferences. But the choices the government is making for the companies potentially stand in the way of returning them to profitability, the companies have said. Executives must choose between making decisions that benefit the housing market or save taxpayer dollars. \\"These initiatives are likely to have a significant adverse effect on our financial results or condition,\\" Freddie Mac warned in its regulatory disclosure.","completion":"The Obama administration has found itself in control of various US financial and industrial giants, such as General Motors, Chrysler, Freddie Mac, and Fannie Mae.

The news of the naked corpse spreads rapidly through the town, and it soon becomes the primary topic of conversation among the residents. The story takes a sudden twist when forensic evidence reveals that the woman was not only murdered, but her killer deliberately undressed her and staged the scene to send a message. Act 2: As the investigation begins, Matt starts digging deeper into the case, driven by ambition to solve it and become a respected investigative journalist again. He forms an unlikely alliance with Detective Jackson and together, they start gathering clues. Soon, they learn that the victim, Maria, was a local activist fighting against a powerful real estate tycoon, Mr. Chambers, who plans to destroy the idyllic town and turn it into a luxury resort. Maria's relentless attempts to expose Mr. Chambers's illegal activities made her the victim of constant threats. Matt and Detective Jackson dive into the shady world of corruption in their quest for the truth. They interview and investigate Maria's friends, family, and enemies. As the evidence stacks up against Mr. Chambers, Matt can't shake the nagging feeling that something isn't adding up. Matt's journalistic instincts lead him to a series of leads connecting numerous people in the town with suspicious backgrounds. Act 3: Matt and Detective Jackson's persistence starts to pay off when they discover that Maria had gathered incriminating evidence against Mr. Chambers, but someone betrayed her trust and informed the cops about the naked corpse. Deeper investigation reveals that the tip came from an unlikely source - the town's meek and unassuming librarian, Emily. Emily proves to be an enigmatic character, providing just enough vague and disturbing information to hold the investigators' attention. Under intense questioning, she eventually breaks down and confesses that she had been having an affair with Mr. Chambers. During their lovemaking, she had found out about Maria's murder and played along as the submissive lover, cleverly learning about the killer's modus operandi. Wracked with guilt over her role in Maria's death, Emily had grown desperate to expose the truth. She sent an anonymous tip to the cops once she knew they were onto Mr. Chambers, but the danger of being implicated forced her to play a dangerous double game. Ultimately, her conscience won, and she cooperated with Matt and Detective Jackson. Driven by the shocking revelations, Matt and Jackson gather enough evidence to convict Mr. Chambers, not only for Maria's murder but also for his other ruthless crimes. However, the powerful tycoon doesn't go down without a fight, leading to an intense and suspenseful showdown. Eventually, justice prevails as Chambers is arrested. Epilogue: Throughout the course of the investigation, Matt and Detective Jackson develop a romantic connection, symbolizing their bond formed by the ordeal they endured together. In the end, Matt's dedication to the case restores his reputation as a respected investigative journalist. As the town slowly returns to its former peace, Matt reflects on the twists of fate that led him there. \\"The Unveiling\\" is a tale of ambition, betrayal, and redemption—depicting the depths of human resilience in the face of adversity and the constant struggle for truth, love, and justice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved.

Punk rock has a faster, driving rhythm, heavy metal uses a 4/4 time signature (the beat is a quarter note lasting 1 second and there are 4 beats per measure), reggae rock is syncopated (beats are played off the rhythm). Search online to find out what rhythm and beats the particular genre of rock music you want to play uses. Many of the most famous rock songs use power chords rather than traditional ones to give the music a less smooth, edgier sound. Power chords are formed by fingering the main note of the chord with your first finger on the top string of your guitar, then using your third and fourth fingers to press down on the 2 strings below the top string 2 frets down the neck of the guitar. The G power chord, for example, would be formed by pressing on the third fret on the top string, then the fifth fret on the 2 strings below the top string. Nirvana’s song “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” for example, uses the power chords for E, A, G, and C. Power chords are particularly popular in grunge music. Acid rock songs use the same type of chords, but they distort the chords by using a distortion pedal hooked up to the amplifier. Indie rock, on the other hand, tends to go for a smoother, softer sound, and may even use traditional chords. Glam rock also uses smoother sounds, and tends to experiment with music from other genres entirely. Electric guitars have been the foundation of rock songs since the beginning. While you’re writing your song, use an electric guitar as the accompaniment and to help develop your melody. Once your finished writing your song, you can add in instruments like the drums, bass guitar, and keyboard. You should also remember to strum your guitar like you’re trying to break the strings. Rock music isn’t rock music without a destructive vibe. Funk rock, for example, emphasizes a heavy beat from the bass guitar and drums. Singer-songwriters like Joan Armatrading tend to focus heavily on melody instruments like guitar and piano and use other instruments mostly just to achieve a fuller sound. Every great rock song has a killer instrumental solo, almost always one with an electric guitar. To write your solo, play around with scales in your song’s key and try adding in bits and pieces of your melody. Try different combinations to see what you come up with and do what you can to really show off your skill. Psychedelic rock in particular features long, improvised instrumental solos, usually by a electric guitar. Punk rock, on the other hand, tends to see instrumental solos and pretentious and unnecessary. The iconic guitar part in the Guns N’ Roses song “Sweet Child O’ Mine,” for example, is a simple variation of a scale that Axl Rose heard guitarist Slash playing in rehearsal.","completion":"The rhythm and beat of a rock song largely depend on the specific style of rock being played. Various rock genres, such as punk rock, heavy metal, reggae rock, grunge, acid rock, indie rock, and glam rock, use different rhythms, beats, and techniques to create distinct sounds. Punk rock usually has a fast, driving rhythm, whereas heavy metal typically follows a 4/4 time signature. Reggae rock is syncopated, meaning beats are played off the rhythm. To determine the rhythm and beats for a particular genre, it is advisable to search online or study established songs in that genre. Many famous rock songs use power chords instead of traditional ones to create an edgier sound. Power chords can be formed by fingering the main note with the first finger on the top string of the guitar and using the third and fourth fingers to press down on the two strings below the top string, two frets down the neck. For example, in Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" the E, A, G, and C power chords are used, making them popular in grunge music. Acid rock employs similar chords to grunge but distorts them using a distortion pedal connected to the amplifier. Indie rock often opts for a smoother, softer sound, sometimes using traditional chords, while glam rock experiments with sounds from other musical genres. Electric guitars are the backbone of rock songs, and they help develop melodies and accompaniments. While composing a rock song, one should use an electric guitar as the primary instrument and later add drums, bass guitar, and keyboards. Strumming the guitar with force can enhance the intense and destructive vibe characteristic of rock music. Funk rock emphasizes heavy beats from bass guitar and drums, and singer-songwriters, like Joan Armatrading, mainly focus on melody instruments such as guitar and piano, with other instruments adding depth to the sound. Most great rock songs feature an instrumental solo, commonly played on an electric guitar. To create a solo, one can experiment with scales in the song's key, incorporating elements of the melody. Psychedelic rock often showcases extended, improvised instrumental solos, while punk rock generally avoids solos, considering them pretentious and unnecessary.

Please answer the following question: The popularity of lip pencils and crayons is soaring, I suspect it’s because they’re just so easy to use. I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply. What does the narrator most likely think that MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil should do with the plum color she bought? A. Make it more pigmented and less shiny B.

(2). no.","completion":"(2). No. The original sentence, \\"With the automobile being the primary means of transportation for over 80 percent of its residents, San Diego is served by a network of freeways and highways,\\" does not specifically answer the question, \\"Which interstate directly connects the east with the Arizona Sun Corridor and Imperial County?\\" To provide a detailed and long answer, let's first define the Arizona Sun Corridor and Imperial County. The Arizona Sun Corridor is the region running through central Arizona, spanning from the Phoenix metro area to Tucson. It is an economically significant area, encompassing a rapidly growing population and a variety of industries, including technology and renewable energy. Imperial County is located in the southeastern part of California, bordering both Arizona and Mexico. The most significant city in Imperial County is El Centro. The county largely relies on agriculture, and the region is ripe with fertile lands, thanks to the Colorado River and the Imperial Valley. Now, let's address the question at hand, focusing on the interstate highway that connects the east with the Arizona Sun Corridor and Imperial County. The answer lies in Interstate 8 (I-8), which runs east to west, from San Diego, California, to Casa Grande, Arizona. Interstate 8 specifically connects San Diego to the Arizona Sun Corridor. It can be accessed from the north or south via several other highways. For instance, Interstate 10, which runs from Santa Monica, California, to Jacksonville, Florida, can be used to connect the eastern United States to the Arizona Sun Corridor. Once in the Sun Corridor, drivers can travel south on I-8 to reach Imperial County. So, the correct answer is Interstate 8 (I-8). Nonetheless, the original sentence does not provide this information, and thus, it does not answer the question directly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. The following article contains an answer for the question: Who did Santa Anna demand the executions of? , can you please find it? The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's...

The first question, \\"What is maturity in general?\\" asks for a general definition or understanding of the concept of maturity. The second question, \\"What is maturity and how do I develop it?\\" not only asks for a definition but also seeks guidance on how to develop or improve one's own maturity. To address both questions, let me clarify the concept of maturity and provide some steps for personal growth. 1. Define maturity: Maturity is the state or quality of being emotionally, intellectually, and socially developed. This includes having a sense of responsibility, empathy, patience, and the ability to make thoughtful decisions and manage emotions effectively. 2. Develop self-awareness: To increase maturity, first recognize your own emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Analyze your reactions to various situations and identify areas for improvement. 3. Practice empathy: Put yourself in other people's shoes and try to understand their perspectives, emotions, and motivations. This will enhance your ability to connect with others and exhibit maturity in social situations. 4. Cultivate emotional intelligence: Learn how to manage your emotions better by expressing them appropriately, not allowing them to negatively impact your decisions, and being resilient against stress and hardships. 5. Be accountable for your actions: Accept responsibility for your decisions and behaviors, whether positive or negative. Learn from your mistakes and apologize when necessary. 6. Develop patience and problem-solving skills: Cultivate the ability to stay calm under stress, and work through problems in a rational, systematic manner. 7. Seek feedback: Openly ask for input from others to learn more about your strengths and weaknesses. Use this feedback to grow as a mature individual.

Self-Employed People Pay Less in Taxes Who pays a greater share of their income in taxes — Warren Buffett, or his administrative assistant? Obviously, posing the question implies its answer. Politicians may tout the virtues of our “progressive” tax system, but it doesn’t really favor the poor over the rich. Nor does it favor the rich over the poor, not when 40% of federal tax receipts come from 1% of the population. Fairly or otherwise, the tax system favors the diligent over the unprepared.

There are two components to that: 1) they were underpaying me to begin with, but had to cough up once I exercised my leverage and threatened to walk and B) the daily rate they paid me after the switch was just for the services I rendered nothing else. It included no employee benefits, no capital expenditures for a workstation, no space reserved for me at the office Christmas party, no food allowance, no 6.2% Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax, no unemployment insurance premium. The responsibility for all that now fell on me. Which is wonderful. It meant that instead of my former employer enjoying all the possible tax deductions from my labor, I got to take advantage of them. My taxes got a little more complicated — I now had to keep more detailed records, and file quarterly instead of annually — but the benefits grossly outweighed the costs. It’s easy to get started, but also easy to make mistakes. You don’t want to be a single proprietor. You want to found an S Corporation, a legal entity that protects you from creditors who are forbidden from coming after certain classifications of income. An S Corporation lets you separate your money between salary and capital gains, the latter of which is taxed at a lower rate. Read More: What Is the Best Way to Find My Credit Score? Find a company that specializes in entity formation. It’ll cost maybe 500 for them to register you with the relevant state’s Secretary of State office. You don’t have to register in your home state, either. If you live in California or New York, you don’t want to — those states’ laws don’t protect you enough from creditors. Register in Delaware or Nevada or, failing that, your home state. Once you incorporate it starts forcing you to think like a businessman. Income will now be tabulated on IRS 1099 forms, rather than those infamous W-2s. The former is where you want most of your income to come from. As a practical matter, once you incorporate you’ll pay (correction: your company will pay) you a salary. What’s a reasonable amount to cover your annual living expenses; maybe 24,000? Then that’s what Employee #1, you, will receive and pay taxes on. After deductions, your effective tax rate on the salary will be close to zero. But what about the rest of your company’s income? Legally speaking, the rest of the revenue your S Corporation takes in is not salary, but shareholder dividends. Which are taxed at a lower rate than salaries are. And you can now deduct all sorts of business expenses before calculating the net shareholder dividends you’ll pay taxes on. Go to IRS.gov and check out Form 2106. Your employer fills one of these out every time you go on a business trip, or eat a meal on company time, or buy anything related to your job. And your employer then enjoys the tax deduction. * It tears me inside to know that by writing this post, I’m giving you leeches an economic edge.

He was the second son of Ethel Irene (nee Orr) and George Waldemar Nelson. His paternal grandparents were Swedish and his mother was of English descent. Nelson was raised in Ridgefield Park where he was active in Scouting, earning the rank of Eagle Scout at age 13. Nelson started his entertainment career as a band leader. He formed and led the Ozzie Nelson Band, and had some initial limited success. He made his own \\"big break\\" in 1930. The New York Daily Mirror ran a poll of its readers to determine their favorite band. He knew that news vendors got credit from the newspaper for unsold copies by returning the front page and discarding the rest of the issue. Gathering hundreds of discarded newspapers, the band filled out ballots in their favor. They edged out Paul Whiteman and were pronounced the winners. From 1930 through the 1940s, Nelson's band recorded prolifically--first on Brunswick (1930-1933), then Vocalion (1933-1934), then back to Brunswick (1934-1936), Bluebird (1937-1941), Victor (1941) and finally back to Bluebird (1941-through the 1940s). Nelson's records were consistently popular and in 1934 Nelson enjoyed success with his hit song, \\"Over Somebody Else's Shoulder\\" which he introduced. Nelson was their primary vocalist and (from August 1932) featured in duets with his other star vocalist, Harriet Hilliard. Nelson's calm, easy vocal style was popular on records and radio and quite similar to son Rick's voice, and Harriet's perky vocals added to the band's popularity. In 1935, Ozzie Nelson and His Orchestra had a number one hit with \\"And Then Some\\", which was number one for one week on the U.S. pop singles chart. Ozzie Nelson composed several songs, including \\"Wave the Stick Blues\\", \\"Subway\\", \\"Jersey Jive\\", \\"Swingin' on the Golden Gate\\", and \\"Central Avenue Shuffle\\". In October 1935 he married the band's vocalist Hilliard. The couple had two children. David (1936-2011), became an actor and director. Eric (\\"Ricky\\") (1940-1985), became an actor and singer.

Here is an article: If you want to get a sense of John Deere’s grip on the agriculture industry, head to Iowa, one of the world’s largest producers of corn. More than 2 billion bushels of the common grain (much of which is used for ethanol production) will be harvested from the state’s 12.6 million acres this year alone. Despite massive consolidation across the industry, most of those acres are still owned by family-run farms, and most of those families have more than corn-growing in common: For decades they have relied on Deere machines to cultivate their crops. “We ‘bleed green,’ ” says T.J. Coughenour, a fourth-generation farmer in the small town of Maxwell (pop. 916). Beside him, lined up in front of an immense cornfield, are three gleaming Deere machines, including the original “cab” purchased by his grandfather more than 40 years ago. In this Midwestern state, Deere’s iconic green tractors, combines, balers, and sprayers are almost as much a part of the natural landscape as cornstalks and cows. (Fun fact: There are more cows than people in Iowa.) Though the 178-year-old company’s headquarters are in neighboring Illinois, its enormous presence in Iowa is a testament to its dominance in agribusiness. Deere controls an estimated 60% of the U.S. farming-equipment market. But despite that supremacy (and the multigenerational loyalty of farming families like the Coughenours), the tractor maker faces strong headwinds. Soft commodity prices have weakened demand for farming equipment and caused Deere’s revenue to tumble to 36.1 billion last year, a 5% decrease from the year before. Deere’s Field Connect system monitors soil moisture.Courtesy of John Deere To help combat the decline, Deere has turned to a new source of revenue: software services that deliver information and counsel to farmers in the field. “What we’re trying to do is put another leg on the ‘ag stool,’ if you will,” says Samuel Allen, the company’s CEO. “A farmer might not have to buy a new piece of equipment every year, but he’s still doing the data every year. That part of the business can be more constant.” Deere has a long history of technological innovation. The company first released tractors with autonomous features in 2002, well before Google GOOG began its driverless-car project. “We’ve had embedded technologies in our cabs for a long time,” says Matt Olson, product line manager for Deere’s Intelligent Solutions Group. “But like most people today, our customers are carrying around iPads with them.” John Deere’s “ExactEmerge” allows accurate rows of corn or soybeans.Courtesy of John Deere So Deere is investing heavily in software. In a nondescript office just outside Des Moines, Olson’s teams are hard at work developing apps that help farmers manage their fields from their mobile devices. One of them, called SeedStar Mobile, lets farmers monitor factors such as the spacing between planted seeds and “singulation” (the term that describes the deployment of a seed from the meter, the machine that regulates seed flow) row by row. Today there are more than 200,000 Deere machines that can wirelessly transmit agronomic data to remote servers to be organized, analyzed, and tapped for other applications (such as coordinating multiple machines in the same field). Active Fill Control uses cameras to ensure that the harvest is evenly deposited, not spilled.Courtesy of John Deere Deere has also looked outward to jump-start its technological initiatives. In early October the company introduced SageInsights, a joint venture with Colorado software company DN2K, which is developing a cloud-computing platform to allow retailers and consultants to manage their agronomic data in one place. One month later Deere revealed that it would open a data link between its machinery and Monsanto’s Climate Corp. division to allow the latter to deliver farmers advice based on weather and crop data. (As part of the deal, Deere acquired Monsanto’s Precision Planting unit, which makes seeding equipment.) Corporate partnerships and software integrations can certainly help John Deere boost its technological prowess in the short term, but the company faces the longer-term challenges of attracting employees with skill sets that match its new businesses. Deere has long hired workers from the farming community it serves. Can it also attract tech-industry talent? “We can’t rely on being the employer of choice only for people involved with farming,” says Allen, who says it makes sense for John Deere to set up shop someday in Silicon Valley. In the meantime the CEO is not worried about future demand for Deere products: “The world needs to eat.” A version of this article appears in the December 1, 2015 issue of Fortune with the headline “John Deere, Modern Farmer.” Write a title for it.","completion":"John Deere Adapts to Modern Farming with New Technology and Software"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Located in Montana, the Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation was established in 1916 for the landless Chippewa and Cree Indians. The name \\"Rocky Boy\\" is derived from the Ojibwa word \\"Asiniiwin,\\" literally meaning \\"Stone Child\\" or \\"Rock Boy,\\" which was attributed to the Chippewa chief named Ah-see-ne-wun, who was instrumental in acquiring the land for the reservation. The Bear Paw Ski Bowl, situated within this reservation, offers excellent skiing and snowboarding opportunities during the winter months. With an elevation of 5,400 feet, the ski area caters to a variety of skill levels, featuring various slopes for beginner, intermediate, and advanced skiers and snowboarders. Equipped with a surface lift, the Bear Paw Ski Bowl prides itself in being family-friendly and less crowded than larger ski resorts. In addition to skiing and snowboarding, visitors often take part in other outdoor activities within the reservation, such as snowshoeing, hiking, and cross-country skiing. These activities further promote the recreational aspect of the area and contribute to the cultural exchange between the visitors and the Chippewa Cree Tribe. The Chippewa Cree Tribe's involvement in managing and maintaining the Bear Paw Ski Bowl highlights their commitment to share their land and rich cultural heritage with visitors.

By the time we finished , we had filled an entire trash bag of \\" garbage \\" and five grocery bags of donations . Why does Kelly feel so accomplished ?","completion":"Kelly feels so accomplished because she managed to put an end to a considerable accumulation of items cluttering her room by actively addressing the issue and dedicating five hours of her time to the task. By cleaning her room, she not only created a more organized and visually appealing living space, but also regained a sense of control over her surroundings, which ultimately leads to personal satisfaction. Moreover, Kelly's cleaning session extended beyond the removal of unwanted items, as it also enabled her to discover belongings she may have lost or forgotten about. This unexpected discovery not only added an element of surprise to the entire experience but reinforced the gratification she felt after her hard work. Another factor contributing to Kelly's sense of accomplishment is the undeniable social aspect of the activity. By involving a friend in this important task, the support and company undoubtedly made the process more enjoyable and allowed her to create a bond through shared effort. This strengthened sense of camaraderie most likely boosted Kelly's motivation, making the success of the task all the more satisfying. Furthermore, Kelly's decision to donate part of the unwanted items demonstrates a sense of social responsibility and generosity. By choosing to give away items to those who may need or appreciate them more, she feels a sense of satisfaction knowing that her actions have a positive effect beyond her immediate surroundings. This selflessness contributes to her heightened sense of accomplishment. Lastly, the tangible results of Kelly's endeavors – a clean room, filled trash bags, and five grocery bags of donations – serve as visual proof of her achievement. This physical evidence emphasizes the effectiveness of her efforts and makes her feel accomplished and proud of her work. In summary, Kelly feels so accomplished because she dedicated time and energy to successfully tackle her cluttered room, resulting in a more organized and comfortable living space. Throughout the process, she reconnected with her belongings, shared the experience with a friend, demonstrated social responsibility through donations, and witnessed the tangible results of her hard work. All these factors combined contribute to her sense of accomplishment and personal satisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? pick from the following. 1). no. 2). yes.","completion":"2). Yes. The two questions are indeed paraphrases of each other as they both ask whether there is more evidence supporting the existence of God versus the lack of evidence supporting the contrary. The difference in their phrasing does not alter the meaning of the questions, as they both inquire about the presence of evidence for God's existence versus evidence suggesting that God does not exist. Now, regarding the discussion on the evidence for God's existence, this is a topic that has spurred countless philosophical debates and personal beliefs for centuries. The search for evidence regarding the existence or non-existence of God largely depends on the kind of evidence we are seeking, and the epistemological perspective one takes in evaluating it. From a philosophical standpoint, traditional arguments for God's existence tend to fall into one of three categories: 1. Cosmological arguments: These claim that something about the existence and nature of the universe—such as its contingency, orderliness, or origins—implies the presence of a supernatural creator. The most famous examples are the Kalam cosmological argument and the Leibnizian cosmological argument. 2. Teleological arguments: These assert that the apparent design, purpose, or order within the universe implies the existence of a deity. Paley's watchmaker analogy and the fine-tuning argument are popular examples. 3. Ontological arguments: These suggest that the nature and concept of the divine is so perfect that its existence is a necessary logical consequence. St. Anselm's ontological argument and Gödel's ontological argument are notable examples of this approach. In contrast, evidence against God's existence tends to be more difficult to pin down, as it would involve proving a negative, and relies on skepticism, rationalism, and empiricism. Critics highlight inconsistencies in holy texts, logical arguments against the existence of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent deity (such as the problem of evil), and the naturalistic explanations for the universe's formation. There is an important point to recognize, though. Some argue that the burden of proof should lie with those who posit the existence of a deity, while others emphasize that one should be open to alternative explanations when facing the complexity, beauty, and mystery of the universe. Ultimately, whether or not there is more evidence for or against God's existence will depend on personal beliefs and perspectives, philosophical frameworks, and epistemological stances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It measures the current that flows through the wire. The faster the magnet or coil moves, the greater the amount of current that is produced. If more turns were added to the coil, this would increase the strength of the magnetic field as well. If the magnet were moved back and forth repeatedly, the current would keep changing direction. In other words, alternating current would be produced. This is illustrated in Figure below . I am facing a new situation today: James is testing the strength of electromagnetic fields. He takes two lengths of copper wire and coils them. His first coil, A, has a weaker magnetic field than his second coil, B. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which coil has a stronger electromagnetic field, A or B?","completion":"Based on the background information provided, the strength of the electromagnetic field depends on two key factors: the speed at which the magnet or coil moves and the number of turns in the coil. The more the number of turns in the coil, the greater the strength of the magnetic field produced. Now, turning to the new situation with James' experiment, it is mentioned that he has two coils made from copper wire. Coil A is noted to have a weaker magnetic field than Coil B. The direct correlation between the number of turns in a coil and the strength of the magnetic field produced, as stated in the background article, can help us answer the question. In this case, since the background article elaborated that adding more turns to a coil would increase the strength of the magnetic field, we can deduce that Coil B, which is said to have a stronger magnetic field, must have more turns compared to Coil A. We're not given any information about the speed of movement of the coils in James' experiment, so we'll focus only on the factor relating to the number of turns in the coil for now.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the given math problem, 44772*j - 44768*j + 212 = 0, for j, we need to apply algebraic manipulation to isolate the variable j. Let's go through it step by step: 1. Combine like terms: We have two terms with j in them: 44772*j and -44768*j. We can combine these two terms by subtracting the coefficients (the numbers in front of the j). So: 44772*j - 44768*j = (44772 - 44768) * j = 4*j Now, the equation becomes: 4*j + 212 = 0 2. Isolate the variable j: To isolate the j term, we need to eliminate the constant term, 212, by moving it to the other side of the equation: 4*j = -212 3. Solve for j: Now, to find the value of j, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of j, which is 4: j = -212 / 4 4. Simplify the fraction: Divide -212 by 4: j = -53 So, the solution to the given math problem is j = -53."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Terry asks his boss's wife Sylvia to his apartment after an office party and the two go to bed. Later, while he is in the bathroom, she hears screams outside and goes naked to the window. Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away. When the media report the murder of a young woman near Terry's flat that night, he thinks the police should know what Sylvia saw but, to protect her, claims he was at the bedroom window. At a police lineup, neither he nor the victim Denise is able to pick out the attacker Carl. Despite the feeble evidence against him, Carl is put on trial for the assault and during the proceedings his lawyer proves that since Terry is short-sighted he could not have witnessed the incident. Carl goes free, leaving not only the police and the prosecution but also Denise and Sylvia aghast at Terry's ineptness. In the courtroom, Carl recognised Sylvia as the woman at the window. Desperate to warn her, Terry finds her at a ballet performance and tells her she must go to the police, but she refuses all further involvement. As he leaves, he sees Carl's distinctive truck parked outside and rushes in again. He is too late, however, for in the dark she has been stabbed fatally and dies in Terry's arms. He takes refuge with Denise, who first seduces him and then offers him a chance to redeem himself. She wants revenge, and with him devises a plot to provoke Carl into another attack.

The answer to the question: What society did the man who had poor command of the Czech language become chorus master of after returning from Sweden? is inside the article: In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper..., can you guess it ?

Q:Background: White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection. Paragraph: Stephanie is a nurse at the local high school.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Taylor's Rule on Fiscal Policy OK, in general I try not to do gotchas of the form “you say this, but you used to say that”. But I just happened to run across John Taylor’s latest, and it was just too funny not to mention. So, Taylor now says that we should not cite falling spending by state and local governments as a reason for the weak recovery. Why? Because, he says, such spending is endogenous: state and local governments cut spending in line with revenue. Basically, they’re cash constrained; so what can you expect? But wait: Taylor has prominently argued (pdf) that the Obama stimulus, and specifically the part that involved aid to state and local governments, was ineffective, because the state and local governments just used the money to pay down debt — that is, giving them more cash wouldn’t have mattered. I’m sure that Taylor will come up with some reason these statements aren’t diametrically opposed. But from here it looks like the Taylor rule on fiscal policy is that Obama is always wrong, and that state and local governments are either cash-constrained or not cash-constrained, depending on which assertion is needed to back up that position.","completion":"This news article discusses John Taylor's stance on fiscal policy. Taylor argues that falling spending by state and local governments should not be cited as a reason for the weak economic recovery. He believes that such spending is endogenous, meaning state and local governments cut spending in line with revenue, and since they are cash-constrained, there isn't much flexibility. However, the article points out a contradiction in Taylor's arguments. Taylor has also argued that the Obama stimulus package, which provided aid to state and local governments, was ineffective, as those governments simply used the money to pay down debt. This means that Taylor believes that providing additional cash wouldn't have made a significant difference. The author suggests that there is an inconsistency in Taylor's arguments, as he seems to switch between considering state and local governments as either cash-constrained or not, depending on which position supports his assertion that Obama's policies were ineffective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education, Durer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend Willibald Pirckheimer, whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images. He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars.

Write some highlights for the following article: During her darkest hours in captivity, former Colombian hostage Ingrid Betancourt considered death preferable to her ordeal, she said in an interview with CNN's \\"Connect the World.\\" Betancourt, who was kidnapped in 2002 during her campaign for the presidency and rescued in 2008, wrote about her experience in a new book, \\"Even Silence Has an End.\\" She recalled that late in her captivity at the hands of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, she became very ill. FARC declined to give her medication, and had her lie in a hammock for months, she said. Betancourt had seen other hostages die in similar circumstances in the jungle. \\"And because I was in so much in pain in my body and I was kind of unplugging mentally, in the sense that I couldn't just concentrate on anything, I thought that perhaps it was a good moment to just, you know,\\" Betancourt said, referring to dying. In that moment, she said, she preferred death because it would reunite her with her father. \\"And, also, I thought that it could be a liberation thing for my children, because they had to stop their lives,\\" Betancourt said. That feeling was just one episode in her 6 1/2 years in captivity. Writing the book, she said, brought her to \\"very deep memories, to places I thought I had forgotten and to situations that were very painful.\\" The writing process would leave her physically exhausted at the end of the day. Betancourt was freed in a high-profile helicopter rescue mission in July 2008. Colombian commandos posed as humanitarian aid workers to free the group, which included three U.S. military contractors and 11 Colombian police and military members. Her book is not the first to touch on her time as a hostage. In a memoir published last year, the U.S. military contractors rescued along with Betancourt painted an unflattering portrait of the dual citizen of France and Colombia, describing her as someone who hoarded belongings and let her temper flare during their time in the rebel camp. For her part, Betancourt admits that she was not the most popular. \\"We hear the news and they talk about the hostages and the only name that comes up on and on and on is mine,\\" she said. \\"By not having their names, it was just another humiliation. It was just another torture for them, not knowing if people knew they were there, what was happening with their families.\\" The guerrillas who held them were also keen on keeping the hostages divided. This, she suspects, was so that they would not unite and attempt an escape together. Much of the guerrillas' treatment of their hostages was meant to be cruel and designed to strip away their identities, Betancourt said. \\"So, for me, it was important to preserve my dignity in the sense of preserving my soul, preserving the things that I thought were important for me to give. And that was a struggle,\\" she said. One way she did this was by showing defiance. When her captors ordered the hostages to identify themselves by numbers, she refused. Although her fellow hostages started counting off, when it came to be her turn, she just answered, \\"Ingrid Betancourt.\\" \\"I didn't want to be a number. I didn't want to be an object,\\" she said. \\"They were referring to us like cargo. And I thought that was horrible. And I didn't want them to get away with that. So I think I was a little like a troublemaker, in some aspects.\\" That streak also partly led to divisions between her and the other hostages, she said. After such lows, how did Betancourt survive the long years? \\"To put it in just one word, I think it was love,\\" she said. \\"The love of my children and the love of my mother.\\" Reflecting on the current political situation in Colombia, the former candidate said that the country is in better shape than when she was abducted. There remains, however, what she called a crucial problem: a disconnect between those who live in the cities very comfortably, and those in the countryside who are affected by the violence of the FARC and other rebel groups. \\"We have 4 million misplaced people in Colombia. And that's because of the war,\\" she said.","completion":"In a recent interview with CNN's \\"Connect the World\\", former Colombian hostage, Ingrid Betancourt, shared details about her harrowing experience in captivity. Betancourt was kidnapped in 2002 during her presidential campaign and was rescued in 2008. She has written a book about her ordeal, titled \\"Even Silence Has an End\\". During her late captivity period at the hands of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Betancourt fell very ill, but her captors refused to give her medication. Having witnessed other hostages die in the jungle under similar circumstances, she considered dying as a preferable option, as it would reunite her with her father and liberate her children, who had to put their lives on hold during her captivity. Writing the book enabled her to face deep memories she had thought were forgotten, although the process left her exhausted. Betancourt was eventually freed through a high-profile helicopter rescue mission in which Colombian commandos posed as humanitarian aid workers to free her and other hostages. In her book, she admits she was not the most popular hostage, as she tried to preserve her dignity and resist the cruel treatment intended to strip her and other hostages of their identities. This lead to divisions among the hostages, but her survival was fueled by the love for her children and her mother. Despite her previous challenges, Ingrid Betancourt believes that Colombia is in better shape now than when she was abducted. Nonetheless, she highlights the crucial problem of disconnect between those living comfortably in the cities and those in the countryside, who are affected by the violence of FARC and other rebel groups. This ongoing violence has led to the displacement of 4 million people in Colombia."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"I will provide an analysis of each concept separately and then compare them to determine if the questions are the same. 1. Nationalism: Nationalism is a political ideology that emphasizes the importance of a shared national identity, culture, and history as the basis of a country's unity and pride. Pros of nationalism: a. Unity: Nationalism brings people together under a common identity and fosters a sense of patriotism. b. Cultural preservation: It encourages the preservation of cultural heritage and traditions, which contribute to a country's unique identity. c. Encourages development and progress: National pride can motivate citizens to work together to achieve common goals, such as economic growth and technological advancement. d. Defense and security: A strong sense of national identity can help protect a country from external threats and promote the willingness to defend its interests. Cons of nationalism: a. Exclusionary and discriminatory: Nationalism can lead to xenophobia and discrimination against minority groups or immigrants. b. Potential for conflict: Nationalist sentiments can escalate tensions between countries and lead to conflict as nations strive to assert their dominance. c. Suppression of dissent: Nationalism can be used by governments or political leaders to suppress criticism and dissent, leading to the erosion of democratic values. d. Hindered cooperation: A strong focus on national interests can impede international cooperation and collaboration. 2. Mercantilism: Mercantilism is an economic theory and practice that promotes the idea that a nation's wealth and power are best served by accumulating gold and silver and by maintaining a favorable balance of trade. Pros of mercantilism: a. Economic growth: Mercantilism can encourage economic growth through increased exports and domestic production. b. Self-sufficiency: It promotes the development of domestic industries, reducing reliance on imports and enhancing the nation's self-sufficiency. c. Protective measures: Mercantilist policies, such as tariffs and quotas, can protect domestic industries from foreign competition. Cons of mercantilism: a. Reduction in global trade: Restrictive trade policies may limit global trade and lead to trade wars, negatively affecting the world economy. b. Inefficiency: Protectionism can lead to the growth of inefficient domestic industries that might not otherwise survive in a competitive market. c. Limitation on consumer choice: Restrictive trade policies may limit the range of products available to consumers, leading to higher prices and reduced choices. Are these questions the same? No, these questions are not the same. Nationalism concerns the political ideology that focuses on national identity, culture, and history, whereas mercantilism is an economic theory that emphasizes a favorable balance of trade and accumulation of wealth. While both concepts may share some overlapping elements, such as the focus on promoting national interests, they address different aspects of a nation's development and management."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: what does beyond the pale mean in ireland?","completion":"The phrase \\"beyond the pale\\" is an idiom that has its origins in Ireland but is now used colloquially across the English-speaking world. To understand the meaning of this phrase, it's essential to delve into its historical context, etymology, and contemporary usage. The term \\"pale\\" derives from the Latin word \\"palus,\\" which means a stake or a fence, particularly one made of wooden stakes. Hence, a \\"pale\\" refers to a boundary or a limit, marked by a fence or other similar structure. In medieval times, pales were employed to demarcate territories, lands, or jurisdictions. In Ireland, during the late 14th century, the English monarchy established an area known as the \\"English Pale\\" or simply \\"the Pale.\\" This region, located around present-day Dublin on the eastern coast of Ireland, was controlled and governed directly by the English Crown, and thus, English settlers inhabited it. The rest of the country, however, was predominantly occupied by independent native Irish lords. The Pale was established as a fortified boundary to protect the English settlers from the native Irish population, who were considered a potential threat. The physical boundary of the Pale was marked by a series of ditches, earthworks, and wooden fences known as the Paling. Within this secured territory, English laws and customs were strictly enforced, while the areas beyond were subject to Irish Brehon laws and local customs. The English viewed those living beyond the Pale as uncivilized, barbaric, and unruly, which formed the basis for the negative connotations associated with the idiom. Over time, the phrase \\"beyond the Pale\\" evolved to mean any behavior or action that is considered unacceptable, improper, or offensive, transcending social norms or values. It alludes to going past the established limits, pushing beyond the boundary of what is deemed tolerable. Today, people use this idiom in various contexts to describe actions or attitudes that are outrageous, shocking, or morally objectionable. In summary, the phrase \\"beyond the pale\\" has its roots in Ireland's history as an expression related to the English Pale. This term originally referred to the areas outside the jurisdiction of the English-controlled territory in Ireland and implied that those living in such areas were uncivilized or rough. Over time, the meaning of the phrase has shifted, and it is now used to describe actions or behaviors that are considered inappropriate, egregious, or beyond the accepted norm. While its direct connection to Ireland's history has diminished, the phrase continues to carry a sense of crossing the line of what is considered acceptable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"You can fish for perch and carp in the lake or for trout in the Riviyre d'Argent (Silver River), or just glide around the lake among the swans.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The water is crystal clear without pollution. \\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, it is not possible to conclusively determine whether the hypothesis \\"The water is crystal clear without pollution\\" is true or false. The premise provides information on the types of fish available in the lake and the Riviyre d'Argent (Silver River), as well as the presence of swans around the lake. However, it does not explicitly mention the water quality, clarity, or presence of pollution. While the presence of several fish species and swans can be seen as an indication of a certain level of water quality, these indicators alone are not sufficient to verify the hypothesis. There are a number of factors that can impact the health of aquatic ecosystems, and the presence of fish does not guarantee an absence of pollution or pristine water conditions. For example, perch and carp are known to be relatively tolerant of various water quality conditions, including those with some levels of pollution. Trout, on the other hand, usually require better water quality and are more sensitive to pollution. Although the presence of these different species can be indicative of better water quality than a body of water containing only pollution-tolerant species, it cannot be taken as a confirmation of crystal clear, pollution-free water. In addition, swans can sometimes tolerate water with less-than-optimal quality. The fact that swans are found around the lake doesn't necessarily confirm that the water is devoid of pollution. It is also essential to consider that various types of pollution may be present in a water body, including but not limited to chemical, biological, and thermal pollution. The presence of certain wildlife may indicate an absence of specific pollutants but not necessarily a complete lack of pollution. To determine whether the hypothesis is true or not, additional information and investigation would be needed. This could include direct observations of water clarity, chemical and biological testing for pollutants, monitoring of water quality parameters (such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, etc.), and an assessment of the overall health of the ecosystem's aquatic life and vegetation. In summary, while the presence of perch, carp, trout, and swans may suggest a certain level of water quality, it is not enough information to deduce whether the water is crystal clear and without pollution. Further research and evidence would be required to confirm or refute the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jonathan Harker, a journalist from London, returns home to Vanhelm to understand his roots and uncover the truth about his family's mysterious past. Upon his arrival, Jonathan finds a series of journals that date back hundreds of years, chronicling his ancestors' encounters with the legendary vampire, Count Dracula. As Jonathan delves deeper into his family's shadowy history, he realizes that the curse that has befallen them stems from a fateful encounter with Dracula when a young Harker had infiltrated the vampire's castle to destroy him. But instead of killing Dracula, the Harker ancestor was bitten and infected with the vampire curse. The dark secret has been passed down through generations of Harkers ever since, causing the villagers to shun and fear them. While exploring his family's cursed estate, Jonathan discovers a hidden room within the manor—a chamber where his ancestors have managed to imprison Dracula's spirit and keep their dreaded curse at bay. Now aware of the dangerous burden he has inherited, Jonathan finds himself in a race against time as the sealed chamber weakens, threatening to unleash the vengeful spirit of Dracula upon the world. As Jonathan struggles to understand the extent of his newfound responsibility, he enlists the help of Mina, a local historian and ancient folklore expert, who educates him on Van Helsing's thwarted attempts to eradicate the vampire. Together, they search for a cure to eradicate the Harker curse once and for all. Time is running short, and their actions haven't gone unnoticed. The townspeople, led by the conniving Mayor Radu, see Jonathan's investigation as a catalyst to awaken stronger evils. Desperate to stop them, the villagers rally together and storm the Harker manor, their fear igniting a chaotic and violent confrontation. In a climactic final battle, Jonathan and Mina confront the spirit of Dracula and contend with the enraged townsfolk. As the manor burns around them, Jonathan sacrifices himself in an attempt to bind Dracula's spirit and eliminate the curse plaguing his bloodline forever. Mina escapes the inferno and, armed with the knowledge of the Harker's trappings, vows to honor Jonathan's memory by helping those cursed by Dracula's touch. The Secrets of Harker's Curse is a thrilling and chilling narrative that combines the brooding atmosphere of Gothic horror with the gripping tension of a supernatural mystery.

With the addition of Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston just prior to the recording of Anodyne, Farrar and Tweedy's relationship became more tumultuous, leading to verbal altercations after concerts. In one account, Tweedy recalled: Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \\"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore. Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore.

The cat did not care for Felicia but loved Amy because Available choices: + Felicia cuddled the cat when it came near.; + Amy cuddled the cat when it came near.;","completion":"Amy cuddled the cat when it came near. From the moment Amy had brought home her newly adopted cat, Whiskers, she had felt an instant connection with the lovable feline. Whiskers was a beautiful calico with piercing blue eyes, a bushy tail, and an air of independence. Though she had two roommates, Felicia and Paul, it was clear to everyone in the household that Whiskers had taken a particular liking to Amy. Amy had a natural talent for understanding the needs and desires of animals, and Whiskers was no exception. Over time, she'd learned to recognize the subtle cues and body language that signaled when Whiskers wanted to be cuddled and when he merely wanted to be left alone. Unlike Felicia, who would often pick Whiskers up and snuggle with him against his will, Amy was always careful to pay attention to his signals and to respect his boundaries. Whiskers appreciated this sensitivity and, as a result, sought out Amy's company more often than anyone else's. But even as Amy and Whiskers grew closer, Felicia's repeated attempts to bond with the cat only served to push him away. Feeling a pang of sympathy for her roommate, Amy decided to talk to Felicia about what she'd observed and to offer some advice. The two friends sat down over tea, and Amy broached the subject cautiously. \\"Felicia, I know you love Whiskers, but I think he might feel smothered by the attention you give him,\\" Amy began. \\"Cats can be very independent creatures, and they need their space. You can't force Whiskers to love you by constantly cuddling him.\\" Felicia frowned, looking hurt. \\"I just want him to feel loved and welcomed,\\" she defended, her voice wavering slightly. Amy smiled gently and took her friend's hand. \\"I know you do,\\" she said reassuringly. \\"But you have to allow Whiskers to come to you on his own terms.\\" Over the next few weeks, Felicia followed Amy's advice by gradually giving Whiskers more and more space. She stopped picking him up at every opportunity and instead kept her distance, waiting for him to show signs of wanting to interact. As time went on, Felicia noticed subtle changes in Whiskers' behavior toward her. He began to approach her more often, meandering slowly towards her when she was sitting or lying on the couch. Eventually, Felicia began to experience the magical moment that all cat lovers dream of: the day she came home from work, collapsed onto the couch, and, without any prompting, Whiskers hopped up and curled up right beside her. From that day forward, Whiskers was much more amicable with Felicia, seeking out her company almost as often as he did Amy's. Felicia's newfound understanding of feline behavior, combined with her more cautious approach to handling Whiskers, had ultimately paid off. While Whiskers would always hold a special connection with Amy due to their early bond, he now also enjoyed a close and affectionate relationship with Felicia, finally completing the circle of trust and friendship within the household."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Vulkan Answer:","completion":"Title: Shadows of Vulkan Genre: Thriller/Mystery Plot Summary: In the seemingly peaceful town of Serenity Falls, Alex Palmer, a once-acclaimed investigative journalist, has been chasing leads on a secret criminal organization known as Vulkan. His life spirals out of control when he is fatefully knocked unconscious by the group's top enforcer. The twist of events surrounding this vicious attack propels Palmer to dig deeper into the heart of the conspiracy as he unravels the menacing truth about Vulkan and their hidden agenda. Act I: A series of inexplicable crimes have left the quaint town of Serenity Falls shaken, and Alex Palmer, a notable investigative journalist who has lost his credibility in recent years, sees this as his chance to redeem himself. Fueled by his passion for truth and justice, he has been covertly gathering information about the town's affairs, where signs ominously point to a single name: Vulkan. As Palmer gathers evidence, he discovers that Vulkan is a highly skilled and ruthless criminal organization shrouded in secrecy, with corrupt connections that extend far beyond the town's borders. Intrigued but forewarned, Palmer cautiously continues his pursuit. Act II: Palmer manages to get close to Vulkan's trusted insiders, camouflaging himself as a newcomer seeking opportunities in their illicit business. As he gains access to their plans, he becomes aware of Vulkan's extensive activities, involving illicit substance manufacturing, arms trafficking, and most shockingly - human experimentation. Despite his better judgment, Palmer finally decides to take them down, starting with their enforcer, the enigmatic and cunning Stanislaw \\"Shadow\\" Voronov. In an unexpected turn of events, Voronov detects Palmer's surveillance and confronts him at a secluded warehouse. A fierce altercation ensues, resulting in Palmer being knocked unconscious and left for dead. Little did Voronov know, this would provide Palmer with the ideal opportunity to stage his disappearance and delve even deeper into Vulkan's operations. Act III: Now returned to his journalistic roots, an unyielding Palmer spearheads an investigative team under an alias. As they painstakingly gather evidence against the shadowy organization, they become entangled with those who once trusted and protected Palmer – including local law enforcement and a dedicated sister-in-arms, the intuitive and relentless Detective Lana Stone. As Lana probes Palmer's \\"disappearance\\" alongside his investigations, she unearths a tangled web of conspiracy and deceit that extends even to her very own department. Act IV: As tensions rise, and Vulkan's grip on Serenity Falls tightens, Palmer and his team infiltrate Vulkan's central hub of operations – a hidden underground facility beneath the town. The team stealthily gathers evidence that exposes Vulkan's ulterior motives in Serenity Falls – including the forced mutation of innocent civilians for military experiments. Amidst the chaos and horrors of the secret facility, Palmer again comes face to face with Voronov. In a breathtaking standoff that pushes both men to their limits, Palmer finally gains the upper hand, incapacitates Voronov, and takes him into custody. Act V: In the shocking climax, Palmer and his team work alongside a now-enlightened Lana to bring Vulkan's deeds to light. The exposed organization crumbles under the weight of its secrets, and Serenity Falls is ultimately liberated from the clutches of Vulkan. As a result, the town begins a steady path to recovery, and Alex Palmer's reputation as a fearless and committed journalist is redeemed. Unbeknownst to the town, however, Vulkan's larger network remains at large – leaving the possibility of retribution hanging ominously in the air."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In which City is La Fenice Opera House?","completion":"La Fenice Opera House, also known as Teatro La Fenice, is located in the enchanting city of Venice, Italy. Venice is known for its intricate network of canals, waterways, and historic architecture. It is situated in the northeastern part of Italy, spread across 118 small islands in the Venetian Lagoon, which lies between the mouths of the Po and Piave rivers. La Fenice, which translates to \\"The Phoenix\\" in English, is one of the most famous and renowned opera houses in Europe. It holds great historical and cultural significance dating back to its establishment in 1792. The opera house boasts a fascinating history of resilience, as it has risen from the ashes twice after devastating fires in 1836 and 1996, staying true to its name. Teatro La Fenice was originally designed by Gian Antonio Selva, a noted Italian neoclassical architect. The facade of the opera house is a stunning display of neo-classical style architecture. The interior, richly adorned with gold leaf and lush red upholstery, presents an awe-inspiring atmosphere for audiences. Its magnificent five-tiered auditorium can seat over 1000 spectators, and the stage is equipped with state-of-the-art technology to host spectacular performances. La Fenice has played a crucial role in the history of opera, as it has hosted the premieres of numerous masterpieces, including operas by famous composers like Gioachino Rossini, Vincenzo Bellini, and Giuseppe Verdi. Some of the most iconic operas to have premiered at La Fenice include Verdi's \\"Rigoletto,\\" \\"La Traviata,\\" and \\"Simon Boccanegra.\\" The opera house has also been a platform for many rising talents in the world of opera and continues to be a key player in fostering the growth of this art form. In addition to hosting operas, Teatro La Fenice is also a prominent venue for other performing arts like ballet, orchestral concerts, and chamber music recitals. The Venice Film Festival, which is part of the Venice Biennale, also hosts some of its events and screenings at the opera house. Visitors from around the world flock to Venice to experience its unique charm and rich history, and a visit to La Fenice Opera House remains at the top of their must-see list.

It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60 students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona.

Carabane's kindergarten is located in a community house, called \\"House of Women and Children,\\" founded in 1988 under the auspices of Caritas Ziguinchor.

Soon the conflict spilled over to other parts of the Caucasus, and on August 5, 1905, the first conflict between the Armenian and Azeri population of Shusha took place. In March 1918 ethnic and religious tensions grew and the Armenian-Azeri conflict in Baku began. Musavat and Committee of Union and Progress parties were accused of Pan-Turkism by Bolsheviks and their allies. Armenian and Muslim militias engaged in armed confrontations, which resulted in heavy casualties. Many Muslims were expelled from Baku or went underground. Meanwhile, the arrest of Gen. Talyshinski, the commander of the Azerbaijani division, and some of its officers—all of whom arrived in Baku on March 9—increased anti-Soviet feelings among the city's Azeri population. On 30 March the Soviets, based on the unfounded report that the Muslim crew of the ship Evelina was armed and ready to revolt against the Soviets, disarmed the crew which tried to resist. This led to three days fighting,resulting in the death of up to 12,000 Azeris. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Step-by-Step process with justification: 1. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is now present in the bloodstream and needs to be removed from the body. This is important because high levels of CO2 can lead to health issues and interfere with the body's natural processes. 2. The carbon dioxide travels back from the bloodstream through the capillaries to the alveoli. This occurs because CO2 is less concentrated in the alveoli than in the bloodstream, and gases move from higher concentrations to lower concentrations, following the principle of diffusion. 3. The CO2 is then transported from the alveoli, up through the bronchioles, and into the bronchi. The bronchi and bronchioles are part of the respiratory system that function as a pathway for inhaled and exhaled air. 4. The carbon dioxide continues its journey by moving through the trachea, or windpipe. The trachea helps maintain an open airway to prevent the lungs from collapsing. 5. Finally, the carbon dioxide is expelled from the body as we exhale. This occurs through the contraction of the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles (muscles between the ribs). These muscle contractions help to push the air out of the lungs and ensure efficient removal of CO2 from the body, marking the conclusion of the respiratory process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Wilhelmus Simon Petrus Fortuijn, known as Pim Fortuyn (Dutch: ['pIm for'toeyn] ( listen); 19 February 1948 - 6 May 2002), was a Dutch politician, civil servant, sociologist, author and professor who formed his own party, Pim Fortuyn List (Lijst Pim Fortuyn or LPF) in 2002. Fortuyn was often regarded as controversial due to his outspoken views about multiculturalism, immigration and Islam in the Netherlands. He called Islam \\"a backward culture\\", and was quoted as saying that if it were legally possible, he would close the borders for Muslim immigrants. He was labelled a far-right populist by his opponents and in the media, but he fiercely rejected this label. On 6 May 2002, at age 54, Fortuyn was assassinated in Hilversum, North Holland, by Volkert van der Graaf. The attack took place in a parking lot outside a radio studio where Fortuyn had just given an interview. This was nine days before the general election, for which he was running. The attacker was pursued by Hans Smolders, Fortuyn's driver, and was arrested by the police shortly afterward, still in possession of a handgun. Months later, Van der Graaf confessed in court to the first notable political assassination in the Netherlands since 1672 (excluding World War II), and on 15 April 2003, he was convicted of assassinating Fortuyn and sentenced to 18 years in prison. He was released on parole in May 2014 after serving two thirds of his sentence, the standard procedure under the Dutch penal system. The assassination shocked many residents of the Netherlands and highlighted the cultural clashes within the country. Various conspiracy theories arose after Pim Fortuyn's murder and deeply affected Dutch politics and society. Politicians from all parties suspended campaigning. After consultation with LPF, the government decided not to postpone the elections. As Dutch law did not permit modifying the ballots, Fortuyn became a posthumous candidate. The LPF made an unprecedented debut in the House of Representatives by winning 26 seats (17% of the 150 seats in the house). The LPF joined a cabinet with the Christian Democratic Appeal and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, but conflicts in the rudderless LPF quickly collapsed the cabinet, forcing new elections. By the following year, the party had lost support, winning only eight seats in the 2003 elections. It won no seats in the 2006 elections, by which time the Party for Freedom, led by Geert Wilders, had emerged as a successor. During the last months of his life, Fortuyn had become closer to the Catholic Church. To the surprise of many commentators and Dutch TV hosts, Fortuyn insisted on Fr. Louis Berger, a parish priest from The Hague, accompanying him in some of his last TV appearances. According to the New York Times, Berger had become his \\"friend and confessor\\" during the last weeks of his life. Fortuyn was initially buried in Driehuis in the Netherlands. He was re-interred on 20 July 2002, at San Giorgio della Richinvelda, in the province of Pordenone in Italy, where he had owned a house.","completion":"This text is about Wilhelmus Simon Petrus Fortuijn, also known as Pim Fortuyn.

Options are: i. ask the photographer to edit their photographs by data moshing.; ii. ask the musicians that play to record their performance from that day.;...I think the answer is","completion":"For reliving moments from a wedding more easily, both of the given options can be helpful in different ways, depending on your preferences and priorities. Let's delve deeper into each method and analyze their aspects to determine which one might be more suitable for accomplishing your goal. Option i: Ask the photographer to edit their photographs by data moshing. Data moshing is a technique that manipulates and distorts the data of digital media files to create glitches, errors, or artifacts in the final result. This creates a unique, artistic, and sometimes surreal aesthetic in the final output. By asking the photographer to incorporate this technique into the wedding photographs, you'll get a collection of images that are visually striking and memorable, which might cause these moments to stand out more when you look back on them. However, data moshing can often result in unrecognizable or outright abstract images, which may not be ideal for those looking to relive the wedding day with accurate visuals. Therefore, this option may not be the best solution for everyone. Option ii: Ask the musicians that play to record their performance from that day. Music has the power to evoke strong memories and emotions, making it a crucial part of any wedding ceremony and celebration. By asking the musicians that played at your wedding to record their performance, you'll have a tangible souvenir of the event that can help transport you back in time whenever you listen to it. This option will allow you to relive the exact atmosphere and ambiance that the live music created during your special day, and you can share this recording with others who attended or even those who were unable to make it to the wedding. In conclusion, while data moshing the wedding photographs could provide a unique visual perspective to relive the memorable moments, it might not offer a true representation of the actual experience. On the other hand, having a recording of the musicians' performance would enable you to relive the atmosphere and emotions tied to the wedding day more effectively. Therefore, considering the goal of reliving moments from a wedding more easily, option ii (asking the musicians to record their performance) appears to be a more reasonable and effective approach. This method provides a more immersive experience and has the potential to evoke vivid memories associated with the sights and sounds of your special day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","completion":"The supposed perturbation of less rain happening would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. To understand this, let's break down the steps and see how less rain influences the streams and rivers. 1. A large rocky area is formed. - Less rain won't have a direct impact on the formation of the rocky area. 2. The rocky area has a higher elevation than the surrounding areas. - Rain has no direct influence on elevation. This step is not impacted by the perturbation. 3. Water from precipitation falls in the area. - Here, less rain will have an indirect impact. With less precipitation, there will be less water falling in the area, which would affect the quantity of water available to form streams and rivers. 4. The water forms a stream. - Since less rain is an indirect impact on the amount of water from precipitation, this step will also be indirectly impacted. With less water present, it may take longer for streams to form or the streams could be smaller or less frequent. 5. The stream flows towards lower elevation. - This step is not directly impacted by less rain, but the size, flow, and frequency of the streams could be affected due to an indirect impact on the amount of water in the system. 6. The stream becomes a river. - Less rain can have an indirect impact on this step as well. With less flow in the streams, it might take more time for them to grow large enough to become rivers or the rivers themselves may be smaller in size and flow. 7. The river continues to flow along the same path for a long time. - This step is not directly impacted by less rain. However, indirectly, rivers with less flow might have a different flow path over time, which might result in less erosion compared to rivers with higher amounts of water flow. 8. The river erodes the rocky area that it touches. - With less rain leading to a reduced water flow in the streams and rivers, this step will be indirectly impacted. When less water flows through a river, the erosive power is also decreased, which would reduce the amount of erosion on the rocky areas. 9. The eroded area cuts deeply into the rock. - Similarly, this step would also be indirectly impacted. With less erosion taking place, the depth of the cut in the rock will be affected. In general, less rain indirectly leads to a decreased degree of erosion and more shallow cuts in the rocks. In summary, less rain will indirectly impact several steps in the process, which include the flow and erosion rate of streams and rivers. Consequently, these impacts can alter the features and dynamics associated with the formation and progression of the streams and rivers in the described scenario."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the background: During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states. and the situation: Jennifer is looking to move to a new city.

There was a bone pin that may have been from a piece of clothing such as a leather coat. He carried a copper knife on his breast. The most amazing find was two gold earrings. That would have made him a man of distinction. Only a few centimeters from his head were two pots made of clay, tools and materials to make arrows, a bow and a dozen arrows for hunting and a second, smaller copper knife. Next to them lay a cushion stone, upon which the man could work metal. His grave is the richest of any found from that period, because this man was buried with two gold earrings which are the oldest gold ever found in Britain (dated to 2470 BC). Besides, he was buried three miles from Stonehenge. Archaeologists tend to believe he was a member of a powerful class who might have organized the construction of Stonehenge. Stonehenge was begun around 3000 BC. In about 2300 BC the huge stone circles were built. The biggest stone weighed approximately 20 tons. But the smaller blue stones, still weighing 4 tons on average, came from west Wales. It is not yet known how these were conveyed over a distance of 380 km. It is also a mystery how early man was able to construct Stonehenge without the use of modern construction machines and lorries. He is an example of people who brought culture and new techniques from the European mainland to Britain.

Instead, the practice has evolved over time, with different cultures and individuals contributing significantly to its development. Here are some noteworthy individuals and cultures associated with the early development of medicine. 1. Ancient civilizations: Various ancient cultures had their practices related to medicine, such as the Sumerians in Mesopotamia, who documented their knowledge in medical tablets. Egyptians also made strides in medical knowledge, as evident in the Edwin Smith Papyrus, a comprehensive medical text dating back to 1600 BCE. 2. Imhotep (Egypt, 27th Century BCE): Imhotep, an Egyptian polymath, is considered one of the earliest known physicians in recorded history.

Nancy Elizabeth Lieberman (born July 1, 1958), nicknamed \\"Lady Magic\\", is a former professional basketball player who played and coached in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) and currently works as an assistant coach for the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA, as well as head coach of the Power in the BIG3. Lieberman is regarded as one of the greatest figures in American women's basketball. In 2000, she was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame. Lieberman is a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame and the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. Lieberman was born in Brooklyn, New York, on July 1, 1958, to Jerome and Renee Lieberman. She was raised Jewish, but has become a born-again Christian. Her family lived in Brooklyn, when she was born, but soon moved to Far Rockaway, New York where she grew up with her older brother Clifford. Her mother brought up the children after a separation and divorce. While growing up, she was very interested in a variety of sports, playing baseball, softball and football with boys, before settling on basketball as her primary sport. She played basketball primarily on pickup teams with boys, not playing on a girls' team until she was a high school sophomore. While attending Far Rockaway High School in Queens, New York, she established herself as one of the top women's basketball players in the country by earning one of only 12 slots on the USA's National Team. In 1975, Lieberman was named to the USA Team designated to play in the World Championships and Pan American Games, where she brought home a gold medal Lieberman's mother, Renee, was not supportive of her daughter's passion for basketball. During one instance when Lieberman was practicing dribbling techniques indoors, because it was cold outside, her mother demanded she stop dribbling because of all the noise. When she did not stop, her mother punctured the basketball with a screwdriver. Lieberman found another ball and continued, but her mother punctured that one as well. This continued until five balls were ruined. Nancy then decided she had better go outside before she ran out of basketballs. During the school year, she played for her high school team, but in the summer, played with an AAU team in Harlem, the New York Chuckles.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: was she married?","completion":"Yes, Nancy Lieberman was married.

Please answer the following question: Fact 1: Insulin helps cells take up glucose from the blood. Fact 2: If there is a lot of glucose in the blood, the pancreas makes insulin. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"what does insulin take up?\\" with the following options: - warmth - heat - pancreas - glucose - sugar - Energy - fructose - Energy. A:","completion":"Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, specifically by the beta cells in the Islets of Langerhans. Insulin plays a vital role in the regulation of blood glucose levels, which is essential for maintaining the body's overall health and functioning. Based on Fact 1 and Fact 2 provided, we can analyze the options and answer the question \\"what does insulin take up?\\" - Option A: warmth - Insulin does not take up warmth. Warmth is a sensation related to temperature, which is not associated with insulin's primary function in the body. - Option B: heat - Similar to warmth, insulin does not take up heat. Heat also refers to the transfer of energy through conduction, convection, or radiation, which is not linked to the function of insulin. - Option C: pancreas - Insulin is produced by the pancreas, but it does not take up the pancreas. The role of insulin is associated with regulating glucose levels in the blood, not the pancreas itself. - Option D: glucose - This is the correct answer. Insulin helps cells take up glucose from the bloodstream. When glucose levels rise, the pancreas secretes more insulin, which allows the body's cells to absorb and store the excess glucose, effectively decreasing the blood sugar levels to a normal range. - Option E: sugar - This option is also correct, as glucose is a type of sugar. Insulin helps regulate the levels of sugar (glucose) in the bloodstream. Glucose is the main source of energy for the body's cells, so maintaining stable sugar levels is crucial for overall health and functioning. - Option F: Energy - While glucose serves as a primary source of energy for cells, the role of insulin is to regulate glucose levels in the blood. Therefore, it wouldn't be accurate to say that insulin takes up energy directly. - Option G: fructose - Insulin does not directly take up fructose. Fructose is another type of sugar but, unlike glucose, it is processed differently by the body. While it can be converted into glucose in the liver, insulin's primary function is still regulating glucose levels in the blood. - Option H: Energy - As mentioned earlier in Option F, insulin is not directly responsible for taking up energy. To conclude, based on the facts provided and the available options, it is accurate to say that insulin takes up glucose and, by extension, sugar. This process regulates blood sugar levels, maintaining a stable environment within the body and providing the necessary energy for the cells to function optimally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: This article: Shackleton's first task, on arriving at the Stromness station, was to arrange for his three companions at Peggoty Camp to be picked up. A whaler was sent round the coast, with Worsley aboard to show the way, and by the evening of 21 May all six of the James Caird party were safe.It took four attempts before Shackleton was able to return to Elephant Island to rescue the party stranded there. He first left South Georgia a mere three days after he had arrived in Stromness, after securing the use of a large whaler, The Southern Sky, which was laid up in Husvik Harbour. Shackleton assembled a volunteer crew, which had it ready to sail by the morning of 22 May. As the vessel approached Elephant Island they saw that an impenetrable barrier of pack ice had formed, some 70 miles (110 km) from their destination. The Southern Sky was not built for ice breaking, and retreated to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands.On reaching Port Stanley, Shackleton informed London by cable of his whereabouts, and requested that a suitable vessel be sent south for the rescue operation. He was informed by the Admiralty that nothing was available before October, which in his view was too late. Then, with the help of the British Minister in Montevideo, Shackleton obtained from the Uruguayan government the loan of a tough trawler, Instituto de Pesca No. 1, which started south on 10 June. Again the pack thwarted them. In search of another ship, Shackleton, Worsley and Crean travelled to Punta Arenas, where they met Allan MacDonald, the British owner of the schooner Emma. McDonald equipped this vessel for a further rescue attempt, which left on 12 July, but with the same negative result—the pack defeated them yet again. Shackleton later named a glacier after McDonald on the Brunt Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea. After problems arose in identifying this glacier, a nearby ice rise was renamed the McDonald Ice Rumples.By now it was mid-August, more than three months since Shackleton had left Elephant Island.

Q: Recently the subject of discrimination has been something I have been thinking a lot about. It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.

Around 24,000 troops stationed around Afghanistan sat down for their traditional turkey dinners. For many it will be their last with the end of NATO combat operations on December 31. Huge shipments of meat, along with the essential cranberry sauce and pies, were also flown to Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan and Kosovo. Food packages, were also sent to West African nations Liberia and Senegal - where around 2,000 service members are fighting the Ebola outbreak. Scroll down for video. Troops grab their trays and head to the tables to sit down for their last Thanksgiving meal in Kabul, Afghanistan, ahead of the end of combat operations on December 31. Service men and women lined tables in the NATO based and tucked into the traditional meal which included cranberry sauce and pies that had been shipped in especially from the United States. Troops stand along the serving hub in Camp Bondtseel near the village of Sojevo in Kosovo where the NATO-led peacekeeping mission in the country, KFOR, is based.

A U.S. soldier carries a plate of food during a Thanksgiving meal at a NATO base in Kabul. A server greets another comrade with a smile as he hands over his tray in Camp Bondsteel near the Kosovan village of Sojeva. In his Thanksgiving address, President Obama paid tribute to the soldiers stationed across the globe for their continued bravery. He said: 'Today, we are grateful to all Americans who do their part to live by those ideals, including our brave men and women in uniform overseas and their families, who sacrifice so much to keep America safe. 'To our service members who are away from home, we say an extra prayer for you and your loved ones, and we renew our commitment to take care of you as well as you've taken care of us.' Anthony Amendolia from the Defence Logistics Agency (DLA), who makes sure soldiers get their Thanksgiving food, told the US Army website: 'Since they can't be home for the holidays, our team is dedicated to bringing the holidays to them. 'Whether they're stationed on a remote base in Afghanistan, or a field hospital in West Africa, they'll be eating a traditional American Thanksgiving meal on November 27.' The agency reported that 2,000 pounds of turkey, 300 pounds of cranberry sauce, and 500 pies will be sent to Liberia, while 600 pounds of turkey, 75 pounds of cranberry sauce, and 200 pies were sent to Senegal. As many as 5,000 meals were served in each location - and troops even had the choice of apple, cherry, pumpkin, pecan or sweet potato pie. As many of 24,000 troops are stationed in Afghanistan and are set to leave by the end of the year.

While the subsistence team typically starts planning to ship holiday meal six months in advance, military operations in West Africa only began two months ago. It meant that the turkeys had to be airlifted to the bases in time for them to be served. Two days ago it was revealed that some personnel returning to Joint Base Lewis-McChord from Africa will spend Thanksgiving in isolation while the Army monitors their health for signs of Ebola. The group arriving Tuesday evening includes 15 service members and one Defense Department civilian who built facilities in Liberia to fight the fatal disease, the Army said. They were not exposed to Ebola-infected patients and the risk that they picked up the fatal disease is very minimal, said I Corps Maj. Mary Ricks. Because they have no symptoms, the isolation is called controlled monitoring rather than quarantine, Ricks said Tuesday. They'll have their temperature taken twice a day during their stay, which won't be a full 21 days because they've already spent some time in Germany. Lewis-McChord is not their home base. They come from all over the country and one is stationed overseas, Ricks said. Servicemen queue up patiently alongside piled-up trays and cutlery as they await their well-deserved turkey in Kosovo.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what does extreme heat and pressure change rock into?\\" is \\"calcite\\", given that extreme heat and pressure change rock into slate? Choose from: --Yes. --No. Answer:","completion":"No. Extreme heat and pressure within the Earth's crust can transform existing rock into metamorphic rock. This process is known as metamorphism. Examples of metamorphic rocks are slate, schist, and gneiss, which can form from shale, mudstone or basalt under these high pressure and temperature conditions. So, if the given situation is saying that extreme heat and pressure change rock into slate, it suggests that the rock in question is being metamorphosed into a type of metamorphic rock, not a mineral like calcite. Calcite is a mineral composed of calcium carbonate, not a type of rock. While calcite is indeed found within various rock structures and can be formed through sedimentary processes, it is not the type of rock that would be formed solely through the application of extreme heat and pressure. Thus, given the information, the right answer to the question \\"what does extreme heat and pressure change rock into?\\" is not \\"calcite,\\" particularly under the given stipulation that extreme heat and pressure change rock into slate. It should be noted that rocks contain several minerals and can be made up of calcite. Limestone and marble are examples of rocks with high calcite content. But extreme heat and pressure would change a rock like limestone into marble, not into a mineral like calcite. In summary, extreme heat and pressure transform rocks not into single minerals like calcite, but into different types of rock like slate, schist, or gneiss, depending on the original rock or what's called the \\"parent rock.\\" The process of transformation is complex and can involve the recrystallization of minerals, the growth of new minerals, and the alignment of mineral grains that can impact the overall appearance, texture, and composition of the final metamorphic rock."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write the text above using proper case.","completion":"These findings can guide the design of strategies and actions that have a greater chance of being effectively implemented. This information is crucial when developing plans and initiatives, as it allows for a better understanding of what works and what does not in various contexts. By using these insights, policymakers, organizations, and individuals can tailor their approaches and interventions to achieve more significant outcomes and lasting impacts. When designing strategies and actions, it is essential to consider several factors. These include understanding the target audience, setting clear goals and objectives, identifying barriers and facilitators to implementation, and continuously monitoring and evaluating progress. By incorporating these aspects into the development process, the likelihood of successful implementation becomes higher. Firstly, knowing the target audience is critical when designing an effective strategy. This involves researching the demographics, needs, preferences, and values of the intended beneficiaries. It is also important to involve stakeholders such as community members, professionals, and policymakers in the planning process. Taking their perspectives into account can lead to more culturally appropriate and contextually relevant interventions. Secondly, setting clear goals and objectives for the project is crucial. These should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART). By having well-defined targets, it becomes easier to track and measure progress towards their achievement. Furthermore, this can help to maintain focus on the most important tasks and activities required for successful implementation. Thirdly, identifying barriers and facilitators to implementation can provide valuable insights into what hinders or accelerates progress. This can be done through literature reviews, consultations with experts, and discussions with intended beneficiaries. Some common barriers include lack of resources, inadequate training, poor communication, and resistance to change. Facilitators, on the other hand, can include strong leadership, clear communication channels, and supportive organizational culture. By addressing these factors, actions can be designed to overcome obstacles and take advantage of opportunities for success. Fourthly, monitoring and evaluation are essential for ensuring the effective implementation of strategies and actions. This involves systematically collecting, analyzing, and using data to improve performance and achieve desired outcomes. Monitoring should be done continuously throughout the implementation process, whereas evaluation usually occurs at specific points in time, such as mid-term or end-of-project assessments. By tracking progress and learning from successes and failures, it becomes possible to make necessary adjustments to improve the strategy. In conclusion, by using these findings to guide the design of strategies and actions, a greater chance of effective implementation can be achieved. Taking into account the target audience, setting clear goals and objectives, identifying barriers and facilitators, and continuously monitoring and evaluating progress can significantly improve the likelihood of success in achieving intended outcomes. As such, it is crucial for policymakers, organizations, and individuals to incorporate these elements into their planning processes to create impactful and lasting positive change."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Determine if Sentence 2 logically follows from Sentence 1. - To be entailed, the second sentence needs to rely on the information presented in the first sentence. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the two sentences. - Sentence 1 describes the 20th century in a negative light ('Disappointing'). - Sentence 2 mentions Woody Allen's hope for a better future.

The two responded by expressing their displeasure. \\"We urge the United States to stop deliberately distorting China's strategic intentions and abandon a Cold War mentality,\\" said a Foreign Ministry rep. \\"Otherwise it will injure others and damage itself.\\" The Chinese Embassy in Washington chimed in with this: \\"It is selfish to put your national interest above other countries' interest and the mutual interest of the international community.

The AP notes Trump didn't just take a swing at China, but poked it, too, by reiterating ties with Taiwan.

He said that countries like China and Russia were doing things that made it hard for America to be safe and happy. They were making powerful weapons, taking ideas that belonged to America, and giving lots and lots of money to countries that were not so lucky. China and Russia didn't like what President Trump said. They told America that they should not think that way about China and Russia, and they should learn to be friends with them instead. It's not nice to think only about yourself and not care about other countries, they said. Some people said that there were still ways for the countries to be friends and work together, but that President Trump's ideas sounded a bit like the old times, when countries wanted to be the only boss of the whole world. But President Trump didn't only talk about China. He also said that America wanted to keep their old friends and make them strong, like Taiwan, the Philippines, and Vietnam. These countries sometimes disagree with China about who can use parts of the sea that are really close to them.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the full birth name of the person who was declared the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time? , can you please find it? Chrismansyah Rahadi ([xrisˈmanʃah raˈhadi]; 16 September 1949 – 30 March 2007), born Christian Rahadi but better known by his stage name of Chrisye ([xəˈriʃə]), was an Indonesian progressive pop singer and songwriter. In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia's list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine.

Little Hans loved to walk with his father in the woods, where he could pick wild flowers and hear the birds sing. His father read to him when his work was done, or told him stories. What his father did helped him open up a new world. Once, when Hans was still a child, he went into a wheat field with his mother and a number of children, to pick the rest wheat which the reapers had left in the field.

During a caucus, voters gather at designated locations at a specific time to select the candidate of their choice. Check your local or state election website to find out if your state will be voting by caucus. 2020 caucus states include: Alaska, Iowa, Kansas, Maine and Wyoming (both parties) Nevada, Washington, and North Dakota (Democrats only) Hawaii and Kentucky (Republicans only) If your party holds primary elections by caucus, they will select caucus locations throughout your state. Visit the official state website for your party to find out where you must go to participate in a caucus. For example, if you live in Iowa and want to participate in the Democratic caucus, visit https://iowademocrats.org/. To participate in the Republican caucus, go to https://www.iowagop.org/. Your caucus location may be different from your regular polling place (e.g., where you would go to vote in the General Presidential Election). Visit your party’s state website or go to the U.S. Vote Foundation’s website to find out when your caucus will take place. Since caucuses take the form of a large meeting rather than an individual ballot voting process that is spread out throughout the day, you’ll need to arrive at a specific time in order to participate. For example, the 2020 Iowa Democratic and Republican caucuses both began at 7:00 PM on February 3. It’s best to arrive slightly before the designated time (e.g., 30 minutes ahead of time) so that you can check in and go to the designated area. During a typical caucus, you’ll have an opportunity to listen to the candidates or their representatives talk about the issues and their positions. Candidates who can’t be there or send representatives from their campaigns may provide pamphlets or other literature for you to look at. If you haven’t already done so, decide which candidate(s) you want to support based on the information presented at the caucus. During the caucus, you may have an opportunity to vote for your preferred candidate by straw poll, or election officials may ask you to physically move to a space that represents your favorite candidate. Follow the directions at your caucus location to determine how to cast your vote. For example, in the Iowa Republican Caucus, caucus-goers write down their preferred candidates on a paper ballot. In the Nevada Democratic caucus, attendees are divided up into “Presidential preference groups.” Election officials then tally up the number of people in each group to determine if a candidate has enough votes to be considered “viable” (e.g., 15% or more of the votes). If your candidate doesn’t get enough votes to be considered viable in the first round of voting, you may have an opportunity to join a different group or vote for your second choice. You can also try to convince other caucus-goers to join your group. After some caucuses, you’ll have an opportunity to stay after the votes are cast and suggest “platform planks.” If you have ideas about issues that you would like incorporated into the official state platform for your party, now is the time to introduce them. If you prefer, you can leave after the nominating contest ends. You aren’t obligated to stay for party business.","completion":"Some states select candidates by having people meet at special places called caucuses. They listen to what the candidates have to say or read about them. Then, these people choose the candidates they like by voting or moving to a special area.

Although Italian cities remained inhabited, they contracted significantly in size. Rome, for instance, shrank from a population of hundreds of thousands to around 30,000 by the end of the 6th century. Roman temples were converted into Christian churches and city walls remained in use. In Northern Europe, cities also shrank, while civic monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials. The establishment of new kingdoms often meant some growth for the towns chosen as capitals. Although there had been Jewish communities in many Roman cities, the Jews suffered periods of persecution after the conversion of the empire to Christianity. Officially they were tolerated, if subject to conversion efforts, and at times were even encouraged to settle in new areas.

The prostate is a gland in men that sits low in the abdomen, and when it gets enlarged it squeezes the urethra. This causes slow flow, difficulty starting to urinate, dribbling, and a weak stream. It is very common for men to get enlarged prostates after the age of 60. This condition is called Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH, which is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate. If you have urinary trouble, see your doctor to be checked for BPH. BPH is very common, but prostate cancer – though much less common – can also enlarge your prostate and cause urinary symptoms. It’s important to have your prostate checked regularly starting at age 50 (or earlier if a relative had prostate cancer). There are several simple changes that you can make to your bathroom habits to help minimize your symptoms. Some things to try include: Go twice. Try to empty your bladder twice each time you go to the bathroom. Relax and take your time. Try taking some deep breaths while you wait for your urine to start flowing. Give yourself plenty of time and don’t worry if it takes a while. Try reading a magazine or a book while you wait. Sit down to urinate. If you usually urinate standing up, then sitting down might help to relax you and make it easier for you to urinate. Turn on the faucet. The sound of running water may also help you to go. If this isn’t an option, then try to imagine the sound of running water. Stay hydrated. You might be frustrated with your low urine flow and want to avoid urinating as much as possible, but not drinking enough water can make matters worse. Drink water throughout the day and avoid drinking it late in the evening so you won’t have to get up as much during the night. Avoid dehydrating substances. Anything that may lead to dehydration can make it harder for you to urinate. Avoid alcohol and any medications that can dehydrate you or make urination difficult. Ask your doctor if you are not sure what medications may cause problems for you. Purchase saw palmetto extract as a supplement from your drug store or health foods store. Saw palmetto is a palm-like plant that has been used medicinally for decades. Some men find this supplement improves their symptoms of BPH, though it’s not scientifically proven to help. Discuss using any medications or supplements with your doctor beforehand. Buy saw palmetto extract in 160mg capsules and take one twice a day, unless directed otherwise by your doctor. Check the label carefully and be sure to get a product that contains “85-95% fatty acids and sterols.” Alpha-blockers are most commonly prescribed for men with mildly distressing symptoms. These can cause low blood pressure and dizziness when going from sitting to standing, so be careful when you start taking these medications. They include tamsulosin (Flomax), terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), alfuzosin (Uroxatral), and silodosin (Rapaflo). Your doctor may also prescribe an alpha-reductase inhibitor (a type of anti-androgen) like finasteride (Proscar) or dutasteride (Avodart) for larger prostates. If you take Viagra or another medication for erectile dysfunction, do not take terazosin or doxazosin unless directed to do so by a doctor. There are several medical procedures that either remove or destroy some of the prostate by going through your urethra. You will be sedated or anesthetized so you won’t feel any pain during the procedure, and may stay overnight in the hospital or may go home the same day. You and your doctor will decide which of these is the best procedure for you: TURP, or transurethral resection of the prostate: parts of the prostate are removed to improve flow; this may cause sexual side effects like trouble ejaculating. Prostate ablation: parts of the prostate are burned away with heat or light; this is better for men with medical issues, as it causes less bleeding than the TURP. Some minimally invasive procedures have fewer side effects and can be done in a day, though urinary trouble may recur afterwards: widening of the urethra with an incision in the prostate, radiofrequency ablation, microwave thermotherapy, or a prostatic lift. If you are generally healthy and your prostate is very large, over 100g, or causes very severe urinary symptoms that affect your quality of life, you can have your prostate removed with surgery. You may need surgery if you have frequent blood in your urine, recurring urinary tract infections, bladder stones, kidney problems, or the inability to urinate.

After the birds were released, they attempted to resume their migration, but both age group grew disoriented quickly. \\"All the birds scattered at first,\\" Wikelski said. \\"It was clear that they were turned around for a couple of days. But while the adults eventually realized they had to head southwest, the younger birds resumed flying straight southward as though they were still in Washington.\\" \\"The adults,\\" said team member Richard Holland, \\"recovered their bearings because they possess something the younger birds do not, which is an internal map.\\" \\"These birds need two things to know where they are and migrate effectively: a 'map' and a 'compass',\\" saidHolland, a postdoctoral research associate in Wikelski's lab. \\"What we've found is that juveniles use their compass, but the adults also use their map.\\" Hollandsaid, \\"The birds do not lose the compass as they age, but somehow develop the map, eventually applying both tools to keep on track during migratory flights.

Seventeen-year-old Carl (Tom Sturridge), recently expelled from school, is sent to stay with his godfather Quentin (Bill Nighy), who runs the station \\"Radio Rock\\" anchored in the North Sea. The eclectic crew of disc jockeys and staffers, led by the brash American DJ \\"The Count\\" (Philip Seymour Hoffman), quickly accept Carl as one of their own. At the start of the film Doctor Dave (Nick Frost) and Carl conspire to have Carl lose his virginity. Dave has his girlfriend get naked and lie in bed for him while he turns off the lights and goes into the bathroom, where has has Carl hidden. Carl then gets naked and walks into the dark room in an attempt to deceive Dave's girlfriend. However she turns the lights on and sees who was really about to have sex with her, and Carl gets embarrassed and leaves. In London, government minister Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) resolves to shut down pirate radio stations due to their commercialism and low morals, instructing his subordinate Twatt (Jack Davenport) to find legal loopholes that will serve this end. They attempt to cut off the stations' revenue by prohibiting British businesses from advertising on unlicensed radio stations. Quentin counters this by bringing massively popular DJ Gavin Kavanagh (Rhys Ifans) out of retirement and onto Radio Rock, enticing his advertisers to work around the law by paying their bills from abroad.

Blofeld A:","completion":"Step 1: Establishing the characters In our movie plot, we have three main characters: Brandt, a skilled assassin; Bond, the iconic British secret agent; and Blofeld, the ruthless mastermind behind a criminal organization. Step 2: Setting up the initial conflict In the opening scenes, we see the criminal organization led by Blofeld planning the assassination of Bond. Brandt, who has a history of successful missions, is assigned the task of eliminating Bond. Step 3: Developing the plot As the movie progresses, we see Brandt tracking down Bond and attempting to kill him multiple times. However, due to Bond's skills and resourcefulness, he manages to narrowly escape death each time. These failures cause Brandt to question her capabilities and develop self-doubt, making her feel vulnerable and defeated. Step 4: Exploring character development and backstory To deepen the story and the characters, we explore Brandt's background, including a tragic past that has shaped her into the skilled assassin she is today. We also delve into Blofeld's motivations for wanting Bond dead, revealing a complex rivalry with deep-rooted personal resentment. Step 5: Introducing a turning point As Brandt's failures continue to mount, Blofeld becomes increasingly frustrated and decides it's time to take matters into his own hands. However, in an unexpected twist, he forgives Brandt for her inability to kill Bond, recognizing her value to the organization and providing her with another chance to prove herself. Step 6: Building towards the climax With renewed determination, Brandt resolves to complete her mission and bring an end to Bond. Simultaneously, Bond uncovers Blofeld's plan and their interconnected pasts, making it a personal mission to stop Blofeld and his organization once and for all. Step 7: Final showdown and resolution In the climactic final act, Brandt confronts Bond one last time, resulting in an intense and suspenseful battle between the two skilled opponents. Ultimately, Brandt realizes the true nature of Blofeld's organization and decides to switch sides, joining Bond in his quest to put an end to their common enemy.

In this statement, the speaker is expressing their support for athletes who possess a sense of civic responsibility. They believe that these athletes should have the freedom to express themselves and share their opinions during the Olympic Games, a major international sporting event. The Olympic Games serve as a platform for athletes from around the world to showcase their talents, hard work, and dedication to their respective sports. However, it goes beyond just competing in sports; the Olympics also bring together people from diverse cultures and backgrounds, promoting global unity and understanding. In this context, athletes with a strong sense of civic duty can contribute to the positive values and messages promoted by the event. Allowing athletes to voice their opinions and beliefs can be beneficial for several reasons. First, it further promotes the spirit of unity and understanding among different cultures. When athletes share their thoughts on global issues, they can foster a healthy exchange of ideas and contribute to the promotion of mutual respect and cooperation. Second, athletes serve as role models for many young people around the world. Encouraging a sense of civic duty and social responsibility among these athletes can make a positive impact on the youth who admire them, inspiring them to be more engaged in their communities and social issues. Finally, granting athletes the right to express their opinions can create a more inclusive and diverse environment at the Olympic Games. This sense of inclusivity can lead to a more enjoyable and meaningful experience for athletes, fans, and organizers alike. However, there may be concerns about the impact of athletes using the Olympic Games as a platform for expressing their views. Some may argue that this could detract from the focus on sports and competitive spirit, or lead to politically charged debates that could overshadow the games themselves. Despite this, it is essential to remember that the right to freedom of expression is a fundamental human right, and athletes should not be excluded from exercising this right during such prominent events. By encouraging open communication and respect for diverse opinions, the Olympic Games can continue to be a symbol of unity, collaboration, and shared human values. Ultimately, supporting athletes with a sense of civic duty and granting them the opportunity to voice their opinions at the Olympic Games can contribute to the overall spirit of the event and the promotion of global understanding and unity.

Roman informs Guy that both Rosemary and Adrian are missing and that Rosemary may attempt to contact him. Later that night, Rosemary and Adrian are sheltering in a bus stop. Rosemary makes a phone call to Guy, while Adrian plays with his toy car nearby. As soon as Guy answers the phone, Rosemary immediately issues instructions on how to send her money.

In 1939, to escape the war and Nazi persecution of the Jews, Szigeti emigrated with his wife to the United States, where they settled in California. (A year later, Bartók also fled to America, and just two days after his arrival, he and Szigeti played a sonata recital at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.)During the 1930s, 1940s and into the 1950s, Szigeti recorded extensively, leaving a significant legacy. Notable recordings include the above-mentioned Library of Congress sonata recital; the studio recording of Bartók's Contrasts with Benny Goodman on clarinet and the composer at the piano; the violin concertos of Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Prokofiev (No. 1) and Bloch under the batons of such conductors as Bruno Walter, Hamilton Harty and Sir Thomas Beecham; and various works by J.S. Bach, Busoni, Corelli, Handel and Mozart. One of his last recordings was of the Six Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin by Bach; although his technique had deteriorated noticeably by that time, the recording is prized for Szigeti's insight and depth of interpretation.In 1950, Szigeti was detained at Ellis Island upon returning from a European concert tour and was held for several days, officially \\"temporarily excluded\\" from the country.

What was it?","completion":"Shepard Fairey's Barack Obama poster, also known as the \\"Hope\\" poster, initially featured a different word before \\"hope\\" became iconic. The original word in Fairey's artwork was \\"PROGRESS.\\" The story of how the Obama poster evolved is quite intriguing. Shepard Fairey, a Los Angeles-based street artist and graphic designer, decided to create an artwork in support of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. He chose an image of Obama by photographer Mannie Garcia as a reference for his poster. Fairey experimented with using different words as slogans for the artwork, and his initial design incorporated the word \\"PROGRESS.\\" Fairey described the artwork as an \\"iconic portrait of then-Senator Obama with the word 'progress' beneath it.\\" After the initial release of the \\"PROGRESS\\" poster, the design was noticed by the Obama campaign and they contacted Fairey to request permission to use the image. Following negotiations, the campaign asked Fairey to change the word \\"PROGRESS\\" to \\"HOPE\\" in the artwork. The new version of the poster, featuring the word \\"HOPE,\\" became tremendously popular and an emblematic part of the 2008 campaign. Later, Fairey created additional versions with the words \\"CHANGE\\" and \\"VOTE.\\" Despite the poster's widespread success, its origins became entangled in controversy when it came to light that Fairey had used a photograph by Mannie Garcia without obtaining permission. The Associated Press, which held the copyright for the photograph, accused Fairey of copyright infringement. Fairey filed a pre-emptive lawsuit to protect the poster, claiming his work was protected under the fair use doctrine. The two parties eventually reached an out-of-court settlement in 2011. In conclusion, the initial word on Shepard Fairey's Barack Obama poster was \\"PROGRESS,\\" which was later changed to \\"HOPE\\" after discussions with the Obama campaign. The poster became an iconic symbol of the 2008 presidential campaign, but it also instigated a legal battle between Fairey and the Associated Press due to copyright issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later (French: Le Vicomte de Bragelonne ou Dix ans plus tard [l@ vikot d@ bRaZ@lon u diz_a ply taR]) is a novel by Alexandre Dumas. Context: This part mostly concerns romantic events at the court of Louis XIV. Raoul de Bragelonne finds his childhood sweetheart, Louise de La Valliere, is maid of honour to the Princess. Fearing a tarnishing of Louise's reputation by affairs at court, Raoul seeks to marry her. His father, Athos, the Comte de la Fere, disapproves, but eventually, out of love for his son, reluctantly agrees. The king, however, refuses to sanction the marriage because Louise is of inferior social status, and so marriage is delayed. Meanwhile, the struggle for power begins between Fouquet and Colbert. Louis attempts to impoverish Fouquet by asking for money to pay for a grand fete at Fontainebleau. Meanwhile, Aramis meets the governor of the Bastille M. de Baisemeaux, and learns of a secret prisoner who bears a striking resemblance to Louis XIV. Aramis uses this secret to persuade the dying general of the Jesuits to name him his successor. After Buckingham leaves France, the Comte de Guiche grows besotted with Henrietta, as soon does Louis XIV. To avoid her new husband being jealous Henrietta suggests that the king choose a young lady at court to act as a smokescreen for their flirtation. They select Louise de la Valliere for this part, but during the fete, the king overhears Louise confess her attraction for him to friends, and promptly forgets his affection for Henrietta. That same night Henrietta hears de Guiche confess his love for her to Raoul. The two pursue their own love affair. Aware of Louise's attachment, the king sends Raoul to England indefinitely as a diplomatic envoy. Rumours of the king's love affair cause friction with de Wardes, who has inherited from his father a hatred of d'Artagnan and all those associated with him. De Guiche is forced to fight a duel with him and is defeated and seriously wounded. The incident is the last straw for Madame Henrietta who resolves to dismiss Louise from her service as Maid of Honour. The king dissuades Henrietta, but she prevents the king from seeing Louise. The king circumvents Henrietta, and so she contacts her brother King Charles II, imploring him to eject Raoul from England. On his return to France, Raoul is heartbroken to discover Louise in the arms of the king. Athos finds out everything and spits his contempt at Louis XIV. The young King orders Athos's imprisonment, but D'Artagnan convinces him to release him. Question: Do they get married?.

Unfortunately, The King, a wiry, manic man who suffers from ADHD, demands that one of his men, Lupus, also work on the con. The con involves bribing a vice president at the bank into wiring money offshore. The plan hits a major snag when Special Agent Gunther Butan (Andy Garcia) shows up in L.A., looking to finally bust Jake, whom he has followed for years. Agent Butan quickly forces two corrupt LAPD detectives into switching their allegiance from Jake to him.After hearing about Butan's arrival in town, a nervous Jake pulls the plug on the whole con, and screams at Lilly - making her walk out on the group. Lupus gets Jake to reconsider nixing the con, hinting that The King will torture and kill the grifters if the plan falls short. The con is back on, though now without Lilly's help. The plan starts smoothly enough, and the bribed bank VP wires the money to Gordo in Belize. Gordo brings the money to Ontario Airport, but he is met at the airport by both Agent Butan as well as The King and his men, as both sides are after the 5 million in a duffle bag. Butan arrests The King and confiscates the money. Gordo, who had the money taken from him, is nowhere to be found. Lupus, thinking the King now has the money, reveals he was the one who killed...

He suddenly finds himself in the local library and discovers his ability to \\"jump\\" from one place to another. Amazed with his new ability, he leaves his abusive father (Michael Rooker) and runs away from home.Eight years later, an adult David (Hayden Christensen) lives lavishly on stolen money. One day, he is ambushed in his home by Roland Cox (Samuel L. Jackson), a member of the Paladins, a group of religious extremists who have been tracking down and killing \\"Jumpers\\". Their reasoning is that Jumpers' alleged omnipresence is considered blasphemous. Roland tries to capture David with electric cables designed to nullify his ability, but David escapes. He returns to Ann Arbor, seeking his old crush Millie (Rachel Bilson). When Mark (Teddy Dunn) attacks him, David teleports him into a bank vault and leaves him there. David then returns to Millie and invites her on a trip to Rome. Roland later discovers Mark in police custody and learns David's identity.In Rome, David and Millie grow closer, though he keeps his ability a secret. They visit the Colosseum, where David meets Griffin (Jamie Bell), another Jumper. A group of Paladins appear, and Griffin casually kills them, then jumps away. David tries to leave with Millie, but he's detained by Italian police and questioned about the deaths. David's mother, Mary (Diane Lane), who had left him when he was five, appears and helps him escape. She urges him to leave Rome with Millie, to protect her. Millie, upset and afraid when David tries to skirt around the issue, demands to know the truth.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: Determine if the paint is from 1970 or earlier. Talk to the owner of the home, or the previous owners. Check if the paint is deteriorating.","completion":"Title: Uncovering the Paint's Origins: Identifying Paint from 1970 or Earlier Introduction When examining old paint in a home to determine if it is from 1970 or earlier, a careful and multi-step approach is necessary. The reason for such scrutiny is that older paints often contain significant amounts of lead, which can pose serious health risks, particularly to children. As a result, it is essential to understand the age of the paint and determine if proper abatement measures are needed. This article will explore ways to assess the paint in question, including discussions with the current and previous homeowners, as well as examining the physical condition of the paint itself. Communicating with Homeowners One of the first steps in establishing the paint's origin is to speak with the current homeowner. They may have critical information about the age of the paint, perhaps from discussions with previous homeowners, records of past renovations, or various other sources. While discussing with the homeowner, it is essential to know the house's overall age and any significant renovations it has undergone. This historical information may provide essential clues for determining whether the paint in question predates 1970. Additionally, speaking with previous owners of the home, if possible, can prove to be a wealth of essential details. Previous homeowners might have direct knowledge of the time the paint was applied or any repainting or renovations completed during their tenure in the home. If the previous owner's testimony indicates that the paint may have been applied before 1970, then it is essential to consider the possibility that the paint contains lead and discuss next necessary actions. Assessing the Physical Condition of the Paint The physical condition of the paint can provide insights into its age, as paints deteriorate and wear over time. Key signs of aging paint include chalking, flaking, peeling, or cracks. If the paint exhibits any of these characteristics, it may suggest it is older – potentially pre-dating 1970. In particular, chalking is a common issue with older paints, where the paint loses its pigment and leaves a chalk-like residue when touched or rubbed. Chalking is indicative of both paint's natural aging process and possible exposure to weather elements. To test for chalking, one can swipe a damp cloth over the paint's surface and see if any noticeable residue comes off. If chalking is present and the origin of the paint is still uncertain, it may be best to investigate further. Another vital aspect to consider when assessing the physical condition of the paint is the presence of any unconventional substrates or primer layers underneath the paint. This may indicate that the paint was, at one point, covering lead-based paint or another potentially hazardous substance. If any unusual layers are visible beneath the paint, it is worth consulting with a professional to assess if the paint is from 1970 or earlier. Testing for Lead Content If evidence points towards the likelihood of the paint being from 1970 or earlier, it is crucial to test the paint for lead content. A simple at-home lead test kit can be purchased, and with proper usage, it can detect the presence of any lead in the paint. These lead test kits typically involve swiping a tester against the paint and observing any color changes in the solution included in the kit. Conclusion Determining if a paint is from 1970 or earlier entails conversing with homeowners, examining the paint's physical condition, and testing for lead content when necessary. It is essential to be thorough and precise when assessing older paint, as undetected lead can lead to severe health risks. If any uncertainty remains about the paint's origins, it is always best to consult with a professional for assistance and guidance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Tuesday April 26, 2011--Barge traffic moves along the channel of the flooding Mississippi River just north of where the Ohio River joins the Mississippi near Cairo Illinois on Tuesday. The Army Corps of Engineers has delayed its plan to dynamite a hole in the Bird's Point levee on the Mississippi River and flood 132,000 acres of mostly farm land to relieve pressure from the rising river. The channel of the Mississippi is marked by the line of trees that show where the normal banks of the river are. David Carson dcarson@post-dispatch.com UPDATED 5:30 p.m. on evacuation in Mississippi County The Army Corps of Engineers has delayed its plan to blow a levee on the Mississippi River in southeast Missouri and flood 132,000 acres to relieve pressure from the rising river. A spokeswoman at the Corps office in Memphis, which covers the Mississippi below its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Ill., said this afternoon, \\"They haven't made a decision. They are positioning people and moving up barges in case, but they will not do anything today.\\" Corps leaders are to meet again Wednesday in Memphis. In Cape Girardeau, Mo., meanwhile, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster asked the U.S. District Court to block the levee-blasting idea. Because the decision had been expected today, several hundred residents who live on the 34-mile-long New Madrid Floodway were evacuated Monday and today. Its path, which would be inundated by the levee break, is in Mississippi County, Mo. The Corps designated the floodway in 1928, one year after a major flood on the lower Mississippi. Even with the Corps decision in limbo, officials there still want people to stay out of the sparsely populated floodway. \\"It's a very frustrating situation,\\" said Janice McCameron, of the county sheriff's office in Charleston, Mo. \\"It's still wise for peole to evacuate. Just because the Corps won't blow the levee yet doesnt mean there won't be flooding.\\" The floodway has not been used since 1937, the record flood for that area below Cairo. Major floods on the Mississippi north of the Ohio, including the record one in 1993, were lesser events once the two rivers met. Bird's Point, where the dynamite would be set, is about 130 air miles south of St. Louis. The Ohio is expected to set a record at Cairo on Friday. It already is 17 feet above flood stage today at Cairo and is forecast to rise another four feet by Friday. That would be one foot higher than the record, set in 1937. At Cape Girardeau, the Mississippi is expected to crest Friday about four feet lower than its 1993 record. The Mississippi, running only about three feet over flood at St. Louis, reaches progressively higher levels on river gauges the closer it gets to the swollen Ohio. McCameron said the floodway area is from four to 12 miles inland from the river. Another line of levees protects the rest of the county. She said area churches are on standby to provide shelter and help for displaced people if necessary. On Monday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon announced his opposition to blowing the levee. In Cairo, residents of nursing homes have been evacuated, and there is a voluntary evacuation call for the rest of the city, said Rose Burris, city payroll clerk. Burris said the U.S. 51 bridge over the Ohio was closed Monday when the rising Ohio swamped the bridge approach on the Kentucky side. Burris said blowing the Bird's Point levee would be good for Cairo because it would make room for the Ohio's flow. Much of southern Missouri and the lower Ohio River valley eastward into Kentucky have received 10 or more inches of rain during the past week. Areas around Poplar Bluff, Mo., where the Black River breached a levee, received 16 inches over the past five days, according to the National Weather Service. In the past week, St. Louis received 4.5 inches. In Missouri's Stoddard and Scott counties, northwest of Mississippi County, swollen drainage channels have broken through levees in two places, one near Bell City and another near Perkins, said Dale Moreland, Stoddard County emergency spokesman. Moreland said water had risen into 25 to 30 homes near the channels. ||||| KANSAS CITY, Mo | KANSAS CITY, Mo (Reuters) - The Missouri attorney general filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday asking a judge to stop the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' plans to detonate the levee at Birds Point on the Mississippi River. Attorney General Chris Koster said the Corps, which manages the river, is preparing to intentionally breach the levee in hopes of keeping Cairo, Illinois, from flooding. Koster said demolition of the levee will cause serious flooding across as much as 130,000 acres of Mississippi County, Missouri. A law enacted in the 1920s requires the Corps to blow up the levee if the gauge at Cairo reaches a certain water level. But Koster believes the law is \\"unclear\\" as to whether the Corps actually has the authority to make the decision to detonate. \\"There are no 'good' options at this juncture,\\" said Koster in a statement. But he said given the long-term effects of the government's proposal on Missouri citizens, the state wants a review by the federal court. A spokesperson for the Corps was not immediately available for comment. Koster said the flooding would leave a layer of silt that could take a generation to clear, causing significant injury to the quality of the farmland. The flooding also would affect 100 homes. About 100 people have already agreed to voluntarily evacuate Cairo, which is at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, according to Cairo Fire Department Captain Brandon Manker. One problem the area is experiencing is that the Ohio and Mississippi rivers are flooding at the same time, and the Ohio, which usually drains into the bigger river, can't do so, according to Buddy Rogers, spokesman for the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management. There has been flooding along the Ohio River from Cincinnati to the Mississippi, according to the National Weather Service.

However, some people don't want to blow up the levee, because it can cause problems to the land and homes in the area.

Movie title: Camelot Movie plot: During the opening credits, like the Broadway production, the studio orchestra plays a potpourri overture that features the \\"Camelot March\\" and the title song. The action begins in early morning darkness as a chorus sings a few lines from \\"Guenevere.\\" Arthur (Richard Harris) talks to his unseen teacher, Merlyn (Laurence Naismith), asking him why everything that has happened to them happened. Before a battle begins at dawn with Lancelot (Franco Nero) and his Joyous Gard knights, Arthur, talking as much to himself as to Merlyn, tries to determine where he went wrong. Merlyn appears and urges the mighty King to think back to one of the most important days of his life. Almost all of the rest of the film is a flashback. It first flashes back to Arthur as a youngster (Nicholas Beauvy); he is walking in the woods in the early morning when he encounters Merlyn, who calls Arthur \\"Wart.\\" Then suddenly, Merlyn interrupts to chide Arthur for going too far back in his memory. The important day Arthur is supposed to remember, Merlyn says, is the day he met Guenevere (Vanessa Redgrave).The following scene shows Arthur in a large snow-laden tree watching people pass on the road beneath. From his perch, Arthur sings \\"I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight?\\" He imagines that his subjects are pondering what he is doing in the final hours before his arranged marriage. Arthur admits that even though he has faced battle bravely, he's terrified of facing his bride-to-be. As the song ends, a procession approaches (\\"Camelot March\\") carrying Guenevere. She is not at all thrilled that her wedding is an inconvenient marriage of convenience. In despair, Guenevere sings \\"The Simple Joys of Maidenhood.\\" The lyrics question how she missed the normal life of a maiden and all its simple pleasures like knights tilting for her and \\"kith not kill their kin\\" for her. The procession halts for a rest so the royal hairdresser can prepare Guenevere to meet her mate. While everyone is busy, Guenevere sneaks away into the woods. She kneels in the snow...

Here is a news article: Two Queens tenants have transformed their solitary, inhospitable 3-bedroom apartment in Elmhurst into a 10-bedroom, monetized community betterment cultural exchange. PIX 11's Arnold Diaz (Shame Shame Shaaaaaaaame) reports that Queens landlord Eddie Shiew rented the third floor 3-bedroom of his home in Elmhurst to Burak Firik and Dogan Kimilli for 2,500/month. Firik and Kimilli promptly put up some walls and began renting the spaces out on Airbnb. When Shiew tore the walls down and changed the locks, his tenants took him to court, and a judge ordered him to let them back in. Now they charge 35/night to travelers who don't mind being separated from their fellow boarders by red shower curtains. \\"We know the laws very well, you'll not be able to evict us ever,\\" Firik allegedly texted Shiew. Shiew's attorney told Diaz that he'd have the men out in a month or two. When Airbnb released anonymized data on their hosts last week, they claimed that only two hosts in Queens posted six or more listings. Was this Firik and Kimilli? Or were their listings categorized a different way? We might never know! Councilmember Helen Rosenthal called Airbnb's anonymized release \\"a useless disclosure that will do nothing to curb illegal hotels and tenant harassment.\\" As Firik and Kimilli's case proves, it's exceedingly difficult to evict tenants running Airbnb hotels. We've asked Airbnb to comment on the case and will update if they respond. UPDATE: A spokesperson for Airbnb gave us this statement: We have suspended listings we believe are associated with this story while we investigate and we will take appropriate action. Situations like these are rare and we strongly oppose illegal hotels. ||||| (Adrian Cabrero / Flickr) Pressured to prove that Airbnb isn't robbing New York City of affordable housing and turning buildings in popular neighborhoods into international party hostels, the company released data today that is much less dire than a report issued by New York Attorney General from roughly a year ago, though it appears that most Airbnb hosts in the city are breaking state law. The AG's report stated that from 2010 through early June of 2014, 168.3 million, or 37% of revenue generated by Airbnb hosts, came from hosts with three or more listings. According to Airbnb's numbers, from November of 2014 through November of this year, only 6% of host revenue came from those who had three or more listings. The median amount made by Airbnb hosts over the past year was 5,110; hosts in \\"Outer Manhattan\\" made the most, at 6,558, followed by \\"Central Manhattan\\" (5,445) and Staten Island (5,221), despite there being only 200 listings in the borough to Outer Manhattan's 13,400. The data, which can be inspected if you make an appointment at Airbnb's New York City offices, states that 55% of Airbnb's users are renting out their entire apartments while they're gone, rather than a single room when they're present, which for most residents against the law. In a release, Share Better, the group that's extremely critical of Airbnb that includes city and state elected officials, as well at the Metropolitan Council On Housing, called the company's release a \\"whitewash.\\" \\"By Airbnb's own analysis they’re admitting most of their revenue comes from illegal home rentals that take precious housing units away from regular everyday New Yorkers,\\" the release states. A spokesperson for state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said their office had no comment on the numbers. \\"There are a lot of misconceptions about home sharing and what it means to be a host,\\" the company said in a release to its users. \\"This anonymized data makes clear that Airbnb is a platform that real New Yorkers depend on to pay the bills and stay in their homes, and not a platform for illegal hotels.\\" Councilmember Helen Rosenthal, a member of Share Better, said in a statement, \\"We met with Airbnb today, and they refused to disclose specific, actionable data. Airbnb only provided 'anonymized' data of its users who break the law—in other words, a useless disclosure that will do nothing to curb illegal hotels and tenant harassment.\\" At a City Council hearing last month, an Airbnb representative told officials that their critique of the company was an \\"attack on the middle class.\\" Councilmember and Housing and Buildings Committee Chair Jumaane Williams stated at the hearing that the City was concerned with commercial operators using Airbnb, not casual users: \\"We are not trying to go after a grandma who rents on the weekend to go on vacation.\\" You can see the selected data here. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video ELMHURST, Queens — Eddie Shiew owns a three-story home in Elmhurst, Queens, as a rental property. He recently rented the third floor, a three-bedroom apartment, to Burak Firik and Dogan Kimilli for 2,500 a month. But after signing the lease, the landlord says he got a call from one of the tenants on the first floor telling him it appeared that construction was going on in the third floor. Shiew says he went to the building and found that the third floor was in fact being renovated without his knowledge. “I went in the next day and found they had turned a three-bedroom into a 10-bedroom apartment.\\" Shiew said it appeared that through the use of sheetrock, a construction crew had divided each bedroom into three small bedrooms. He says he then discovered that Firik and Kimilli were listing the rooms for rent on airbnb.com, a website for people looking for a cheap place to stay for a short time, usually in someone’s home. And airbnb customers are who PIX11 found living in the apartment. PIX11 spoke with two tourists who were paying 35 dollars a night for a room on the third floor. When the landlord found out what was going on, he brought some workmen in and tore down all the renovations, changed the locks on the doors, and demanded that Firik and Kimilli leave. But the two men took the landlord to court. “They went to court and got a court order against me, “ Shiew said. “They said I illegally locked them out.” The judge ordered the landlord to let Firik and Kimilli back into the apartment. While they haven’t done any more renovations, they are creating spaces to rent on airbnb by using curtains as room dividers. The landlord has hired an attorney and is trying to evict them, claiming the two men violated the terms of the lease. The lease says “except as authorized by the consent of the Landlord, Tenants will not make any repairs or alterations to the premises.\\" But Firik texted the landlord, “we know the laws very well, you’ll not be able to evict us ever.” The landlord’s attorney says he expects the court will order Firik and Kimilli out within a couple of months. PIX11's Arnold Diaz spoke with Firik by phone, who refused to do an on-camera interview and denied doing renovations to the apartment. He claims he and Kimilli live in the apartment, but the airbnb tenants said they have never met the guys renting the apartment. They say the pay airbnb online.

Since both -40l and 9l are like terms as they have the same variable l, we can combine them by adding their coefficients. -40l + 9l = -31l So, the equation becomes: -31l = 186 Step 2: Isolate the variable l. To isolate l, we need to get rid of the coefficient -31. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -31. -31l ÷ -31 = 186 ÷ -31 Step 3: Simplify the equation. Dividing both sides of the equation gives us: l = -6 So, the solution to the equation -40l + 9l = 186 is l = -6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: Erin Brockovich Context: Desperate for work, unskilled Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts), single parent of three, takes a relatively inconsequential job as a legal assistant in a California law firm for low wages. While organizing some paperwork pertaining to real estate cases, she is puzzled when she notices medical records in one of the files. On a whim, she does a little investigating of her own, and comes to suspect that land purchased by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E;) is the same land on which chromium contamination resulted from PG&E;'s environmentally irresponsible actions.Examination of local water records and interviews with residents ill from exposure to poisonous chromium confirm Erin's suspicions, but pursuit of legal proceedings against PG&E; would seem beyond the capabilities of the small law firm she works at. Still, Erin succeeds in making her boss, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), as passionate about the case as she is, and he takes it on. Both Ed and Erin must make great sacrifices in their lives, as the legal costs spread Ed very thin, and the round-the-clock work takes Erin out of touch with both her boyfriend and her kids.Erin's kids resent the lack of attention from her, and her attempts to explain the merits of what she is doing to her eldest son are futile ..... but, one day her eldest son happens across one of the many documents pertaining to the PG&E; case. He reads of a child his own age who is very ill, and knowing that Erin's work will help this child, asks her why the child's mother cannot provide the needed help. When Erin explains that it is because the child's mother is very ill, too, her son, for the first time, appreciates the nature and importance of Erin's work.In the end, Erin's special ability to bond with the victims of chromium contaminaton and their families and Ed's legal and administrative prowess are the key ingredients to making the case against PG&E.; As a team, they manage to successfully lay the groundwork for the payment of legal damages by PG&E; to those harmed.

Dog Despite their descent from wolves and classification as Carnivora, dogs are variously described in scholarly and other writings as carnivores or omnivores. Unlike obligate carnivores, such as the cat family with its shorter small intestine, dogs can adapt to a wide-ranging diet, and are not dependent on meat-specific protein nor a very high level of protein in order to fulfill their basic dietary requirements.

Please answer the following question: The two basic things you have to do to have a successful weight-loss journey is consume fewer calories (eat less) and exercise more. It is a pleasure to report that it is possible to do both of these things without feeling deprived or overwhelmed. Just add these two little extras for help with weight-loss success. Add a Little Extra Exercise to Your Daily Routine A simple way to increase the level of exercise during your week is by adding a little more effort into your daily activities – the things you are going to do anyway. For example, we all have to do housework right? So, that is an easy one! Instead of taking your time and working at a leisurely pace, work faster. As you sweep and mop the kitchen floor, put some oomph into it. Work at a steady, brisk pace. Stretch your arms and use your muscles. This will definitely increase your heart rate, and burn more calories. When it’s time to clean the windows, reach up as high as you can – stretch to the top of the windows and be sure to get into the corners. Then, buff the glass to a high sheen, which will involve a little more elbow grease than normal. When you scrub out the tub and the shower, do it with energy and a song – make those tiles shine. Play fun music and dance when you sweep, mop or vacuum. Work for longer periods of time – 20 to 30 minutes of active cleaning is much better than 5 minutes here and 5 minutes there. It gives you more time to get your heart rate going and a better boost to your metabolism. These are things you can do to keep your house sparkling and build the new you. So, start throwing in an abundant amount of gusto for extra calorie burning and body shaping. Why does the author recommend sweeping and mopping at a brisk pace? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - More calories will be burned - So there is more time in the day to exercise, since you will be done with chores faster - Stretching your arms will make you more flexible - not enough information Answer:","completion":"The author recommends sweeping and mopping at a brisk pace because more calories will be burned. By working at a steady, brisk pace and putting more effort into daily activities like cleaning, one can increase their heart rate and burn more calories without having to dedicate additional time specifically for exercise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

John Kenneth Galbraith (October 15, 1908 - April 29, 2006), also known as Ken Galbraith, was a Canadian-born economist, public official, and diplomat, and a leading proponent of 20th-century American liberalism. His books on economic topics were bestsellers from the 1950s through the 2000s, during which time Galbraith fulfilled the role of public intellectual. As an economist, he leaned toward post-Keynesian economics from an institutionalist perspective. Galbraith was a long-time Harvard faculty member and stayed with Harvard University for half a century as a professor of economics. In February 1946, Galbraith took a leave of absence from his magazine work for a senior position in the State Department as director of the Office of Economic Security Policy where he was nominally in charge of economic affairs regarding Germany, Japan, Austria, and South Korea. He was distrusted by the senior diplomats so he was relegated to routine work with few opportunities to make policy. Galbraith favored detente with the Soviet Union, along with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and General Lucius D. Clay, a military governor of the US Zone in Germany from 1947 to 1949, but they were out of step with the containment policy then being developed by George Kennan and favored by the majority of the US major policymakers. After a disconcerting half-year, Galbraith resigned in September 1946 and went back to his magazine writing on economics issues. Later, he immortalized his frustration with \\"the ways of Foggy Bottom\\" in a satirical novel, The Triumph (1968). The postwar period also was memorable for Galbraith because of his work, along with Eleanor Roosevelt and Hubert Humphrey, to establish a progressive policy organization Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) in support of the cause of economic and social justice in 1947. During his time as an adviser to President John F. Kennedy, Galbraith was appointed United States Ambassador to India from 1961 to 1963. His rapport with President Kennedy was such that he regularly bypassed the State Department and sent his diplomatic cables directly to the president. In India, he became a confidant of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and extensively advised the Indian government on economic matters. In 1966, when he was no longer ambassador, he told the United States Senate that one of the main causes of the 1965 Kashmir war was American military aid to Pakistan. While in India, he helped establish one of the first computer science departments, at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Even after leaving office, Galbraith remained a friend and supporter of India. Because of his recommendation, First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy undertook her 1962 diplomatic missions in India and Pakistan. In autumn 1972 Galbraith was an adviser and assistant to Nixon's rival candidate George McGovern in the election campaign for the American presidency. During this time (September 1972) he travelled in to China in his role as president of the American Economic Association (AEA) at the invitation of Mao Zedong's communist government with the economists Leontief and Tobin and in 1973 published an account of his experiences in A China Passage. Galbraith wrote that there was \\"no serious doubt that China is devising a highly effective economic system,\\" \\"[d]issidents are brought firmly into line in China, but, one suspects, with great politeness,\\" \\"Greater Shanghai ... has a better medical service than New York,\\" and considered it not implausible that Chinese industrial and agricultural output was expanding annually at a rate of 10 to 11%. Did he continue working?","completion":"Yes, John Kenneth Galbraith continued working after his time as an adviser and assistant to George McGovern during the 1972 presidential campaign. Galbraith remained active in both academic and public life. He continued to teach at Harvard University and write extensively on economic and social topics. He also provided public commentary through various publications and interviews. Galbraith's writing extended beyond his experience in China, producing several notable works during his later years. He authored the bestselling book \\"Money: Whence It Came, Where It Went\\" (1975), which delved into the world of finance and monetary history. He also wrote \\"The Age of Uncertainty\\" (1977), a popular economic history that became a 13-part television series aired by BBC and PBS. Later, in 1993, he published \\"A Journey Through Economic Time: A Firsthand View,\\" reflecting on his long career in economics, politics, and academia. In 1997, Galbraith published \\"The Great Crash, 1929,\\" an influential work that analyzed the causes of the stock market crash that led to the Great Depression. He continued to advocate for a more regulated capitalist system throughout his career, emphasizing the importance of government intervention to ensure economic stability and social justice. Galbraith remained a prominent figure in American liberalism, using his voice to support progressive causes and offer insights into economic policy and global affairs. His continued involvement in politics and academia made him an influential voice in economic and social debates during the latter part of the 20th century. Although he passed away in 2006, the impact of his work and ideas continue to shape economic discussions to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Gifford Pinchot (August 11, 1865 - October 4, 1946) was an American forester and politician. Pinchot served as the first Chief of the United States Forest Service from 1905 until his firing in 1910, and was the 28th Governor of Pennsylvania, serving from 1923 to 1927, and again from 1931 to 1935. He was a member of the Republican Party for most of his life, though he also joined the Progressive Party for a brief period. Pinchot is known for reforming the management and development of forests in the United States and for advocating the conservation of the nation's reserves by planned use and renewal. Gifford Pinchot was born August 11, 1865, to Episcopalian parents in Simsbury, Connecticut, the son of James W. Pinchot, a successful New York City wallpaper merchant, and Mary Eno, daughter of one of New York City's wealthiest real estate developers, Amos Eno. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy and in 1889, Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. He had a brother Amos Pinchot and a sister Antoinette (who married the diplomat Alan Johnstone). The Pinchots made a great fortune by importing French wallpaper to furnish stately American homes during the late Victorian era. Pinchot's father James made conservation a family affair and suggested that Gifford should become a forester, asking him just before he left for college in 1885, \\"How would you like to become a forester?\\". Gifford studied as a postgraduate at the French National School of Forestry, in Nancy, for a year. He returned home and plunged into the nascent forestry movement, intent on shaping a national forest policy. At Gifford's urging, together James and Gifford endowed the Yale School of Forestry in 1900, and James turned Grey Towers, the family estate at Milford, Pennsylvania, into a \\"nursery\\" for the American forestry movement. Family financial affairs were managed by brother Amos Pinchot, thus freeing Gifford to do the more important work of developing forest management concepts. Unlike some others in the forestry movement, Gifford's wealth allowed him to singly pursue this goal without worry of income. Pinchot's approach set him apart from the other leading forestry experts, especially Bernhard E. Fernow and Carl A. Schenck. Fernow had been Pinchot's predecessor in the United States Department of Agriculture's Division of Forestry before leaving in 1898 to become the first Dean of the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell. Schenck was Pinchot's successor at the Biltmore Estate (widely recognized as the \\"cradle of American forestry\\") and founder of the Biltmore Forest School on Biltmore Estate. Their schools largely reflected their approaches to introducing forestry in the United States: Fernow advocated a regional approach and Schenck a private enterprise effort in contrast to Pinchot's national vision. Perhaps, the men who had the most influence on his development as a forester were Sir Dietrich Brandis, who had brought forestry to the British Empire, and Sir Wilhelm Schlich, Brandis' successor. Pinchot relied heavily upon Brandis' advice for introducing professional forest management in the U.S. and on how to structure the Forest Service when Pinchot established it in 1905.","completion":"This text is about Gifford Pinchot, an American forester and politician who played a pivotal role in the development of forest management and conservation in the United States.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The best family vacation that I ever had was going on a road trip to Myrtle Beach. The trip was for 2 weeks during the March break from school. This trip was probably about 20 years ago so it was before the time of things like portable video games and being able to watch movies in the back seat.2 So to pass the many hours of travel my brother and I had to entertain ourselves and each other. My mum would set the back seat up so that it was our own little playroom. She would pack everything up so that we had a big level area to play in. We would play cards and board games.C When it got to the point where we were at each other's throats we would be sent back to our own side of the seat and would be forced to either nap or read by ourselves until we could be friendly to each other again. I can remember us playing for quite some time when we turned the back seat into a spaceship and traveled around the earth.f Another time we turned it into a kitchen and had a bake-off . But the thing that I remember the most and that gave us many hours of enjoyment was using each other's faces as silly Plasticine and making funny faces. We would see how far we could stretch each other's mouths open, see how thin we could make the other's eye by pulling on it. We would keep going until one of us begged for mercy because we had to give our faces a rest.7 So while I can remember us having a great time on the beach, laughing a lot trying to put the tent up in the rain, what I remember the most of that trip and what always makes me smile the most is remembering the pain that our faces would be in after the trip.g Options: A We were fighting with each other./ B We used up our skills.A C We were quite out of breath.= D We were about to fall asleep.= Answer: A We were fighting with each other./ Question: A:","completion":"Based on the given article, which of the following describes a situation during the long road trip to Myrtle Beach?

The calls indicated that the 25-pound female bobcat Ollie may be in the Woodley Park or Cleveland Park neighborhoods. Meanwhile, D.C. schools have canceled recess at 13 schools near the National Zoo, even though zoo officials say the animal poses no danger to humans. School system spokeswoman Michelle Lerner says the decision to not let students outside on Tuesday was made “out of an abundance of caution.” She declined to comment on how long the policy would stay in place. Zoo spokeswoman Pamela Baker-Masson said she spoke to the school system’s chief operating officer and emphasized that the animal is not dangerous. She says the zoo and the school system will keep in touch as the search for the missing bobcat continues. On Tuesday, a team from the zoo and the Humane Rescue Alliance was dispatched to search the area where Ollie was reportedly spotted. Related Stories Bobcat escapes from National Zoo enclosure Washington, DC News The first choice is to catch her in a blanket, said Baker-Masson. Additionally, they have set up humane traps that look like oversized dog carriers. The Humane Rescue Alliance has darts, as well, but that is not the first choice in catching her, as a darted animal does not go down right away and may run and hide. Baker-Masson said that if Ollie headed toward Rock Creek Park rather than the Woodley Park and Cleveland Park areas, she may never be found. Ollie is believed to have escaped through an opening in the mesh around her enclosure Monday morning. The bobcat was last counted by zookeepers at 7:30 a.m. Monday, but around 10:40 a.m., Ollie couldn’t be found when keepers returned for the morning feeding.

Unlike the usual fare of feature films of the war movie, labor hero genre, we were shown two short subjects. One was a film about the DPRK soccer team's visit to the play-offs in London. The other was about a US service man's body being returned to the UN side at Panmunjom by the DPRK. Two different subjects, but one common action united the two films. The film about the soccer team began with the North Korean team arriving in London and driving through the streets in a bus festooned with flags of the DPRK. As the bus drove down the street one proper English gentleman complete with derby and umbrella spotted the bus and flipped it off! The man must have been a Korean War vet and he was giving the bus the finger. Whoever was taking the pictures zoomed in on it. A murmur went through the crew; the KORCOMs didn't know what the finger meant. This was further demonstrated in the second film in which a US Navy Officer flipped off the cameraman. They left it in. We now had a weapon! Back in our rooms we were elated, this was one more thing we could use to discredit the propaganda we were being forced to grind out. Several crew members expressed caution, but the general attitude was use it. We had been captured, but we never surrendered. Damn the Koreans, full fingers ahead. The finger became an integral part of our anti-propaganda campaign. Any time a camera appeared, so did the fingers. A concern grew among us that sooner or later the Koreans would notice this and ask questions. It was decided that if the question was raised, the answer was to be that the finger was a gesture known as the Hawaiian Good Luck sign, a variation of the Hang Loose gesture. In late August one of the duty officers asked about the finger and seemed to be accepting of the explanation, but most of us realized that our zeal to ruin their propaganda would come back to haunt us, eventually.

Movie plot title: Homecoming Movie plot: An unnamed US president (whose appearance is modeled after Bill Clinton and whose voice is modeled after George W. Bush) is running for reelection during a divisive war, and one of his speech writers, David Murch (Jon Tenney), goes on TV to speak with talk show host Marty Clark (Terry David Mulligan) and strident right-wing sexpot (and Ann Coulter-like) Jane Cleaver (Thea Gill). Another guest is Janet Hofstader (Beverly Breuer), the Cindy Sheehan-like mother of a dead soldier, who demands to know what her son died for. Murch gets a bit teary-eyed and explains that he lost his older brother Philip (Ryan McDonnell) in Vietnam.\\"Believe me,\\" he tells the grieving mom, \\"if I had one wish, I would wish for your son to come back, because I know he would tell us how important this struggle is.\\" Cleaver is so impressed with Murch's handling of the situation that she takes him out for a drink later, picks his brain, and eventually seduces him. The Karl Rove-like Kurt Rand (Robert Picardo) interrupts their tryst, calling to let Murch know that the president plans to make his line part of his stump speech.Soon, the soldiers killed in Iraq do start returning from the dead, and it doesn't go the way Murch predicted. They are not back to feast on the living, but unhappily for the president and his supporters, they just want a chance to vote in the upcoming election. \\"We'll vote for anyone who ends this war,\\" one explains. The spin machine goes into overdrive, but the dead are determined to make their voice heard even going as far as one soldier killing Kurt Rand by acting out the zombie stereotype (gouging his eye and slamming his head into the table) when Rand tried to force him to sign an unwanted document by threatening the soldier's mother.While voting results are being counted during the election, people within the current administration decide to skew the results so the current administration remains in power. After the election results are broadcast, more soldiers begin to return from the dead - but not just ones...

When a dog is incontinent they will often respond to their bladder leaking by licking around their genital area. The dog's skin might appear irritated and red. Select from the following. (i) Often, a dog will refuse to use the bathroom and should have bloody urine coming out of their urinary tract. If this happens to you or to an adult dog, move them to a safe place where they cannot urinate, and block their urinary tract to keep them from bladder incontinence.. (ii) In most cases, this redness is the sign of a urinary tract infection or gi tract infection. Your dog may develop a painful cough, muscle spasm, low abdominal area, or labored breathing.. (iii) You may also detect the strong odor of urine on their fur or in their bedding area. These are all indications that your dog is suffering from incontinence and needs medical attention..

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: (i) Although a dog's refusal to use the bathroom and bloody urine can be signs of a urinary tract issue, blocking their urinary tract is not a proper solution and may cause harm. They need proper veterinary care and diagnosis for their incontinence. (ii) Redness around the genital area can be indicative of a urinary or GI tract infection, but the described symptoms such as painful cough, muscle spasm, low abdominal area, or labored breathing are not exclusive to these infections and may not necessarily result from incontinence. (iv) While pressure on the bladder can cause some issues, the statement about the dog becoming lame and peeing more frequently isn't a proper conclusion.

Answer the above question based on the context below: During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.

Though both have the purpose of fostering connections, their objectives and methods can differ significantly. Intentional friend-making focuses on creating new friendships and connections with the express purpose of building a supportive network and potentially introducing one's beliefs and values to others. This process can involve meeting new people, attending social events, and actively seeking out others who may benefit from or be interested in your faith or shared values. The ultimate goal is not necessarily to convert others, but rather to create an environment in which one can share their beliefs and offer support without judgment. On the other hand, friendship evangelism is a more targeted approach within existing relationships. This method involves sharing one's faith with friends or acquaintances with whom one already has a trusting and established relationship. The goal is to introduce or deepen the other person's understanding of your faith, allowing them to learn more and potentially adopt some or all aspects of your beliefs. By employing friendship evangelism, you are focusing on opening up a dialogue about faith within an existing relationship, rather than directly seeking to create new friendships. Despite their differences, both intentional friend-making and friendship evangelism stem from a genuine desire to share one's faith and connect with others who can benefit from or relate to your beliefs. These approaches can complement each other in forming a comprehensive and effective strategy for building relationships and spreading your faith among different groups of people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose specific singles - The iPod's design and user interface made it easy for users to navigate through their music library and select the specific songs they wanted to listen to. 4.

While the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed like the beginning of a not too mainstream psychological thriller, it soon went downhill from there and eventually degraded into one of the most generic slasher films I've seen so far, including a massive amount of plot holes, unrealistic emotional responses and sub-par acting. It seems like Boll tried his best to come up with a decent plot but after a while just gave up on it. Maybe he should stick to comedy?! The few good things about this film is that he does manage to create an overall creepy atmosphere, that the special effects are better than I expected and the soundtrack does go well with the overall atmosphere, but the unbalanced pacing of this film combined with the utter generic nature thereof makes he last half hour quite tedious to watch, which ruined my experience altogether. There are a very fairly well done shocking scenes, but they seem to be there for the shock value alone. And let's not forget the camera work that was pretty nauseating at times.

To bring peace, Merlin (Nicol Williamson) secures the mystical sword Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake (Hilary Joyalle) and gives it to Uther. Impressed by this symbol of power and Uther's promise of land, Cornwall relents and recognizes Uther as king. Cornwall hosts a celebration, where his wife, Igrayne (Katrine Boorman) dances. Uther cannot hide his lust and the fragile truce is broken.Uther besieges Cornwall's castle. He again asks Merlin to intervene. Merlin agrees to give him Igrayne but only if Merlin will receive the result of Uther's lust. That night, Uther's men draw Cornwall out of his castle and ambush him, killing him. Merlin transforms Uther to resemble Cornwall. Uther enters the castle, makes rough love to Igrayne and impregnates her as Cornwall breathes his last.Nine months later, Igrayne gives birth to a son. Upon seeing his son for the first time, Uther vows to become a peaceful king and secure his kingdom for his son. Merlin, who has not been seen since the night Cornwall died, appears and takes the child, as per their agreement. Igrayne is distraught and as Merlin disappears into the forest, Uther tries to stop him but is attacked by knights still loyal to Cornwall. Mortally wounded, Uther drives Excalibur into a stone, declaring no one will have the sword but him. Standing nearby, Merlin recites a spell that will keep the sword in the stone until Arthur is old enough to claim it.For the next sixteen years, no one is able to pull the sword from the stone. Annually a joust is held to see who will be able to try; if any man succeeds, he will be crowned king. Sir Ector (Clive Swift) brings his son, Kay (Niall O'Brien) and Kay's squire, Arthur (Nigel Terry). When Arthur forgets Kay's sword, he goes to the stone and draws Excalibur for Kay to use in the joust. Incredulous, the crowd sees that Arthur has removed the sword.

John is studying the different states of matter. Today, he has a matter in three states in front of him, state A, state B, and state C. State A is in solid state. State B is in liquid state. And, state C is in gaseous state. He needs to determine the properties of each state. Hint: As Figure above shows, the distance between particles is much smaller for the solid and liquid states than for the gas state. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter.

The narrator's cousin D. not enough information Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: What is creativity? How de we define creativity? Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us. Maybe creativity to you is 90% unique idea, 5% skill and 5% hard work. Maybe creativity to you is 40% unique idea, 50% skill and 10% hard work. Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from? Is it simply random? Is it a gift from the gods? Is our unique idea just a product of a lot of subconscious effort, only made aware to us in the sense of a ‘random’ idea? Have we been influenced by something, processed it... Question: Who started Capturing Creativity Studio?

Question: What does the crowd do when the supply of Soylent Green is exhausted? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Soylent Green Context: The 20th century's industrialization leaves the world overcrowded, polluted and stagnant. In 2022, with 40 million people in New York City alone, housing is dilapidated and overcrowded; homeless people fill the streets; the majority are unemployed, the few \\"lucky\\" people with jobs are only barely scraping by, and food and working technology is scarce. Most of the population survives on rations produced by the Soylent Corporation, whose newest product is Soylent Green, a green wafer advertised to contain \\"high-energy plankton\\" from the World Ocean, more nutritious and palatable than its predecessors \\"Red\\" and \\"Yellow\\", but in short supply. New York City Police Department detective Frank Thorn lives with aged friend and \\"book\\" (a police analyst) Solomon \\"Sol\\" Roth. Roth remembers life before its current miserable state, and often waxes nostalgic. He is also well-educated and uses a small library of reference materials to assist Thorn. Investigating the murder of William R. Simonson, a wealthy businessman, Thorn questions Shirl, a concubine, and Tab Fielding, Simonson's bodyguard, who, when the murder took place, was escorting Shirl. Thorn searches Simonson's apartment for clues and enjoys Simonson's luxurious lifestyle, helping himself to Simonson's bourbon, fresh produce, and a steak Shirl purchased as a surprise for Simonson. Thorn gives Roth the classified Soylent Oceanographic Survey Report, 2015 to 2019 he's found in Simonson's apartment. Roth's research reveals Simonson and the current governor of New York, Joseph Santini, were partners in a law firm, and that Simonson was also a member of the board of Soylent. Thorn tells his lieutenant, Hatcher, that he suspects an assassination: nothing had been stolen from the apartment, its sophisticated alarm was not working for the first time in two years, and Simonson's bodyguard was absent.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize: Start with short intervals and increase the time with the bunny. Consider placing a nice plate of greens out for the rabbit to eat while you stroke the rabbit to decrease any potential anxiety. Don't make sudden moves or sounds that might alarm your rabbit. Be gentle and soothing when you pet the rabbit. Rabbits are prey animals, so when they feel threatened, they run and hide if they can. Sit on the floor to minimize your size and avoid towering over the bunny. Never pick up a rabbit by his ears, legs, scruff, or tail. Rabbits are very delicate and you could severely injure them if you pick them up incorrectly. Grabbing on to limbs, tails, or ears will cause the rabbit to react by pulling away. Doing so may cause a fracture or a dislocation or tearing of underlying muscle and soft tissue. A bunny new to the household should be picked up and restrained by adults at first. Children can pet the bunny while it is on the floor or while sitting in the child’s (or adult’s) lap sitting on the floor. Staying close to the ground for a while is a good preventative measure. Should the rabbit try to escape, they will not fall a long distance and potentially injure themselves. Reward the rabbit with a treat afterward. This will help it get used to the feeling of being picked up. Do not pick the rabbit up by the scruff alone, but use this as a handle to prevent forward motion while you use your other hand arm to tuck the hind legs under the bunny and scrunch the bunny in a gentle “bunny ball.” Your free hand that is not holding the scruff should be placed on the bunny’s rump. You should roll the back legs underneath, toward the front of the bunny, holding the feet up with your hand. This will prevent the rabbit from kicking out and potentially injuring itself. There are differing opinions on whether or not to scruff a rabbit. Scruffing, done gently, does not injure the rabbit. Place one under his chest and one under its behind. The positioning should be comfortable for both you and the rabbit. Make sure you have a firm (but not tight) grip on the rabbit's body so that it doesn't leap from your hands when you lift. Make sure to contain the hind legs securely, by keeping your hand on the rump and scrunching the hind legs up toward the bunny’s head. Remember, you are holding the hind legs so that they point forward, toward the head, the opposite direction of where the hind legs would be should the bunny kick out. It may help to kneel to get closer to the rabbit, so you don't have to bend and lift. Get down on the ground with the rabbit. It's best to lift a rabbit either from a top-opening cage or a confined area in your house. It can be much more difficult to lift a rabbit from a side opening cage. Rabbits will often run and hide when approached, so trying to pick up a rabbit in a room with lots of furniture will also be difficult. When removing a rabbit from a side or front opening carrier, do so with the hind legs first out of the opening. That way, if they get out of your grip, they will jump back into the carrier and not down to the ground. Use one hand to hold the bunny’s head away from you, toward the back of the cage, while gently holding on to the scruff. The other hand is used over the bunny’s rump to scrunch the hind legs up into the “bunny ball” hold. Then lift the bunny out, hind legs toward you, and place under your arm so the bunny’s head is given a place to hide. If you are getting the bunny out of a top-opening carrier, you can use the same technique, just remember not to dangle the bunny by the scruff. If this is a well handled and calm bunny, you are likely to be able to safely pick up the bunny with one hand under its chest and one hand scrunching the rump, without holding on to the scruff. Be aware, that if the bunny feels like it might fall, it will struggle and kick and try to get down. If this happens, place the bunny back in the carrier and re-grip or go back to using the scruff to help with restraint. If your rabbit tends to run under furniture, coax it out with a treat before trying to pick it up. Better yet, manage the area to prevent the rabbit from being able to get away and hide so that it doesn't have access to hiding places that are difficult for you to access. Try using an exercise pen to confine the bunny, but still allowing them an area large enough to hop around. Never pull on a rabbit's legs or tail to get it to move closer to you. It is better to gently get a hold of the scruff to prevent the rabbit from getting away, then you can get an arm around the rabbit’s body and contain the hind legs. Never forcefully scruff a rabbit or dangle it by the scruff. This will cause the rabbit injury. If a rabbit thumps a hind leg when you approach, be aware that this is a warning to you that you are in their territory and they are not thrilled with your presence. The rabbit may be more difficult to handle, so be prepared. Again, remember to use confinement within an exercise pen or other area to help you manage the rabbit’s access to hiding places and allow you find and restrain the rabbit more easily.","completion":"To build trust and minimize anxiety with a rabbit, start with short intervals, offer food, and be gentle.

His tousled, sandy brown hair that always framed his face so effortlessly, made him look like a man who had just emerged from the pages of a romantic novel. \\"I don't know what it is about you, Melody,\\" Logan continued, the sincerity in his voice bringing her back to reality, \\"but you make me want to explore the depths of my soul, emotions buried deep within me that I never even knew existed.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the information given, this data could be about a World War II military officer who served in the Luftwaffe, which was the aerial warfare branch of the Nazi German military. The officer was born on November 17, 1915, in Marienwerder, a town that is now part of modern-day Poland, and had a death date of July 22, 1985, in Burgdorf, Hanover, Germany. Throughout their military career, they demonstrated allegiance to Nazi Germany. As a military officer, this individual served until 1945 and reached the rank of Major im Generalstab. They were assigned to Flak Regiment 36, a unit that specialized in anti-aircraft warfare. The Luftwaffe of Nazi Germany focused on air defense and played a pivotal role in several key battles, including during the Spanish Civil War and World War II. The officer was recognized and awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, which was one of the highest military decorations in Nazi Germany that was awarded for outstanding military leadership and valor. This award signified that the officer had demonstrated extraordinary bravery and service on the battlefield. Considering these details, one possibility this information might refer to is Major Horst Kaestner. Kaestner was an officer in the Luftwaffe during World War II who ultimately received the Knight's Cross of Iron Cross for his service.

Push the 2x4 board along the ground to lower any raised spots and fill the low spots with dirt. Check the level as you work so you can make the ground as even as possible. Simple carpenter's levels can be purchased at most hardware or home improvement stores. Buy a 2x4 board that is approximately the same length as the area you are leveling. If you are leveling the whole yard, purchase a large 2x4 board and move it along the area you are leveling as you work. Alternatively, you could rent a water-filled lawn roller from a home improvement store to help you level your yard. If your yard is grassy and you did not have to remove any turf, then your work is done. If you did, however, then you will need to grow new grass from seedlings. Spread grass seeds over the areas you leveled, then cover them with peat moss to help the seeds retain moisture. Avoid stepping on your grass seedlings for the first few weeks to prevent trampling them underfoot. Water your seeds daily to keep them moist, but avoid watering so much that puddles form. You could also mix grass seeds into a top dressing and spread 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) over thin or bare areas. Follow the guidelines on the package to use the right amount of seeds for the area you’re covering. New grass seeds need plenty of care and maintenance to keep healthy. If you stripped your entire lawn, lay sod on the ground and grow a new lawn. Roll out tight rows of sod over the bare ground, keeping the gaps between rows tight. Fill in the lines with soil or peat moss, then walk over the rows with a lawn roller to ensure contact between the sod roots and dirt. Water your sod at least once a week, and mow the area whenever it grows taller than about 3.5 inches (8.9 cm). Summary:","completion":"To make your yard even, you should use a string line level and put it on 4 stakes and look at the bubble. If the bubble is not in the middle, the ground is not even. You can use a rake or shovel to make the ground even. If it's still not even, you can use a 2x4 board with a carpenter's level on top and push it along the ground to make it even. When your yard is even, you can plant new grass seeds and take care of them with water and soil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Who is hired to endorse his opponent? Movie title: Head of State Movie plot: Mays Gilliam (Chris Rock) is an alderman of the 9th Ward in the Washington D.C. area. After being fired from his post, Mays is surprisingly chosen as the party candidate for the presidency (after his party's original presidential and vice-presidential nominees die in a plane crash; their two separate planes crashed into each other) to run against sitting vice-president Brian Lewis. Assuming the election was already lost, the party decided to pick a likeable but losing minority candidate to improve their chances of another politician taking the office in the next presidential election.

Trump's approval hit 43 percent in the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with 52 percent disapproving. That represents a 3 percent improvement from last month in the same survey. Several other new surveys also show Trump at or slightly above 40 percent. The RealClearPolitics polling average puts the president's approval rating at 41 percent, a noticeable bump from August, when the rating was often in the mid-30s. For much of the second half of August, Trump's approval rating in the Gallup Daily Tracking poll was either 34 percent or 35 percent, historically a low mark for a new president. On Thursday, Gallup had Trump at 37 percent. The previous day, Trump hit 39 percent, his highest mark since late July. Trump's recent outreach to Democrats on budget issues and, possibly, immigration has boosted his poll numbers, as has his administration's response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed approved of Trump's deal with Democrats to fund the government until December and raise the debt ceiling, while 8 percent disapproved. The question is whether Trump has turned a political corner, or is merely seeing a temporary respite from the low poll ratings that have plagued him since the beginning of his presidency. That could depend on whether working with Democrats is a long-range goal or a passing fad, and experts said that making a forecast on that could turn out to be foolish. \\"When it comes to President Trump, I have gotten out of the prediction business,\\" said Brookings Institution scholar Bill Galston. \\"For now, this is a significant shift of strategy and tactics.

Established in 1916, the organization had approximately 1500 members and a paid staff of 4 in 2013. The former Mayor of Portland, Sam Adams, served as Executive Director 2013 to 2015. The current Executive Director is Julia Meier. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? The City Club of Portland, led by Julia Meier, does not seek to make a profit. Options: + Yes. + It's impossible to say. + No.","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided in the paragraph, the sentence \\"The City Club of Portland, led by Julia Meier, does not seek to make a profit\\" can be considered true. The paragraph indicates that the City Club of Portland is a nonprofit organization. Additionally, nonprofit organizations typically aim to serve the public interest and invest any revenue generated back into the organization's mission and goals rather than distributing it to shareholders or other stakeholders for profit. Furthermore, the fact that the City Club of Portland is described as nonpartisan, meaning it does not support or endorse any particular political party, also supports the idea that its main purpose is civic engagement rather than profit-making. In this context, Julia Meier serves as the Executive Director, which means she is responsible for overseeing the organization's operations, staff, and the implementation of its mission and objectives. As demonstrated in the paragraph, the organization has had changes in its leadership over the years, with former leaders such as Sam Adams also functioning as Executive Director. However, these changes in leadership would not affect the nonprofit and nonpartisan status of the City Club of Portland, because its organizational structure and mission would remain focused on serving the public interest, not on generating profits. Additionally, it's essential to recognize that The City Club of Portland is a well-established organization, having been founded in 1916. This historical longevity indicates that, over the years, the organization has remained consistent in its dedication to its nonprofit and nonpartisan mission. The membership structure, with 1,500 members as of 2013, further emphasizes the civic nature of the organization and suggests that a central goal is promoting community participation and discussion on various issues. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is accurate to say that The City Club of Portland, led by Julia Meier, does not seek to make a profit. As a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization, its primary mission is to engage citizens in civic matters and provide a platform for the exchange of ideas, rather than generating revenue for personal or stakeholder gains."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plot title: The Host Movie plot: The human race has been taken over by small parasitic aliens called \\"Souls\\". They travel to planets inserting themselves into a host body of that planet's dominant species while suppressing the host's consciousness. They access the host's memories, and occupied hosts are identifiable by silver rings in the hosts' eyes. A human on the run, Melanie Stryder, is captured and infused with a soul called \\"Wanderer.\\" Wanderer is asked by Seeker to access Melanie's memories in order to discover the location of a pocket of unassimilated humans. Melanie's consciousness, however, has not been completely eliminated, and it struggles to regain control of her body. Melanie and Wanderer carry out an internal conversation and debate with each other, forming a friendship. Wanderer shares with Seeker that Melanie was traveling with her brother, Jamie, and her boyfriend, Jared Howe, to find Melanie's uncle Jeb in the desert. Wanderer admits that Melanie is still present, so Seeker decides to be transferred into Melanie's body to get the information herself. With the help of Melanie, Wanderer escapes and makes her way to the desert, where she is found by Jeb, who takes her to a series of caves hidden inside a mountain where the humans (including Jared and Jamie) are hiding. Wanderer's presence is met with hostility by all but Jeb and Jamie. Melanie instructs Wanderer not to tell anyone she is still alive, since it would provoke them, though she later allows her to tell Jamie. Wanderer begins interacting with the humans and slowly begins to gain their trust, forming a bond with Ian O'Shea. Seeker leads a search party into the desert to find Wanderer. They intercept one of the shelter's supply teams, and in the ensuing chase, Aaron and Brandt commit suicide to avoid capture. During the chase, Seeker accidentally kills another Soul, leading her superiors to call off the search.

Age of Enlightenment: One of the most important developments that the Enlightenment era brought to the discipline of science was its popularization. An increasingly literate population seeking knowledge and education in both the arts and the sciences drove the expansion of print culture and the dissemination of scientific learning. The new literate population was due to a high rise in the availability of food. This enabled many people to rise out of poverty, and instead of paying more for food, they had money for education. Popularization was generally part of an overarching Enlightenment ideal that endeavoured \\"to make information available to the greatest number of people.\\" As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century, public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies. More formal works included explanations of scientific theories for individuals lacking the educational background to comprehend the original scientific text. Sir Isaac Newton's celebrated Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica was published in Latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education in the classics until Enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze the text in the vernacular.

Go online and search for the kind of quiff you want, then show the person who cuts your hair so that they have a good idea of what you want.

Short Quiff: This short, clean cut has become popular with businessmen and executive types. It is short on the sides and tops with 1-2 inches of coiffed hair at most. The Pompadour: This is a big, wavy quiff, similar to James Dean or Johnny Cash's haircuts. Undercut: This modern cut is when you buzz the sides of your head almost completely, fading into light hair on top and a small, short quiff, like Adam Levine. Pretty much anyone can carry off a quiff with the right products and tools, though it’s probably best to avoid this style if you have thin, very curly, or ferociously frizzy hair.

The book is authored by Stephen King, and it was also adapted into a movie, thus providing multiple sources to draw information from. Based on general knowledge, I know that the main characters of \\"The Shining\\" are Jack Torrance, his wife, Wendy Torrance, and their son, Danny Torrance. However, the protagonist or the main focus is typically Jack Torrance, especially as much of the plot revolves around his mental disintegration. These characters' experiences at the Overlook Hotel are the focus of the story. Jack, the father, is the character whose perspective is often focused on in the narrative, which makes him one of the primary characters. Nonetheless, the entire family's ordeal is central to the story. Overall, if one had to single out a main character, it would probably be Jack Torrance. However, Danny and Wendy Torrance are also central to the story, making them main characters as well."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Insect growth is constrained by the inelastic exoskeleton and development involves a series of molts. The immature stages can differ from the adults in structure, habit and habitat, and can include a passive pupal stage in those groups that undergo 4-stage metamorphosis (see holometabolism). Insects that undergo 3-stage metamorphosis lack a pupal stage and adults develop through a series of nymphal stages. The higher level relationship of the Hexapoda is unclear. Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the Paleozoic Era, including giant dragonflies with wingspans of 55 to 70 cm (22–28 in). The most diverse insect groups appear to have coevolved with flowering plants. What is the primary constraint on the physical growth of an insect?","completion":"The primary constraint on the physical growth of an insect is its inelastic exoskeleton. Insects have a hard, protective outer covering called an exoskeleton, which is made of a material called chitin. Unlike the flexible and elastic skin found in mammals, an insect's exoskeleton is rigid and does not expand or stretch as the insect grows. As a result of this inelastic exoskeleton, insects must go through a process called molting in order to grow. Molting involves shedding the old exoskeleton and replacing it with a new, larger one. During the molting process, the insect secretes enzymes that break down the old exoskeleton, and a new, soft exoskeleton forms beneath it. Once the old exoskeleton is shed, the new one rapidly hardens and takes on its final, rigid form. The process of molting is repeated several times throughout an insect's life as it progresses through its various developmental stages. While this process allows for growth, the rigidity of the exoskeleton still places constraints on the ultimate size that an insect can attain. Moreover, the inelastic exoskeleton also affects the insect's metabolic and respiratory systems, which need to supply oxygen and nutrients to the growing body. As the insect grows larger, these systems may become less efficient, making it difficult for the insect to meet its physiological needs. This further contributes to the limitations on an insect's physical growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The crash, which took place on the evening of September 26th, involved a semi-truck colliding head-on with a bus carrying the North Central Texas College women's softball team. The team was returning from a four-game scrimmage in Oklahoma City when the devastating accident occurred. Initial reports of the incident pointed to driver error on the part of the semi-truck driver. However, as the investigation proceeded, evidence has emerged that the driver may have intentionally driven his vehicle into the wrong lane, causing the catastrophic collision. This chilling revelation has raised the possibility of a willful act by the truck driver, escalating the tragedy from a fatal accident to a possible criminal act. The accident occurred on Interstate 35 just north of Ardmore, Oklahoma, when a semi-truck operated by Quickway Transportation Inc. crossed the median and entered the wrong lane, striking the front left side of the southbound bus. The impact resulted in the catastrophic failure of the bus's left wheel, sending it careening off the roadway. The bus then rolled over several times before coming to a rest in a ditch alongside the interstate. Four young student-athletes tragically lost their lives in this horrendous crash, with thirteen others sustaining injuries - two in critical condition. \\"As a response to witness statements and evidence collected at the scene, we are investigating the possibility of homicide in this case,\\" said a spokesperson for the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety. \\"We owe it to the victims, their families, and the entire college community to ensure that we explore every possible explanation for this crash, and hold the responsible party accountable.\\" The semi-truck driver, identified as Russell Staley, 53, from Saginaw, Texas, was reportedly uninjured in the crash. Upon his release from the hospital, he was interrogated by local police who have not yet filed charges against him. Staley is cooperating with the ongoing investigation, which is expected to take several weeks. The families of the deceased and injured are anxiously awaiting answers to their questions about this senseless tragedy. The ramifications of the possible homicide allegation have been deeply felt by the college and surrounding community. North Central Texas College President Dr. G. Brent Wallace said, \\"The bond that our students have with each other, their families, and our community is something that we hold dear, and it has been broken by this tragedy. We are heartbroken and devastated by the loss of these young lives and pray for their families and teammates as they mourn their loss.\\" In light of these recent developments, a candlelit vigil was held at North Central Texas College to honor the memory of the four fallen student-athletes, and prayers were offered for the swift recovery of the injured survivors. The devastated college community is coming together in grief and support, as they seek answers and justice for those taken too soon in this horrifying crash. As the investigation continues, authorities are urging anyone with information regarding the crash or the moments leading up to the collision to contact the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety. The search for justice for these young lives taken too soon is paramount for both the families and the community as they struggle to cope with the senseless loss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Murder in Amsterdam: The Death of Theo Van Gogh and the Limits of Tolerance is a 2006 book by Ian Buruma which demonizes the impact of mass immigration from Muslim countries into Dutch culture.","completion":"No, it would not be accurate to infer that \\"Murder in Amsterdam: The Death of Theo Van Gogh and the Limits of Tolerance\\" by Ian Buruma demonizes the impact of mass immigration from Muslim countries into Dutch culture. Buruma's book, as described, is framed as a lens to view the cultural impact of mass immigration and the effects it had in the specific context of the Netherlands. However, using it as a lens does not necessarily mean it portrays those effects in a negative or demonizing light. The book seeks to discuss a sensitive issue that has had a profound impact on Dutch society and other European nations. It does so by exploring the murder of Theo van Gogh, who was an outspoken critic of Islam, and delves into the tensions that this immigration has brought to the surface. Its purpose is to stimulate thought and dialogue about a complex, multi-faceted issue, not to vilify a group of people or a process. Challenging the 'limits of tolerance' the book indeed sheds light upon how the influx of a different culture can sometimes ignite frictions in society, but this scrutiny is aimed more at a rigorous examination of societal reaction to the 'other,' rather than passing judgment on immigration itself. Therefore, it is best to view Buruma's work as engaging in a deep, nuanced analysis of the cultural clash that resulted from mass immigration, rather than demonizing the process or the people involved. It's important to remember that the characterization of the book might also depend on a reader's perspective. Different readers might interpret the book's message in different ways, depending on their own beliefs and experiences. A person with strong anti-immigration sentiments may take away a very different message than someone who is more pro-immigration. As such, Buruma's book is a complex piece of work open to interpretation, but it wouldn't be accurate to say it universally demonizes the impact of immigration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But these failings aside, it appears plain that most of Crimea's population, with the exception of the Tatar minority and some ethnic Ukrainians, was content to return to what it regards as its ancestral home.

Sir Richard Francis Burton (; 19 March 1821 - 20 October 1890) was a British explorer, geographer, translator, writer, soldier, orientalist, cartographer, ethnologist, spy, linguist, poet, fencer, and diplomat. He was famed for his travels and explorations in Asia, Africa and the Americas, as well as his extraordinary knowledge of languages and cultures. According to one count, he spoke 29 European, Asian and African languages. Burton died in Trieste early on the morning of 20 October 1890 of a heart attack. His wife Isabel persuaded a priest to perform the last rites, although Burton was not a Catholic and this action later caused a rift between Isabel and some of Burton's friends. It has been suggested that the death occurred very late on 19 October and that Burton was already dead by the time the last rites were administered. On his religious views, Burton called himself an atheist, stating he was raised in the Church of England which he said was \\"officially (his) church\\". Isabel never recovered from the loss. After his death she burned many of her husband's papers, including journals and a planned new translation of The Perfumed Garden to be called The Scented Garden, for which she had been offered six thousand guineas and which she regarded as his \\"magnum opus\\". She believed she was acting to protect her husband's reputation, and that she had been instructed to burn the manuscript of The Scented Garden by his spirit, but her actions have been widely condemned. Isabel wrote a biography in praise of her husband. The couple are buried in a remarkable tomb in the shape of a Bedouin tent, designed by Isabel, in the cemetery of St Mary Magdalen Roman Catholic Church Mortlake in southwest London. The coffins of Sir Richard and Lady Burton can be seen through a window at the rear of the tent, which can be accessed via a short fixed ladder. Next to the lady chapel in the church there is a memorial stained-glass window to Burton, also erected by Isabel; it depicts Burton as a mediaeval knight.

Q:Information: - Anampses is a genus of wrasses native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans . - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - The wrasses are a family, Labridae, of marine fish, many of which are brightly colored. The family is large and diverse, with over 600 species in 82 genera, which are divided into 9 subgroups or tribes. They are typically small fish, most of them less than long, although the largest, the humphead wrasse, can measure up to . They are efficient carnivores, feeding on a wide range of small invertebrates. Many smaller wrasses follow the feeding trails of larger fish, picking up invertebrates disturbed by their passing. Juveniles of some representatives of the genera \\"Bodianus\\", \\"Epibulus\\",\\"Cirrhilabrus\\", \\"Oxycheilinus\\", and \\"Paracheilinus\\" hide among the tentacles of the free-living mushroom coral \\"Heliofungia actiniformis\\". - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. What entity does 'anampses' has the relation 'parent taxon' with?

She was born in London on January 9th, 1810. She entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of 14. Seven years later, just after her first show, Anna married Sir Henry Bishop, who was 24 years her senior. Her reputation as a singer grew rapidly, based largely on her tours with Sir Henry and harpist Nicholas Bochsa. After a tour of Dublin, Edinburgh, and London, Anna Bishop deserted her husband and three children and ran away with Bochsa. From then on, Madame Bishop--as she continued to be known--traveled and sang as if her life depended on it. Between 1839 and 1843 she traveled to every major town in Europe, where she sang in 260 concerts. In the course of two years in Naples, she performed in 20 operas. In 1855 she and Bochsa sailed for Sydney, Australia. He died there the following year, and Anna went on to tour South America before returning to New York, where she married a diamond merchant. Then she began what proved her most dangerous adventure. After another American tour in 1866, she and her husband set sail across the Pacific. They were shipwrecked on a small coral reef, and for more than a month they drifted in a small boat before they finally reaching Guam. She had lost her music, her wardrobe, and her jewelry, but Madame Bishop was not to be stopped. She went on to Manila and began a concert tour that led to Hong Kong, Singapore, and India before she went back to England. After another two-year world tour she returned eventually to New York, where she gave her last public performance in 1883--at age 73.

It has several common names, including: aplodontia, mountain boomer, ground bear, and giant mole. The name sewellel beaver comes from \\"sewellel\\" or \\"suwellel\\", the Chinookan term for a cloak made from its pelts. This species is the only living member of its genus, Aplodontia, and family, Aplodontiidae. It should not be confused with true North American and Eurasian beavers, to which it is not closely related. - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - The term Sciuromorpha has referred to numerous groups of rodents , but the only family common to all variations is the Sciuridae , the squirrels . Most definitions also include the mountain beaver . Traditionally , the term has been defined on the basis of the shape of the infraorbital canal . A sciuromorphous zygomasseteric system is characterized by attachment of the lateral masseter muscle along the side of the rostrum . Unlike hystricomorphous and myomorphous rodents , the medial masseter muscle does not pass through the infraorbital canal . Among extant rodents , only the families Sciuridae , Castoridae , Heteromyidae , and Geomyidae are truly sciuromorphous . Some authorities would exclude the Geomyidae and Heteromyidae from that list due to the attachment of the medial masseter directly behind the zygomatic arch. Carleton and Musser ( 2005 ) redefined rodent suborders on the basis of a host of both morphological and molecular reasons . They defined the Sciuromorpha as including three families , Sciuridae , Aplodontiidae , and Gliridae . Of these , only the Sciuridae are truly sciuromorphous . The Aplodontiidae are protrogomorphous and the Gliridae are myomorphous . The connection between Aplodontiidae and Sciuridae has been proposed numerous times in the past . The two families have been united into a common infraorder ( Sciurida ) or superfamily ( Sciuroidea ) . It has long been suggested that dormice ( Gliridae ) are not particularly related to the Myomorpha , and their zygomasseteric structure has been termed \`\` pseudomyomorphy '' . The connection between squirrels and dormice has been almost exclusively suggested through genetic studies , and to a lesser degree via the fossil rodent Reithroparamys . - The Eurasian beaver or European beaver (\\"Castor fiber\\") is a species of beaver which was once widespread in Eurasia. It was hunted to near-extinction for both its fur and castoreum; and by 1900, only 1200 beavers survived in eight relict populations in Europe and Asia. Reintroduced through much of its former range, it now occurs from Great Britain to China and Mongolia, although it is absent from Italy, Portugal, the southern Balkans, and the Middle East. - A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population. What object entity has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'sciuromorpha'? Choices: - amniota - aplodontia - area - bear - castor - human - rodentia - sauropsida - theria - theriiformes The answer to this question is:","completion":"Rodentia. The parent taxon of Sciuromorpha is Rodentia, as Sciuromorpha is a suborder within this order of mammals. The members of Sciuromorpha include some families such as Sciuridae, Aplodontiidae, and Gliridae, which share certain characteristics in their skull and jaw structures.

Checkout is not entirely worthless. i've had the opportunity to see it twice, and on the second time i did get a great laugh at the movie's expense. so i guess it's worth something for that. and also it's worthwhile for the excruciating pain it caused me on my first viewing. as another reviewer pointed out, this film is hackneyed in every sense of the word. not a single original thought went into this movie (which makes the comment below about the originality of the premise entirely baffling to me). the film is nothing but a long line of cliches which are strung together and paraded around as a movie. it is definitely not the next Clerks, it is definitely not original, and it is absolutely not \\"good, clean fun.\\" the film is absolute agony to the uninitiated (after seeing it a first time, the second time can be quite funny, in an insulting sort of way). as i looked around the theater, it was obvious that nearly everyone, barring perhaps the elderly, were completely bored or pained by this movie. during some of the particularly emotional scenes, like where Nick chews out his mother, the audience was actually cringing because it was so poorly done. i even heard someone *groan* in the theater, something i had heretofore never witnessed. i don't care where you have the chance to see this movie, be it at a film festival, or in a indie theater, or wherever. do yourself a favor, skip this movie with a vengeance. unless you're like me and just can't resist the opportunity to see what may truly be the worst movie ever made.

Is the following review positive or negative? I love this place because it opens at 7am and near my office. I start work early and sometimes need a great breakfast burrito. I ordered a sausage egg and cheese burrito with potatoes, I do wish the tortillas were homemade but the burro was very delish. Sam will make it any way you like, but this place also has sandwiches and it's brand new so they still have that new smell, its very clean and just a little deli in my area. I also had the BBQ pulled pork special they had the other day for lunch. It looks like they specialize in pick-ups and deliveries since the area is packed with nearby businesses. Service is also very friendly.","completion":"This review is positive. Step-by-step analysis: 1.

Sentence 1: In some cases, pain, or at least inconvenience, is secondary, or rather insignificant, to humiliation. Sentence 2: In some cases, pain, or at least discomfort, is insignificant, or rather subordinates to humiliation. Step 2: Identify the differences in sentence structure and wording. Difference 1: \\"inconvenience\\" (Sentence 1) vs \\"discomfort\\" (Sentence 2) Difference 2: \\"secondary\\" (Sentence 1) vs \\"subordinates\\" (Sentence 2) Step 3: Evaluate whether the meanings of the different words and structures are the same. Evaluation of Difference 1: \\"inconvenience\\" refers to a minor annoyance or difficulty, while \\"discomfort\\" refers to a mild pain or physical discomfort. These words have similar but not identical meanings. Evaluation of Difference 2: The word \\"secondary\\" means something of lesser importance, while \\"subordinates\\" is a verb that suggests one thing being subordinate or subservient to another. Since \\"secondary\\" is an adjective and \\"subordinates\\" is a verb, the structure and meaning are not the same. Step 4: Determine if the overall meaning of the sentences is the same. The overall meaning of the two sentences is similar, but not exactly the same due to the different words and sentence structures used.

On her way to La Jolla for the horse races, she stops in Los Angeles to visit her son Roy (John Cusack), a small-time grifter whom she has not seen in eight years. She finds him in pain and bleeding internally after one of his victims caught him pulling a petty scam and punched him in the stomach. When medical assistance finally comes, Lilly confronts the doctor, threatening to have him killed if her son dies. At the hospital, Lilly meets and takes an instant dislike to Roy's girlfriend, Myra Langtry (Annette Bening), who is a few years older than her son. Lilly urges her son to quit the grift, saying he literally does not have the stomach for it. Because she leaves late for La Jolla, she misses a race where the winner was paying 70â1. For this mistake, Bobo burns her hand with a cigar. Myra, like Roy and Lilly, plays all the angles. When her landlord demands payment of late rent, she uses her sex appeal to lure him into bed and forget the rent. She makes a similar offer to a jeweler (Stephen Tobolowsky) to get what she wants for a gem she is trying to pawn. Upon leaving the hospital, Roy takes Myra to La Jolla for the weekend. On the train, she notices him conning a group of sailors in a rigged dice game. Myra reveals to Roy that she is also a grifter and is looking for a new partner for a long-con operation. Myra describes her long association with another man, Cole (J. T.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.

Separation of church and state in the United States: The Duke of York had required that every community in his new lands of New York and New Jersey support some church, but this was more often Dutch Reformed, Quaker or Presbyterian, than Anglican. Some chose to support more than one church. He also ordained that the tax-payers were free, having paid his local tax, to choose their own church. The terms for the surrender of New Amsterdam had provided that the Dutch would have liberty of conscience, and the Duke, as an openly divine-right Catholic, was no friend of Anglicanism. The first Anglican minister in New Jersey arrived in 1698, though Anglicanism was more popular in New York. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Why was the Duke not a friend of Anglicanism?","completion":"The Duke of York, later known as King James II of England, was not a friend of Anglicanism because he was an openly divine-right Catholic. He held strong Catholic beliefs and supported the idea of the divine right of kings, which is the belief that a monarch's power and authority come directly from God. This put him at odds with Anglicanism, a Protestant denomination that formed as a result of the English Reformation and the break from the Roman Catholic Church. The religious differences between Catholicism and Anglicanism made it challenging for the Duke to support or befriend Anglicanism as he adhered to and prioritized his Catholic faith."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The driver forgot his glasses, he was having trouble judging distance of oncoming cars and wouldn't pull out thinking they were all what? Choices: - close - closeness - proximity - near - measured in meters The rationale to choose \\"near\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The rationale to choose \\"near\\" as the answer lies in understanding the context of the situation and the process of elimination among the given choices. In this scenario, the driver has forgotten his glasses and is struggling to judge the distance of oncoming cars. Consequently, this leads to him hesitating and not pulling out, as he perceives the cars to be dangerously close to him. Analyzing each option will lead us to the most appropriate choice, which is \\"near.\\" Let's examine each choice individually: 1. Close: While it might seem to be a suitable option, \\"close\\" can be a bit ambiguous without context and may refer to a physical, emotional or temporal sense. It does not convey the exact sense of spatial distance in the scenario presented. 2. Closeness: This option also deals with proximity; however, it leans more towards the idea of emotional or intimate connections rather than physical distance. Since we are referring to the driver's perception of spatial distance, \\"closeness\\" is not the best fit. 3. Proximity: This choice refers to being near to something, but it works better when used to discuss general location or position, such as \\"living in close proximity to the city center.\\" In this context, proximity may sound too formal, and it lacks the simplicity and clarity needed to describe the distance between the driver and oncoming cars. 4. Near: This choice precisely conveys the idea of being physically close to something and is clearly associated with spatial distance. While it does not provide an exact measurement, it is the most fitting word given the driver's predicament. Consequently, \\"near\\" is the most appropriate choice to describe the driver's perception of the approaching vehicles. 5. Measured in meters: This choice is not suitable, as it refers to a unit of measurement rather than any form of distance or proximity. In this context, \\"measured in meters\\" would not convey the driver's perception of oncoming cars being close to him. In conclusion, the rationale for choosing \\"near\\" as the answer is largely attributed to its ability to communicate spatial distance clearly and effectively. Given the driver's difficulty in judging distance without his glasses, the word \\"near\\" best describes his inaccurate perception of oncoming cars being too close for safety. The other choices, while potentially applicable in different contexts, do not adequately address the driver's specific scenario or provide as much clarity as \\"near\\" does."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the war he lived in Scotland at Hutton in Berwickshire, before ending his days in Edinburgh Zoo. The event was organised by the Wojtek Memorial Trust. The trust's secretary Helena Scott said: \\"The Wojtek Memorial Trust wishes to thank all our supporters and donors for their generosity which has enabled us to progress and achieve a key objective of the charity, namely to erect a monument fitting to Polish veterans of the Second World War, and to the many men, women and children displaced as a consequence of the war and its aftermath, as told through the story of Wojtek, the Soldier Bear. \\"Trustees consist of individuals, each with their own personal interest of the story of Wojtek, and how that story may have touched their lives. \\"For those born of Polish parents, the unveiling is particularly poignant because we represent a generation that bridges between those post-war Poles who settled in Scotland and the younger generation, those that have made Scotland their home in more recent years. \\"Wojtek's story has enabled us to come together and to span a history of some 70 years of post-war Polish Scottish relations - to celebrate but also to commemorate.\\" Edinburgh city council approved the erection of the bronze statue of Wojtek on 16 September 2013. The statue represents Wojtek and a Polish Army Soldier \\"walking in peace and unity\\" and represents his journey from Egypt to Scotland alongside the Polish Army. The Lord Provost Donald Wilson said: \\"I am thrilled that the trust has succeeded in immortalising Wojtek the Soldier Bear in such a significant and appropriate way. \\"The story of Edinburgh's adopted bear is a cherished one and has become a firm family favourite, but this statue stands for more than that. \\"It makes a statement about fighting for freedom and showing support and comfort to those who are suffering. \\"It celebrates the ties that have been established in Edinburgh and Poland between our communities and strives to further strengthen this bond over time. \\"Being in the heart of the city, in the beautiful Princes Street Gardens and in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle, is exactly the sort of prime location this memorial deserves. I hope that it can be enjoyed by residents and visitors for generations to come.\\" Other guests included Fiona Hyslop MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs, representatives of the Polish government as well as sponsors and contractors. Wojtek - also known as Voytek - was rescued as a cub in the Middle East in 1943. The Polish soldiers adopted him and as he grew he was trained to carry heavy mortar rounds. When their forces were deployed to Europe the only way to take the bear with them was to \\"enlist\\" him. So he was given a name, rank and number and took part in the Italian campaign. At the end of the war the bear - who had also learned how to smoke and drink beer - was billeted at an army camp in the Scottish Borders. When the Polish soldiers were demobilised he was taken to Edinburgh Zoo where he eventually died in 1963. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"Wojtek, also known as the \\"Soldier Bear,\\" was a special bear who lived a long time ago during a big war. Polish soldiers found him all alone and decided to take care of him. Wojtek grew up with the soldiers and even helped them carry heavy things like ammunition during a battle called Monte Cassino. The war eventually ended, and Wojtek moved to Scotland with the soldiers and went to live in a zoo when his soldier friends didn't have to fight anymore. To remember how brave Wojtek was and the connection between Scottish and Polish people, a shiny bronze statue was made and placed in a beautiful park in Edinburgh, Scotland. This statue shows Wojtek with a Polish soldier walking together in peace, and it is a symbol of friendship between Scotland and Poland that many people can enjoy for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer: Who directed and co-starred in the 1958 film ‘Touch of Evil’?","completion":"The 1958 film 'Touch of Evil' is an American film noir directed by and co-starring the immensely talented Orson Welles. Although the movie is based on the novel 'Badge of Evil' by Whit Masterson, Welles, as director, made significant changes in the screenplay and plot in order to create his own vision. The movie also stars Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, and Marlene Dietrich, among others. 'Touch of Evil' is set in a small town on the U.S.-Mexico border and follows the story of Mexican narcotics officer Miguel Vargas (played by Charlton Heston) and his American bride Susie (played by Janet Leigh) as they become entangled in a murky web of crime and corruption. Orson Welles plays the role of Hank Quinlan, a morally ambiguous American police captain who uses unscrupulous means to solve crimes. The film examines themes of racism, corruption, and the abuse of power, which are still relevant today. The film is highly regarded for its technical achievements in cinematography and sound design. One of the most famous scenes in the movie is the unbroken three-minute opening shot, which brilliantly introduces the story, setting, and characters. This innovative opening is considered one of the finest examples of a tracking shot and has inspired many filmmakers since its release. 'Touch of Evil' also features striking black-and-white visuals, which help evoke the dark, sinister atmosphere the story demands. Despite its groundbreaking elements, 'Touch of Evil' initially received mixed reviews and box office returns. However, in later years, it has grown in prominence and is now considered a classic in the film noir genre. In 1998, the film was re-edited according to Orson Welles' original vision, after his notes and edits were discovered in the archives of his production company. In summary, 'Touch of Evil' (1958) is directed by and co-stars Orson Welles, who plays the character of Hank Quinlan. The film has become a classic in the film noir genre and is celebrated for its innovations in cinematography and storytelling, carrying a powerful impact even today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Sting Context: The film takes place in 1936, at the height of the Great Depression. Johnny Hooker, a grifter in Joliet, Illinois, cons 11,000 in cash (187,600 today) in a pigeon drop from an unsuspecting victim with the aid of his partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie. Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago to teach him \\"the big con\\". Unfortunately, their victim was a numbers racket courier for vicious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. Corrupt Joliet police Lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing Lonnegan's involvement and demanding part of Hookerâs cut. Having already spent his share, Hooker pays Snyder in counterfeit bills. Lonnegan's men murder both the courier and Luther, and Hooker flees for his life to Chicago. Hooker finds Henry Gondorff, a once-great con-man now hiding from the FBI, and asks for his help in taking on the dangerous Lonnegan. Gondorff is initially reluctant, but he relents and recruits a core team of experienced con men to con Lonnegan. They decide to resurrect an elaborate and supposedly obsolete scam known as \\"the wire\\", using a larger crew of con artists to create a phony off-track betting parlor. Aboard the opulent 20th Century Limited, Gondorff, posing as boorish Chicago bookie Shaw, buys into Lonnegan's private, high-stakes poker game.

Researchers have just offered evidence in a study that says obesity appears to spread through society. But the findings might also offer hope. If friends help make obesity acceptable, then they might also be influential in losing the fat. The researchers note that support groups are already an effective tool in dealing with other socially influenced problems, like alcoholism . The findings appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. The researchers used information collected from 12,000 people. It was collected between 1972 and 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study. The information was highly detailed. There was even contact information for close friends of the people in the study. The researchers examined more than 40,000 social ties. They found a person's chances of becoming severely overweight increased by 50% if a friend had become obese. A sister or brother of a person who became obese had a 40% increased chance of becoming obese. The risk for a wife or husband was a little less than that. Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School was a lead researcher in the study. He says there is a direct causal relationship between a person getting fat and being followed in weight gain by a friend. The study found that the sex of the friends was also an influence. In same-sex friendship, a person had a 71% increased risk of becoming obese. Men had a 44% increased risk of becoming obese after weight gain in a brother. In sisters, it was 67%. The researchers also considered the effect of where people lived in relation to each other. James Fowler of the University of California was the other lead expert. He says a friend who lives a few hundred kilometers away has as much influence as one in the same neighborhood.

Given the below context: Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived.

The founding members were New Zealander Neil Finn (vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter) and Australians Paul Hester (drums) and Nick Seymour (bass). Later band members included Neil Finn's brother, Tim Finn, and Americans Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod. Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits In 2006 Neil Finn asked Nick Seymour to play bass on his third solo album. Seymour agreed and the two joined up with producer and multi-instrumentalist Ethan Johns to begin recording. As the recording sessions progressed it was decided that the album would be issued under the Crowded House band name, rather than as a Neil Finn solo album. In January 2007, the group publicly announced their reformation and on 23 February, after 20 days of auditions, former Beck drummer Matt Sherrod joined Finn, Seymour and Mark Hart to complete the new line up. As Sherrod and Hart had not participated in the initial sessions, four new tracks were recorded with producer Steve Lillywhite including the album's first single \\"Don't Stop Now\\". On 17 March 2007 the band played a live show at their rehearsal studio in front of around fifty fans, friends and family. The performance was streamed live as a webcast. The two-and-a-half-hour set included some new tracks, including \\"Silent House\\" co-written by Finn with the Dixie Chicks. A concert onboard The Thekla, moored in Bristol, followed on 19 March. Crowded House played at the Marquee Theatre in Tempe, Arizona on 26 April as a warm-up for their appearance at the Coachella Festival on 29 April in Indio, California. They also played at the Australian Live Earth concert in Sydney on 7 July. The next day, Finn and Seymour were interviewed on Rove Live and the band, with Hart and Sherrod, performed \\"Don't Stop Now\\" to promote the new album, which was titled Time on Earth. The single was a minor hit in Australia and the UK. The album was released worldwide in June and July. It topped the album chart in New Zealand and made number 2 in Australia and number 3 in the UK. On 6 December 2008 Crowded House played the Homebake festival in Sydney, with warm up gigs at small venues in Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney. For these shows the band were augmented by multi-instrumentalist Don McGlashan and Neil's younger son, Elroy Finn, on guitar. On 14 March 2009 the band joined Neil's older son, Liam Finn, on stage for three songs at the Sound Relief concert in Melbourne.

I loved The Running Man. So obviously I was very excited that someone had made a film of it. And when a local network showed the film, I was in heaven. I was all ready for a night of fun! The first indicator that something was wrong was when I noticed that someone had cast Arnold Schwarzenegger. I could simply not believe that a man who got famous for films filled with runnin' an' shootin' could play a more cunning part, as was described in the book. I still was convinced that this would be a good film, however. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some hidden talents? Well, he didn't. I soon found out that the only reason he was even cast was because someone had re-written the entire story to MAKE it about fightin' an' shootin'. Yup, it was a standard Arnold-film: hero is done wrong, hero solves problems by flexing his mighty muscles and scaring everyone away and hero gets the girl. I was stunned. This is NOT what the book said at all. I know that books can't be put on screen literally, but this didn't even have ties to the book. Stephen King should have openly denounced any affiliation with the film and he should have forbidden using the title The Running Man for this shameless waste of film. I don't say it often, but this film was BAD. If I weren't at home watching, I'd have tossed rotten tomatoes at the screen. Once again: bad. (Note that I used 'someone' a lot.

Grieving but determined, this mother’s commitment to educating others has become a crucial aspect of her journey to cope with the unimaginable pain she has faced. As the anniversary of her daughter’s passing approaches, we reflect on her relentless efforts to provide valuable insight on the risks associated with drug use, the importance of an open conversation on this topic, and the powerful impact this advocacy can have on other families. The Tragic Event In a world where drug use is becoming alarmingly normalized, the story of a bright and loving 15-year-old girl losing her life to a recreational drug like ecstasy serves as a stark reminder of the cruel consequences some families have to face. The incident, which was at first thought to be just another adolescent adventure, quickly turned into a heart-wrenching tragedy. The young girl had unknowingly taken an overdose of ecstasy, leading to a series of unwarranted health complications that ultimately claimed her life. Her mother, devastated by the loss, has since dedicated herself to fighting against the normalization of drug use and ensuring that others are aware of the harsh reality of such a choice. The Journey of Raising Awareness Since the death of her daughter, the mother has used various platforms, from social media to public speaking events, to share her story and inform others of the dangers associated with drug use. She has openly discussed the challenges that she and her family have faced throughout this process, including the emotional trauma of losing a child at such a young age, as well as her daughter's struggle with drug addiction. In addition to personal anecdotes, the mother offers vital information about the risks of ecstasy use, including the chemical makeup of the drug, its effects on the brain and body, and the potentially fatal consequences of an overdose. By doing so, she aims to debunk common misconceptions, while highlighting the gravity of the issue. The Importance of Open Communication Central to the mother's advocacy is the promotion of open and honest communication between parents, educators, and young people about the dangers of drug use. She emphasizes that breaking the taboo surrounding the topic is crucial to preventing further tragedies. Encouraging an open dialogue can help families understand the severity of the issue and seek professional help when necessary. By working closely with schools and communities, the mother hopes to change the narrative around drug use, pushing for more effective education in this area. The Potential Impact The mother’s efforts have already begun to create a ripple effect in communities across the country. Her passion, dedication, and courage have inspired others to have difficult conversations with their own children, peers, and educators. Moreover, her outreach has been featured in a plethora of articles, television interviews, and campaigns, raising awareness on a much larger scale than she could have ever imagined. Conclusion As the mother of a bright 15-year-old who tragically lost her life to ecstasy continues her journey to create awareness, she brings hope and change to a society plagued by the normalization of drug use. Her work serves not only as a tribute to her own daughter, but as the guiding light for countless families who may walk down a similar path. By uniting in the fight against drug use and supporting one another in these challenging times, we can honor the memory of those who lost their lives to drugs and work together to prevent future tragedies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Honestly, who doesn't. These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage. Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? It can be tempting to use a word processor (e.g., Microsoft Word) or a similar program to create a rich-text document, but pseudocode needs as little formatting as possible to keep it simple. Dedicating a line or two to explaining the purpose of your code will help set up the rest of the document, and it will also save you the task of explaining the program's function to each person to whom you show the pseudocode. Each statement in your pseudocode should express just one action for the computer. In most cases, if the task list is properly drawn, then each task will correspond to one line of pseudocode. Consider writing out your task list, then translating that list into pseudocode, then gradually developing that pseudocode into actual, computer-readable code. Using white spaces between \\"blocks\\" of text will help keep different components of your pseudocode isolated, and indenting different pieces of each block will indicate that those pieces of pseudocode go under a less-indented section. For example, a section of pseudocode that discusses entering a number should all be in the same \\"block\\", while the next section (e.g., the section that discusses the output) should be in a different block. Depending on your pseudocode requirements or the environment in which you're publishing the pseudocode, you may need to capitalize commands that will remain in the actual code. For example, if you use \\"if\\" and \\"then\\" commands in your pseudocode, you might want to change them to read \\"IF\\" and \\"THEN\\" (e.g., \\"IF input number THEN output result\\"). Remember, you're writing about what the project will do, not summarizing the code itself. This is especially important if you're writing pseudocode to serve as a demonstration for a customer who doesn't know coding, or as a project for a beginner programmer. While the language you use to modify your pseudocode should be simple, you still need to keep each piece of your pseudocode in the order in which it needs to be executed. Everything that is happening in the process must be described completely. Pseudocode statements are close to simple English statements. Pseudocode does not typically use variables, but instead describes what the program should do with close-to-real-world objects such as account numbers, names, or transaction amounts. Even if there is no standard for pseudocode, it will be easier for other programmers to understand your steps if you use structures from existing (sequential) programming languages. Use terms like \\"if\\", \\"then\\", \\"while\\", \\"else\\", and \\"loop\\" the same way that you would in your preferred programming language. Consider the following structures: if CONDITION then INSTRUCTION — This means that a given instruction will only be conducted if a given condition is true. \\"Instruction\\", in this case, means a step that the program will perform, while \\"condition\\" means that the data must meet a certain set of criteria before the program takes action. while CONDITION do INSTRUCTION — This means that the instruction should be repeated again and again until the condition is no longer true. do INSTRUCTION while CONDITION — This is very similar to \\"while CONDITION do INSTRUCTION\\". In the first case, the condition is checked before the instruction is conducted, but in the second case the instruction will be conducted first; thus, in the second case, INSTRUCTION will be conducted at least one time. function NAME (ARGUMENTS): INSTRUCTION — This means that every time a certain name is used in the code, it is an abbreviation for a certain instruction. \\"Arguments\\" are lists of variables that you can use to clarify the instruction. If you have large sections of pseudocode that define other pieces of pseudocode within the same block, you may want to use brackets or other identifiers to keep everything contained. Brackets—both standard (e.g., [code]) and curved (e.g., {code})—can help contain long segments of pseudocode. When coding, you can add comments by typing \\"//\\" on the left side of the comment (e.g., //This is a temporary step.). You can use this same method when writing pseudocode to leave notes that don't fit into the coding text. You should be able to answer the following questions by the end of the document: Would this pseudocode be understood by someone who isn't familiar with the process? Is the pseudocode written in such a way that it will be easy to translated it into a computing language? Does the pseudocode describe the complete process without leaving anything out? Is every object name used in the pseudocode clearly understood by the target audience? If you find that a section of pseudocode needs elaboration or it doesn't explicitly outline a step that someone else might forget, go back and add the necessary information.
