Tashman was best known for her supporting roles as tongue-in-cheek villainesses and the vindictive \\"other woman.\\" She made 66 films over the course of her Hollywood career and although she never obtained superstar status, her cinematic performances are described as \\"sharp, clever and have aged little over the decades.\\" Tall, blonde, and slender with fox-like features and a throaty voice, Tashman freelanced as a fashion and artist's model in New York City. In 1932, Tashman entered the hospital in New York City for an appendectomy that is now considered a concealment for abdominal cancer. She left the hospital thin and weak. Although she made five films in her last years, performing with her usual artistry and professionalism, she weakened significantly in the months following her hospitalization and her role in Riptide was trimmed because of her ever-worsening health. In February 1934, she flew to New York City to film Frankie and Johnny for All Star Productions (released by Republic Pictures) but her condition necessitated a week of rest in Connecticut with Lowe. She resumed work in March, completing her film role on March 8 and then appearing at the Israel Orphan's Home benefit on March 10. When she entered the hospital for surgery on March 16, it was too late for the doctors to help her. Tashman died of cancer at Doctor's Hospital in New York City on March 21, 1934 at the age of 37. Her funeral was held on March 22 in New York City synagogue Temple Emanu-El with Sophie Tucker, Mary Pickford, Fanny Brice, Cecil Beaton, Jack Benny, and other distinguished celebrities in attendance. Eddie Cantor delivered the eulogy. The burial in Brooklyn's Washington Cemetery attracted 10,000 fans, mourners, and curious onlookers; it became a near riot when people were injured and a gravestone was toppled. Tashman left no will, but the distribution of her 31,000 in cash and 121,000 in furs and jewels provoked contentious discussion among her husband and sisters, Hattie and Jennie. Her last film, Frankie and Johnny, was released posthumously in May 1936 with her role as Nellie Bly cut to a cameo. How did she handle this?","completion":"Lilyan Tashman handled her deteriorating health and the challenges it presented with grace and professionalism. Despite weakening significantly after her appendectomy, which was believed to be a cover for her abdominal cancer treatment, she continued to work diligently in the film industry. Tashman made five films during her final years, maintaining her reputation for artistry and professionalism. She continued to work on her last film, Frankie and Johnny, even amidst ongoing health struggles. In February 1934, she took a week of rest in Connecticut with her husband Edmund Lowe, before resuming work in March. Throughout this period, Tashman remained dedicated to both her career and charitable events, appearing at the Israel Orphans' Home benefit on March 10, just days before she entered the hospital for surgery. Her dedication to her profession and her spirit of philanthropy were testaments to her strength and determination in the face of adversity. Even though she was unable to fully recover, Tashman continued to put her best foot forward both on and off the screen, handling her illness with professionalism and grace. Her commitment to her work and her ability to face her health challenges head-on left a lasting impact on both her fans and fellow Hollywood stars. Her funeral, which attracted a large number of celebrities and fans, showed the immense respect and admiration people had for her. Eddie Cantor's eulogy encapsulated the way Tashman lived her life and her legacy in the entertainment industry. The fact that her last film, Frankie and Johnny, was released posthumously in May 1936, with her role as Nellie Bly reduced to a cameo, further demonstrated how she remained an important figure in Hollywood even in her final days."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. Henry is currently writing a research paper for his biology class. The subject of the paper is abiotic stress. For his paper, he is analyzing two different forests of differing stress levels and writing about the differences seen in the environments. For the area with a low level of stress Henry chose the Narshe Forest, located near the mountains of Harkal. The area of high stress that Henry will be looking at is the Midgar forest.

Read this and answer the question The hole walls for boards with two or more layers can be made conductive and then electroplated with copper to form plated-through holes. These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multi-layer boards, those with three layers or more, drilling typically produces a smear of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical de-smear process, or by plasma-etch. The de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through. On high reliability boards a process called etch-back is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma. The etch-back removes resin and the glass fibers so that the copper layers extend into the hole and as the hole is plated become integral with the deposited copper.

Title: A Heavenly Culinary Experience Last weekend, I had the pleasure of dining at 'The Enchanted Bistro,' and I am still awestruck by the unforgettable experience. Not only was the food absolutely divine, but the overall ambiance, service, and attention to detail made the experience one I would highly recommend to friends and family. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by an elegant and welcoming atmosphere. The decor was stylish and contemporary, with exquisite lighting and warm hues that made us feel right at home. The staff, from the hostess to the servers, were professional, courteous, and attentive, ensuring that we were well-taken care of throughout the evening. The menu at 'The Enchanted Bistro' showcased an array of creative and delicious dishes, which made it difficult to decide what to order. However, our server Jessica was well-versed in the menu and provided insightful recommendations, making our decision more manageable. To start, we indulged in the smoked salmon bruschetta, which was a delightful symphony of flavors. The crunchiness of the crostini perfectly complemented the delicate taste of the smoked salmon, while the zesty lemon caper aioli elevated the entire dish. For our entrees, we were torn between the fresh pasta with oxtail ragu and the almond-crusted sea bass. We opted for both, and we were certainly not disappointed. The pasta was tender and full of hearty, robust flavors that left us craving for more. The sea bass, on the other hand, was cooked to perfection with a beautifully crispy almond crust that added depth to the mild, flaky fish. The accompanying vegetable medley, with hints of garlic and herbs, accentuated both dishes, making them absolute standouts. The pièce de résistance came in the form of dessert – a sumptuous chocolate lava cake with raspberry coulis and vanilla ice cream. The rich, decadent chocolate melted in our mouths while the tangy raspberry coulis provided a refreshing touch, balancing the indulgence. The velvety vanilla ice cream was the final note of perfection, concluding our meal on a high. Overall, the inviting ambiance, the exceptional service, and the heavenly culinary creations make 'The Enchanted Bistro' a must-visit destination for any gastronome looking to enjoy a positively memorable dining experience. I eagerly anticipate my next visit, ready to explore more of what this wonderful and enchanting establishment has to offer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? This is the most crucial point of your vault. For your first few runs, you should hold the pole above your head with your arms outstretched and be ready to place it directly in the center of the box, on the back edge. As you become more comfortable, you can rest the pole over your shoulder or hold it next to your waist, raising it above your head to plant it as you approach the box. This is the beginning of your jumping motion as you are pushing off of the ground and using the pole as leverage while you pull on it. Your leg on the non-dominant side of your body will still be on the ground as you push up, with your toe pointed. This will give you lift and the pole will begin to bend. Your lower arm should continue pushing on the pole to keep your body moving up and forward. The leg that was pointed will help your body move into an upside-down position. Keep pushing with your lower hand to get yourself as close to upside-down as possible. Bring your dominant hand, which should still be toward the top of the pole, down to your hip in a pulling motion on the pole. Use your core muscles to keep your body moving and keep you close to the pole. Initiate the turn by turning your dominant foot to the inside. As you pull your body should naturally turn around the pole so that your belly is now facing the pit. At this point, you will be completely upside down. Try to keep your legs straight above your head while you push off of the pole. Let go of the pole as you feel yourself falling away from your maximum height. Letting your legs fall down too quickly can take height off of your jump. Be careful not to let go too quickly, as you can fall headfirst into the box. It’s better to hold on for too long while you are learning, rather than risk an injury.

People from all over the world came to visit this magical place, full of bright lights, tall buildings, and lots of fun things to do. There were people pouring shots and taking pictures of others. \\"Pouring shots\\" means someone was serving little drinks, and \\"shooting portraits\\" means they were taking pictures of people. In the old Times Square, people would gather to have fun and celebrate. There were many parties where people shared cheers with tiny drinks called \\"shots.\\" These shots were like little happy potions that made people feel merry and excited. Adults liked to drink shots at parties, but don't worry; these were only for grown-ups! Besides pouring shots, there were lots of talented artists who loved taking pictures of people. They were called photographers. They would set up their special photo-taking machines, called cameras, to capture the smiling faces and excitement of the people who were visiting Times Square. A picture is like a frozen moment in time when we can look back and remember the fun we had. Taking photos in the old Times Square was different than it is today. Back then, photographers used big machines that had big black boxes, and long silver things to make the pictures look nice and bright. In those days, the photographs would come out in black and white, like a drawing made with pencils. Those photographers were very good at \\"shooting portraits,\\" helping people to look their best, and making them feel like movie stars.

His way took him by well-remembered field-paths which, although towards the end of his walk darkness had set in, he had no difficulty in tracing. The last field he crossed brought him to a by-road joining the highway which ran through Wynford, the junction being about a quarter of a mile from the church. As he neared the stile which admitted to the road he saw, on the other side of the hedge and showing just above it, the head of a man. At the sound of his footsteps the man quickly turned, and, as for a moment the fitful moonlight caught his face, Gifford was sure he recognized Gervase Henshaw. But he took no notice and kept on his way to the stile, which he crossed and gained the road. As he did so he glanced back. A horse and trap was waiting there with Henshaw in it.

Vegetables and flowers usually require at least six hours of full, continuous sunlight a day to thrive. However, some plants prefer shade or little sun.","completion":"After identifying the appropriate location for your garden plot based on sunlight needs, the next steps to follow for preparing the garden plot are: 1. Assess the Soil: Before you start working the soil, get a soil test performed to determine the pH level and nutrient content of your soil. Results from the soil test will provide insights on the amendments required for optimal plant growth. Typically, a pH ranging from 6.0-7.0 is ideal for most plants. You can also check the soil's texture and drainage capacity which may impact plant growth. 2. Clear and Mark the Space: Clear the designated garden plot area of any debris, leaves, rocks, and weeds that might prevent plant growth. Once cleared, mark the boundaries of your plot with string or stakes, ensuring you leave enough space between garden beds for maneuvering and maintenance. Measuring and staking out the space helps to visualize the garden layout before planting and account for the space needed for plant growth. 3. Till or Loosen the Soil: Tilling or digging the soil to a depth of 10-12 inches helps to break up compacted earth, improve aeration, and promote optimal root development. This process can be done using a shovel, garden fork, or a mechanical tiller; however, be mindful not to over-till the soil as that can disrupt its structure and lead to further compaction. 4. Amend the Soil: Based on the findings from your soil test, incorporate necessary amendments such as organic matter, compost, peat moss, or aged manure into the soil to enhance fertility, improve structure, and create an optimal growing environment. Ensure the amendments are thoroughly mixed with the existing soil to guarantee uniform distribution. 5. Create Garden Beds: Arrange the garden beds according to the planned layout, considering factors such as crop rotation, companion planting, and plant growth habits. Garden beds can be linear, square, or circular depending on the available space and aesthetic preferences. Raised beds can offer better drainage for waterlogged areas and help to alleviate back strain during planting and weeding. 6. Apply Mulch: Mulching the garden beds with materials such as leaves, straw, or wood chips helps to retain moisture, suppress weed growth, regulate soil temperature, and add organic matter as it decomposes over time. Spread mulch around the base of your plants, maintaining a 2-3 inch layer while avoiding direct contact with plant stems to prevent rot. 7. Water and Fertilize: Like sunlight, providing an adequate supply of water is essential for the well-being of your garden plot. Install a drip irrigation system or routinely water the garden based on specific plant requirements, ensuring that the soil remains moist but not waterlogged. As the plants start to grow, apply appropriate fertilizers and nutrients to support their development and address any nutrient deficiencies. 8. Monitor and Maintain: Regular maintenance, such as weeding, pruning, and pest control, will help to keep your garden plot healthy and flourishing. Keep an eye on the garden's progress and make adjustments as needed to manage environmental changes and seasonal variations. Finalizing the garden plot's preparation sets the groundwork for a successful growing season. Once these steps are complete, you can start planting the desired flowers, vegetables, or fruits, following the proper planting guidelines and seasonal timelines for each plant variety."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Her parents, Jerry and Phyllis, fly to Italy to meet her fiancé and his parents. Jerry happens to hear Giancarlos (Michelangelo's father) beautiful operatic voice while the latter sings in the shower. As a former admittedly avant-garde and critically reviled opera director, Jerry feels inspired to bring Giancarlos gift to the public. Although Giancarlo protests that he sings for himself and doesnt want to go professional, Jerry pushes the issue until Giancarlo agrees to audition in front of a room of opera bigwigs. Outside the safety of his shower, Giancarlos confidence abandons him. He makes faces and he is humiliated. Michelangelo, who attended the audition too, accuses Jerry of using his father to achieve some level of fame for himself. It occurs to Jerry that Giancarlo, like most people, sings the most confidently when he has some measure of privacy. In Giancarlos case, he performs best in his shower. Giancarlo, naked but for a towel, premieres at the Teatro dellOpera di Roma. Jerry has built him a shower onstage, and Giancarlo sings as he washes. The opera attendees love his strange performance, so Jerry and Giancarlo decide to stage Pagliacci, shower and all. Again, Giancarlos rich voice mesmerizes the crowd, and he receives rave reviews though Jerry's direction is once again utterly reviled, a fact he is not aware of since he doesn't understand Italian. Giancarlo decides to retire from opera singing, because he prefers working as a mortician and spending time with his family though he appreciates being given the chance to live his dream of performing Pagliacci.Newlyweds Antonio and Milly move from their rustic hometown to Rome because Antonios posh uncles have offered him a job in their familys business.

Soren and Gylfie avoid being 'moon-blinked' (a catatonic state induced by sleeping under a full moon), while the others do not know and become moon-blinked. They are forced to 'pick' through owl's pellets, scouring for bits of metal 'flecks', which are being used to build a superweapon. They are spotted by Grimble, a boreal owl, who reveals that he works under the Pure Ones only to keep his family safe and that he isn't really a Pure One at all. He teaches them to fly, but Nyra finds out whilst coming to invite Soren to become a soldier. Kludd decides to stay behind and become a Pure One, despite Soren's pleas for him to come with him.

Plot title: The Mummy's Ghost Movie plot: In Egypt, Yousef Bey (John Carradine) journeys to a remote temple in answer to a summons from Andoheb, High Priest of Arkham (George Zucco). Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The politician lost the election. What is the cause of the preceding sentence?","completion":"There can be numerous factors that could have contributed to the politician's loss in the election mentioned in the preceding sentence. While it's difficult to pinpoint an exact cause without more context, some common reasons for a political candidate's defeat in an election may include the following: 1. Weak Campaign Strategy: A successful election campaign requires a strong message, effective communication, and efficient use of resources. If the politician's campaign strategy lacked clear goals, failed to target the right voters, or mismanaged its financial resources, it could have led to the politician losing the election. 2. Lack of Voter Appeal: The politician may not have been able to resonate with a majority of the voters. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as an inability to relate to the average voter, a lack of charisma, or not effectively addressing the main concerns of the electorate. 3. Unpopular Policies: The politician may have advocated for policies that were not well-received by the voting public, negatively impacting their chances of securing enough votes to win. In some cases, voters may feel that a particular policy would not be beneficial to them or their community, leading them to cast their ballots for an opposing candidate. 4. Poor Media Coverage and Social Media Presence: In today's increasingly connected world, digital media plays a significant role in shaping public opinion. The politician may not have been able to manage their media interactions effectively or failed to maintain a strong social media presence, resulting in a negative image or low visibility among the electorate. 5. Scandals and Controversies: The politician may have been involved in scandals or controversies that damaged their reputation, leading voters to question their integrity and fitness for office. In the age of information, negative news stories can spread quickly, significantly impacting a candidate's public image. 6. Strong Opposition: The politician's rivals may have run particularly effective campaigns, attracting voters who may have otherwise supported the losing candidate. The strength of an opponent's campaign, financial backing, and overall popularity could contribute to a candidate's defeat in an election. 7. Voter Turnout: A low voter turnout may have negatively affected the candidate, especially if their supporters were less motivated to vote compared to the opposing candidate's supporters. Voter apathy and the failure to mobilize one's voter base can ultimately lead to a loss in an election. 8. Demographic Shifts: Changes in the region's demographics may have worked against the politician's favor. An increase in new residents with different political views, shifts in the age distribution, or changes in income levels can create a new, unfavorable electoral landscape for a candidate. 9. Missteps and Gaffes: Sometimes, a politician may make mistakes during their campaign, whether in the form of speeches, interviews, or public appearances. These missteps can be perceived as a sign of incompetence, ultimately causing potential voters to lose faith in the candidate. 10. Economic Factors: A tough economic climate can make it difficult for incumbent candidates, especially when they belong to the ruling party. Voters may be more likely to support an opposition candidate in the hopes of bringing change and improving the economic situation. While any of these factors on their own may not be enough to cause a politician to lose an election, when combined, they can create considerable obstacles for a candidate to overcome. It is essential for political candidates to be aware of these potential pitfalls and develop strategies accordingly, to maximize their chances of electoral success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(2) Surfers often travel to San Lorenzo to find powerful waves ( high regularly ) . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"No, these two sentences do not mean the same thing as they are not conveying the same message due to differences in word placement and how the information is being structured. Let's look at these sentences in detail: (1) Surfers often travel to San Lorenzo to find powerful waves (regularly head high). In this sentence, the main idea being conveyed is that surfers frequently go to San Lorenzo in search of powerful waves that are consistently of substantial height, described as \\"head high.\\" The word \\"regularly\\" is used to modify the term \\"head high,\\" suggesting that the waves have this height quite frequently. This sentence provides a clear understanding that San Lorenzo is a location known for its consistently powerful and tall waves. (2) Surfers often travel to San Lorenzo to find powerful waves (high regularly). In this sentence, there is a rearrangement of words that leads to a change in meaning and reduced clarity. Here, the word \\"high\\" is used in isolation, and then followed by the adverb \\"regularly.\\" This creates ambiguity, as it may be interpreted in different ways: a) Surfers go to San Lorenzo to find powerful waves that are regularly high. b) Surfers often find high waves in San Lorenzo and go there regularly. The phrasing in sentence (2) makes it unclear whether \\"regularly\\" is meant to modify the traveling of surfers or the height of the waves. The structure of the sentence makes it challenging to determine the intended message with certainty. So, while both sentences refer to surfers traveling to San Lorenzo and the presence of powerful waves, they do not convey the same meaning due to differences in how information is organized and the impact of word choice. Sentence (1) provides a clear, easily understandable description of the wave heights and how they attract surfers, whereas sentence (2) creates ambiguity about the specific relationship between wave height and the frequency of surfers' traveling."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: Although the Palaeologi emperors recaptured Constantinople from the Western Europeans in 1261, they were never able to regain control of much of the former imperial lands. They usually controlled only a small section of the Balkan Peninsula near Constantinople, the city itself, and some coastal lands on the Black Sea and around the Aegean Sea. The former Byzantine lands in the Balkans were divided between the new Kingdom of Serbia, the Second Bulgarian Empire and the city-state of Venice. The power of the Byzantine emperors was threatened by a new Turkish tribe, the Ottomans, who established themselves in Anatolia in the 13th century and steadily expanded throughout the 14th century. The Ottomans expanded into Europe, reducing Bulgaria to a vassal state by 1366 and taking over Serbia after its defeat at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Western Europeans rallied to the plight of the Christians in the Balkans and declared a new crusade in 1396; a great army was sent to the Balkans, where it was defeated at the Battle of Nicopolis.

Please answer the following question: WHITE HOUSE — \\"The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,\\" President Donald Trump vowed Monday amid growing outrage over his administration forcibly separating children from parents at the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that \\"what's happening in Europe … we can't allow that to happen to the United States — not on my watch.\\" Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate. In actuality, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years. Tough border enforcement in the U.S. has led to the family breakups, with nearly 2,000 children being sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials. The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders finally introduced Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen after 5 p.m., and she defended the administration's \\"zero-tolerance\\" policy that is breaking up families at the southwestern U.S. border. Nielsen forcefully pushed back at the negative media coverage, asserting that what U.S. authorities are doing is properly enforcing the law. \\"What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law,\\" she said. Asked about critics accusing the administration of using children as \\"pawns\\" to demand legislative actions from Congress, the DHS secretary replied, \\"I say that is a very cowardly response,\\" adding it is clearly within Congress' power \\"to make the laws and change the laws. They should do so.\\" Trump's Republican party controls both chambers in Congress, and the family border policies were set by his administration.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc. Now, I have a new situation: Two scientist, Pete and Gill, studied the Earth's crust and geology. Pete studied earthquakes, while Gill studied mantles and volcanos.

Poland is a surprising educational success story: in the past decade, the country raised students' test scores from significantly below average to well above it. Polish kids have now outscored(......) American kids in math and science, even though Poland spends, on average, less than half as much per student as the United States does. One of the most striking differences between the high school Tom attended in Gettysburg and the one he ends up at in Warsaw is that the latter has no football team, or, for that matter, teams of any kind. That American high schools lavish more time and money on sports than on math is an old complaint. This is not a matter of how any given student who plays sports does in school, but of the culture and its priorities. This December, when the latest Program for International Student Assessment(PISA) results are announced, it's safe to predict that American high-school students will once again display their limited skills in math and reading, outscored not just by students in Poland but also by students in places like South Korea, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Singapore, and Japan. Meanwhile, they will have played some very exciting football games, which will have been breathlessly written up in their hometown papers. Why does this situation continue? Well, for one thing, kids like it. And for another, according to Ripley, parents seem to like the arrangement, too. She describes a tour she took of a school in Washington D.C., which costs thirty thousand dollars a year. The tour leader--a mother with three children in the school--was asked about the school's flaws . When she said that the math program was weak, none of the parents taking the tour reacted.

Given the question: Given the background: For example, a radioactive isotope of iodine (I-131) is used in both the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer. The thyroid will normally absorb some iodine to produce iodine-containing thyroid hormones. An overactive thyroid gland will absorb a larger amount of the radioactive material. If this is the case, more and more radioactive iodine can be administered, where it will cluster in the diseased portion of the thyroid tissue and kill some of the nearby cells. Cancer treatments often cause patients to feel very sick, because while the radiation treatment kills the unwanted cancer cells, it causes damage to some healthy cells in the process. and the situation: John is a doctor in a local hospital. Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A has thyroid cancer, but patient B does not have thyroid cancer. John is trying to see the difference between these two patients' reports. Answer the following question: Which patient would have an overactive thyroid gland, patient A or patient B? The answer is:","completion":"Patient A. The person with thyroid cancer, Patient A, would likely have an overactive thyroid gland.

His keen intellect and razor-sharp wit had led him to believe that he could meticulously plan and control every aspect of his life. He was accustomed to getting his way, and his confidence blinded him to the unexpected turns that life often takes. Meanwhile, she too had dreams, goals, and ambitions, but her approach greatly differed from his. She had learned in her experiences that life was full of curveballs, bumps, and surprises. So she had adopted a more adaptable, fluid, and open-minded attitude in order to manage her way through those tricky situations. As they both embarked on their respective paths, the events that unfolded seemed to conspire against him. Despite his determination and careful planning, he was met with obstacles and roadblocks at every turn. His unwavering belief in his own knowledge and his ability to control the outcome of situations left him ill-prepared for the many twists and turns thrown his way. His once steady hand began to falter, and he found it increasingly challenging to continue holding onto his tightly constructed plans. On the other hand, she seemed to be continuously blessed with fortuitous opportunities and serendipitous encounters. With her ability to adapt, bend, and flex to the ever-changing world around her, she continued to overcome the obstacles that presented themselves.

As he stood holding onto the fragments of his shattered dreams, he was struck by the realization that he could no longer deny the inherent value of adaptability and flexibility in a world that was inherently unpredictable. But there was also a sense of loss, a tremendous sense of failure looming over him. It was as if the universe had conspired against him, leading him down a path of self-discovery and humility that he never thought possible. However, amidst the ruins of his plans, he also discovered a newfound truth: that resilience and adaptability weren't a sign of weakness, but rather a testament to strength. He learned to embrace the uncertainty, the unexpected, and the challenges that life offered him. Gradually, he too began to evolve, shifting his mindset to understand that sometimes the best-laid plans can falter in the face of the unpredictable and that success isn't measured solely by adherence to a predetermined course. While they took unique paths throughout life, both he and she gained valuable insights and grew stronger by embracing the challenges presented to them. Their contrasting approaches offered them the opportunity to learn from one another, and as the years went by, their once-divergent paths began to converge in shared understanding and wisdom. They learned that in the end, achieving goals isn't about meticulous planning and control; it's about navigating through life with resilience, adaptability, and the willingness to learn and grow with every step taken."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Unfolding Changes in Egypt's Interim Government; New Health, Transportation Ministers Appointed In a recent development, Egypt's interim government has witnessed a shuffle in critical positions amidst the ongoing political turmoil. As the government faces mounting pressure from protesters demanding faster-paced reforms, there has been a change in guard pertaining to major ministerial positions, among which include the health, transportation, finance, and industry sectors. The government has announced the appointment of new health and transportation ministers, reflecting an attempt to steer clear of the ongoing controversies and present an image of stability and control. The individuals replacing the incumbents have yet to be publicly named. This step is perceived as a strategic move aimed at pacifying the dissatisfied populace and invigorating a more rapid pace of reform, a demand repeatedly voiced by the demonstrators. In further news concerning the shake-up, the finance and industry ministers have stepped down from their roles. Their resignation adds to the complexities of this transitional period in Egypt. Amidst such changes, a noteworthy appointment comes to the forefront, confirming Hazem El-Beblawi as the newly assigned Finance Minister. The choice of El-Beblawi, marking him as part of the reconfigured political landscape, surely represents a significant change in the narrative of the interim government. It is expected that El-Beblawi, with his extensive experience and knowledge, will effectively handle the ongoing economic crises and undertake essential reforms. These recent alterations are seen as the government's response to appease the rising discontent among protesters. Given that public pressure has played an instrumental role in these cabinet changes, the interim government’s next course of action in expediting reforms will be observed closely. The presence of new faces in significant ministries is perceived as a promising sign of the desired change. It remains to be seen how the new ministers navigate their respective departments amidst the pressure and the high expectations for accelerated reforms. For the collective betterment of the country, it is hoped that their leadership would translate into positive and impactful changes. The unfolding events instigate a renewed sense of anticipation for progress and provide a glimmer of hope that the pace of reform will indeed be quickened. The world watches keenly as Egypt's interim government repositions itself to tackle the challenges head-on and work towards the stability demanded by its people. Justification: Given that the initial information was just highlights, I first draft a title that best encapsulates the news article's content. I then start the article addressing the context, in this case, the current political situation in Egypt's interim government. I mention the appointment of new health and transportation ministers, and resignations of the finance and industry ministers. I also include the appointment of Hazem El-Beblawi as the new Finance Minister, providing his context in the unfolding situation. Lastly, I end the article by discussing the expectations from the new appointments and what they might mean for Egyptian reforms, ensuring to keep the tone neutral and professional, typical for news articles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The photographer quickly snapped the child's photo.. b). The photographer quickly changed the child's pose.. The answer is:","completion":"a). The photographer quickly snapped the child's photo. The sentence \\"The photographer got the child to smile\\" implies that the photographer has successfully managed to make the child feel comfortable, happy, or amused, resulting in a smile on the child's face. This accomplishment of getting a genuine smile from the child is a crucial moment for the photographer, as it generally means that they have captured the desired emotion and expression for the photograph. Therefore, it is logical to assume that, upon seeing the child's smile, the photographer would quickly snap the child's photo to capture that perfect moment. While changing the child's pose may still be relevant to the overall process of photography, the sentence specified the act of making the child smile. The focus is on the achievement of capturing the perfect smile, which directly corresponds to the action in option a). Photographers often aim to capture authentic emotions and moments, and a genuine smile can make a photograph feel more natural and lively, making for a more attractive final result. In this context, it's reasonable to say that the photographer quickly snapped the child's photo, as it showcases the desired emotion of happiness and positively impacts the overall success of the photo. The connection between the sentence and option a) emphasizes the photographer's skill in creating comfortable and enjoyable environments for their subjects, which makes it easier to capture beautiful, authentic expressions and memories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Negative Movie Review: Title: \\"Disappointment: A Cinematic Catastrophe\\" From the moment the opening credits rolled across the big screen, it was apparent that \\"Disappointment: A Cinematic Catastrophe\\" was doomed to fall into the abyss of forgettable, lackluster films. With a meandering plot, unlikable characters, and uninspired visuals, this movie tragically failed to deliver on its immense potential. The film's convoluted plot left audiences scratching their heads. Instead of cultivating tension and intrigue, the storyline was riddled with illogical twists and turns that constantly shattered the suspension of disbelief. The lack of continuity, in addition to an overabundance of flashbacks, ultimately created a disorienting experience that detracted from any potential emotional investment. While an intricate plot can be forgiven if audiences find themselves deeply connected to the characters, \\"Disappointment: A Cinematic Catastrophe\\" severely failed on that front as well. The characters were frustratingly one-dimensional, leaving audiences apathetic to their plights. Any semblance of character development seemed to be quickly undermined, which kept viewers from forming any genuine attachment. Additionally, the lack of chemistry between the leads made their love story feel hollow and contrived. One would hope that the visuals could at least redeem the movie, but alas, even this was disappointing. The cinematography was uninspired, with a mundane color palette and bland backdrops. The visual effects were, at times, laughably amateurish, detracting from any sense of immersion. Moreover, the action sequences were poorly executed and edited, often leaving the audience feeling disoriented. To compound these issues, the film’s pacing was abysmal. What could have been an engaging, suspenseful movie was weighed down by an onslaught of tedious exposition and inconsequential scenes. In the end, it felt like a test of endurance, prompting audiences to check their watches, wondering when the agonizing experience would finally come to an end. What's truly maddening about \\"Disappointment: A Cinematic Catastrophe\\" might be the sheer waste of talent. Its cast, featuring several acclaimed actors known for previous standout performances, was tragically undermined by a weak script, poor direction, and uninspired character arcs. In conclusion, \\"Disappointment: A Cinematic Catastrophe\\" leaves viewers longing for something more. With a problematic plot, stale performances, lackluster visuals, and abysmal pacing, this film is better left unseen. Whatever potential the original concept may have had is woefully squandered in a movie that will be remembered only for its failure to excel in any aspect of filmmaking. It is a prime lesson in what can go wrong when great potential is met with poor execution."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Among the more colorful characters of Leadville's golden age were H. A. W. Tabor and his wife, Elizabeth McCourt, better known as \\"Baby Doe\\". Their history is fast becoming one of the legends of the Old West. Horace Austin Warner Tabor was a school teacher in Vermont. Then he moved west to the small Colorado mining camp known as California Gulch, which he later renamed Leadville when he became its leading citizen. \\"Great deposits of lead are sure to be found here.\\" he said. As it turned out, it was silver, not lead, that was to make Leadville's fortune and wealth. Tabor knew little about mining himself, so he opened a general store, which sold everything from boots to salt, flour, and tobacco. It was his custom to \\" _ \\" prospective miners, in other words, to supply them with food and supplies, or \\"grub\\", while they looked for ore , in return for which he would get a share in the mine if one was discovered. He did this for a number of years, but no one that he aided ever found anything of value. Finally one day in the year 1878, so the story goes, two miners came in and asked for \\"grub\\". Tabor had decided to quit supplying it because he had lost too much money that way. These were persistent, however, and Tabor was too busy to argue with them. \\"Oh help yourself. One more time won't make any difference,\\" He said and went on selling shoes and hats to other customers. The two miners took 17 worth of supplies, in return for which they gave Tabor a one-third interest in their findings. They picked a barren place on the mountain side and began to dig. After nine days they struck a rich vein of silver. Tabor bought the shares of the other two men, and so the mine belonged to him alone. This mine, known as the \\"Pittsburgh Mine,\\" made 1,300,000 for Tabor in return for his 17 investment. Later Tabor bought the Matchless Mine on another barren hillside just outside the town for 117,000. This turned out to be even more fabulous than the Pittsburgh, yielding 35,000 worth of silver per day at one time. Leadville grew.... Question: We can infer that Tabor's life career is.

Please write a short summary for the following article: A Corporate Divorce on the Cheap Nor are Chrysler’s long-term prospects clear. Cerberus dispatched its chairman, John W. Snow, the former secretary of the Treasury, to Stuttgart to drum up excitement about Chrysler’s future and to reassure managers and workers that the investment firm is not going to turn Chrysler inside out. Among Daimler executives here, however, there was a sense that they got the good end of the bargain. The company’s businesses — trucks, buses and luxury cars — are among the fastest-growing and most profitable segments in the industry. And Mercedes-Benz, after a period in which it suffered from quality concerns and eroding profits, is on an upswing. “There are more people with higher incomes,” said Garel Rhys, director of the Center for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff University in Wales, “and they are living longer, so they have time to buy these cars.” Though it will become much smaller, Daimler will have a stronger balance sheet, a hoard of cash and a clear focus. “The new Daimler will stand on a very solid foundation,” the chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, said. None of this dispelled a palpable sense of regret on the part of Mr. Zetsche, who made his reputation running Chrysler and even lent his image to television commercials for its vehicles. The company will retain a 19.9 percent stake in Chrysler. “We obviously overestimated the potential of synergies,” Mr. Zetsche said of the 1998 merger. “I don’t know if any amount of due diligence could have given us a better estimate in that regard.” Daimler, he said, was not able to exploit the combination of its highly engineered Mercedes-Benz luxury cars with the mass-market vehicles of Chrysler because American motorists could not, or would not, pay a premium for a Chrysler equipped with Mercedes technology. What Daimler encountered instead were the unforgiving vagaries of the American car market. Chrysler lost 1.5 billion last year, and the losses are expected to continue this year. Finally, Mr. Zetsche said, DaimlerChrysler could no longer bear the pressure on its profits or share price. DaimlerChrysler stock closed up nearly 2 percent in Frankfurt trading on Monday, after jumping as much as 7.8 percent when news of the agreement with Cerberus was reported. It has risen 25 percent since Mr. Zetsche disclosed in February that the company was considering alternatives, including a divestiture. Mr. Zetsche insisted that Chrysler did not drain cash from Mercedes. Despite its recent losses, it generated nearly 15 billion in cumulative profits during the years it was owned by Daimler. But analysts said Daimler could have found better uses for the cash it poured into Chrysler. “They spent about 60 billion acquiring, restructuring and investing in Chrysler over the last nine years,” Mr. Jonas of Morgan Stanley said. “Just think where the next 60 billion could go if it was invested properly.” Among other things, he said, Mercedes-Benz could introduce more innovative and alluring cars to compete with German brands like BMW and Audi. BMW, which has taken the mantle of the world’s top luxury carmaker in recent years, may feel new heat from its old rival. Daimler’s residual stake in Chrysler means that it will continue to have close ties to the company. For all the difficulties between Mercedes and Chrysler, Mr. Zetsche said they had successfully cooperated in developing power trains, buying raw material and sharing logistics systems. That work will go on, under the aegis of a joint automotive council. Mr. Zetsche portrayed the arrangement as a benefit, because Daimler will be able to capitalize on cost savings or new products that flow out of its collaboration without bearing health care liabilities. “We basically have all the upside potential without the downside risk,” Mr. Zetsche said. Still, Daimler’s history as a minority shareholder is problematic. In 1999, it bought a stake in Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, thinking that the Japanese carmaker would be the third leg of its global stool. Management turmoil led Daimler to take control of Mitsubishi in 2002, and by 2004, it ended the alliance. Keeping a stake in Chrysler could also subject Daimler to criticism at home if the new owner takes radical steps. German companies that dispose of operations can be vulnerable to charges of antisocial behavior, as the engineering giant Siemens learned last year when it sold its cellular phone operation to a Taiwan company, which later shut it down. Some analysts maintain that Daimler’s 19.9 percent stake will be temporary — a sort of umbilical cord for Chrysler’s new proprietor. Executives at Cerberus said Monday that they welcomed Daimler’s continuing investment, viewing it as a way to “secure the transaction.” Mr. Snow and others from Cerberus sought to allay fears that they planned wholesale changes at Chrysler. The firm has no immediate plans for layoffs, Mr. Snow said. And he disputed suggestions that Chrysler’s unionized workers had something to fear from Cerberus. “It’s a mistake to think private equity companies are antagonistic,” Mr. Snow said in a brief interview. “Companies that don’t have the support of their workers can’t be successful.” Mr. Snow said the deal was a landmark for private equity firms “in that this great symbol of American industry is returning to American shores, to American hands; that’s important.” Other executives at Cerberus attributed their success in the bidding to their firm’s 51 percent stake in the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, G.M.’s lending arm. That investment, they said, gave Cerberus familiarity with the details of automotive finance. They also credited the participation of Wolfgang Bernhard, a former president of Chrysler, who advised on the bid. Mr. Bernhard still has close ties with Mr. Zetsche, for whom he worked at Chrysler. For its part, DaimlerChrysler said it was swayed by the fact that Cerberus could arrange financing and move swiftly to close the deal. While Mr. Zetsche said the price tag was important, it was one of several factors in choosing the Cerberus offer over rival bids by the Blackstone Group, another private equity firm, and Magna International, a Canadian auto supplier. Daimler’s payments swell from 650 million to 1.5 billion if one includes 878 million for the company’s redemption of long-term bonds issued by Chrysler. Bodo Uebber, Daimler’s chief financial officer, said it did not consider that part of the cost of the transaction because it would have had to redeem the bonds eventually. As Chrysler passes into private hands, Mr. Zetsche said he planned to stay in touch with its chief, Thomas W. LaSorda, to learn the tricks of managing under the gaze of private equity investors. “It’s always important that you learn in your life,” he said. Summary:","completion":"Daimler is set to sell Chrysler to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management for 7.4 billion. Although this sale price is significantly lower than the 36 billion Daimler spent on acquiring Chrysler nine years ago, it will result in a stronger balance sheet for Daimler. The company's core businesses, including trucks, buses, and luxury cars such as Mercedes-Benz, are now on an upswing and are among the fastest-growing and most profitable segments in the automotive industry. Daimler will retain a 19.9% stake in Chrysler and the two companies will continue to collaborate in areas such as powertrains, raw materials procurement, and logistics systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Nick Enoch PUBLISHED: 08:51 EST, 23 October 2013 | UPDATED: 18:09 EST, 24 October 2013 From Tony 'Scarface' Montana's 'little friend' - the M16 rifle - to Dirty Harry's Magnum ('the most powerful handgun in the world'), guns and glamour have often gone hand in hand on the big screen. But now the firearms have been cast in a new light, as these X-ray images show. The intimate workings of some of cinema’s most iconic weapons, including James Bond's Walther PPK, have been revealed by British artist Nick Veasey in an attempt to 'deglamorise' guns - by reducing them to the status of scientific specimens. assassinate Abraham Lincoln to the M60 wielded by","completion":"Rambo, these fascinating X-ray images provide a unique perspective on these famous weapons. Known for his attention to detail and fascination with the hidden aspects of life, Nick Veasey has captured the intricate workings of these legendary guns, from the sophisticated mechanisms that allowed John Wilkes Booth to assassinate Abraham Lincoln to the raw power of the M60 wielded by Rambo in his fight against injustice. As part of his ongoing exploration into 'seeing through the surface' of everyday objects, Veasey has used high-tech X-ray imaging techniques to demystify these iconic weapons and, in the process, challenge our perceptions of their glamorized status. By stripping away the layers and focusing on the cold, mechanical elements of the guns, the artist enables us to view them not as symbols of power and style, but as carefully engineered tools with a deadly purpose. Furthermore, the stark grayscale images emphasize the dichotomy between the artistry of the weapons' design and their lethal capabilities. By presenting these firearms in such an unconventional and dispassionate manner, Nick Veasey has managed to create a powerful commentary on the allure of guns in our society and the potential consequences of their use. From Clint Eastwood's iconic Dirty Harry quote to Al Pacino's defiant \\"say hello to my little friend\\" in Scarface, the power and mystique of guns have permeated our culture and shaped our perceptions. However, by deconstructing these cinematic weapons and forcing us to confront their inner workings, Nick Veasey's X-ray art serves as a sobering reminder that beneath the glamour lies the potential for life-altering, irreversible damage."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

It seems like every day I wake up and tell myself that I'll be on my best behavior, but the moment I step through those school doors, it's like something triggers inside me, and I find myself in the principal's office yet again.\\" Christopher furrowed his brow, deep in thought. He knew that deep down, Robert was a kind-hearted person who genuinely wanted to change his ways. \\"Maybe it has something to do with how you interact with others, or maybe it's the environment that's causing you to act out. Have you ever thought about seeking help, like talking to the school counselor?\\" Robert shrugged. \\"I guess I could give it a try, but I'm not sure how much it would help. I mean, I don't even know what's causing me to act this way.\\" For the next couple of days, Christopher observed Robert closely, trying to identify the factors that could be contributing to his friend's misbehavior. He noticed that Robert tended to get more agitated whenever he was around particular teachers and students. Furthermore, he was quick to react in anger when faced with even the smallest of adversities. Armed with his newfound observations, Christopher decided to approach Robert with a plan to help him curb his uncontrollable impulse to act out. \\"Robert, have you ever noticed that you tend to get more agitated around certain people at school?\\" Christopher asked hesitantly, hoping his friend would not take offense. Robert looked thoughtful for a moment before nodding. \\"Yeah, actually, now that you mention it, I do feel more on edge when I'm around certain teachers and students. It's like they're subconsciously pushing me towards the edge.\\" Christopher continued, \\"I think it might be because of the negative influences in your environment. Maybe you can try changing your usual routes and habits at school to avoid people who seem to trigger you.\\" Robert considered the idea for a moment before agreeing to give it a try. Over the next few weeks, he started avoiding situations and people that seemed to set him off. He took different routes to class, switched seats in the cafeteria, and even joined a new club to make new friends. To his surprise, these changes began to have a positive impact on his behavior. The number of times he was sent to the principal's office decreased, and he found himself being able to better control his emotions. Seeing the improvement in his friend, Christopher decided to suggest the next step in Robert's journey. \\"Now that you've made some progress, why not talk to the school counselor about your emotions? They might be able to help you understand and manage them better.\\" Feeling more confident and willing to open up, Robert agreed and scheduled an appointment with the school counselor. As the weeks went by, Robert and the counselor worked together on various techniques to help him recognize and manage his emotions, such as deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, and self-reflection. Month after month, the two friends noticed a significant improvement in Robert's behavior. He no longer dreaded going to school, and his newfound sense of control brought him a sense of happiness he hadn't felt in a long time. Gradually, he went from being the student who always found himself in the principal's office to one who was commended for his progress and achievements. Throughout this journey, Christopher stood firmly by Robert's side, celebrating his victories and sharing his setbacks. They both knew that this transformation wasn't a result of a miracle but the outcome of a strong bond between friends and the determination to believe in the goodness within oneself. It wouldn't be long before Robert became a role model to others, proving that even the most troubled individuals could turn their lives around when supported and guided by a compassionate heart. And through it all, Christopher stood beside him, not only as his best friend but as a testament to the power of friendship and the limitless potential for change that lies within each and every one of us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When we got married we thought it was going to be all bliss and happiness for life. By about week two we both had an awakening. Something about being exact opposites and together 24/7. We clashed about something so important I can’t even remember what it was. We hadn’t really ever had that happen while engaged. Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss. Through all the sameness and romance. We still everyday enjoy our love and each other. And can’t imagine life without the other.

Title: A Real Sleeper Review: I heard a lot about this book, so I checked it out of the library to find out what people were talking about. It takes pages and pages of flabby prose for Goldberg to get to the heart of his argument, which is largely anecdotal and mostly unverifiable. Goldberg tells us breathlessly that an unnamed person agrees with him in a two-person meeting that there is \\"liberal\\" bias in the news. Maybe it happened, but why should anyone believe it? Let's see some proof. Right-leaning reviewers love this book because it bashes \\"liberals,\\" while left-leaning reviewers dismiss it as exhibiting right-wing bias.

Paragraph: Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Introduction The environment consists of numerous pathogens, which are agents, usually microorganisms, that cause diseases in their hosts. A host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen. Pathogens include bacteria, protists, fungi and other infectious organisms. We are constantly exposed to pathogens in food and water, on surfaces, and in the air. Mammalian immune systems evolved for protection from such pathogens; they are composed of an extremely diverse array of specialized cells and soluble molecules that coordinate a rapid and flexible defense system capable of providing protection from a majority of these disease agents. Components of the immune system constantly search the body for signs of pathogens. When pathogens are found, immune factors are mobilized to the site of an infection. The immune factors identify the nature of the pathogen, strengthen the corresponding cells and molecules to combat it efficiently, and then halt the immune response after the infection is cleared to avoid unnecessary host cell damage. The immune system can remember pathogens to which it has been exposed to create a more efficient response upon re-exposure. This memory can last several decades. Features of the immune system, such as pathogen identification, specific response, amplification, retreat, and remembrance are essential for survival against pathogens. The immune response can be classified as either innate or active. The innate immune response is always present and attempts to defend against all pathogens rather than focusing on specific ones. Conversely, the adaptive immune response stores information about past infections and mounts pathogen-specific defenses.

This indicates that the attractions lie along drivable routes and may be spaced pretty far apart; hence the statement, \\"you'll likely be spending a lot of time driving from one site to another.\\" On the other hand, the hypothesis argues that there are no roads, and sightseeing has to be done on foot. This contradicts the premise because it implies that vehicular travel is impossible due to the absence of roads and, as a result, sightseeing must be undertaken by walking. Given these considerations, the premise does not support the hypothesis. Therefore, the answer is c). No. The premise does not entail the hypothesis \\"Sightseeing has to be done on foot as there are no roads.\\""},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Digging the glasvegas album.... the dude is a dead ringer for Joe Strummer (minus the Clash What is the sentiment of this tweet?","completion":"This tweet seems to express a mixture of admiration and a sense of discovery from the user. On one hand, the user is enjoying the Glasvegas album, an indie rock band from Glasgow, Scotland. The positive sentiment can be inferred from the phrase \\"digging,\\" which suggests that they appreciate the music and are enthusiastically engaging with the album. On the other hand, the user introduces an observation about the lead singer, James Allan, considered a \\"dead ringer\\" for Joe Strummer, the late vocalist and guitarist of the iconic punk rock band The Clash. The term \\"dead ringer\\" implies that the two artists resemble each other to a significant extent, but the phrase \\"minus the Clash\\" also suggests that the resemblance may only be on a physical or perhaps vocal level, rather than in the overall sound or style of the band. It is worth noting that Joe Strummer was a highly respected and influential musician, and comparing the two artists this way indicates that the user finds a noteworthy connection. Furthermore, using the term \\"dude\\" to casually refer to the artist could imply familiarity or a laid-back, friendly approach when commenting on the resemblance. It could also denote a sense of surprise coming from the user, like they have stumbled upon this interesting and unexpected similarity in appearance between James Allan and Joe Strummer.

Given the question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Cannabis (drug). Yes or no? Answer: Pharmacologically, the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); it is one of 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 84 other cannabinoids , such as cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV). Question: how was marijuana discovered The answer is:","completion":"No, the provided statement does not correctly answer the question \\"how was marijuana discovered?\\" as it presents a rundown of the technical, pharmocological attributes and chemical compounds of cannabis, rather than tracing its historical discovery. The discovery of marijuana (also known as cannabis) isn't attributed to a specific event or individual but goes back thousands of years in human history, marking its significance and use across different timelines, civilizations and geographical settings. Historically, marijuana is believed to have originated in Central Asia, specifically in the regions that are now Mongolia and southern Siberia, around 12,000 years ago. Some research suggests that it was among the first crops purposely cultivated by human beings, demonstrating its integral role in early agricultural societies. In ancient times, the cannabis plant was used for a multitude of purposes, with its utility going beyond rudimentary psychoactive usage. The durable hemp derived from the plant was employed for creating items like rope, clothes, and paper. Simultaneously, the seeds were consumed as a food source due to their high nutritional value. The plant also found its application in the domain of medicine, supporting various traditional medical practices and therapies. The psychoactive properties of the plant were also discovered pretty early on. The consumption habits differed from culture to culture; while some chose to brew it in teas, others consumed it recreationally, either orally or through smoke. Some societies even used it for religious or spiritual rituals. The plant's historic journey then moved through migration, trade routes, and conquests over centuries. Herodotus, an ancient Greek historian, wrote about the Scythians using cannabis steam for ritualistic purposes in the 5th century BCE. It found its way to the Middle East between 2000 B.C. and 1400 B.C., and by 500 A.D., it spread to the rest of the world, including Europe, Africa, and eventually the Americas. In more recent history, the recreational use of marijuana increased in the western world during the 19th century, stemming from its scientific introductions. It was only in the late 19th and early 20th century when regulatory laws began to restrict its use across numerous countries, marking the beginning of its controversial status that persists today. In conclusion, the discovery of marijuana wasn't a singular event attributable to a specific time or individual. Instead, it was an exploration and utilization of the plant’s components, primarily THC, that was understood and adopted by various societies over millennia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children. According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\". Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter. Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed. Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce.

You’ve been devastated in New York and New Jersey, and just know everyone’s thinking of you and we're doing everything we can to help.\\" Then, in a segment taped from the hotel where he spent Wednesday night, Biden moved onto the jokes as he listed the top ten reasons why to take advantage of early voting. \\"You know who votes early? People with a backbone like a ramrod\\" came in at No. 8, and drew from the description Biden often uses to talk about President Obama's conviction to make hard choices including the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan. And, drawing on a key word from last month's vice presidential debate, he said: \\"Not exercising your right to vote is malarkey – it's literally malarkey.\\" \\"Dave, I hope to hell you voted,\\" Biden told Letterman after finishing with the list. The full top ten list: 10. I'm not saying each early voter gets a free cheeseburger, but I'm not saying they don't either. 9. It's vastly more effective than voting late. 8. You know who votes early? People with a backbone like a ramrod. 7. At a less crowded polling center, there’s plenty of room to stretch out, linger and relax. 6. If you vote early, you don’t have to pay taxes.

Article: Playing a sport in college is a big commitment. At top ranked schools, you will be playing and practicing nearly every day of the week. While in season, you will be traveling and missing classes for games. The majority of soccer teams are regulated under the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which has three divisions. Only Division I and Division II schools are eligible to offer athletic scholarships; you can narrow your search to these schools. Players on Division III teams can earn academic and merit scholarships, but these will not constitute soccer scholarships. This takes self-reflection and being honest with yourself about your abilities. Playing for a top ranked college is not going to be feasible if your soccer skills are not at an exceptionally high level. Playing soccer at a college level is a huge commitment and if you are not 100% committed to playing, you will not succeed. Setting goals that are appropriate to your skill level can save you from heartache and disappointment down the line. Within Division I and Division II schools, colleges vary on their competitiveness. Look at the current college soccer rankings to identify schools that are more competitive than others. Even though you want to play soccer for this college, you are also there to get an education. The colleges that you apply to should fit your academic goals and be a good fit for you outside of soccer. Again, these goals should be realistic and reflective of your academic abilities. Colleges set academic requirements for their athletes and if you fall below this grade point average you can be suspended from the team. If you are an exceptional student, you will have more opportunities available. Talk with your high school and club coach about your skill level, your potential to win a scholarship, and where you can improve. Be candid and open with your coaches about your goals to win a scholarship and ask for their help. Your coaches will most likely have established relationships with some colleges and recruiters. The number of contacts that your coach will have can vary widely, but they can get your foot in the door. Ask them what skills and areas you can improve on. Even the best soccer player can fine tune their skills and improve their consistency. Your coaches can help you identify the areas you are weak in so you can improve before playing in front of recruiters. Talk to other players that you know who have gone through this process and players that are now collegiate athletes. Ask them about their experiences and for advice on the process. Consider asking them questions like: What has your experience playing soccer in college been like? What were the most challenging parts of the recruiting process? What do you wish you had known about the process before you had started it? Men and women’s teams are ranked based off of their win-loss record and performance in tournaments. If you want to focus your search to the most competitive schools, you should aim to be recruited by schools that are in the top 25 of the nation. Men’s and women’s teams are ranked separately. You may find that some schools have stronger men’s programs than women’s or vice versa. Based on your goals, your coaches’ input, and your skill level, you can begin to identify schools that you are most interested in. This list of schools should include the name of the soccer coach and their contact information. Most schools will have a website devoted to their athletic program where you can find this information. Your list of schools should be large in the beginning of your process and become narrowed down over time. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article would be: Playing a sport like soccer in college entails a major commitment, with demanding schedules and dedication required. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) regulates most soccer teams in the US with Divisions I and II offering athletic scholarships. Players in Division III can only receive academic and merit-based scholarships. To play soccer at a college level, individuals should be realistic about their abilities and set goals accordingly. They should also consider academic fit when choosing a college. Speaking with high school and club coaches can help guide the decision-making process, as they can give advice about scholarships and areas of improvement. Moreover, engaging with current collegiate athletes can offer valuable insights into the experience and recruitment process. To pursue a soccer career at competitive schools, aspiring college athletes should focus on institutions ranked in the top 25 in the nation and be aware that men's and women's teams are ranked separately. Based on these factors, individuals can create a list of preferred schools, gather the necessary contact information, and narrow down their choices over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: For women who are HIV negative or who do not know their HIV status, breastfeeding should be protected, promoted and supported for six months. Hypothesis: Women who are not HIV positive can be mothers","completion":"Step 1: Analyzing the Context First, let's understand the context given. The statement talks about breastfeeding in relation to women who are HIV negative or do not know their HIV status. It suggests that breastfeeding should be protected, promoted, and supported for these women for six months. Step 2: Comparing Context with Hypothesis The hypothesis to be drawn is \\"Women who are not HIV positive can be mothers\\". This hypothesis is speaking about the ability of women who are not HIV positive to become mothers, which is a broader topic related to fertility, childbearing, and motherhood. Step 3: Drawing Conclusion The context given does not provide any information on whether women who are not HIV positive can or cannot be mothers. It only comments on the recommendation for such women regarding breastfeeding. Hence, we cannot draw the hypothesis \\"Women who are not HIV positive can be mothers\\" directly from the context given.

Xi was appointed to the nine-man Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China at the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. Xi was ranked above Li Keqiang, an indication that he was going to succeed Hu Jintao as China's next leader. In addition, Xi also held the top-ranking membership of the Communist Party's Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People's Congress in March 2008, when Xi was elected as Vice-President of the People's Republic of China. Following his elevation, Xi has held a broad range of portfolios. He was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government's leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, he also became the new President of the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China, the cadre-training and ideological education wing of the Communist Party. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Xi visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. Xi made his first foreign trip as vice president to North Korea, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Yemen from 17 to 25 June 2008. After the Olympics, Xi was assigned the post of Committee Chair for the preparations of the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of the founding of the People's Republic of China. He was also reportedly at the helm of a top-level Communist Party committee dubbed the 6521 Project, which was charged with ensuring social stability during a series of politically sensitive anniversaries in 2009. Xi is considered to be one of the most successful members of the Crown Prince Party, a quasi-clique of politicians who are descendants of early Chinese Communist revolutionaries. Former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, when asked about Xi, said he felt he was \\"a thoughtful man who has gone through many trials and tribulations.\\" Lee also commented: \\"I would put him in the Nelson Mandela class of persons. A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings affect his judgment. In other words, he is impressive\\". Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson described Xi as \\"the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line.\\" Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that Xi \\"has sufficient reformist, party and military background to be very much his own man.\\" Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tweeted, \\"Xi hosting a meeting on women's rights at the UN while persecuting feminists?

Fightstar are a British rock band from London that formed in 2003. The band is composed of lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Charlie Simpson, guitarist and co-vocalist Alex Westaway, bassist Dan Haigh and drummer Omar Abidi. Generally considered a post-hardcore band, Fightstar are known to incorporate metal, alternative rock and other genres into their sound. During the band's early days, they were viewed sceptically by critics because of Simpson's former pop career with Busted. On 11 August 2008 Fightstar released the B-sides album Alternate Endings, with live radio sessions, covers and a previously-unreleased track. When Gut Records went into administration at the end of 2008 the band decided to release their next album, Be Human, in a joint venture with their management company (Raw Power) on the Search and Destroy label. The album was distributed by PIAS Records. Fightstar released their first single from Be Human, \\"The English Way\\", on 3 November 2008 and it topped the UK rock chart. Its video was played on Kerrang! and Scuzz T.V., and topped the MTV2 top 10. The album was co-produced by the band and Carl Bown at Treehouse Studios, Bown's Chesterfield studio. In interviews before its release, Fightstar called the new album \\"quite different\\" from their previous releases; Charlie Simpson said that they wanted to experiment with a \\"rock opera\\" sound, including strings and a choir. Simpson said that although it might be different, it would still be a Fightstar album with their trademark dark, heavy elements. The band supported Feeder for the first part of their UK tour, which began on 21 October 2008. Drummer Jason Bowld of the British metal band Pitchshifter filled in for Omar Abidi on their UK tour while Abidi recovered from a broken wrist; Abidi returned to touring with the band in early 2009. Due to the drummer's injury, Simpson played drums on six tracks of the new album while Abidi wrote the drum parts and oversaw Simpson's playing. On 4 February 2009, Fightstar announced a 12-date UK tour supported by In Case of Fire and Laruso. Two weeks before the release of Be Human, \\"Mercury Summer\\" was released as the next single; its video debuted on the band's MySpace page on 25 February. \\"Mercury Summer\\" was well-received, reaching the A List of the Radio 1 Playlist; the band was featured on the BBC2 music show, Sound. \\"Mercury Summer\\" was added to the daytime playlist at XFM Radio and picked as Ian Camfield's Record of the Week. Emma Scott and Kerrang Radio also made \\"Mercury Summer\\" her Record of the Week. Be Human was released on 20 April 2009, reaching the highest chart peak of any Fightstar album: number 20 on the UK Albums Chart. The band introduced \\"A City on Fire\\" during Fearne Cotton's Radio 1 show on 19 October; its video, directed by Sitcom Soldiers, premiered on 24 October. The single was released as a digital download on 20 December and peaked at numbers four and ten on the UK Rock and Indie charts, respectively. Fightstar released a deluxe edition of Be Human on 1 March 2010 with five new tracks, including \\"A City on Fire\\" and a live cover of Jordin Sparks' \\"Battlefield\\" on the iTunes edition.

SLS is often used as a cheap filler to help toothpaste thicken and foam up. But this additive has been shown to increase the likelihood of developing canker sores in your mouth. Read the labels on toothpastes and mouthwashes to make sure they are free of SLS before you use them or search online for brands that specifically do not contain SLS. You can also follow good oral hygiene by choosing a soft bristle toothbrush to clean your teeth. Try to brush your teeth twice a day and after every meal. This will reduce the presence of bacteria and food particles that may cause canker sores to develop. Using a soft bristle brush will also prevent irritation in your mouth. Irritating your mouth with hard brushes can lead to the development of canker sores. Floss once each day to prevent food particles from staying in your mouth. These food particles can lead to oral health issues, including canker sores. Get in the habit of flossing before bed as well so your mouth is clean and free of bacteria or food particles. Flossing more than once daily can be harmful to your gums. If you have braces or a retainer, make sure it is not rubbing or scratching the inside of your mouth. Poorly fitting dental equipment can lead to the development of canker sores. Talk to your dentist if you feel your dental equipment is irritating your mouth. If you have braces that are rubbing against your mouth and causing sores, try using dental wax to cover sharp edges.

Governments of Republic of Turkey since that time have consistently rejected charges of genocide, typically arguing either that those Armenians who died were simply in the way of a war or that killings of Armenians were justified by their individual or collective support for the enemies of the Ottoman Empire. Passage of legislation in various foreign countries condemning the persecution of the Armenians as genocide has often provoked diplomatic conflict.

The Young Turks came to power after overthrowing Sultan Abdulhamid II in 1908. The key figures and leaders within the CUP during the Armenian Genocide were Mehmed Talaat Pasha, Ismail Enver Pasha, and Ahmed Djemal Pasha. Mehmed Talaat Pasha, as Minister of the Interior, was responsible for internal affairs and played an instrumental role in the organization and implementation of the Armenian Genocide policies. Ismail Enver Pasha, the Minister of War, was primarily responsible for military affairs but also had a hand in the genocide by targeting Armenian soldiers in the Ottoman army and using them for forced labor. Ahmed Djemal Pasha, the Minister of Navy, was responsible for overseeing the deportations and forced marches of Armenians to the Syrian Desert. These three figures, along with other high-ranking Young Turk officials, were largely responsible for the events that occurred during the Armenian Genocide. Their policies led to the deaths of around 1.5 million Armenians between 1915 and 1923. Ultimately, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I saw the rise of the Republic of Turkey, which formally replaced the Ottoman Empire in 1923 under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The idea would be for Alphabet GOOGL to acquire the insurance provider and turn it into an innovation lab for financial services, according to an analyst note obtained by Bloomberg from Citigroup C analysts let by Todd Bault. “We realize it is a very low-probability event, while maintaining that it is still a very good idea,” says the note. In short, the acquisition would amount to marrying AIG’s AIG ongoing work to refocus its services and Google’s technology-based approach to redefining traditional industries. In the last decade, AIG has suffered from higher-than-expected claims costs, a string of executive departures, and is now under pressure from activist investors like Carl Icahn and John Paulson to whip itself into shape. Alphabet, on the other hand, changed its company structure last summer, gaining a new name and organizing it in way that creates an umbrella (Alphabet) over a constellation of business units focused on specific technologies. AIG CEO Peter Hancock has praised Alphabet’s move, even comparing his own company’s structure to it, according to Bloomberg. Alphabet has also dabbled in selling insurance, although it’s currently only focused on car insurance. With that said, Citigroup’s analysts acknowledge that Alphabet’s shareholders wouldn’t be too happy for the company to take on billions of dollars in insurance liabilities. So, they believe the solution would be to partner with an investment bank in a deal that would let Alphabet control what it knows best: data and business strategy.

Background: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. Paragraph: People from two villages ate lots of salt.

Please answer the following question: What was the last name of the older composer who Wolfgang played their harpsichord works in his May 1764 royal recital? Answer the above question based on the context below: During Leopold's illness performances were impossible, so Wolfgang turned to composition. According to the writer and musician Jane Glover, Wolfgang was inspired to write symphonies after meeting Johann Christian Bach. It is not clear when this meeting occurred, or when Wolfgang first heard J. C. Bach's symphonies, although he had played the older composer's harpsichord works in his May 1764 royal recital. Wolfgang soon completed his Symphony No. 1 in E flat, K. 16, and started his No. 4 in D major, K. 19 (which Zaslaw concludes was more likely composed, or at least completed, in The Hague). The D major symphony has, in Hildesheimer's words, \\"an originality of melody and modulation which goes beyond the routine methods of his [grown-up] contemporaries\\". These are Wolfgang's first orchestral writings, although Zaslaw hypothesises a theoretical \\"Symphony No. 0\\" from sketches in Wolfgang's musical notebook. Three lost symphonies, identified in the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's works only by their incipits (first few bars of music), may also have originated from the London period. Other works composed by Wolfgang in London include several instrumental sonatas, the jewel of which, according to Hildesheimer, is the C major sonata for piano, four hands, K. 19d. A set of violin sonatas, with extra flute and cello parts, was dedicated to Queen Charlotte at her request, and presented to her with an appropriate inscription in January 1765. Wolfgang also wrote his first vocal works, the motet \\"God is our Refuge\\", K. 20, and the tenor aria Va, dal furor portata, K. 21.

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home. She is in the most active of the four levels available, but should the need arise, she can move on to assisted living facilities within the same complex.

Background: Newton Leroy Gingrich (; ne McPherson; born June 17, 1943) is an American politician and author from the state of Pennsylvania who served as the 50th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 1999. He represented Georgia's 6th congressional district as a Republican from 1979 until his resignation in 1999. In 2012, Gingrich was a candidate for the Republican Party presidential nomination. Context: In 1974, Gingrich made his first bid for political office as the Republican candidate in Georgia's 6th congressional district, which stretched from the southern Atlanta suburbs to the Alabama state line. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes. Gingrich ran up huge margins in the suburban areas of the district, but was unable to overcome Flynt's lead in the more rural areas. Gingrich's relative success surprised political analysts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger; Gingrich was the second Republican to ever run against him. He did well against Flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for Republican candidates nationally due to fallout from the Watergate scandal of the Nixon administration. Gingrich sought a rematch against Flynt in 1976. While the Republicans did slightly better in the 1976 House elections than in 1974 nationally, the Democratic candidate in the 1976 presidential election was former Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter. Carter won more than two-thirds of the vote in his native Georgia. Gingrich lost his race by 5,100 votes. As Gingrich primed for another run in the 1978 elections, Flynt decided to retire. Gingrich defeated Democratic State Senator Virginia Shapard by 7,500 votes. Gingrich was re-elected six times from this district. He faced a close general election race once--in the House elections of 1990--when he won by 978 votes in a race against Democrat David Worley. Although the district was trending Republican at the national level, conservative Democrats continued to hold most local offices, as well as most of the area's seats in the General Assembly, well into the 1980s. Question: Did he win? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Newt Gingrich won his first election to become a representative in Georgia's 6th congressional district in 1978. He had lost two previous attempts in 1974 and 1976, but finally succeeded when he defeated Democratic State Senator Virginia Shapard in 1978."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Morgan Gardner Bulkeley (December 26, 1837 - November 6, 1922) was an American politician, businessman, and sports executive. A Republican, he served in the American Civil War, and became a Hartford bank president before becoming the third president of the Aetna Life Insurance Company, a post he held for 43 years. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in recognition of his role as the first president of the National League. Bulkeley served on the Hartford City Council and was a four-term mayor of Hartford. Bulkeley's short career as a baseball executive coincided with the beginning of his political career. From 1874 to 1876, he served on the Hartford Common Council and the Board of Aldermen. When Thomas O. Enders resigned Aetna's presidency due to ill health in 1879, Bulkeley became the company's third president. In 1880, Bulkeley ran for both mayor of Hartford and governor of Connecticut. He lost the gubernatorial race but won the mayoral race and was Hartford's mayor from 1880 to 1888. As mayor he became known for his flamboyant generosity; for instance, arranging steamboat trips on the Connecticut River for underprivileged children, using his own money. While mayor of Hartford, on February 11, 1885, Bulkeley married Fannie Briggs Houghton in San Francisco, California. They had two sons and a daughter. In 1888, Bulkeley again ran for governor. In the election, Luzon B. Morris accumulated more votes than Bulkeley but neither had the required 50%. In accordance with the rules of the time, the General Assembly decided the winner and the largely Republican body chose Bulkeley. Although he did not run in 1890, the vote was so close and fell into such disarray due to ballot irregularities in Bridgeport that officials did not certify the results, and the Connecticut House of Representatives and Senate, each led by opposing parties, could not agree on a legal successor. When Bulkeley refused to recognize the Democratic candidate as the victor, the Democratic state comptroller changed the lock on an anteroom that led from the governor's office to the Statehouse. When Bulkeley found the door locked the next morning, he broke in with a crowbar, earning the nickname the \\"Crow-Bar Governor\\". When the legislature refused to appropriate money for state government operations because of the deadlock, Bulkeley, who also happened to be president of Aetna Life Insurance Co., had his company pick up the state's bills until the next election. Bulkeley remained in office two more years, and the state Supreme Court unanimously held that he had been the lawful governor for the disputed period of time. Bulkeley later served one term in the U.S. Senate from 1905 to 1911, as part of the \\"Millionaires' Senate\\" of 1906, so named for the wealth of its members. What role did he have in the U.S. Senate?","completion":"Morgan Gardner Bulkeley served one term in the U.S. Senate from 1905 to 1911.

Felicia goes out wearing a scarf but Rebecca does not. This is because","completion":"Felicia finds comfort and warmth in wearing a scarf, while Rebecca does not feel the need to wear one for various reasons. This difference in preference and perspective is shaped by their personal experiences, beliefs, and factors that influence their decision-making process in their everyday lives. Felicia's preference for wearing a scarf could stem from multiple reasons. One possible explanation may be that she has thin hair or is sensitive to changing temperatures, requiring her to wear a scarf to protect her ears and neck from the cold. Felicia might have also grown up in a family that places high importance on wearing scarves to protect against the cold or has cultural significance. In this case, Felicia's scarf becomes a symbol of care and a way to maintain her family traditions. On the other hand, Rebecca might not feel the need to wear a scarf due to personal comfort. She might find a scarf too restrictive or uncomfortable to wear or even prefer other winter accessories like earmuffs or turtleneck sweaters. Moreover, Rebecca might possess a thicker head of hair, which makes a scarf less essential. It is possible that Rebecca comes from a region where wearing a scarf is considered unnecessary due to warmer temperatures or different cultural practices. Another factor influencing their fashion choices could be their personal styles and aesthetics. Felicia might find that a scarf adds a touch of sophistication and elegance to her outfit, while Rebecca might consider her look complete without one. Felicia possibly enjoys experimenting with different types of scarves, experimenting with various folding techniques or patterns, highlighting her creativity and passion for fashion. Rebecca, in contrast, might lean towards minimalism when it comes to her wardrobe, appreciating the simplicity and ease of getting dressed without having to worry about coordinating her ensemble with a scarf. For Rebecca, her personal style reflects her preference for unencumbered aesthetics or functionality. Moreover, wearing or not wearing a scarf could also be influenced by their social circle, with friends encouraging each other's fashion choices or even participating in trends and challenges on social media. Felicia might have friends who love wearing scarves, encouraging her focus on following those trends, while Rebecca might be exposed to influencers on social media who promote a more simplistic approach to style. This friendly and subtle competition or camaraderie between Felicia and Rebecca can also contribute to what influences their decisions to wear specific accessories like a scarf. In conclusion, Felicia goes out wearing a scarf but Rebecca does not mainly because of the multitude of factors that shape their preferences, beliefs, and perspective on the matter. Personal experiences, upbringing, fashion sense, and individual tastes all play a role in their decisions on whether to incorporate a scarf into their daily wardrobe. The fact that they have differing opinions on wearing scarves showcases the diversity and individuality prevalent among humans. In all aspects of life, such differences should be celebrated, and we should appreciate everyone's unique choices, no matter how big or small those preferences may be."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on the premise \\"oh that's the cheerleader thing\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"That's related cheerleaders, right?\\" is true?","completion":"To evaluate the hypothesis \\"That's related to cheerleaders, right?\\" based on the premise \\"oh that's the cheerleader thing\\", we need to carefully analyze the context and information provided in both statements. Let's break it down: 1. Premise: \\"oh that's the cheerleader thing\\" This statement suggests that someone has recognized something as being connected to or characteristic of cheerleading. It could be an activity, an outfit, a performance, or even an attitude that is typical of cheerleaders or cheerleading culture. The speaker has acknowledged the connection between the observed item or behavior and cheerleading. 2. Hypothesis: \\"That's related to cheerleaders, right?\\" This statement is a question that seeks confirmation of the relationship between the observed item or behavior and cheerleading. The speaker may not be completely certain about the connection or may simply wish to corroborate their understanding with others. By comparing the given premise and hypothesis, we can observe the following: - Both statements acknowledge the presence of an item or behavior related to cheerleading. - The premise demonstrates an understanding or identification of the observed item or behavior as a \\"cheerleader thing.\\" - The hypothesis questions the relationship and seeks confirmation. Considering the context and information in both statements, we can reasonably conclude that the hypothesis \\"That's related to cheerleaders, right?\\" aligns with the premise \\"oh that's the cheerleader thing\\" and is likely to be true. However, it is essential to note that, without additional information or context, we cannot definitively confirm the truth of the hypothesis. This conclusion is based on the apparent connection between the premise and hypothesis and the assumption that the person who identified the \\"cheerleader thing\\" has accurately recognized the relationship. There could be cases where the premise is based on incorrect information or preconceived notions, which would affect the validity of our conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1636 George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, ruler of the Brunswick-Lüneburg principality of Calenberg, moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692, and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg, colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenberg's capital (see also: House of Hanover). Its electors would later become monarchs of Great Britain (and from 1801, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). The first of these was George I Louis, who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who ruled in Hanover was William IV. Semi-Salic law, which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

Venice had held several islands in the Aegean and the Ionian seas, together with strategically positioned forts along the coast of the Greek mainland since the carving up of the Byzantine Empire after the Fourth Crusade. However, with the rise of the Ottomans, during the 16th and early 17th centuries, they lost most of these, such as Cyprus and Euboea to the Turks. Between 1645 and 1669, the Venetians and the Ottomans fought a long and costly war over the last major Venetian possession in the Aegean, Crete. During this war, the Venetian commander, Francesco Morosini, came into contact with the rebellious Maniots, for a joint campaign in the Morea. In 1659, Morosini landed in the Morea, and together with the Maniots, he took Kalamata. However, he was soon after forced to return to Crete, and the Peloponnesian venture failed. In 1683, a new war broke out between Austria and the Ottomans, with a large Ottoman army advancing towards Vienna. In response to this, a Holy League was formed. After the Ottoman army was defeated in the Battle of Vienna, the Venetians decided to use the opportunity of the weakening of Ottoman power and its distraction in the Danubian front so as to reconquer its lost territories in the Aegean and Dalmatia. On 25 April 1684, the Most Serene Republic declared war on the Ottomans. Aware that she would have to rely on her own strength for success, Venice prepared for the war by securing financial and military aid in men and ships from the Knights of Malta, the Duchy of Savoy, the Papal States, and the Knights of St. Stephen. In addition, the Venetians enrolled large numbers of mercenaries from Italy and the German states, especially Saxony and Brunswick.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms.

He then spent the summer with Whiteman's band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture, The King of Jazz. Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois.

Progressive organizations such as Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) and Media Matters for America (MMfA) have criticized Stossel's work, for what they perceived as a lack of balance of coverage and distortion of facts. For example, Stossel was criticized for a segment on his October 11, 1999, show during which he argued that AIDS research has received too much funding, \\"25 times more than on Parkinson's, which kills more people.\\" FAIR responded that AIDS had killed more people in the United States in 1999, but Stossel was speaking in more broad terms than a single country over a single year. In a February 2000 Salon.com feature on Stossel entitled \\"Prime-time propagandist\\", David Mastio wrote that Stossel has a conflict of interest in donating profits from his public speaking engagements to, among others, a non-profit called \\"Stossel in the Classroom\\" which includes material for use in schools, some of which uses material made by Stossel. University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith has alleged that Stossel, in his September 1999 special Is America #1?, used an out-of-context clip of Galbraith to convey the notion that Galbraith advocated the adoption by Europe of the free market economics practiced by the United States, when in fact Galbraith actually advocated that Europe adopt some of the United States' social benefit transfer mechanisms such as Social Security, which is the economically opposite view. Stossel denied any misrepresentation of Galbraith's views and stated that it was not his intention to convey that Galbraith agreed with all of the special's ideas. However, he re-edited that portion of the program for its September 2000 repeat, in which Stossel paraphrased, \\"Even economists who like Europe's policies, like James Galbraith, now acknowledge America's success.\\" Answer this question \\"Who was criticising him?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) and Media Matters for America (MMfA) were criticizing him."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:You are given a new situation: Two students had to study fermentation processes for a school project. Ned studied lactic fermentation, while Kat studied alcoholic fermentation. and a hint : Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy. Please answer this question : Which student read more about animals carrying out lactic acid fermentation? A:","completion":"Ned is the student who read more about animals carrying out lactic acid fermentation. My justification for this answer is based on the given information about the two students' study topics. Ned studied lactic fermentation, which is directly related to the hint provided about animals, bacteria, and fungi carrying out lactic acid fermentation. On the other hand, Kat studied alcoholic fermentation, which is a different process and not mentioned in the hint.

Two cousins were fascinated about food chains in nature. Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores. Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Answer:","completion":"Fox learned less about predators with no natural predators. In the given paragraph, Liam and Fox explored different aspects of food chains in nature. Liam focused on apex predators, which are described as predators at the top of a food chain with no natural predators. On the other hand, Fox concentrated on grazers and large herbivores - animals which are usually lower in the food chain and often serve as prey for apex predators like wolves. Because Liam specifically studied apex predators, which have no natural predators, he gained more knowledge about these types of animals in comparison to Fox, who focused on grazers and large herbivores. Consequently, it can be said that Fox learned less about predators with no natural predators due to his area of study."},{"prompt":"Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"One factor controlling spinal motor neurons is related to the spine while the other factor is related to what area?\\" is in \\"Motor systems are areas of the brain that are directly or indirectly involved in producing body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming.

He converces schizophrenically with himself via tape recordings of his own voice. He is also being hounded by Randy (Pier Luigi Conti), a shady loan shark whom he owes money to after accruing bad gambling debts.Lester picks up a certain Maggie MacDonald (Sasha Darwin), an obnoxious, hysterical, mustached, sexually frustrated alcoholic, whom he invites over at his house for dinner. His attempt to poison her is thwarted because she is already so drunk when she arrives at his place that she spills her glass of wine onto the floor. On the next attempt, she giddily mixed up his glass of wine with hers. He finally loses patience on the third try when she swallows the poisoned glassful, only to vomit before it can take effect. As Maggie excuses herself to the bathroom to clean up, he attacks her with a wooden stick. Her scalp splits apart and she runs screaming from the bathroom with blood streaming down her face. He chases her down the corridor bashing her head repeatedly, causing skin to rip away from her face, and a single bloodshot eyeball to roll out of her right eye socket onto the floor.Playing dead for a few seconds, Maggie rises when Parson's back is turned and makes another mad dash for the front door, but is rounded up and punched unconscious. Furious and exhausted, the killer shoves her head into a over and switches it on, leaving her slumped with her flesh slowly melting off her face. Dead at last, Parson shoves Maggie's body into the trunk of his Mercedes. But he has to chop off the corpse's feet to get the body to fit right.When Parson ditches the body at a construction site, he is observed by a local tramp (Marco Di Stefano), who proceeds to attempt to blackmail Parson.

Maira Elizabeth and Andrew Nari An undated photo of Maira Elizabeth Nari and her father, Andrew Nari, the chief stweard aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. It was midnight when Maira Elizabeth Nari scrolled through her Twitter feed and saw the news: A piece of an airplane wing had washed ashore on an island in the Indian Ocean. Home with her mother watching television at the time, Nari had “mixed feelings,” she says. For nearly a year and a half, she had held out hope that her father, the chief steward on the Malaysia Airlines flight that vanished last year, could still be alive, perhaps “stranded somewhere,” she says. The rusty bit of wing, covered in barnacles from the sea, meant her dad might not be coming home. Nari, a 19-year-old college student studying communications in Malaysia, had been sending notes to her father, Andrew Nari, on Twitter and Instagram ever since his disappearance, telling him she was waiting for him. In one early tweet, she wrote, “Daddy. It’s almost 24 hours. When will you be back home? I’ll be waiting, all of us are. Goodnight, daddy.” At Christmas, she wrote on Instagram, “I love you, daddy. Have a blessed Christmas with the rest of the crew and passengers.” A few months later, she wrote, “I miss you, and I’ll wait for you. Even if you’re not gonna come home, that’s okay. Because I know, you’re waiting for us to join you. Wait for me, daddy. Up there, we’ll do things that we never get to do.” Her love notes to her dad captured the attention of the world—she now has has more than 92,000 followers on Twitter and more than 23,000 on Instagram. “It feels good to know that people actually care for you,” she says, describing Twitter as “like a diary to me.” At the same time, she says, “it is so weird to have the attention. It’s like people are watching whatever you tweet, and you have to be careful.” One tweet caught the eye of the Liverpool Football Club in England: “Daddy, Liverpool is winning the game. Come home, so you can watch the game! You never miss watching the game.” Last month, the team’s manager, captain, and a former star met with her near Kuala Lumpur, where she attends college. “I was so happy and excited to meet them,” she says. “My dad has been a Liverpool fan for so many years, even before he met my mother.” Just days later came the news of the wing. “I don’t know what I felt at that time,” she says, adding that part of her hoped the debris was from the plane and part of her hoped it wasn’t. All of her family had maintained hope that her father had survived, she says, ever since Flight MH370 vanished from the radar on March 8, 2014, while traveling from Malaysia to China with 239 people on board. Until the wing fragment washed up, no debris from the Boeing 777 had been found. For family and friends of the passengers, the unsolved mystery left room for hope that their loved ones were still alive, perhaps the victims of a hijacking. Nari and her mother and brother spent an anxious few days waiting to hear if the debris was indeed from the flight. Nari was asleep when Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak made the predawn announcement last week: Experts had concluded that the debris was from the plane, he said. Nari saw the news on Twitter when she awoke, and began to cry. Other international investigators did not immediately confirm the findings in Malaysia, calling for more analysis. The mixed messages reportedly caused confusion and frustration among friends and relatives of people on the flight. In China, relatives of Chinese passengers protested outside the Malaysia Airlines offices in Beijing. Family members also went to the Boeing offices in Beijing, demanding a briefing on the wing fragment. On a Facebook page devoted to an American passenger, Philip Wood, a commenter wrote, “This is yet another piece of circumstantial evidence. Still, no proof.” Nari says her family is also confused and frustrated, and she is unsure if the debris is from the plane or not. She says she doesn’t know if she’ll ever have answers about what happened to the flight. As for the investigators, she says, she is “being very positive that they are trying their best.” She says the relatives of other passengers are like family now. Two weeks before Nari’s father went missing, he celebrated his birthday with his wife and kids. Nari used her first-ever paycheck from a job as a hostess at a hotel to buy him a birthday cake and a portable power bank to charge his devices. “He always wanted to get himself a power bank,” she says. When he opened the gift box, she says, “he smiled from ear to ear.” She recalls how her father told her to “study hard so that I have a good future.” He said she could have a boyfriend only after she finished her degree. “Oops,” she says, “I broke the rule.” She said goodbye to her dad on the night of the fateful flight, as he headed out the door to drive to the airport with her mother and brother. Her father had worked with the airline for 25 years, and her mother had worked there for a time too, she says, serving as a flight attendant. Nari, tired that night from a long day of work at the hotel, told her dad she would see him when he returned. She was at work the next day when a colleague said a plane had gone missing. She called her mother and learned the unthinkable news. “I was out of my mind,” she says of her grief. “I wasn’t thinking straight. All I did was cry for few days. I didn’t eat at all. I fell asleep crying the whole time. It took me a week to actually get back on track to think properly.” She says she gradually began to heal with the help of her Catholic faith and a belief that she needed to stay strong for her family. “I was thinking about my mother and my brother. I’m the eldest, so I thought, I should take care of them and that they need me. So I had to be strong and positive,” she says. “But I am thankful, we all made it through.” Expressing her emotions on Twitter also helped, she says. “At that time, I didn’t know who to tell about what I feel and think. On Twitter, you can tweet whatever you want without what others may think.” She adds, “Well, that was last year,” before she attracted followers from around the world. “Now everyone has their eyes on me.” Sometimes people send negative comments, for instance suggesting that the flight crew was to blame. “At first I felt really sad about it, but then I got used to it,” she says. “So I ignore all the negative comments and be positive.” In the meantime, her father visits her in her dreams. In a poignant note last November, eight months to the day after her dad disappeared, she wrote on Instagram, “Daddy, few days ago you came to see me. It was the funniest dream, but hey! Thank you for stopping by.” She went on to describe her recent dream of a busy morning, taking a shower and checking text messages on her phone. “Suddenly I feel like I had to look up, and I saw you standing at the stairs looking at me and your smile…your ear to ear smile. You said, ‘I’m home.'” ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Article: Parents are often amazed at how fast their child grows and develops. New research has determined that the ability to quantify may develop much sooner than most parents realize. Kristy vanMarle, professor of the University of Missouri, has determined that contrary to what previous studies have shown, infants are able to quantify substances --like sand or water--as early as 10 months. As long as the difference between the two substances is large enough, infants will choose the larger amount, especially when it comes to food. With the assistance of her team researchers, vanMarle tested the quantifying skills of babies by presenting them with two cups: one containing a small amount of food, and one containing a larger amount. Consistently, the babies chose the larger amount. \\"Several studies throughout the last 15 years have shown that infants are very good at telling how many objects they see; however, infants don't seem to count things like water or sand,\\" vanMarle said. \\"What we're saying is that they can quantify substances; The infants can see how much food goes into each cup and compare that in their memories. They decide which amount is larger, and they almost always select the larger one.\\" This information further refutes the long-held idea that babies \\"know nothing of the world,\\" vanMarle said. \\"Since psychologists have begun studying infants with sensitive measures, we've discovered a lot of early abilities. I think for parents, it should be exciting to know that there's somebody there that has some fundamental and basic knowledge of the world, and that knowledge is guiding their development,\\" vanMarle said. In the future, vanMarle says this kind of study could be linked to a child's progress in math-related skills, although programs marketed to increase those abilities, such as \\"Baby Einstein,\\" still have mixed reviews when it comes to academic study.

Break the concrete into blocks and joints. 3). When you run out of boards, lay a tarp down to protect the concrete rather than covering it completely. Use drywall screws to secure your forms in place. 4). Use a level to make sure the surface comes out perfectly flat. Formwork structures serve to mark the perimeter of the concrete surface and contain the wet concrete mix while it's being spread and compacted.","completion":"After constructing your formwork, it's crucial to ensure the surface is even and well-prepared for the concrete pouring process - this is where using a level comes into play. By utilizing a level, you can guarantee that the surface comes out perfectly flat, providing a stable and well-aligned base for the concrete. In addition to marking out the perimeter of the intended concrete surface, the formwork structures also play a vital role in containing the wet concrete mix as it is spread and compacted. This ultimately helps in achieving a uniform, properly shaped, and structurally sound final product that meets the project's requirements. Not only does proper leveling and formwork contribute to the stability of the concrete structure, but it also enhances its durability and overall appearance, making for a more polished and professional result.

Write a title for this article: New York City’s public school students showed large gains on state math tests this year, particularly in the middle school grades, and black and Hispanic students continued to edge closer to their white counterparts, the city and state education departments announced on Monday. In New York City, 82 percent of students in Grades 3 through 8 passed the test, compared with 74 percent last year and just 57 percent three years ago. Statewide, 86 percent of students passed the test, compared with 81 percent last year. The results, coupled with similar gains on English tests released last month, were a boon for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is lobbying Albany to keep control of city schools in the mayor’s hands. At a news conference at a school in the Bronx, Mr. Bloomberg trumpeted the results as evidence that mayoral control had produced revolutionary improvements and brought city students within spitting distance of state averages after years of mediocrity. “Our reforms are working,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “Our schools are heading in the right direction.” New York was not, however, the only urban school system to register large gains. Buffalo, Rochester, Yonkers and Syracuse showed similar increases. Merryl H. Tisch, the chancellor of the state’s Board of Regents, said there was reason for caution amid the impressive results. She said that the tests had become too predictable, and that the state was considering raising the scores required to pass next year. “Just because scores have gone up dramatically does not mean that our youngsters are ready to go to college,” Dr. Tisch said at a news conference in Albany. She said the results in New York City showed “positive, strong movement in a right direction.” But she pointed out that 74 percent of public school graduates need remedial education in English and math when they enter the City University of New York. “No one should interpret this as an enormous victory,” Dr. Tisch said. Mr. Bloomberg and his schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, disputed that characterization, pointing to what they described as ground-breaking results: for instance, that the achievement gap between city students and their state counterparts had been cut in half over the past three years and is now 7 percentage points. There was also evidence that the gap among students of different races was narrowing in a city whose public school students are more than 70 percent black or Hispanic. Black students, for instance, trailed white students by 17 percentage points this year, on average, compared with 31 points in 2006. And middle school students, whose performance the city has historically struggled to improve, showed large gains. For example, 71 percent of eighth graders passed the test this year, compared with 60 percent last year. The students’ average scores on the tests, often cited by testing experts as a better measure of progress on tests, showed an 8-point increase in the city, to 680, compared with 6 points statewide, to 684. Test scores range from the upper 400s to upper 700s, with 650 considered passing. Mr. Klein said in an interview that the results marked a milestone in his reform efforts and showed that urban districts with large numbers of disadvantaged students could compete with their better-off counterparts. “This is a big victory for the city, and we should really bask in it,” he said, adding that he supported the call to develop national standards. Even Randi Weingarten, the president of the teachers’ union, lavished praise on the mayor and his chancellor. “What we’ve seen in the last seven years is a cohesion and a stability and resources that we did not have beforehand,” she said. But several scholars cautioned against viewing the scores as evidence of dramatic change. Michael J. Petrilli, a vice president at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute in Washington, an educational research organization, said the numbers most likely reflected a pattern that has emerged in cities that have implemented high-stakes testing programs. “This is mostly about educators getting used to the exams, rather than some sort of intervention having a big impact,” he said. Mr. Petrilli said claims that the achievement gap was narrowing needed to be weighed against the fact that in many cases, the scores of white students have reached a plateau, making gains by black and Hispanic students appear more significant than they might actually be. Daniel Koretz, a Harvard professor of education and an expert on testing, said it was important to consider the possibility of score inflation. David W.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Cimino was born in New York City on February 3, 1939. A third-generation Italian-American, Cimino and his brothers grew up with their parents in Old Westbury, Long Island. He was regarded as a prodigy at the private schools his parents sent him to, but rebelled as an adolescent by consorting with delinquents, getting into fights, and coming home drunk. Of this time, Cimino described himself as \\"always hanging around with kids my parents didn't approve of. Interviews with Cimino were rare; he declined all interviews with American journalists for 10 years following Heaven's Gate and he gave his part in the making of that film little discussion. George Hickenlooper's book Reel Conversations and Peter Biskind's highly critical book Easy Riders, Raging Bulls deal with the film and resulting scandal. Hickenlooper's book includes one of the few candid discussions with Cimino; Biskind focuses on events during and after the production as a later backdrop for the sweeping changes made to Hollywood and the movie brat generation. Steven Bach, a former UA studio executive, wrote Final Cut (1985), which describes in detail how Heaven's Gate brought down United Artists. Cimino called Bach's book a \\"work of fiction\\" by a \\"degenerate who never even came on the set\\". However, Bach's work does discuss times in which he did appear at the shooting location to confront Cimino about the budgetary issues. While Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Francis Ford Coppola, Gene Hackman, Sidney Lumet and Robert De Niro all gave interviews for the 2009 John Cazale documentary I Knew It Was You, Cimino refused to do so. However, the European DVD release of The Deer Hunter contains an audio commentary with Cimino as does the American DVD release of Year of the Dragon. In 2011, the French movie critic Jean-Baptiste Thoret wrote a large profile on Michael Cimino for Les Cahiers du Cinema. Cimino appeared on the cover.

Information: - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - The London Borough of Bromley is one of the 32 London Boroughs (plus the City) which make up Greater London. The London Borough of Bromley is south of the River Thames which flows through London, the capital city of the United Kingdom. Bromley is the principal town in the London Borough of Bromley. The local authority is Bromley London Borough Council. - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics. - A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \\"possibility\\", but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted. - Constrained Energy Lapped Transform (CELT) is an open, royalty-free lossy audio compression format and a free software codec with especially low algorithmic delay for use in low-latency audio communication.

It was historically a market town chartered since 1158 and an ancient parish in the county of Kent. Its location on a coaching route and the opening of a railway station in 1858 were key to its development, and the economic history of Bromley is underpinned by a shift from an agrarian village to commerce and retail. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bromley significantly increased in population and was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1903. It has developed into one of a handful of regionally significant commercial and retail districts outside central London and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. Most of Bromley including the town centre falls under the BR1 postcode district, whereas areas to the west towards Shortlands are part of BR2 instead. - A holy well or sacred spring is a spring or other small body of water revered either in a Pagan or Christian context, often both. Holy wells were frequently pagan sacred sites that later became Christianized. The term \\"holy well\\" is commonly employed to refer to any water source of limited size (i.e. not a lake or river, but including pools and natural springs and seeps), which has some significance in the folklore of the area where it is located, whether in the form of a particular name, an associated legend, the attribution of healing qualities to the water through the numinous presence of its guardian spirit or Christian saint, or a ceremony or ritual centred on the well site. In Christian legend, the water is often said to have been made to flow by the action of a saint, a familiar theme especially in the hagiography of Celtic saints. - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone. - Shortlands is a suburban village in the London Borough of Bromley, Greater London, England. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - A ritual \\"is a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, and objects, performed in a sequestered place, and performed according to set sequence.\\" Rituals may be prescribed by the traditions of a community, including a religious community.

Their analysis is summarized in the October print issue of Neuropharmacology. \\"We want to initiate the conversation now as to how to classify psilocybin to facilitate its path to the clinic and minimize logistical hurdles in the future,\\" says Matthew W. Johnson, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \\"We expect these final clearance trials to take place in the next five years or so.\\" Medical marijuana A sea change in CBD drug policy? Hopkins experts discuss the DEA's recent decision to schedule a marijuana-derived epilepsy medication as a Schedule V drug, making it the first federally-sanctioned compound derived from the cannabis plant Following the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, any drug with the potential for abuse is categorized based on criteria that take into account whether the drug has accepted medical use, and its safety and the potential for abuse. Schedule IV drugs are those that have a low potential for abuse or dependence. Although preliminary research studies suggest that psilocybin may be effective for smoking cessation and for disorders such as cancer-specific depression and anxiety, it must clear phase III clinical trials before the Food and Drug Administration can be petitioned to reclassify it. Studies in animals and humans both show low potential for abuse, the researchers say. When rats push a lever to receive psilocybin, they don't keep pushing the lever like they do for drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, or heroin. When it comes to human studies, people who have used psilocybin typically report using it a few times across their lifetime. When rats push a lever to receive psilocybin, they don't keep pushing the lever like they do for drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, or heroin. As for safety, studies show it frequently falls at the end of the scales with the least harm to users and society, say the researchers. Psilocybin also is lowest in the potential for lethal overdose as there is no known overdose level. \\"We should be clear that psilocybin is not without risks of harm, which are greater in recreational than medical settings, but relatively speaking, looking at other drugs both legal and illegal, it comes off as being the least harmful in different surveys and across different countries,\\" says Johnson. Although psilocybin is relatively less harmful than other drugs and not prone to compulsive abuse, the researchers don't recommend releasing psilocybin into patients' hands even with a prescription. \\"We believe that the conditions should be tightly controlled and that when taken for a clinical reason, it should be administered in a health care setting, monitored by a person trained for that situation,\\" says Johnson. The researchers foresee that the process for psilocybin use in the clinic would be similar to how an anesthesiologist prescribes and administers a drug, minimizing the potential for abuse or harm. ||||| Researchers at Johns Hopkins University hope to eventually reclassify psilocybin from a schedule I to schedule IV drug, according to a news release from the research institution. Psilocybin is the psychedelic drug that puts the “magic” in mushrooms. The hallucinogenic drug has been shown to offer therapeutics benefits such as alleviating symptoms of depression and helping people to quit smoking, for example. But despite some proven clinical uses, psilocybin is still classified as a schedule I drug, which means it is classified as having no medical use and high potential for abuse and addiction. By contrast, schedule IV drugs, which include such controlled substances as sleep aids, have a low potential for abuse or dependence. But before the Food and Drug Administration can be petitioned to reclassify it, psilocybin first has to clear phase III clinical trials. The entire process is expected to take about five years. That isn’t to say that once cleared, psilocybin should be available for prescription use and placed directly into the hands of patients. “We believe that the conditions should be tightly controlled and that when taken for a clinical reason, it should be administered in a health care setting, monitored by a person trained for that situation,” explained Matthew W. Johnson, a Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. Johnson is the lead author on the study about reclassifying psilocybin, published in the October 2018 issue of the journal Neuropharmacology. Psilocybin is found in more than 200 varieties of mushrooms and has gained growing acceptance in the medical community in recent years for treating depression. That increased acceptance has also garnered some interest from venture capital. Investor Peter Thiel has stakes in companies using magic mushrooms to treat depression to the general public and has suggested that psychedelics were the next big bet for investors hoping to cash in on cutting edge new therapies. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Johns Hopkins researchers have suggested that if psilocybin, the psychoactive component in hallucinogenic mushrooms, clears phase III clinical trials, it should be re-categorized from a schedule I drug with no known medical potential to a schedule IV drug, like prescription sleep aids, but with tighter control.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Whose palace was El Greco obliged to leave? ? By the time El Greco arrived in Rome, Michelangelo and Raphael were dead, but their example continued to be paramount, and somewhat overwhelming for young painters. El Greco was determined to make his own mark in Rome defending his personal artistic views, ideas and style. He singled out Correggio and Parmigianino for particular praise, but he did not hesitate to dismiss Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel; he extended an offer to Pope Pius V to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter Catholic thinking. When he was later asked what he thought about Michelangelo, El Greco replied that \\"he was a good man, but he did not know how to paint\\". And thus we are confronted by a paradox: El Greco is said to have reacted most strongly or even condemned Michelangelo, but found it impossible to withstand his influence. Michelangelo's influence can be seen in later El Greco works such as the Allegory of the Holy League. By painting portraits of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, presumably, Raphael in one of his works (The Purification of the Temple), El Greco not only expressed his gratitude but also advanced the claim to rival these masters. As his own commentaries indicate, El Greco viewed Titian, Michelangelo and Raphael as models to emulate. In his 17th century Chronicles, Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters who had initiated, in various ways, a re-evaluation of Michelangelo's teachings.Because of his unconventional artistic beliefs (such as his dismissal of Michelangelo's technique) and personality, El Greco soon acquired enemies in Rome. Architect and writer Pirro Ligorio called him a \\"foolish foreigner\\", and newly discovered archival material reveals a skirmish with Farnese, who obliged the young artist to leave his palace. On 6 July 1572, El Greco officially complained about this event. A few months later, on 18 September 1572, he paid his dues to the Guild of Saint Luke in Rome as a miniature painter. At the end of that year, El Greco opened his own workshop and... Answer:","completion":"El Greco was obliged to leave the palace of Farnese."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Endogamy is the practice of marrying within a specific ethnic group, class, or social group, rejecting others on such a basis as being unsuitable for marriage or for other close personal relationships. - Caste is a form of social stratification characterized by endogamy, hereditary transmission of a lifestyle which often includes an occupation, status in a hierarchy, and customary social interaction and exclusion. Its paradigmatic ethnographic example is the division of Indian society into rigid social groups, with roots in India's ancient history and persisting until today. However, the economic significance of the caste system in India has been declining as a result of urbanization and affirmative action programs. A subject of much scholarship by sociologists and anthropologists, the Indian caste system is sometimes used as an analogical basis for the study of caste-like social divisions existing outside India. The term is also applied to non-human populations like ants and bees. - The Pasi are one of the untouchable communities ( or dalits ) who are now classified as a Scheduled Caste under modern India 's system of positive discrimination . As untouchables , they were traditionally considered outside the Hindu ritual ranking system of castes known as varna . They live in the northern Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh . - Social stratification is a society's categorization of people into socioeconomic strata, based upon their occupation and income, wealth and social status, or derived power (social and political). As such, stratification is the relative social position of persons within a social group, category, geographic region, or social unit. In modern Western societies, social stratification typically is distinguished as three social classes: (i) the upper class, (ii) the middle class, and (iii) the lower class; in turn, each class can be subdivided into strata, e.g. the upper-stratum, the middle-stratum, and the lower stratum. Moreover, a social stratum can be formed upon the bases of kinship or caste, or both. - The caste system in India is the paradigmatic ethnographic example of caste. It has origins in ancient India, and was transformed by various ruling elites in medieval, early-modern, and, modern India, especially the Mughal Empire and the British Raj. It is today the basis of educational and job reservations in India. It consists of two different concepts, \\"varna\\" and \\"jti\\", which may be regarded as different levels of analysis of this system. - Affirmative action (known as reservation in India and Nepal and positive discrimination in the UK; also known in a narrower context as employment equity in Canada and South Africa) is the policy of favoring members of a disadvantaged group who suffer or have suffered from discrimination within a culture. Often, these people are disadvantaged for historical reasons, such as oppression or slavery. Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve goals such as bridging inequalities in employment and pay, increasing access to education, promoting diversity, and redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances. The nature of affirmative action policies varies from region to region. Some countries, such as India, use a quota system, whereby a certain percentage of government jobs, political positions, and school vacancies must be reserved for members of a certain group. In some other regions where quotas are not used, minority group members are given preference or special consideration in selection processes. What is the relationship between 'pasi ' and 'ethnic group'?","completion":"The Pasi community is an ethnic group in the Indian subcontinent, mainly residing in the northern Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. As mentioned, they are classified as a Scheduled Caste under India's system of positive discrimination. The relationship between the Pasi community and the concept of an ethnic group can be understood by looking at various aspects of culture, identity, and social organization. An ethnic group, broadly defined, is a category of people who identify with each other based on shared cultural, ancestral, linguistic, social, or national experiences. In the case of the Pasi community, they share a common history, cultural practices, social norms, and rituals that make them a distinct ethnic group within the larger Indian social framework. One key aspect of the Pasi community's ethnic identity is their historical status as one of the \\"untouchable\\" communities or Dalits within the Indian caste system. As untouchables, they were traditionally considered outside the Hindu ritual ranking system of castes known as varna. This social exclusion and marginalization have played a significant role in shaping the collective identity of the Pasi community. The caste system in India is a form of social stratification characterized by endogamy, meaning individuals are expected to marry within their own caste or social group. This practice further reinforces the group's shared identity and cultural practices. The Pasi community's status as a Scheduled Caste under India's affirmative action policies is an effort to address and alleviate the historical discrimination and social exclusion they have faced due to their caste and untouchable status. In summary, the Pasi community's relationship with the concept of an ethnic group involves their shared history, cultural practices, social norms, and rituals, which have been shaped by their status within the Indian caste system and social stratification. As an ethnic group, the Pasi have a distinct identity that is recognized and addressed through modern policies to foster social inclusion, positive discrimination, and the provision of opportunities for education, employment, and political representation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event.

Q: Which competition leads to one species going extinct or both becoming more specialized? A: Answer:","completion":"The competition that leads to one species going extinct or both species becoming more specialized is known as interspecific competition. Interspecific competition is a critical component of the ecological interactions between different species sharing the same resources within a community. In this type of competition, two or more species compete for limited resources such as space, food, water, or light, which may significantly impact their survival and reproductive rates. Interspecific competition is an essential force driving the process of evolution and specialization of species. When two species have similar requirements and preferences within an ecosystem, they may begin to compete against each other, which can eventually lead to several potential outcomes: 1. Competitive Exclusion: One species may become better adapted at utilizing the available resources and gaining a competitive advantage over the other, leading to the extinction of the less competitive species. This principle is known as the \\"competitive exclusion principle\\" or Gause's Law, named after the Russian biologist Georgy Gause. In this case, two species that occupy the same niche cannot coexist over time, and one will eventually outcompete and displace the other. 2. Niche Partitioning: If both competing species can adapt and specialize in their resource usage and preferences, they may be able to coexist within the same ecosystem, avoiding direct competition. For instance, species may differ in their feeding habits, habitat preference, reproductive patterns, or temporal activities. Each species will occupy a different or narrower niche, thereby reducing or avoiding competition. In this scenario, both species will evolve and adapt to separate microhabitats reducing their competition and potential negative effects on each other. For instance, two bird species with distinct beak size and shape may feed on different-sized seeds, thus avoiding direct competition and allowing them to coexist without the need to outcompete one another. 3. Character Displacement: Over time, species may undergo evolutionarily changes that result in different physical or behavioral traits that minimize the overlap between their niches, allowing them to coexist within the same environment. This phenomenon is known as \\"character displacement,\\" where species diverge in their morphological or ecological traits when competing for the same resources. For example, two species of lizards living on the same island may develop separate eating habits and exhibit different body sizes, enabling them to utilize different resources and reduce competition. Interspecific competition is an essential process in ecology, as it influences critical aspects of community structure, species diversity, and evolutionary processes. By driving adaptation, specialization, and ultimately species evolution, interspecific competition plays a significant role in shaping the patterns of biodiversity across the world's ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The idea of having an Active Display feature on my phone without buying a new device enticed me. However, after using the app for a while now, I'd give it a 3-star rating as it leaves room for improvement. The user interface is quite simple and uncluttered, which I appreciate. The app allows me to view time, date, and notifications on the lock screen without having to unlock my phone. It works well most of the time, but I've experienced a few glitches in which the screen would not turn off automatically, draining my battery, or when notifications aren't cleared upon dismissing them. One of the major drawbacks is higher battery usage. I noticed a significant decrease in my battery life after installing AcDisplay, which might be a problem for users looking to maximize productivity. Another issue I encountered is the app's compatibility with other lock screen apps and security measures. I had to try disabling my lock screen password for AcDisplay to work without clashing with security. It would be great if the developers could find a way to fix this and make the app more compatible with other security measures set on the device. Overall, com.achep.acdisplay has a lot of potential, but it needs improvements in battery efficiency and compatibility with other lock screen or security features. With those fixes, I believe this app could easily become a 4 or even a 5-star application. Until then, I'd recommend giving this app a try, but don't expect it to be perfect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The earliest human remains found on the island of Sri Lanka date to about 35,000 years ago . The proto-historical period begins roughly in the 3rd century, based on chronicles like the Mahavamsa, Dipavamsa, and the Culavamsa. The earliest documents of settlement in the Island are found in these chronicles. These chronicles cover the period since the establishment of the Kingdom of Tambapanni in the 6th century BCE. The first Sri Lankan ruler of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, Pandukabhaya, is recorded for the 4th century BCE. Buddhism was introduced in the 3rd century BCE by Arhath Mahinda . The first Tamil ruler of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, Ellalan, an invader, is recorded for the 2nd century BCE. The island was divided into numerous kingdoms over the following centuries, intermittently united under Chola rule. Sri Lanka was ruled by 181 monarchs from the Anuradhapura to Kandy periods.From the 16th century, some coastal areas of the country were also controlled by the Portuguese, Dutch and British.Between 1597 and 1658, a substantial part of the island was under Portuguese rule. The Portuguese lost their possessions in Ceylon due to Dutch intervention in the Eighty Years' War. Following the Kandyan Wars, the island was united under British rule in 1815.Armed uprisings against the British took place in the 1818 Uva Rebellion and the 1848 Matale Rebellion. Independence was finally granted in 1948 but the country remained a Dominion of the British Empire until 1972. In 1972 Sri Lanka assumed the status of a Republic. A constitution was introduced in 1978 which made the Executive President the head of state. The Sri Lankan Civil War began in 1983, including an armed youth uprising in 1971 and 1987-1989, with the 25-year-long civil war ending in 2009. Answer this question: How many years were there between the Uva Rebellion and the Matale Rebellion?","completion":"To calculate the number of years between the Uva Rebellion and the Matale Rebellion, we need to find the difference between the years in which these events took place. The Uva Rebellion occurred in 1818, and the Matale Rebellion took place in 1848. The difference between these years is: 1848 (year of Matale Rebellion) - 1818 (year of Uva Rebellion) = 30 years.

Summarize: Tight, structured clothing and shoes may make you uncomfortable when you travel. They may also increase your risk of developing blood clots. Instead, wear something loose that fits you comfortably. Opt for stretchy pants with an elastic waistline and a loose fitting top, or wear a loose-fitting jersey or cotton dress. Pair your outfit with a pair of comfortable walking shoes, such as sneakers or supportive sandals. You may also want to dress in layers to help keep yourself at a comfortable temperature. For example, you could wear a short-sleeved top with a cardigan or pullover. That way if you feel a chill, you can simply throw on your cardigan. Buckle your seatbelt when you are going to be riding in a car, on a bus, or on an airplane. Make sure that the seatbelt is low around your hips and positioned under your belly. The top strap of a car seatbelt should go across your chest and be positioned above your belly. On an airplane, keep your seatbelt buckled even when the “fasten seatbelt” sign is off. Unexpected turbulence may jostle you around and could even cause injury if you’re out of your seat during severe turbulence. If you will be driving, position yourself as far away from the steering wheel as you can while still being able to fully operate your vehicle. Take some extra time to get adjusted and make sure that your position is both comfortable and safe. If you put your seat all the way back and it is hard for you to reach the steering wheel, you need to be closer to it. Don’t put yourself in unsafe positions just to create more distance between you and the wheel. Gas-producing foods can increase your discomfort while traveling, so it is best to avoid them while you’re in transit.

Jehovah's Witnesses children at risk: RC Children are not adequately protected from sexual abuse in the Jehovah's Witnesses, an organisation that wrongly relies on a rule with 2000-year-old biblical origins when handling complaints, the royal commission says. It also says victims may face an impossible choice between staying in an organisation that protects their abuser or being \\"shunned\\" and cut off from family and friends. \\"We do not consider the Jehovah's Witness organisation to be an organisation which responds adequately to child sexual abuse,\\" the sex abuse royal commission said in a report released on Monday. \\"We do not believe that children are adequately protected from the risk of sexual abuse.\\" The commission said the Jehovah's Witness organisation's scripturally-based policies and practices were outdated and, by and large, wholly inappropriate and unsuitable in child sex abuse cases. It applied a two-witness rule for complaints of wrongdoing that had not been revised or improved since the Jehovah's Witnesses was founded in the late 19th century. \\"The Jehovah's Witness organisation relies on, and applies inflexibly even in the context of child sexual abuse, a rule which was devised more than 2000 years ago,\\" the report said. \\"A complainant of child sexual abuse whose allegation has not been corroborated by confession by their abuser or a second 'credible' eyewitness is necessarily disempowered and subjected to ongoing traumatisation.\\" To put a victim of child sex abuse in such a position was unacceptable and wrong, the commission said. The commission found the organisation's internal sanctions are weak and leave perpetrators of child sexual abuse at large in the organisation and the community. The organisation deals with offenders through assessing how repentant they are, with inadequate regard to the risk of reoffending, the commission said. That showed a serious lack of understanding of the nature and impact of child sex abuse and and placed children within the organisation at significant risk of sexual abuse, it said. The commission said the practice of shunning those who leave the Jehovah's Witnesses could put victims in the untenable position of having to choose between constant re-traumatisation through sharing a community with their abuser or losing their entire family and social network. The commission found the Jehovah's Witnesses' general practice was not to report child sex abuse allegations to police or authorities unless required to do so by law, saying there was no evidence they reported a single one of 1006 alleged abusers. However, the Jehovah's Witnesses said they comply with mandatory reporting laws and will report abuse allegations to the authorities if the child is in danger, regardless of reporting requirements. \\"In addition to whatever action is taken by the authorities, Jehovah's Witnesses document and act upon any allegation of child abuse received, and provide pastoral care to a victim and their family,\\" the organisation told AAP. It said the commission's recommendations related to responses from decades ago and the Jehovah's Witnesses continued to refine and improve their responses. \\"Although the commission questioned certain Bible-based beliefs and standards, senior Jehovah's Witnesses testified that the organisation will continue to review its responses.\\" The religion never takes custody of children and does not sponsor any activities or programs that separate children from their parents or guardians at any time, it said. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The Australian Royal Commission accuses the Jehovah's Witnesses organisation of inadequate response and failure to protect children from sexual abuse. The commission claims the religious group's handling of sexual abuse complaints is based on outdated scripturally-based policies, requiring corroboration of the abuse claims either by confession from the abuser or a second 'credible' eyewitness. This practise is not only traumatising but also effectively shields abusers within the organisation. Furthermore, victims face a harsh choice between staying with the organisation that shelters abusers or leaving and being shunned by their community. Although the Jehovah's Witnesses organisation insists they comply with mandatory reporting laws in relation to abuse, the commission found no evidence of them reporting any one of 1006 alleged abusers.

Please answer the following question: Two countries had big rivers discharging in the same ocean. Finland was very aware of environmental pollution and acted accordingly, while Russian practiced conventional agriculture and used fertilizers. Which country caused less human waste to reach into the ocean? Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. A:","completion":"To answer the question, we need to compare the waste production and management practices in both Finland and Russia. Step 1: Consider Environmental Awareness and Practices Finland is known for its environmental awareness and regulations. This means they are likely to have better waste management practices, including the proper treatment of sewage and agricultural waste to minimize pollution. Russia, on the other hand, practices conventional agriculture and uses fertilizers. This suggests that they may not have as strict environmental regulations or waste management practices in place compared to Finland. Step 2: Analyze the Agriculture Practices and Human Waste Management Hypoxia and dead zones are caused by the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals, primarily due to agricultural fertilizers, livestock waste, and human waste. Finland is more environmentally conscious and may have better agricultural practices, such as using fewer fertilizers, efficient waste management, and sewage treatment facilities. This would result in less human waste and agricultural pollutants entering the ocean. Russia, with its conventional agriculture and fertilizer use, is more likely to contribute to higher levels of marine pollution due to excess nutrients and the lack of strict waste management policies. Step 3: Drawing a Conclusion Based on the information provided and our analysis of environmental practices in both countries, it is likely that Finland causes less human waste to reach the ocean compared to Russia. This conclusion is primarily due to Finland's environmentally conscious approach, better waste management practices, and lower use of agricultural fertilizers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, the word \\"stylish\\" is key in understanding the intended sentiment. The word \\"stylish\\" can generally be seen as a positive descriptor, as it implies that the film in question possesses a sense of sophistication, fashion, or flair in its presentation. This can refer to various aspects of a movie, such as its cinematography, art direction, costuming, or even the storytelling itself. The phrase \\"this stylish film\\" implies that the speaker regards the movie as visually appealing and well-executed in terms of its creative choices, which indicates a positive sentiment. However, it is important to note that the phrase \\"this stylish film\\" is relatively short and may not provide the entire context of the speaker's opinion. Although the phrase itself leans towards a positive sentiment, additional information from the full review or surrounding sentences may introduce a more critical or even negative perspective on the film, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the sentiment. For example, consider these different scenarios: 1. \\"This stylish film manages to captivate its audience with its exceptional acting and gripping plot.\\" In this case, the sentiment is clearly positive, with the stylishness of the film contributing to its overall appeal and quality. 2. \\"Despite being a stylish film, it ultimately falls flat due to a poorly written script and one-dimensional characters.\\" Here, the sentiment is more mixed or even negative. While the film's style is acknowledged as a positive aspect, it is outweighed by other elements that bring down the overall opinion of the movie. In conclusion, while the phrase \\"this stylish film\\" alone suggests a positive sentiment, it is essential to consider the broader context of the review to fully grasp the speaker's stance on the movie. The more complete the context, the more accurate the interpretation of the sentiment will be."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Options: - decline - going down hill - nausea - death - kissing Answer:","completion":"The suitable action that a couple might do at the end of the sleighing ride would be \\"kissing\\". Sleighing or sledge rides are quite popular during the winter season, particularly in regions where there is heavy snowfall. This activity typically involves riding on a lightweight vehicle, generally pulled by a horse, over snow or ice. It's a quintessential winter activity that is not only fun and exhilarating, but also provides an opportunity for couples to bond and enjoy an intimate time together. Once the ride is over, couples might be filled with such joy and happiness from the thrilling sleigh experience. Overwhelmed with positive emotions from the adventure and the beauty of the glittering snow and twinkling lights around them, they would be drawn closer together. In such romantic scenarios, it's quite common for couples to express their affection for each other by having a warm embrace or by sharing a passionate kiss at the end of the ride. The other options mentioned - decline, going down hill, nausea and death - seem to imply negative outcomes which are not typically associated with a romantic or fun-filled activity such as a sleighing ride. Decline and going down hill signify a reduction or deterioration, nausea implies sickness which is not a normal or desirable outcome of a sleighing ride, and death is certainly too extreme and not in tune with the context of the question. Therefore, out of all the options given, the act of a couple \\"kissing\\" at the end of the sleighing ride is the most suitable and relevant response.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Gina Rinehart is far from a household name in the U.S., but she will be soon if Citigroup’s projections are correct. She’ll also be the richest person in the world, eclipsing the fortunes of well-known billionaires like Carlos Slim, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. Mining tycoon Rinehart is Australia’s richest person, worth 9 billion. Her fortune quadrupled last year thanks to high iron ore prices and rising exports to China. But Australian journalist Tim Treadgold, who recently wrote a Forbes Asia story on Rinehart, believes her net worth could climb as high as 100 billion. In a story for Australia’s Smart Company, he extrapolates findings from Citigroup Global Markets research on mining projects. The report names Hancock Prospecting, the company Rinehart inherited from her father, as the world’s fifth largest mining outfit. Treadgold’s full story is definitely worth reading, but the thrust of his argument is as follows: If Rinehart was a company listed on the ASX, and valued using the same 11-times price-to-earnings ratio as her partner, Rio Tinto, she would be worth 30 billion, putting her in the top 10 of the Forbes rich list headed by Mexican telephone magnate, Carlos Slim, at US74 billion, with Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, second at US56 billion. Rinehart, however, has three more mines on the way, and potentially more in the exploration phase. If Rinehart’s three new projects mentioned by Citigroup match the performance of Hope Downs, and if mineral prices stay high (two big assumptions) it is possible to see Rinehart’s portfolio of coal and iron ore production spinning off annual profits approaching 10 billion. If those best guesses prove to be correct, Rinehart is heading for a personal net worth valuation of more than 100 billion, using the Rio Tinto 11-times PE multiple. Treadgold goes on to say that these numbers are, of course, contingent on “estimates, assumptions, forecasts and predictions.” And yes, 100 billion does sound exceptionally high. Still, he makes a compelling case that Rinehart is one to watch. Even at a 30 billion net worth valuation, based on profit forecasts for her Hope Downs mine, she’d be the world’s richest woman, a title currently held by Walmart heiress Christy Walton. And whereas Walton inherited her wealth, Rinehart is almost entirely self-made. As Treadgold wrote in his Forbes Asia story, Hancock Prospecting was “in shambles” when her father died. She’s spent the last two decades building it up, and it’s paying off. Follow me on Twitter: @Clare_OC ||||| Gina Rinehart hates the label “Australia’s richest person”. So how will she and the rest of the country react when - not if - she ranks as the “world’s richest\\", as can be forecast using the latest research. Citigroup Global Markets, a division of the big US banking group Citibank, provided a glimpse into Rinehart’s future in a major report on worldwide resource projects called Generation Next. The 60-page document looks at 400 mining projects around the world classified as “greenfields”, meaning they are not currently in production, but are moving through the design and approvals process. As might be expected, the world’s biggest mining companies, including BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Xstrata and Anglo American, are top of the list. But in fifth spot on the greenfields list, ahead of Brazil’s resources leader Vale, is Hancock Prospecting, the company Rinehart inherited from her father, the late Lang Hancock. To say this is an amazing ranking is putting it mildly. Putting a single person (because Rinehart owns all of Hancock Prospecting) on a list of global resource giants means that she will, in the future, own projects of a similar size to the biggest miners. Two factors need to be considered in this, the start of re-rating Rinehart as the world’s richest person. They are: How did Citigroup apply a common value to different types of mine developments, including coal, gold, iron ore and copper? Why will Rinehart’s project catapult her up the world’s various rich lists? The answer to the first question is that all projects were reduced to a common factor, a copper equivalent. In other words, they have been valued as if they were all producing copper, the leading base metal with uses which span a number of industries, from construction to electronics. The answer to the second question is that Rinehart owns all of hers, whereas the other companies on the list share their wealth with thousands of shareholders. The strength of Rinehart’s position is shown in the list of the top 10 projects, which is headed by Rio Tinto’s Simandou iron ore mine in the west African country of Guinea. It will start production in 2013, building to an annual output of 70 million tonnes of iron ore, which is calculated by Citigroup to be the equivalent of 875,000 tonnes of copper a year. Rinehart has three projects in the top 10, the same number as Rio Tinto. BHP Billiton has none. Roy Hill iron ore in WA, which is scheduled to start production in 2014, building to a rate of 55 million tonnes a year, and valued at 688,888 tonnes of copper equivalent. Alpha Coal in Queensland, also scheduled to start in 2014 at a rate of 30 million tonnes of coal and year – rated as 563,000 tonnes of copper, and Kevin’s Corner coal in Queensland, scheduled to start in 2013 also at a rate of 30 million tonnes of coal – and also rated as 563,000 tonnes of copper. Those three projects are expected to attract joint venture partners in the same way Rinehart brought Rio Tinto in as a partner in her first mine, the Hope Downs iron ore project in WA. It was the start of production at Hope Downs, plus a perpetual royalty paid by Rio Tinto on most of its WA iron ore production, which pushed Rinehart to the top of the Australia and New Zealand rich list compiled by Forbes magazine, followed later this year by BRW, with both estimating her net worth at between 9-and-10 billion. Important as the royalty might be, it is Hope Downs which is generating the bulk of Rinehart’s cash flow, as this snapshot illustrates. At its current annual 30 million tonnes of production, and an iron ore price of around US175 a tonne (A166 a tonne) Hope Downs generates annual revenue of around 5 billion. The cost of producing a tonne of iron ore in the Pilbara is around A40, leaving a profit margin per tonne of around A126, meaning Hope Downs is generating an annual profit of 3.78 billion – with half flowing to Rinehart, or around 1.9 billion. Hope Downs is expanding to 45 million tonnes a year, which will lift Rinehart’s share to 22.5 million tonnes, taking her annual profit to around 2.8 billion (before the Rio Tinto royalty). If Rinehart was a company listed on the ASX, and valued using the same 11-times price-to-earnings ratio as her partner, Rio Tinto, she would be worth 30 billion, putting her in the top 10 of the Forbes rich list headed by Mexican telephone magnate, Carlos Slim, at US74 billion, with Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, second at US56 billion. Rinehart, however, has three more mines on the way, and potentially more in the exploration phase. If Rinehart’s three new projects mentioned by Citigroup match the performance of Hope Downs, and if mineral prices stay high (two big assumptions) it is possible to see Rinehart’s portfolio of coal and iron ore production spinning off annual profits approaching 10 billion. If those best guesses prove to be correct, Rinehart is heading for a personal net worth valuation of more than 100 billion, using the Rio Tinto 11-times PE multiple. It is, at this stage, a game of estimates, assumptions, forecasts and predictions. But the numbers are a guide as to how big Rinehart could become, raising a totally separate set of questions - especially how Australian governments deal with her. Tim Treadgold is a West Australian journalist. |||||Summary:","completion":"Gina Rinehart is a lady from Australia who has a lot of money because her family owns big land where they dig for iron and other things.

Memo Reveals Tangled Business Ties A 2011 memo made public Wednesday by Wikileaks revealed new details of how former President Bill Clinton made tens of millions of dollars for himself and his wife, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, through an opaque, ethically messy amalgam of philanthropic, business and personal activities. The memo was written by Bill Clinton’s longtime aide, Doug Band, and is among tens of thousands of emails apparently stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chief, John Podesta, in what U.S. officials believe is part of a massive Russian-backed attempt to disrupt the U.S. election. The Band memo came in response to an investigation undertaken by a law firm, Simpson Thatcher, into the activities of the Clinton Foundation at the behest of its board. The board was concerned that some of the activities undertaken by Band and others on behalf of the President could threaten the Foundation’s IRS status as a charity, according to Band’s memo. Chelsea Clinton had also reported concerns to Podesta and other Clinton advisors that Band and his recently-launched consulting firm, Teneo, were using her father’s name without his knowledge to contact British lawmakers for clients, including Dow Chemical. In the 12-page memo, Band describes how he and several colleagues spent much of the years after Bill Clinton’s presidency working to fund the Clinton Foundation, which has raised nearly 2 billion from individuals, corporations and governments for charities focusing on climate change, economic development, health, women and girls issues and other causes. Band claims in the memo that from 2006 to 2011, he and a colleague, Justin Cooper, raised 46 million for the Foundation through the Clinton Global Initiative, an annual networking conference that is one of the Foundation’s big sources of income. But the Foundation work was just a part of what Bill Clinton did during his wife’s time as a Senator and Secretary of State, and it wasn’t always clear where the former president’s non-profit activities ended and his for-profit ones began. Five months before he wrote the memo, Band joined forces with a recently retired State Department envoy, Declan Kelly, to form Teneo, which Band said provided merchant and investment banking services, corporate restructuring, public relations and communications services and strategic advising services to 20 clients, including Coca-Cola, Dow Chemical, UBS, Barclays and BHP Billiton, among others. Over that period, Band says in the memo, Teneo raised 8 million for the Clinton Foundation. And Band was also organizing personal income directly for Clinton. Under the heading, “For-Profit Activity of President Clinton (i.e. Bill Clinton, Inc.),” Band wrote, “We have dedicated our selves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities—including speeches, books, and advisory service engagements… In support of the President’s for-profit activity, we also have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, in-kind services for the President and his family—for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like. Neither Justin nor I are separately compensated for these activities (e.g., we do not receive a fee for, or percentage of, the more than 50 million in for-profit activity we have personally helped to secure for President Clinton to date or the 66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements).” Band mentions four such “arrangements” without naming them. Bill Clinton was paid nearly 18 million to be “honorary chancellor” of a for-profit college, Laureate International Universities, according to reports and the family’s tax returns. A Dubai-based firm, GEMS Education, paid Bill Clinton more than 560,000 in 2015, according to the tax returns. Band also lists a variety of speaking fees, previously disclosed by the Clintons, including hundreds of thousands of dollars each from UBS, Ericsson, BHP and Barclays. In 2011 alone, according to the Clinton’s tax returns, Bill Clinton earned 13,454,000 in speaking fees. No evidence has been found to support allegations of a quid pro quo of official acts by Hillary Clinton as senator or Secretary of State in exchange for the money received by the Clintons or the Clinton Foundation. However the messiness and opacity of the relationship between Clinton’s personal, business and philanthropic undertakings detailed in the memo raises new questions about Bill Clinton’s activity. In the email to which Band’s draft memo was attached, Band tells Podesta he has removed the “lasry section all together.” Marc Lasry is a hedge fund manager and Clinton donor who funded an unsuccessful investment vehicle launched by Chelsea Clinton’s husband Marc Mezvinsky. Other questions arise in the penultimate paragraph of the memo, entitled “Other Matters.” Without providing details, Band writes that since the end of Bill Clinton’s presidency he and Cooper had served as the primary contact and point of management for President Clinton’s activities, including political, business and Foundation matters, speeches, books, and family/personal needs, including “securing in-kind private airplane travel, in-kind vacation stays, and supporting family business and personal needs.” Calls and emails to Band, Teneo and the Clinton Foundation were not immediately returned. The Hillary Clinton campaign declined to confirm that the memo, or other emails released by Wikileaks, are in fact undoctored documents stolen from Podesta’s personal email account. However a campaign spokesperson, Glen Caplin, tweeted on Wednesday that Wikileaks was advancing a “clear political agenda” by “dribbling out” Podesta’s emails. “If Podesta dump was about high-minded transparency @wikileaks would release all at once,” Carlin tweeted. Podesta has said he is cooperating with the FBI in an investigation of the hack. The Clinton Foundation has said it will stop accepting foreign and corporate donations if Hillary Clinton is elected president. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"A Wikileaks memo has shown how former President Bill Clinton made a lot of money for himself and his wife, Hillary Clinton, through a mix of business, charity and personal activities.

Make sure to remove the green lump and thin green stem attaching the flower to the stalk. Possible answers: (a). Try not to twist the stem as you remove the flower from the plant. Wait patiently for the flower to recover from its old color. (b). Once all of the flower is removed the green vein will be visible from above the plant as well as around it. After removing the flowers make sure to cut off the main stalk in the same area. (c). Place each flower beneath a warm lamp in a warm room or among light fixtures.

Process: - Aluminium cans are put into a recycling bin - Aluminium cans are then collected and taken to a treatment plant - At the treatment plant the aluminium is sorted and cleaned - Readied for reprocessing - The aluminum cans go through a re-melt process - Turned into molten aluminium - The molten aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - The ingots are sent to mills and are rolled out into thin sheets - The rolls are ready to be made into new aluminum products. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose People eat more food from cans happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"If people eat more food from cans, it can be expected that there will be an increase in the number of aluminum cans that need to be recycled. This increased demand for canned food would lead to a higher production and consumption of aluminum cans. As a result, a higher amount of aluminum cans will end up in recycling bins, eventually finding their way to the treatment plants. The perturbation of people consuming more food in cans has both direct and indirect effects on the aluminum recycling process: 1. Direct effect: The increased number of aluminum cans would directly affect the recycling process by requiring treatment plants to handle a larger volume of cans. This could lead to plants needing to expand their facilities, hire more workers, or improve their sorting and cleaning processes to accommodate the higher influx of cans. 2. Indirect effect: With more aluminum cans being recycled, there might be an increased overall demand for recycled aluminum products. This higher demand could lead to a growth in the recycled aluminum industry, potentially creating new jobs and promoting technological advancements in recycling processes. Additionally, the environmental impact of recycling more aluminum could indirectly lead to benefits such as reduced energy consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions. In conclusion, if people were to eat more food from cans and subsequently recycle more aluminum cans, it would have both direct and indirect effects on the aluminum recycling process. This could lead to improvements in recycling efficiency, growth in the recycled aluminum industry, and overall, positive environmental outcomes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: About nine million people like rock climbing in America. Millions more take part in the activity around the world. Some do it just for fun. Others compete. Climbing takes strength, control and good balance. Climbers have to pull themselves straight up the face of very high rocks or walls. So they have to be strong enough to carry their own weight. And climbers sometimes have to hold onto rocks by only their fingers or toes. There are several kinds of rock climbing. Traditional rock climbing is done outside. Climbers wear ropes and tie equipment to the rocks as they climb many hundreds of meters up. They also connect their ropes to the equipment. If a climber slips, a rope can stop him from falling. Sport climbing is similar. However, in it the protective equipment is placed in the rock all the time. There is also indoor climbing. Rock walls made of wood have places for the climber's hands and feet. Ice climbing is exactly as it sounds. People climb glaciers or frozen waterfalls instead of rocks. They use special equipment for the ice. And then there is bouldering-climbing rocks between three and seven meters high. It is quicker and stronger climbing. Many climbers like bouldering because they can use less equipment. Climbers often need only special shoes and chalk . All climbers use chalk to keep their hands dry. Most rocks have cracks and holes and parts that stick out. Climbers use these for foot-holds and handholds. Climbers use their legs to climb. They try not to pull themselves up with their hands or arms. Arms and hands are for position and balance. People almost always climb in groups of two or more. Climbing alone is very dangerous. Expert rock climbers say only the very best in the sport should do it. Question: Which of the following is TRUE about rock climbing? Options: A: Climbers use their hands or arms to climb.

Two of the earliest dialectal divisions among Iranian indeed happen to not follow the later division into Western and Eastern blocks. These concern the fate of the Proto-Indo-Iranian first-series palatal consonants, *ć and *dź: Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What elements of Proto-Indo-Iranian did not diverge according to the ensuing split between eastern and western variants?","completion":"The question raises an interesting point about the Proto-Indo-Iranian language and its development into the Eastern and Western dialects. But before breaking down specific elements that did not diverge according to the split, it is important to understand the development of the Proto-Indo-Iranian language and its two primary branches. Proto-Indo-Iranian, a sub-branch of the larger Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language family, is the reconstructed common ancestor of two major language groups: Indo-Aryan (also known as Indic) languages and Iranian languages. The division into Eastern (Indo-Aryan) and Western (Iranian) blocks reflects the geographical dispersion and subsequent linguistic divergence of the early Indo-Iranian-speaking peoples. Some key features and elements of Proto-Indo-Iranian that did not significantly diverge with the Eastern and Western split can be discussed as follows: 1. Palatalization: The palatalization of first-series palatal consonants (*ć and *dź) marks one of the early dialectal divisions in the Indo-Iranian languages. This palatalization did not necessarily follow the strict division into Eastern and Western blocks. The loss of these consonants is observed in some eastern languages like Sanskrit, while they were mostly retained in western languages like Avestan. 2. Case system: The Proto-Indo-Iranian language inherited a system of eight grammatical cases (nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, locative, and instrumental) from the Proto-Indo-European language family. This case system remained mostly intact in both eastern and western branches, although some changes occurred in the usage and function of certain cases over time. 3. Gender system: Both Eastern and Western branches retained the Proto-Indo-Iranian gender system, with three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and agreement between nouns and their modifiers, pronouns, and verbs. 4. Verb system: The verb system of Proto-Indo-Iranian was based on a combination of tense, aspect, and voice. Both Eastern and Western branches inherited this system and continued to use it, although the details of conjugation and verbal structure underwent changes in both branches. 5. Shared vocabulary: Despite the division into Eastern and Western blocks, a considerable amount of shared vocabulary was retained in the descendant languages. Many basic words, such as grammatical particles, pronouns, numbers, common verbs, and everyday nouns, originated from the earliest Proto-Indo-Iranian language stage. Overall, while the linguistic differentiation between the Eastern and Western branches of Proto-Indo-Iranian languages did occur, there were several key elements — including palatalization, case and gender systems, the verb system, and shared vocabulary — that did not diverge strictly along the lines of the East-West split. These components serve as reminders that the common ancestry of the Indo-Iranian languages persisted despite the linguistic and geographical diversification that took place over time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His physics professor explained him why one object's temperature was higher while other object's temperature was lower. Hint: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator. - Notopteroidei is a suborder of the order Osteoglossiformes that contains the Gymnarchidae (aba), Notopteridae (feather backs and knifefish), mormyrids (the elephantfishes), as well as extinct families. - Oncorhynchus is a genus of fish in the family Salmonidae; it contains the Pacific salmon and Pacific trout. The name of the genus is derived from the Greek \\"onkos\\" (\\"hook\\") and \\"rynchos\\" (\\"nose\\"), in reference to the hooked jaws of males in the mating season (the \\"kype\\"). - Osteoglossiformes (Greek: \\"bony tongues\\") is a relatively primitive order of ray-finned fish that contains two sub-orders, the Osteoglossoidei and the Notopteroidei. All of at least 245 living species inhabit freshwater. They are found in South America, Africa, Australia and southern Asia, having first evolved in Gondwana before that continent broke up. - Salmo is a genus of fish in the salmon family Salmonidae that includes the European species of salmon and trout, among them the familiar Atlantic salmon \\"Salmo salar\\" and the brown trout \\"Salmo trutta\\". The natural distribution of \\"Salmo\\" also extends to Northern Africa and to Western Asia around the Black Sea basin. The single \\"Salmo\\" species naturally found in the Atlantic North America is the Atlantic salmon, whereas the salmon and trout of the Pacific basin belong to another genus, \\"Oncorhynchus\\". The generic name \\"Salmo\\" derives from the Latin \\"salm\\" (salmon). The number of distinct species and subspecies in \\"Salmo\\" is a debated issue. Atlantic salmon and brown trout are widespread species, while most of the other taxa are narrowly distributed forms endemic to single watersheds. - Trout is the common name for a number of species of freshwater fish belonging to the genera \\"Oncorhynchus\\", \\"Salmo\\" and \\"Salvelinus\\", all of the subfamily Salmoninae of the family Salmonidae. The word \\"trout\\" is also used as part of the name of some non-salmonid fish such as \\"Cynoscion nebulosus\\", the spotted seatrout or speckled trout. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Salmonidae is a family of ray-finned fish, the only living family currently placed in the order Salmoniformes. It includes salmon, trout, chars, freshwater whitefishes, and graylings, which collectively are known as the salmonids. The Atlantic salmon and trout of the genus \\"Salmo\\" give the family and order their names. - Tertiary is the former term for the geologic period from 66 million to 2.58 million years ago, a time span that lies between the superseded Secondary period and the Quaternary. The Tertiary is no longer recognized as a formal unit by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, but the word is still widely used. The traditional span of the Tertiary has been divided between the Paleogene and Neogene Periods and extends to the first stage of the Pleistocene Epoch, the Gelasian age. The period began with the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs in the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event, at the start of the Cenozoic Era, and extended to the beginning of the Quaternary glaciation at the end of the Pliocene Epoch. - An invasive species is a plant, fungus, or animal species that is not native to a specific location (an introduced species), and which has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health. - The Neogene is a geologic period and system that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the Paleogene Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the present Quaternary Period Mya. The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary. - In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the \\"donor\\" organism(s). - Osteoglossoidei are a suborder of the order Osteoglossiformes (Latin: \\"bony tongues\\") that contains the butterflyfish, the arowanas and bonytongues, as well as extinct families. - In paleogeography, Gondwana, also Gondwanaland, is the name given to an ancient supercontinent. It is believed to have sutured between about 573 and 510 million years ago (Mya), joining East Gondwana to West Gondwana. Gondwana formed prior to Pangaea, and later became part of it. - The arapaima, pirarucu, or paiche are any large species of bonytongue in the genus Arapaima native to the Amazon and Essequibo basins of South America. Genus \\"Arapaima\\" is the type genus of the family Arapaimidae. They are among the world's largest freshwater fish, reaching as much as . They are an important food fish. They have declined in the native range due to overfishing and habitat loss. In contrast, arapaima have been introduced to several tropical regions outside the native range (within South America and elsewhere) where they are sometimes considered invasive species. Its local name, \\"pirarucu\\", derives from the indigenous words for \\"pira\\" meaning \\"fish\\" and \\"urucum\\" meaning \\"red\\". - The Paleocene or Palaeocene, the \\"old recent\\", is a geologic epoch that lasted from about . It is the first epoch of the Paleogene Period in the modern Cenozoic Era. As with many geologic periods, the strata that define the epoch's beginning and end are well identified, but the exact ages remain uncertain. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - Salvelinus is a genus of salmonid fish often called char or charr; some species are called \\"trout\\". \\"Salvelinus\\" is a member of the Salmoninae subfamily of the Salmonidae family. The genus has a northern circumpolar distribution, and most of its members are typically cold-water fish that primarily inhabit fresh waters. Many species also migrate to the sea, however. - The tongue is a muscular organ in the mouth of most vertebrates that manipulates food for mastication, and is used in the act of swallowing. It is of importance in the digestive system and is the primary organ of taste in the gustatory system. The tongue's upper surface (dorsum) is covered in taste buds housed in numerous lingual papillae. It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva, and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels. The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth. A major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans and vocalization in other animals. - Omnivore is a consumption classification for animals that have the capability to obtain chemical energy and nutrients from materials originating from plant and animal origin. Often, omnivores also have the ability to incorporate food sources such as algae, fungi, and bacteria into their diet as well. - Ancient Greece was a civilization belonging to a period of Greek history from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th-9th centuries BC to the end of antiquity (AD). Immediately following this period was the beginning of the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine era. Roughly three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century BC, ushering in the period of Archaic Greece and colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the period of Classical Greece, an era that began with the Greco-Persian Wars, lasting from the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Due to the conquests by Alexander the Great of Macedonia, Hellenistic civilization flourished from Central Asia to the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. The Hellenistic period came to an end with the conquests and annexations of the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, which established the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire. - Opsithrissops ( Ancient Greek : \`\` Aspect Fish Face '' ) is an extinct genus of prehistoric bony fish that lived during the Thanetian stage of the Paleocene epoch . It is a small 100 centimetres ( 3.3 ft ) nektonic opportunistic carnivore in the family Osteoglossiformes which includes other bony - tongues such as the extant species of Arowana and Arapaima . It hunted small invertebrates and fish similarly to today 's trout and became a Paleogene keystone species in many habitats before its disappearance from the fossil record . - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Arowanas are freshwater bony fish of the family Osteoglossidae, also known as bonytongues (the latter name is now often reserved for Arapaimidae). In this family of fish, the head is bony and the elongated body is covered by large, heavy scales, with a mosaic pattern of canals. The dorsal and anal fins have soft rays and are long based, while the pectoral and ventral fins are small. The name \\"bonytongues\\" is derived from a toothed bone on the floor of the mouth, the \\"tongue\\", equipped with teeth that bite against teeth on the roof of the mouth. The arowana is a facultative air breather and can obtain oxygen from air by sucking it into its swim bladder, which is lined with capillaries like lung tissue. - The Phanerozoic Eon (British English Phanærozoic) is the current geologic eon in the geologic time scale, and the one during which abundant animal and plant life has existed. It covers million years to the present, and began with the Cambrian Period when diverse hard-shelled animals first appeared. Its name was derived from the Ancient Greek words (phanerós) and (z), meaning \\"visible life\\", since it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon. The time before the Phanerozoic, called the \\"Precambrian\\" supereon, is now divided into the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons. - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - Salmon is the common name for several species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae. Other fish in the same family include trout, char, grayling and whitefish. Salmon are native to tributaries of the North Atlantic (genus \\"Salmo\\") and Pacific Ocean (genus \\"Oncorhynchus\\"). Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America. Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.

Johann Sebastian Bach composed the church cantata Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten! (Ring out, you songs; sound, you strings!), BWV 172, in Weimar for Pentecost Sunday in 1714. Bach led the first performance on 20 May 1714 in the Schlosskirche, the court chapel in the ducal Schloss. Erschallet, ihr Lieder is an early work in a genre to which he later contributed complete cantata cycles for all occasions of the liturgical year. Bach was appointed Konzertmeister in Weimar in the spring of 1714, a position that called for the performance of a church cantata each month. He composed Erschallet, ihr Lieder as the third cantata in the series, to a text probably written by court poet Salomon Franck. The text reflects different aspects of the Holy Spirit. The librettist included a quotation from the day's prescribed Gospel reading in the only recitative, and for the closing chorale he used a stanza from Philipp Nicolai's hymn \\"Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern\\" (1599). The work is in six movements, and scored for four vocal soloists, four-part choir, three trumpets, timpani, oboe, bassoon and a string orchestra of two violins, two violas, and basso continuo. The orchestra for the holiday occasion is festive compared to the two works previously composed in Weimar. The cantata opens with a chorus, followed by the recitative, in which words spoken by Jesus are sung by the bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ). A bass aria with trumpets addresses the Trinity, and a tenor aria then describes the Spirit that was present at the Creation. This is followed by an intimate duet of the Soul (soprano) and the Spirit (alto), to which an oboe plays the ornamented melody of Martin Luther's hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\" and a solo cello provides the bass line.

(June 27) AP Marchers carry signs in downtown Pittsburgh as they protest the shooting death of Antwon Rose Jr. (Photo: Keith Srakocic, AP) A Pennsylvania police officer accused of fatally shooting an unarmed black teen hours after being sworn into the East Pittsburgh Police Department was charged Wednesday with one count of criminal homicide. Authorities say Officer Michael Rosfeld, who is white, shot Antwon Rose Jr., 17, on June 19 while fleeing from a car that had been stopped on suspicion it was involved in a drive-by shooting. Police were questioning the driver when Rose and another man fled. Rose was shot three times. \\"This is a small stride toward justice, but we have a very long road ahead,\\" said lawyer S.

East Pittsburgh police officer Michael Rosfeld was charged with homicide Wednesday in connection with last week's shooting death of Antwon Rose, and court documents say the officer made inconsistent statements to detectives about why he pulled the trigger. \\"You do not shoot someone in the back if they are not a threat to you,\\" Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr., said in a news conference. Rosfeld was arraigned just before 8 a.m. by District Judge Regis Charles Welsh, according to court records. He was released on 250,000 unsecured bond. Reached late Wednesday, Rosfeld's attorney, Patrick Tomassey, confirmed that Allegheny County Judge Jeffrey Manning modified Rosfeld's bond to include electronic monitoring.

Fred Rabner, an attorney for Rose's family, said the family viewed the filing of charges with \\"guarded optimism.\\" \\"There is still a long road ahead to a conviction and proper sentencing, which is the only thing we will accept as justice,\\" Rabner said. \\"In this area of civil rights we know that from protests to policy is a marathon not a sprint and we hope that this case has the endurance to change the landscape of the country on this important issue of police brutality.\\" The shooting happened at about 8:40 p.m. June 19 after East Pittsburgh police pulled over a car near Grandview Avenue and Howard Street. The car matched the description of one involved in an earlier shooting in North Braddock. As police ordered the 20-year-old driver to the ground, Rose and another passenger, who has since been identified as 17-year-old Zaijuan Hester, ran from the car. Rosfeld opened fire, hitting Rose, also 17, three times. In an eight-page criminal complaint, Allegheny County detectives detailed their interviews with at least six witnesses to the East Pittsburgh and North Braddock shootings, including two who said that Rose and Hester clearly had nothing in their hands when they ran from the car after police pulled it over in East Pittsburgh. A person identified in the complaint as Witness 2 lives several houses away from the East Pittsburgh shooting scene and told police they were on their front porch as the incident unfolded. That witness watched as Rosfeld ordered the driver out of the car and to the ground. After the driver complied, Rosfeld ordered the car's other two occupants out of the vehicle and they ran toward Route 30, the complaint said. Witness 2 could \\"clearly see that neither male had anything in his hands,\\" detectives wrote in the complaint. A person identified in the complaint as Witness 3 also lives nearby and reported seeing the person in the front passenger seat get out of the car and begin to put his hands on the roof of the car but then turned and ran away. \\"Witness 3 said the officer then fired his weapon three times at the person as he ran away,\\" detectives wrote. \\"Witness 3 stated the person's hands were empty and the officer shot at him as he was running away from the officer.\\" Rosfeld provided a conflicting account to detectives, according to the complaint. Rosfeld initially told detectives that when he ordered the driver out of the car and onto the ground, the front-seat passenger got out of the vehicle. \\"(Rosfeld) said this person turned his hand toward (Rosfeld) and he, (Rosfeld), saw something dark that he perceived as a gun,\\" detectives wrote. \\"This observation caused him to step from behind the cover of his car door to acquire a better view. He then fired his weapon.\\" Detectives later asked Rosfeld to go over the sequence of events a second time. \\"During that rendition, Rosfeld told the detectives that he did not see a gun when the passenger emerged and ran,\\" they wrote. \\"When confronted with this inconsistency, Rosfeld stated he saw something in the passenger's hand but was not sure what it was,\\" detectives wrote, adding he \\"was not certain if the individual who had his arm pointed at him was still pointing at him when he fired the shots.\\" The complaint said Rose was struck in the right side of his face, in his right elbow and in the middle of his back. The wound to the back was fatal, according to the complaint. Statements from witnesses to the earlier North Braddock shooting seem to place Rose in the front passenger seat and Hester in the back passenger seat. A 22-year-old man identified in the complaint as Witness 1 was standing near another man on North Braddock's Jones Avenue when he heard gunfire and realized he'd been struck, the complaint said. He would be treated and released from a hospital for a grazing wound to the abdomen. Surveillance footage gathered by detectives showed the rear passenger window of the car in which Rose and Hester were riding come down and a passenger holding a gun began shooting, according to the complaint. Detectives noted that the front passenger window remained closed. The man standing near Witness 1 returned fire. The same backseat passenger then fired at another man on the street, who returned fire, detectives wrote. The driver of the car in which Rose and Hester were riding said shots fired from inside his car came from the rear passenger seat. The driver told police he knew Rose and Hester, and they hired him that night to drive them from Rankin's Hawkins Village to Grandview Avenue in East Pittsburgh, according to the complaint. Police found two guns in the jitney driver's car: a 9mm Glock model 26 pistol under the front portion of the front passenger seat that was loaded with a 17-round magazine that contained 16 rounds; and a .40-caliber Glock 22 pistol under the rear portion of the front passenger seat with a live round in the chamber and an extended magazine with 18 rounds. Shell casings found on the ground in North Braddock matched the latter gun, police wrote. An empty handgun magazine found in Rose's pocket fit the 9mm pistol found under the front portion of the front passenger seat, according to the complaint.

Summarize this article: An FBI mole who provided valuable intelligence on al Qaeda and met with Osama bin Laden was lured away from the FBI to work for the CIA, but was killed by al Qaeda operatives in Bosnia who suspected he was an informant, NBC News has learned exclusively. The informant, a Sudan-born driver and confidante to “Blind Sheikh” Omar Abdel-Rahman, the radical Muslim cleric who allegedly masterminded the first attempt to take down the World Trade Center, had been the sole human asset providing first-person information about al Qaeda in the mid-1990s as the terror group gained strength around the globe. According to sources familiar with the management of the mole, the FBI recruited him in 1993 because he was a known associate of the Blind Sheikh. Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the alleged mastermind of the first World Trade Center bombing. Ted Thai / Time Life Pictures via Getty Images The Egyptian-born Sheikh had been an FBI target since at least Nov. 5, 1990, when one of his followers, El Sayyid Nosair, shot and killed radical Rabbi Meir Kahane in a Manhattan hotel. After the shooting, boxes of information were found in Nosair’s apartment that hinted at a larger conspiracy. Under pressure, the Sheikh moved some of his operations from the New York area to Los Angeles, where the future mole was living. The mole became the Sheikh’s driver. That’s when the FBI first noticed him, and started the process that would turn him into an informant. In early 1993, the Immigration and Naturalization Service tipped the FBI to the driver’s identity, and the FBI found that he was on a terrorism watch list. The INS then tried to deport the driver, only to discover that the driver’s status as a possible Islamic militant made it hard to find a country that would accept him. Jordan agreed to take him, but then threw him in jail for three months. The driver wound up in Yemen, where the FBI began to reel him in. Though the chronology is unclear, by around this time terrorists had mounted their first attack on New York’s World Trade Center. On Feb. 26, 1993, a truck filled with 1,500 pounds of explosive detonated in an underground garage, killing six people but failing to take down the twin towers. The FBI increased its focus on the Sheikh and his associates, who were suspected of involvement. In Yemen, the FBI agent who would later become the driver’s handler – Bassem Youssef, the bureau’s highest ranking Arabic speaker – made his first approach. According to sources, he introduced himself to the driver not as an agent, but as a friend who could help reunite the driver with his family in California, via personal connections with an important L.A. judge. The bureau also obtained warrants to listen to phone calls to and from the driver’s home, including conversations with the Sheikh. And it began to work on the driver’s wife, who became a cooperating source. The driver, however, still didn’t know he was talking to the FBI. But after subsequent meetings with Youssef and other agents in Rome and Brussels, he learned the truth, and agreed to provide information, said sources. He started talking about a terror group called al Qaeda. In Brussels, he passed a polygraph test, and then produced a dozen authentic U.S. and Canadian passports in which the original pictures had been replaced with the pictures of al Qaeda operatives. The operatives had used the passports to crisscross Europe and spread the message of jihad. The driver was also able to arrange a trip to his home country of Sudan for a meeting with one of the Sheikh’s associates, a little-known Saudi-born terror leader named Osama bin Laden. “Bin Laden was not bin Laden then,” said one Justice Department official. “He was not that hard to get to.” In Sudan, bin Laden told the mole that he had “picked out” a Masonic Lodge in Los Angeles for an “explosion.” The mole also told the FBI that the Sheikh said, “If you need any money, you go to Osama directly and tell him I sent you.” It is not known whether the source tried to solicit funds from bin Laden. Back in the U.S., the Blind Sheikh was arrested along with nine followers on June 24, 1993. He was later convicted of conspiracy for planned attacks on American landmarks, and sentenced to life in prison. The informant continued working for the FBI after the Sheikh’s arrest, said sources. But the mole’s success had piqued the interest of another U.S. agency, the CIA. In 1994, a civilian female working for the CIA was able to convince the informant, with the help of a large sum of money, to work for the CIA instead of the FBI. In 1994 or 1995, the CIA dispatched the informant to Bosnia, where jihadis were aiding Bosnia’s Muslim majority in a war against Serbian forces. The FBI did not know at the time that its informant had started working for the CIA, or why he had disappeared. His former handler, Bassem Youssef, who by then was working undercover in Los Angeles as a supposed member of al Qaeda, began asking his al Qaeda sources what had become of the driver. They told Youssef that the driver had gone to Bosnia, and that al Qaeda operatives there had killed him because they believed that he was a mole for the CIA. Later, Youssef was able to confirm that the al Qaeda operatives’ suspicions were justified, and that the driver had been working for the CIA. The existence of the informant was first revealed during courtroom testimony in 2010, as part of a discrimination suit filed by Bassem Youssef against the FBI. Youssef accused the bureau of passing him over for promotion despite his skills. Testifying on Youssef’s behalf, former assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s L.A. office Ed Curran revealed that Youssef had developed the Blind Sheikh’s driver as an informant. “It was the only source I know in the bureau where we had a source right in al Qaeda, directly involved,” Curran told the court, according to excerpts of testimony published by the Washington Times. He also testified that the informant was “tight, close” with al Qaeda leadership. The Washington Times was the first media outlet to report on Curran’s revelation, and noted that the bureau had declined to tell the 9/11 Commission, which investigated al Qaeda’s 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, about the al Qaeda informant’s existence. Sources told NBC News, however, that they weren’t sure the informant was relevant to the 9/11 Commission, because by 2001 his short, albeit productive, relationship with the U.S. government – and his life – had been over for six years. In a statement, the FBI said that the FBI “made all relevant information available to the 9/11 Commission.” The CIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bassem Youssef is still with the FBI and continues to pursue his discrimination suit. ||||| Guy Taylor is the National Security Team Leader at The Washington Times, overseeing the paper’s State Department, Pentagon and intelligence community coverage.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker. Do you have any questions?","completion":"Sure, let me explain that in simpler terms for you. A long time ago, there were some bad men who didn't like the United States. They wanted to do something really harmful. One of those bad men was named Mohamed Atta. He was from Egypt, but he went to Germany to study. In Germany, Atta made friends with three other men who also didn't like the United States. Atta and his friends were good at speaking English and knew a lot about life in Europe. This made them perfect for the bad men's harmful plan. They all went to a faraway place called Afghanistan to join the other bad men and get ready for their plan. This group became very important in the big harmful thing that happened on September 11, 2001, in the United States. Do you want to ask anything else about this?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: The plan is to deploy 1,700 peacekeeping troops.","completion":"After reading the given paragraph, it appears that the hypothesis stating \\"The plan is to deploy 1,700 peacekeeping troops\\" is false. According to Francis Deng's belief expressed in the text, the government will be receptive to the plan that consists of deploying 1,800, not 1,700, peacekeeping troops. This information is critical in understanding the accurate troop count linked to the deployment plan and serves as vital evidence in discrediting the hypothesis. It is equally important to consider the implications of a 100-troop difference. The distinction between 1,700 and 1,800 troops could lead to changes in allocated resources, logistics, and overall plan execution. Acknowledging this disparity is essential, as it will impact the decision-making process if it were to be overlooked. Furthermore, the paragraph reflects Francis Deng's beliefs, but further context is required to better understand the situation. For instance, it would be beneficial to know the context surrounding the peacekeeping mission and the reasons behind the government's potential receptiveness, as well as Francis Deng's credibility and experience in engaging with the government or contributing to the plan.

Question: suppose environment improving makes butterflies more healthy happens, how will it affect the magma condenses less. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"C: No effect The health of butterflies and the process of magma condensation are two unrelated occurrences, and an improvement in the environment that leads to healthier butterflies will not have an effect on the cooling and condensation of magma. Let's break down each part of the relationships at play here to make it clear. 1. Magma condensation: The process of magma condensation or solidification occurs deep below the Earth's crust and is influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and the composition of the magma itself. Some other factors that might impact the rate of magma cooling include the rate of heat loss to the surrounding rock, whether water is present in the magma, and the extent of partial crystallization. As the magma cools down, the atoms slow down and begin to arrange themselves into a more ordered, crystalline structure. This leads to the formation of solid minerals that can form rocks like basalt, granite, or gabbro, depending on the chemical composition of the magma. 2. Environment and butterfly health: Butterflies, on the other hand, are influenced by various environmental factors, many of which can affect their overall health and wellbeing. An improvement in the environment could include a reduction in pollution levels and pesticide use, increased availability of nectar sources, and an increase in suitable host plants for their larvae. These factors are crucial to butterflies in terms of reproduction and survival. When the environment is improved, butterflies may see better health due to increased food sources, less exposure to harmful chemicals, and a reduction in habitat destruction. In turn, this could lead to increased populations and greater biodiversity. However, the processes leading to healthier butterflies have no direct impact on the geological processes that occur deep within the Earth, such as magma condensation. The two phenomena are unrelated, and any changes to butterfly health will not influence the rate of magma cooling and solidification.

Twentieth... - The Shard, also referred to as the Shard of Glass, Shard London Bridge and formerly London Bridge Tower, is a 95-storey skyscraper in Southwark, London, that forms part of the London Bridge Quarter development. Standing high, the Shard is the tallest building in the United Kingdom, the fourth-tallest building in Europe and the 105th-tallest building in the world. It is also the second-tallest free-standing structure in the United Kingdom, after the concrete tower at the Emley Moor transmitting station. - The Research Excellence Framework is the successor to the Research Assessment Exercise. It is an Impact evaluation; assessing the research of British higher education institutions. It was used in 2014 to assess UK research during the period 20082013. - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. - Warwick Business School (WBS) is an academic department of the University of Warwick, originally established in 1967 as the School of Industrial and Business Studies. It is one of the most prestigious and highly selective business schools in the world. Due to the school's historical international outlook its alumni hold leadership positions in corporate, governmental and academic institutions around the globe. - The European University Association (EUA) represents and supports more than 850 institutions of higher education in 47 countries, providing them with a forum for cooperation and exchange of information on higher education and research policies. Members of the Association are European universities involved in teaching and research, national associations of rectors and other organisations active in higher education and research. - A royal charter is a formal document issued by a monarch as letters patent, granting a right or power to an individual or a body corporate. They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters. Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being that awarded to the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, on 7 April 2011. - Sir Kenneth Robinson ( born 4 March 1950 ) is an English author , speaker and international advisor on education in the arts to government , non-profits , education and arts bodies .

Warwick Medical School is one of only two solely graduate-entry medical schools in the UK (together with Swansea Medical School). - The Russell Group is a self-selected association of twenty-four public research universities in the United Kingdom. The group is headquartered in London and was established in 1994 to represent its members' interests, principally to government and parliament; nineteen smaller British research universities formed the 1994 Group in response, which has since dissolved. In 2010, Russell Group members received approximately two-thirds of all university research grant and contract income in the United Kingdom. The group is widely perceived as representing the best universities in the country. - The University of Warwick Science Park (also known as UWSP and Warwick Science Park) was one of the first university based science parks in the United Kingdom when it was opened by the Rt. Hon. Margaret Thatcher in 1984. It was a joint venture between the University of Warwick, Coventry City Council, Warwickshire County Council and Barclays. The latter are no longer shareholders having been replaced by WM Enterprise. The University of Warwick agreed in 2011 to purchase the shareholding of Coventry City Council. The acquisition was completed in 2012 and today the Science Park is wholly owned by the University of Warwick. UWSP currently covers four sites; the main campus abutting the University of Warwick, the Business Innovation Centre in Binley, Warwick Innovation Centre on Warwick Technology Park and Blythe Valley Innovation Centre near Solihull. - Universities UK is an advocacy organisation for universities in the United Kingdom.

The group provides taught and research degrees for postgraduate students at the University of Warwick campus in England, and at overseas centres in China, India, Singapore, Malaysia, Cyprus, Russia and Thailand. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.

Article: The evidence for harmony may not be obvious in some families. But it seems that four out of five young people now get on well with their parents, which is the opposite of the popularly-held image of unhappy teenagers locked in their room after endless family quarrels. An important new study into teenage attitudes surprisingly shows that their family life is more harmonious than it had ever been in the past. \\"We were surprised by just how positive today's young people seem to be about their families,\\" said one number of the research team. \\"They're expected to be rebellious and selfish but actually they have other things on their minds: they want a car and material goods, and they worry about whether school is serving them well. There's more negotiation and discussion between parents and children, and children expect to take part in the family decision-making process. They don't want to rock the boat.\\" So it seems that this generation of parents is much more likely than parents of 30 years ago to treat their children as friends. \\"My parents are happy to discuss things with me and willing to listen to me,\\" says 17-year-old Daniel Lazall. \\"I always tell them when I'm going out clubbing. As long as they know what I'm doing, they're fine with me.\\" Susan Crome, who is now 21, agrees. \\"Looking back on the last 10 years, there was a lot of what you could call negotiation.

It is possible that the idea of teenage rebellion is not rooted in real facts.

Given the question: Given the following context: Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe. His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\".... answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who was attending school in Knutsford by 1818?

Input: The Illinois Department of Labor reproach focused on emails that Illinois Veterans Home administrators sent to state workers, WBEZ Chicago reported Thursday. State labor officials said the Illinois Department of Veterans’ Affairs “failed to effectively notify all employees” about the outbreak. Labor officials also said the veterans’ agency didn’t instruct workers about “proper precautions to avoid or eliminate exposure in a timely manner.” The disease has caused the deaths of 13 residents since 2015 and made dozens more residents and staff members seriously ill. State labor officials became involved after two sickened staffers complained to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. AFSCME, the public union representing some Quincy workers, argued the veterans’ home didn’t do enough to warn employees about the disease threat. Illinois Veterans’ Affairs Director Erica Jeffries, who resigns next week, said Quincy employees were kept informed about the outbreak through emails, meetings and informational material posted at nursing stations. “We communicated effectively to our staff and to our residents and certainly to the family members of each resident that was exhibiting signs and symptoms of pneumonia,” she said in a statement. Her spokesman, Dave MacDonna, said the veterans’ affairs department “has been transparent concerning its response to the outbreak in 2015 and has provided thousands of documents to both members of the media and the General Assembly.” State Department of Labor spokesman Ben Noble said former state Labor Director Hugo Chaviano approved issuing the written reprimand but said there was no citation because no workplace safety standards were violated. Noble said the department hasn’t received any follow-up complaints. Rauner’s administration last week recommended starting fresh at the western Illinois home with a state-of-the-art facility on the 130-year-old campus costing between 190 million and 230 million. ___ Information from: WBEZ-FM.

The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event. - Geir Andersen ( born February 12 , 1964 ) is a Norwegian nordic combined skier who competed from 1983 to 1989 . He won three medals at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships with one gold ( 1984 : 3 x 10 km team ) and two silvers ( 1985 : 15 km individual , 3 x 10 km team ) . Andersen also finished 10th in the individual event at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo . He had six individual victories in his career from 1984 to 1985 . - Nordic combined is a winter sport in which athletes compete in cross-country skiing and ski jumping. Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup are ongoing. - The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup is a Nordic combined competition organized yearly by FIS, representing the highest level in international competition for this sport. It was first arranged for the 1983/84 season. Team event was first time held in 1999/00 season. The FIS race director is a Norwegian ex ski jumper and ex world record holder Lasse Ottesen. - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate. - The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships have been held in various numbers and types of events since 1925 for men and since 1954 for women. Championship events include nordic skiing's three disciplines: cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and nordic combined (the latter being a combination sport consisting of both cross-country and ski jumping). From 1924 to 1939, the World Championships were held every year, including the Winter Olympics. After World War II, the World Championships were held every four years from 1950 to 1982. Since 1985, the World Championships have been held in odd-numbered years. - Nordic skiing pertains to skiing disciplines that use equipment where the toe of the ski boot is fixed to the binding in a manner that allows the heel to rise off the ski, unlike Alpine skiing, where the boot is attached to the ski from toe to heel. Recreational disciplines include cross-country skiing and Telemark skiing. - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline.

Bake until done, then cover the top of each cupcake with frosting....I think the answer is","completion":"The more reasonable method for accomplishing the goal of making cupcakes is: Option: * Put paper cupcake liners into each cell of a muffin tin and then fill each liner with cupcake batter. Bake until done, then cover the top of each cupcake with frosting. This method is more reasonable for a number of reasons: 1. Proper preparation: Placing paper cupcake liners into each cell of a muffin tin is the standard way of preparing the tin for baking cupcakes. This is because it helps the cupcakes hold their shape, allows for easy removal from the tin, and makes them easy to handle and decorate once baked. 2. Sequence of steps: Putting the cupcake batter into the liners first, followed by baking, and then applying the frosting, is the correct sequence of steps when making cupcakes. The batter needs to be baked first to create the structure and foundation of the cupcakes. Baking also ensures the cupcakes rise properly, develop a tender crumb, and achieve the right level of doneness. 3. Frosting application: As cupcakes need to cool down completely before frosting them, it would be impractical to put frosting into the liners before baking. Frosting would melt and mix with the batter, resulting in an unsuccessful final product. The ideal time to apply frosting is after the cupcakes have cooled down. This allows the frosting to stay intact and maintain its consistency, flavor, and visual appeal. 4. Consistency and texture: Frosting plays a vital role in giving cupcakes their characteristic moistness, richness, and sweetness. By placing frosting on top of a baked cupcake, you ensure the desired consistency and texture is retained. If frosting were to be mixed with the batter and baked together, it would lose its intended properties and cause the cupcakes to have an undesirable texture. 5. Final presentation: Cupcakes are known for their visually appealing and appetizing frosted tops. By using the more reasonable method, you can decorate cupcakes with a swirl of frosting, any desired toppings, and other decorative elements, offering an aesthetically pleasing final product. In conclusion, putting cupcake liners into each cell of a muffin tin, filling the liners with cupcake batter, baking until done, and then covering the top of each cupcake with frosting is the most reasonable method for making and decorating cupcakes to achieve the best taste and appearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The","completion":"first thing she did was to research the benefits of granite countertops and the various color options available. She discovered that granite is an extremely durable material that resists scratches, heat, and stains, making it a perfect choice for a high-traffic area like the kitchen. Additionally, granite is bacteria-resistant, which would make cleaning and maintaining the countertops much easier. Excited about the possibilities, Jane began searching for local suppliers that could offer her the best quality granite at a reasonable price. She compared several quotes from different companies and finally settled on one that offered a wide range of colors and finishes for her to choose from. To make sure she made the right decision, Jane also looked at reviews from previous customers and found that the supplier had a solid reputation for quality and craftsmanship. Before proceeding with the installation process, Jane had to carefully measure the dimensions of her kitchen counters to ensure a proper fit. She sketched a layout of her kitchen and noted where the sink, cooktop, and other appliances were located. Jane then discussed her preferences and requirements with the chosen supplier, who sent a technician to her home to take accurate measurements and double-check the layout. With all the measurements in hand, the supplier began cutting and fabricating the granite countertops according to Jane's specifications. During this time, Jane started preparing her kitchen for the installation. She removed all items from the counters, detached the sink and faucets, and cleared out space under the cabinets, making it easier for the installers to work. The entire process took a few days, as the fabricators had to carefully polish the edges of the granite slabs and create cutouts for the undermount sink and cooktop. When the granite countertops were ready, the installers arrived at Jane's home and began the process of removing the existing wood countertops. They carefully detached them from the cabinets and disposed of the old counters according to local regulations. Next, they leveled the cabinets to provide a stable, even surface for the new granite countertops. Installing the granite countertops required caution and precision, as the slabs were heavy and could potentially break if mishandled. The installers carefully maneuvered the slabs into place, making sure they aligned perfectly with the cabinets and walls. They secured the slabs with a combination of adhesive and brackets, ensuring that the countertops would remain in place for years to come. Once the granite countertops were in place, the installers reinstalled the sink, faucet, and cooktop, sealing the edges and seams between the granite and appliances to prevent water damage and create a watertight seal. After the job was completed, Jane marveled at her kitchen's transformation. The new granite countertops provided a sophisticated and modern look that brightened up the entire space. The diverse patterns and colors in the granite added depth and visual interest, making the countertops the focal point of her kitchen. Taking care of her new granite countertops would require a bit more maintenance than her previous wood counters but, Jane knew that the benefits and beauty of her new granite counters were well worth the effort. Following the supplier's recommendations, she sealed the countertops with a high-quality sealer which would preserve their appearance and protect them from potential stains, and regularly cleaned them with a gentle cleaner designed for natural stone surfaces. As time passed, Jane's investment in high-quality granite countertops continued to reward her with its durability, functionality, and undeniable elegance. Her kitchen was now not only a place for her to prepare delicious meals but also a space that showcased her personal style and refined taste."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tom (Billy Mauch) is the son of vicious criminal John Canty (Barton MacLane), while Edward VI (Bobby Mauch) is a prince and the heir of King Henry VIII of England (Montagu Love). One grows up in poverty, hungering for something better for himself and his family, the other in isolated luxury, with a strong curiosity about the outside world. When they are youngsters, they meet and are astounded by their striking resemblance to each other. As a prank, they exchange clothes, but the Captain of the Guard (Alan Hale, Sr.) mistakes the prince for the pauper and throws him out of the palace grounds. Tom is unable to convince anybody except for the Earl of Hertford (Claude Rains) of his identity. Everyone else is convinced that he is mentally ill. When Henry VIII dies, Hertford threatens to expose Tom unless he does as he is told. Hertford also blackmails the Captain into searching for the real prince to eliminate the dangerous loose end. Meanwhile, Edward finds an amused, if disbelieving protector in Miles Hendon (Errol Flynn). An attempt to assassinate the boy on the instigation of the Earl of Hertford, who fears for his power if the real king lives, changes Hendon's opinion of Edward's story. With Hendon's help, Edward manages to re-enter the palace just in time to interrupt the coronation ceremony and prove his identity.

There is a notable variety of agency types. Although usage differs, a government agency is normally distinct both from a department or ministry, and other types of public body established by government. The functions of an agency are normally executive in character, since different types of organizations (\\"such as commissions\\") are most often constituted in an advisory rolethis distinction is often blurred in practice however. - The Machinery of Government (sometimes MoG) means the interconnected structures and processes of government, such as the functions and accountability of departments in the executive branch of government.

Q:I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world.\\"?

A message thought to be from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri criticizes the ouster of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy and urges Muslims to stand together to prevent Egypt from being divided. The 14-minute audio message -- which purportedly is al-Zawahiri's second this week -- was posted to jihadist forums on Friday. CNN could not independently verify its authenticity. The language used in the last posting resembles that in other messages attributed to al-Zawahiri in which he criticizes the treatment from various parties of Morsy, the former Muslim Brotherhood leader who last year became Egypt's first democratically elected president. \\"The crusaders, the seculars, the Americanized army, (former President Hosni) Mubarak's thugs and some members of Islamic parties with the support of Gulf money and American plotting, all agreed to topple Mohamed Morsy's government,\\" he says.

Those behind Morsy's ouster, the message states, wanted a \\"secular, pro-American president to rule Egypt so they can continue with their plotting -- along with the Americans and Zionists -- to divide Egypt, just like what happened in Sudan.\\" The 62-year-old Al-Zawahiri is no stranger to Egypt or its politics.

In that message, the voice purportedly of al-Zawahiri denounced U.S. treatment of hunger-striking detainees at its Guantanamo Bay military prison and pledged to free them. He also urged Muslims -- as he and other al Qaeda leaders have many times before -- to unite and fight. \\"Every Muslim in every spot on Earth must work to defend the blood of Muslims that is being shed by America and its allies, and their sanctities that they are violating, and their villages and homes that they are destroying, and their wealth that they are stealing,\\" he said.

Sesli haber: Kosovalı Sırpların ikramiyeleri kesilecek Which language is this?","completion":"The language in your text, \\"Sesli haber: Kosovalı Sırpların ikramiyeleri kesilecek,\\" is Turkish. Turkish is a Turkic language spoken mainly in Turkey, Cyprus, and surrounding regions. It's one of the most prominent Turkic languages and is known for its distinctive characteristics like vowel harmony and agglutination. \\"Sesli haber\\" translates to \\"Voice news\\" or \\"Audio news\\" in English, depending on the context. \\"Kosovalı Sırpların ikramiyeleri kesilecek\\" translates to \\"The bonuses of the Serbs of Kosovo will be cut\\". Therefore, it seems like the sentence is a headline or a piece of news item about how the bonuses of Serbian people living in Kosovo are set to be cut. Turkish language is different from most Indo-European languages in that it is agglutinative and possesses a subject-object-verb word order. This means that instead of using prepositions, conjunctions, and auxiliary verbs that English and other Western languages typically use, Turkish prefers to stick grammatical markers onto the ends or beginnings of words. Moreover, Turkish utilizes vowel harmony which means that the vowels within a word need to be from the same class, enhancing the fluidity and consistency in the language. The Turkish alphabet is Latin-based, devised by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1928 as part of his initiatives to modernize Turkey. While the Turkish language might seem quite complex at first glance, due to its unexpected structure for those familiar with Indo-European languages, its consistency in applying grammatical rules and regular spelling actually make it a very logical language. Once learners understand the central logic revolving around the Turkish language, their fluency improves substantially."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He feels trapped in his career, always dreaming of doing something more meaningful with his life. During his time at the bar, he notices a mysterious man in a dark corner. This man is Samuel Morris, a reclusive writer who just moved to town, struggling to finish his soon-to-be groundbreaking novel. One night, after having a few drinks, Meyers approaches Morris out of curiosity and strikes up a conversation. The two men quickly form an unlikely friendship as they share stories and connect over their mutual love for cinema. Meyers, in particular, is astonished to find out that Morris had a brief but successful career as a screenwriter in the past. Over time, Meyers becomes increasingly intrigued by Morris's unfinished novel, which Morris describes as his magnum opus and the story he's always been destined to tell. However, as time goes on, Meyers notices that Morris is tormented by his past, specifically his estranged relationship with his daughter and the death of his wife. Seeing a chance to help his new friend and escape his mundane life as an accountant, Meyers proposes a challenge: finish the novel in 30 days, and they will pitch it together as a screenplay to a well-known film producer. Morris hesitantly agrees, seeing it as a possible way to reach out to his daughter, whom he knows is now a successful actress. As the 30 days progress, Meyers and Morris become inseparable. They help each other face their deepest fears and regrets, providing emotional support throughout the writing process. Upon finishing the novel, the two head to Hollywood to pitch their screenplay, but the journey is filled with obstacles, from a ruthless rival screenwriter to egotistical producers, and even a dash of dangerous intrigue. In a dramatic conclusion, Meyers and Morris successfully present their screenplay to a renowned film studio. However, it becomes clear that their friendship and growth throughout their journey was far more significant than the potential success of their screenplay. Ultimately, Morris is reunited with his daughter, and Meyers finds renewed purpose in his life, finally escaping the monotony of accounting. In the end, Meyers and Morris return to \\"The Rusty Anchor,\\" toasting to their newfound purpose in life and the unbreakable bond of their friendship forged in a bar where it all began."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health. \\"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it, they just cut me off,\\" he said, adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself.

Determine the sentiment: The film exposes the blatant exploitation of the Chinese worker - generally female - garnering footage from the Chinese business owner who shares his unashamed and delusional viewpoint, his American counterpart also as unashamed and delusional, the oppressed workers who are given a voice and, of course, the drunken Americans who wear the beaded necklaces mindlessly celebrating in New Orleans. The glimmer of hope comes when some Americans are actually outraged that people making their beaded necklaces were getting paid like 0.10 per hour to do so. You also have a feeling that the workers may have a chance to escape working in the bead factory, but will probably do so when they get fed up with the punishment treatment popular with the factory owner and/or they just get too exhausted to work up to 20 hours a day of hard labor. I have wondered where those necklaces came from, not realizing how completely grueling and arduous it would be to make them. I just truly appreciated this film as it beautifully portrays the impact American indulgence has over something we consider relatively innocuous in our society on peoples on the other side of the world. Honorable mention goes to Wal-Mart. It is simply amazing.

Tone: The tone of the text is mostly serious and somber with a hint of sarcasm. 2. Content: The text describes the exploitation of Chinese workers, the unashamed attitude of business owners, and the impact of American consumerism on these workers. It also mentions a glimmer of hope when some Americans show outrage about the unfair wages and the possibility of workers escaping the harsh conditions. 3. Emotions conveyed: The text shows empathy and concern for the exploited workers, disapproval of the business owners and drunken Americans, and appreciation for the film that sheds light on these issues. Overall, the sentiment of the text can be characterized as a mix of negative and positive emotions. The negative sentiment is mainly directed towards the exploitation of workers and the indifferent attitudes of business owners and consumers, while the positive sentiment emerges from the hope that change is possible and the commendation for the film exposing this issue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The two young leaders of the coup, Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang, both educated in Europe and influenced by Western ideas, came to dominate Thai politics in the ensuing years. Can we infer the following? Pibul was a young leader.","completion":"Yes, we can infer that Pibul was a young leader from the given information. The statement specifies that the coup was led by two young leaders, Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang. Both of them were educated in Europe and influenced by Western ideas, which consequently played a significant role in shaping their political views and leadership. Plaek Phibun Songgram, also known as Pibul, was a Thai military officer and political leader who played a crucial role in the development of modern Thailand. Born in 1897, he pursued higher education in France, where he studied the French language, civil and military law, and military strategy. His exposure to European culture and ideas further influenced his outlook and leadership ambitions. Pibul's co-leader, Pridi Phanomyang, was also a key figure in Thai politics. Born in 1900, Pridi was known for his intellectual prowess, progressive ideas, and interest in Western-style democracy. He studied law in France, where he developed strong connections with fellow Thai students and future political collaborators, including Pibul. Together, Pibul and Pridi played pivotal roles in the Siamese coup of 1932, which effectively ended the absolute monarchy in Thailand and introduced a constitutional monarchy system. Their partnership was marked by contrasting political styles, with Pibul leaning towards militarism and nationalism, while Pridi favored a more democratic and liberal approach to governance. Despite their differences, the two young leaders managed to steer Thailand through a period of intense political change and modernization. Their European education and exposure to Western ideas helped shape the nation's transformation during the 1930s and 1940s, while their youthfulness provided them with the energy and ambition required to challenge traditional power structures and introduce new political concepts. In conclusion, the information provided allows us to infer that Pibul was indeed a young leader during the time of the coup in Thailand, and his leadership, in partnership with Pridi Phanomyang, had a profound impact on the country's political landscape and its transition towards a more modern and progressive nation. Their Western education and shared experiences in Europe played an essential role in shaping their political outlook and the policies they would implement as leaders in Thailand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They both like meteorology. Barbara studies the formation of the ozone layer, while Jane studies about the stratosphere. and a hint : The mechanism describing the formation of the ozone layer was described by British mathematician Sydney Chapman in 1930. Molecular oxygen absorbs high energy sunlight in the UV-C region, at wavelengths shorter than about 240 nm. Radicals produced from the homolytically split oxygen molecules combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone. Ozone in turn is photolysed much more rapidly than molecular oxygen as it has a stronger absorption that occurs at longer wavelengths, where the solar emission is more intense. Ozone (O3) photolysis produces O and O2. The oxygen atom product combines with atmospheric molecular oxygen to reform O3, releasing heat. The rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heats the stratosphere resulting in a temperature inversion. This increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere; its resistance to vertical mixing means that it is stratified. Within the stratosphere temperatures increase with altitude (see temperature inversion); the top of the stratosphere has a temperature of about 270 K (−3°C or 26.6°F). This vertical stratification, with warmer layers above and cooler layers below, makes the stratosphere dynamically stable: there is no regular convection and associated turbulence in this part of the atmosphere. However, exceptionally energetic convection processes, such as volcanic eruption columns and overshooting tops in severe supercell thunderstorms, may carry convection into the stratosphere on a very local and temporary basis. Overall the attenuation of solar UV at wavelengths that damage DNA by the ozone layer allows life to exist on the surface of the planet outside of the ocean. All air entering the stratosphere must pass through the tropopause, the temperature minimum that divides the troposphere and stratosphere. The rising air is literally freeze dried; the stratosphere is a very dry place. The top of the stratosphere is called the stratopause, above which the temperature decreases with height. Please answer this question : Which student learned more about temperature inversion? Answer:","completion":"Jane learned more about temperature inversion. In the given information, it states that \\"The rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heats the stratosphere resulting in a temperature inversion.\\" and \\"This increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere\\". Since Jane studies the stratosphere, she would be more familiar with and have a better understanding of the temperature inversion phenomena. Barbara, on the other hand, focuses on the ozone layer formation, which doesn't specifically cover temperature inversion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A: Answer:","completion":"Temperature and pH level are the two main environmental factors that are important in the activity of an enzyme. Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They play a crucial role in various biological processes, including digestion, metabolism, and cellular respiration. To function optimally, enzymes require specific conditions in their environment, such as a particular temperature and pH level. The activity of an enzyme is highly sensitive to changes in temperature. Each enzyme has a specific temperature range within which it performs its function most efficiently. This optimal temperature usually corresponds to the temperature at which the organism lives or operates. For instance, human enzymes generally have an optimal temperature of around 37°C (98.6°F), which is the average body temperature. As the temperature moves further away from the optimal range, the enzyme's activity decreases. Extremely high or low temperatures can even cause enzymes to denature, meaning they lose their structure and functionality, thereby becoming inactive. In addition to temperature, pH level is another crucial environmental factor affecting enzyme activity. Similar to temperature, each enzyme has a specific pH range within which it performs optimally. This optimal pH level depends on the specific enzyme and the environment of its activity within the organism. For example, pepsin, an enzyme involved in digestion, works best within the acidic environment of the stomach, which has a pH level of around 1.5-3.0. On the other hand, trypsin, another digestive enzyme, functions best in the slightly alkaline environment of the small intestine, with a pH level of around 7.5-8.5. Changes in pH levels can disrupt the enzyme's structure, leading to reduced activity or denaturation. Hence, maintaining the appropriate pH level is critical for enzyme function. In summary, temperature and pH level are the two main environmental factors that significantly affect the activity of an enzyme. Both factors have specific optimal ranges for different enzymes, and maintaining these conditions is essential to ensure the proper functioning of enzymes in living organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The increase in the number of butterflies in the environment could lead to less caterpillar growth due to the following perturbation: indirectly impacting a step of the process. This can be explained in more detail as follows: When the number of butterflies in the environment increases, several factors can indirectly impact the growth and development of caterpillars. These factors include: 1. Availability of food: As the number of butterflies increases, the availability of food resources for caterpillars may decrease. Butterflies and caterpillars usually compete for the same food sources, such as leaves and plants. As a result, with more butterflies present, there might be fewer resources left for caterpillars to consume, leading to slower growth and potentially a reduction in caterpillar population. 2. Predation: An increase in the butterfly population can attract more predators, such as birds, spiders, and other insects, to the area. This may cause an increase in predation pressure on both butterflies and caterpillars. As the predators search for butterflies, they may also come across caterpillars, leading to a decrease in the caterpillar population. 3. Parasitism: Butterflies and caterpillars can be hosts to various parasites, such as parasitic wasps and flies. An increased butterfly population may attract more parasites to the area, which may cause a higher number of infections in both butterfly and caterpillar populations. This can lead to a decrease in caterpillar growth and overall population. 4. Changes in the ecosystem: The increased butterfly population can also cause changes in the ecosystem that indirectly affect caterpillar growth. For example, a large number of butterflies feeding on a particular type of plant can cause an imbalance in the plant population, leading to less food for caterpillars. Moreover, this can cause other species in the ecosystem to respond differently, which can indirectly impact the availability of resources and habitat for caterpillars. 5. Competition: With more butterflies in the environment, there might be an increase in competition for shelter, food, and mates among both butterflies and caterpillars. This competition can lead to reduced growth and survival rates for caterpillars, possibly resulting in a decreased caterpillar population. In conclusion, the perturbation of the increased butterfly population in the environment indirectly impacts a step of the process. This can lead to less caterpillar growth due to factors such as competition for food, availability of resources, predation, parasitism, and changes in the ecosystem. These indirect impacts may lead to a decrease in the caterpillar population, which highlights the complex and interconnected nature of ecological relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. When do people use broad brushstrokes according to the author?

Article: Correction: Earlier versions of this article included a credit line that incorrectly said that reporter Michael Birnbaum contributed from Manama.Also, this article cited the fact that the State Department has not recalled its ambassador as evidence of the Obama administration’s muted objections to Bahrain’s actions. The United States has not recalled any top diplomats because of the crackdown, but it currently has no ambassador in Bahrain; the last ambassador returned to the United States in January to take up a post at the State Department. Two months after the eruption of mass protests in Bahrain, the kingdom has largely silenced the opposition, jailing hundreds of activists in a crackdown that has left the Obama administration vulnerable to charges that it is upholding democratic values in the Middle East selectively. Bahrain’s monarchy, since calling in Saudi troops last month to help crush the protest movement, has been quietly dismantling the country’s Shiite-led opposition. On Friday, the Sunni government announced an investigation into the activities of Bahrain’s largest political party, the Shiite-dominated al-Wefaq, which could lead to its ban. The Obama administration has repeatedly appealed to the Bahraini government for restraint, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton this week called for a political process that “advances the rights and aspirations of all the citizens of Bahrain.” But the administration has neither recalled its ambassador to Manama nor threatened the kinds of sanctions it imposed on Libya — a striking disparity that is fueling ­anti-U.S. sentiment among Bahraini opposition groups. “Even though the American administration’s words are all about freedom and democracy and change, in Bahrain, the reality is that they’re basically a protection for the dictatorship,” said Zainab al-Khawaja, a prominent human-rights activist who began a hunger strike after her father, husband and brother-in-law were arrested at her apartment over the weekend. U.S. officials privately acknowledge that the administration has been understated in its criticism of Bahrain, in part to avoid further strain in relations with Saudi Arabia, a vital U.S. ally and neighbor to the tiny island kingdom. The Saudis, fearing the rise of a pro-Iranian Shiite state on its eastern frontier, urged Bahrain to deal firmly with the throng of protesters that occupied a central square and blocked access to Manama’s main business district. A month later, however, with Bahrain’s iron first tightening further, the White House is facing awkward questions from political allies as well as foes. A perceived U.S. double standard on Middle East democracy — a problem since the Arab spring movement began three months ago — could become more acute if Washington is seen to ignore widespread abuses, according to current and former diplomats and regional experts. “We need to worry about the human-rights situation deteriorating there,” said Joel Rubin, a former Middle East specialist for the State Department and deputy director of the National Security Network, a Democratic-leaning foreign policy think tank. “It has a real impact on perceptions of American policy in the region.” U.S. officials defend the administration’s ad hoc approach to Middle East democracy movements as prudent, saying each country requires a unique balancing of democratic ideals and compelling security interests. “We don’t make decisions about questions like intervention based on consistency or precedent,” Denis R. McDonough, Obama’s deputy national security adviser, said recently in explaining why U.S. policy on Libya differs from that on Bahrain. “We make them based on how we can best advance our interests in the region.” In the case of Bahrain, the United States has key military interests. The kingdom is home to the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet; it is also seen as a strategically important bulwark against Iranian power in the region. But even more vital is the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia, a critical ally in the Middle East for half a century. Saudi Arabia and the United States have fundamentally different views of what is happening in Bahrain, why it is happening and who is responsible for it. Saudi officials deny that Bahrain has cracked down on legitimate demonstrators, insisting that action has been taken only against radicals seeking to provoke the government. A senior U.S. official held the opposite view, saying: “The crackdown is a fact.” Administration officials accept that Bahrain is the Saudi “back yard,” a point emphasized by a member of the Saudi legislative council, Majlis al-Shura, during a visit to Washington last week. “Bahrain is our Cuba,” said the official, who spoke at a forum organized by the New America Foundation. “We don’t believe the uprising is real,” said another shura member. Most of Bahrain’s Shiites “are happy; a small minority is causing the problem,” he said. “Maybe some are oppressed, but 1 percent is causing the trouble.” Whatever the makeup of the protest movement, the intensity of the crackdown stunned Bahraini opposition leaders as well as many Middle East experts, who are dismayed by the dismantling of reforms that had cemented the island’s reputation as progressive and Western-friendly. Until the crackdown on March 14, many of the thousands of protesters who jammed the capital’s Pearl Square were confident that the movement sweeping the region would bring new political freedoms and economic equality for the country’s majority Shiite population. “Only a month ago, we had a feeling of change and respect for democracy and human rights. Now we feel as though we are all in a big prison,” said Mohammed al-Maskati, president of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights. “They want to attack everyone who was involved in the protests.” In addition to jailing activists and banning Shiite-led opposition parties, Bahraini authorities fired civil servants and even professional athletes who participated in demonstrations. The country’s only independent newspaper was taken over last week and its editor forced to resign. And on Monday, the New York-based Human Rights Watch alleged that at least three opposition figures had died in Bahraini prisons under suspicious circumstances. While Bahraini authorities attributed the deaths to natural causes, Human Rights Watch said in a report that one of the victims’ bodies bore “signs of horrific abuse.” Some government opponents accuse the United States of failing to put enough pressure on Bahrain and the neighboring Persian Gulf kingdoms that supported the crackdown. One prominent human rights activist described Bahraini protesters as “very, very disappointed” by the mild American response. Clinton defended the U.S. role in a speech this week at a meeting of the U.S.-Islamic World Forum, insisting that the United States’ “core interests and values have not changed, including our commitment to promote human rights.” But Clinton cited other goals, including the defeat of terrorism and the containment of Iran, as “mutual interests.” “We know that a one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t make sense in such a diverse region at such a fluid time,” she said. Clinton mentioned Bahrain only briefly, hailing what she called a “decades-long friendship with Bahrain that we expect to continue long into the future.” But, referring to the recent crackdown, she added that “violence is not and cannot be the answer.” “We have raised our concerns about the current measures directly with Bahraini officials and will continue to do so,” Clinton said. Birnbaum reported from Berlin. Staff writer Karen DeYoung in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| When thousands of protesters spilled into Bahrain's streets in February, Dr. Mohammed Al-Muharraqi, a self-professed pessimist, thought his country might change for the better.Though most of the demonstrators gathering in the capital's Pearl Square roundabout were Shiite Muslims and he is a Sunni Muslim, Muharraqi was excited to hear them voice hopes he'd long shared.\\"When it started, we found it really, really cool,\\" Muharraqi said. \\"They wanted a more equal distribution of wealth, less unemployment, more parliamentary power. If those were the things the protests were about, then we felt, 'Go, roundabout!'\\"For an exhilarating moment, the protests united many Bahrainis.One of them was a young Shiite professional who had been apolitical all his life, and who was inspired to become an opposition blogger. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said he became convinced that the protest movement's peaceful tactics could bring change to Bahrain's monarchy.Another was Kefaya Almubarak, a social worker and mother of three, who saw a future with better jobs and pay.Now, their hopes have been dashed. The fate of authoritarian regimes in Libya and Yemen is still unclear, but in Bahrain, a key U.S. ally, the state has won, and life is worse for most people than it was before the heady early days in Pearl Square.The uprising deepened the divide between the majority Shiites and minority Sunnis in this Persian Gulf island-state.Many Sunnis, aligned with the government, welcome what they say is the restoration of law and order. Shiites inhabit an entirely different reality: a police state where checkpoints limit movement, the wounded avoid hospitals for fear of arrest and people simply disappear, with the unlucky ones turning up at the morgue.Only a clear sense of loss — loss of loved ones, of economic security, of easy coexistence — seems to unite Bahrainis today.\\"Before, we were talking about change,\\" the opposition blogger said. \\"But now, we just want the bleeding to stop.\\"At the end of a long day, Muharraqi needed a smoke at his favorite outdoor hookah cafe. His credentials at the island's main military hospital allowed him to get through the checkpoints that spring up after curfew so he could enjoy a night out. As he sipped juice and puffed on the hookah, he described his early excitement about the uprising, and his eventual disillusionment.After 20 years in Britain, Muharraqi said, he had returned to Bahrain hoping for a quiet life practicing plastic surgery and administering Botox shots.When the protests began Feb. 14, people asked for better economic opportunities, a constitutional monarchy and an end to discrimination against Shiites. Three days later, just before dawn, government forces with guns and tear gas raided Pearl Square , killing at least seven people.Soon afterward, Bahrain's more radical parties, which seek an end to the monarchy, began setting the agenda for the opposition.Sunni sympathy for the protest movement began to evaporate when some demonstrators last month tried to enter the Sunni area of Riffa to protest at the royal family's residences. Sunnis were further alienated, Muharraqi said, when protesters barricaded the financial district, disrupting the economy.\\"I felt the movement had grown horns and fangs and claws,\\" Muharraqi said. \\"I felt stuck in the middle. I didn't want a change in government; it hadn't done anything to me.\\"His anger intensified after a wounded man was brought into the emergency room at the military hospital. A YouTube video shows the man being run over twice by an SUV and then kicked and beaten with sticks. But the blurry video is subject to divergent interpretations.According to the government, the victim was a policeman and his assailants were protesters. According to the opposition, the man was a civilian and the attackers state security agents. The man died of his injuries. |||||Summary:","completion":"The Bahraini government has largely silenced the opposition, jailing hundreds of activists and dismantling the country’s Shiite-led opposition.

Gaffe-prone Vice President Joe Biden has learned a thing or two during his 64 months in the Obama administration, including the need to avoid broadcasting F-bombs like the one he let loose on Mar 23, 2010. That was the day the president triumphantly announced the signing of the Affordable Care Act. But Biden unwittingly stole the spotlight by introducing Obama, embracing him and saying – loudly enough for the podium microphone to capture it – 'This is a big f***ing deal.' '[A] piece of advice about that \\"BFD\\" stuff:. Assume every microphone is on,' Biden told a crowd gathered on Monday at the starting line of the annual Ride 2 Recovery Memorial Challenge, a cycling event that raises money for wounded-veterans charities. Scroll down for video of the infamous moment. I didn't mean it: Biden insisted he never intentionally called the Obamacare signing 'a big f***ing deal,' but his words looking intentional on network video feeds. Gaffer-in-chief: Biden's famous moments have included asking a wheelchair-bound local politician to stand up and acknowledge applause,and saying of the 2009 federal stimulus that there was 'a 30% chance we're going to get it wrong' Riders travel 325 miles from Washington, D.C. to Virginia Beach every year on Memorial Day for the event. 'I just want. you to know, I didn't intentionally say that,' he added, according to CNN. 'I actually turned and I said, \\"Mr. President,\\" and I whispered in his ear. Unfortunately, I was looking in the direction of one guy who could actually read lips — not a joke. Because no one picked it up at the time and one of the reporters read lips.' 'Thank God my mother was. gone or I'd have been one dead vice president.' His words, however, were clearly audible and went out on every broadcast network covering the event. The Associated Press reported at the time that 'Biden appeared to be offering that perspective to Obama privately.' Moments later, then-White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs tweeted, 'And yes, Mr. Vice President, you're right.' A Ride 2 Recovery coordinator who introduced Biden playfully warned the crowd that 'for those of you who don't know, Joe is famous for some of his one liners.' 'There was a bill signing at the White House ... and he said it was a \\"big f-ing deal.\\" And that was a quote ... If I may say, sir, Ride to Recovery is a big f-ing deal.' The introduction also included the prediction. that 'at some point in the future Joe is going to run for president. again.' In response, Biden was seen making a dramatic sign of the cross on his body. Biden's mouth often out-runs his brain, as he proved in 2010 with an open microphone and an F-bomb. Goofball: Biden mugged for a camera with Obama to launch his Instagram account, but was better-known for saying that in his home state of Delaware, 'you cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.' The vice president, who is mulling a White House run in 2016, also mentioned the controversy swirling around the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which is accused of using phony off-the-books waiting lists to mask its failure to provide timely health care to battle-tested servicemen and women. 'That is a sacred obligation, and we’re behind right now,' the he conceded. 'The VA is having problems, and we’ve got to get to the bottom of it.' 'This is a long-term commitment this nation has to make,' Biden said, 'so it seems to me on this day we as Americans have to recommit ourselves not just with words but with deeds.'

McCain settling in as Republican Party leader McCain settling in as Republican Party leader By Liz Sidoti, Associated Press WASHINGTON  John McCain, a longtime Republican Party agitator, is easing into the role of its newfound leader. He has met abroad with world leaders, intensified fundraising and taken control of the party apparatus. He is thinking about running mates and is introducing himself to the country. He's also made a few missteps and watched a challenging political terrain that favors Democrats grow more troublesome for the GOP. \\"We're making the kind of progress I think needs to be made,\\" the senator from Arizona said this week, expressing confidence — despite the private concerns of some Republicans — that his team is embracing the opportunity afforded him as Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama continue to spar for the Democratic nod. \\"We've done a pretty good job of unifying our party. Now we've got to energize our party.\\" In the month since he clinched the GOP nomination and his White House campaign entered a new phase, McCain has moved forward on all fronts — from message to mechanics — to position himself for November's general election. His first stretch as the GOP's nominee-in-waiting, however, has not been without hiccups. McCain faced fallout from an endorsement by a televangelist who has made anti-Catholic comments and confronted questions about his ties to lobbyists. He invited criticism with a speech that derided aggressive federal intervention in the housing crisis but offered no immediate relief for homeowners threatened with foreclosure. And, he mistakenly said Iran was allowing al-Qaeda fighters into its country to be trained and returned to Iraq. At the same time, the landscape became more problematic for Republicans. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said this week for the first time that a recession is possible, and the government rescued investment house Bear Stearns from collapse as the housing and credit crises continue to roil Wall Street. The Iraq war entered its sixth year and U.S. troop deaths topped 4,000 amid renewed violence in the southern Shiite region and the shelling of the U.S.-controlled Green Zone in Baghdad. In spite of the hurdles, McCain said: \\"I'm glad to be where we are. We're going to keep working hard.\\" Polls show McCain would be in strong contention with either Clinton or Obama in a head-to-head matchup. Nonetheless, Democratic loyalists appear far more enthusiastic — and willing to donate — than the GOP rank-and-file, while President Bush's support remains low and most people say the country is on the wrong track amid the unpopular Iraq war and fragile economy. Still, McCain has had the luxury of focusing on the general election while his Democratic rivals remain embroiled in a tight contest. Each Democrat props up McCain daily, assailing him in hopes of appearing to be the strongest one to take him on in November. \\"John McCain wants to continue the war in Iraq. I want to end it,\\" Obama said this week. And, Clinton launched an ad in Pennsylvania that claims \\"John McCain just said the government shouldn't take any real action on the housing crisis, he'd let the phone keep ringing.\\" As Democrats bicker, McCain has focused on these areas: •Money: Fundraising is arguably his biggest weakness and, thus, highest priority. He raised only 11 million in February to a combined 80 million for Clinton and Obama, and has been slow to sign up many of Bush's big donors. Obama reported raising 40 million in March; Clinton said she raised 20 million. McCain is likely to surpass his February total but still trail his rivals. He held dozens of fundraisers last month and set up joint fundraising accounts with the Republican National Committee to encourage donations. •Unity: Trying to heal wounds from a divisive GOP primary was a high priority for a candidate who has spent decades bucking the party on issues that resonate with conservatives. In hopes of getting critics to swing behind him, McCain appeared with Bush in the White House Rose Garden and received Nancy Reagan's endorsement. He also campaigned with former GOP rival Mitt Romney to show solidarity. •Message: Speaking to a broader electorate, McCain, a former Navy pilot held prisoner during the Vietnam War, has cast himself as an experienced wartime commander in chief and statesman with his own vision, despite Democratic efforts to paint him as a Bush clone. McCain visited the Middle East, including Iraq, and Europe, where he met with allies. Stateside, he embarked on a week-long biographical tour and began an ad campaign. •Structure: McCain has dispatched four high-level allies to the RNC — Frank Donatelli, Lew Eisenberg, Carly Fiorina and Mike DuHaime — to meld its fundraising, get-out-the-vote and party-building operations with his own growing organization. His northern Virginia headquarters has hired more staffers and is creating offices in 10 regions of the country to decentralize the campaign. •Vice President: McCain has a list of some 20 names from which he could choose a running mate and says he's in the \\"embryonic stages\\" of selecting someone. Aides say little to no significant vetting has occurred. The goal is to select someone before the nominating convention in early September, and McCain says he's mindful of the enhanced importance of the task because of his age. He is 71 and would be the oldest president elected. Copyright 2008 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

(Source) As she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity. But the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not. So this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her. But my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict. If the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them. But the person who just fakes that he is in need, we should be strict/ignore them, else they will not do any work, and just simply rely on us. Sometimes, being strict and giving up humanity will make the person grow. According to the above context, answer the following question. The author probably believes that OPTIONS: [a].

Kiedis was lyrically influenced by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love. Songs written for the album such as \\"By the Way,\\" \\"I Could Die for You,\\" \\"Dosed,\\" \\"Warm Tape\\" and non-album tracks \\"Someone\\" and \\"Body of Water\\" all digressed into the many sides of love. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he'd only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like \\"This Is the Place\\" and \\"Don't Forget Me\\" expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug-dependency). He referenced early Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in \\"This Is the Place\\" and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: \\"On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean.\\" \\"Venice Queen\\" was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California's Venice Beach. It mourned her death as a painful loss: \\"We all want to tell her/Tell her that we love her/Venice gets a queen/Best I've ever seen.\\" By the Way diverged from the band's previous styles, containing few funk-driven songs. \\"Can't Stop\\" and the title track were the only songs which revisited the Chili Peppers' once trademark style of short, rapped verses. \\"Throw Away Your Television,\\" while not having any rapidly sung lyrics, also contained a funk-oriented bass line, though hinted at experimental rock due to the heavy use of distortion throughout the verse and chorus. Other \\"experimental\\" tracks include the melodica-based \\"On Mercury.\\" \\"Cabron,\\" the only track to be played entirely on acoustic guitar, has distinctive Latin influences. \\"Tear\\" and \\"Warm Tape\\" were keyboard based more so than guitar or bass, the latter being completely written on the instrument.

Some states require that you belong to certain professions, such as law, accounting, medicine, engineering, or architecture. However, other states, such as New York, define \\"professional services\\" a little more broadly. Therefore, it is crucial to check your state's specific definition of \\"professional services\\" to determine whether your occupation qualifies for the formation of a PLLC. In addition to verifying your eligibility, it will also be vital to explore the benefits and obligations associated with forming a PLLC. Some common advantages of a PLLC include limited liability protection, which safeguards an individual's personal assets from the company's debts and liabilities, and potential tax advantages. On the other hand, associated obligations may include annual filings, taxes, and potential fees to maintain the entity's active status. Once you have familiarized yourself with your state's requirements and the nuances of a PLLC, you may begin compiling the necessary documentation for the registration process. Typically, this will involve drafting an Articles of Organization document, which outlines key information about your PLLC, such as its name, purpose, and members' names. Additionally, some states mandate the adoption of an operating agreement, which is an internal document detailing how the PLLC will be run and governed. When your paperwork is ready, submit your completed forms, along with the required filing fee, to your state's relevant regulatory agency. The processing time for PLLC registration may vary from state to state; however, once approved, your PLLC will officially be recognized as a legal business entity. As you commence operations, it would also be prudent to seek the advice of an attorney or a qualified business professional to ensure your PLLC remains compliant with all pertinent regulations moving forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many of them have tried very hard at school but have failed in the exams and have their parents lose hopes.

It is surprising that though most Japanese parents are worried about their children, they do not help them in any ways .Many parents feel that they are not able to help their children and it is the teachers' work to help their children. To make matter worse, a lot of parents send their children to those school opening in the evenings and on weekends-- they only help students to pass exams and never teach students any real sense of the world. It is a great surprise that almost three quarters of middle school students have been to such kind of schools. Many Japanese schools usually have rules about everything from the students' hair to their clothes and the things in their bags. Child psychologists now think that such strict rules are harmful to the feelings of the students. Almost 40% of the students said that no one had taught them how to get on with others, how to tell right from wrong, how to show love for others, even for their parents.

Needless to say the latter proves to be very popular though the former is enjoyed by many real tennis fans.

Answer: OPT: (I). No (II). Yes Answer:","completion":"Based on the given review, the user would likely not recommend this product. The user initially commented on the positive aspect of the product, stating that it looks good and stable. However, the user then proceeded to share their negative experiences with the product. Firstly, the user mentioned that they experienced water leakage from the drain during the first time use. This indicates that the product may have design or manufacturing issues, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction. Additionally, the user stated that after several uses, the product stopped working. A product that fails to function properly after a short period can be frustrating for the customer, and significantly impact their opinion of the product. The user also stated that it took 7 months for the product to completely fail, which further supports the conclusion that the user would not recommend this product. A good quality product is expected to last much longer than this time frame, leading one to believe that the user is unhappy with the product's durability. Regarding the user's question about using distilled water – it may or may not be related to the problem. Usage of distilled water is typically a good practice when using products that involve water, as it minimizes the risk of mineral buildup and potential damage. Therefore, it is unlikely that using distilled water would cause the issues experienced by the user. Hence, it would be safe to say that the problem lies with the product itself. In conclusion, based on the user's negative experiences, the water leakage, the product's failure within a relatively short period, and the fact that distilled water usage should not have contributed to these issues, it is highly likely that the user would not recommend this product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

These glasses work with a see-through display called a 'pupil division optical system' and can display information such as emails from a smartphone linked via Bluetooth. Apple and Google have also been investigating similar technology. The prototype of Olympus's glasses includes built-in GPS and an accelerometer, which can deliver mapping information directly to the device's 320x240 display.

Help as much as you can. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: With smart phones taking the world by Storm, a phone that can only send and receive voice calls and text messages may seem like a relic from a bygone age. Yet in East Africa,simple phones like these are changing the face of the economy, thanks to the mobile money services that are spreading across the region. Using the text-messaging function built into the GSM system used by most cell phone networks, these services allow people without a bank account or credit card to use their phone as an electronic wallet that can be used to store. send or receive cash. It works like this: you pay cash to your local agent who then tops up your mobile money account using a secure form of text messaging. That money can be transferred to another person by sending a message to their cell phone account. For some the system is a lifeline. \\"If I didn't have my mobile phone. I would be very poor, \\"says Neyasse Neemur, a mother of four children who lives in northern Kenya. \\"Now I can sell fish.\\" Neemur took up fishing in July last year, but making money from it was a little tricky, especially as Turkana people do not usually eat fish. A truck from Ethiopia to Tanzania passes through her village once a week, and she arranged to have the driver transport the fish several hundred kilometres south to market in Kisumu, where her s sell the fish. \\"I get the money transfer immediately.\\" says Neemur. \\"Then I can pay for my children to go to school and for vegetables and beans,\\" she adds, \\"so I don't need to eat fish.\\" According to the Central Bank of Kenya, payments worth around l billion Kenyan shillings(13 million)per day were transferred through Kenya's mobile money systems in 2009, equaling the country's credit card transactions . The bank expects mobile money transfers to overtake credit cards in 2011. Question: What can we learn about the simple phones in East Africa?

You may feel too sad or tired to eat right, sleep well, and exercise, but all of these things will help you to recover as quickly as possible. Things like exercise will also give your brain the extra positivity it needs to get through this rough patch, since it produces the happiness chemical serotonin. Enlist the help of friends if you're having a hard time with self-care. Make dinner with people you're close to or go to the gym with someone who is into exercising consistently. Distracting yourself from your pain may seem like a good idea in the moment, but it will only increase the amount of time it takes you to process the breakup. This can make it more difficult not to bring your residual feelings into new relationships and other areas of your life. Talking it out with a friend can give you a good way of reflecting on your feelings. Make sure it's someone you trust to be sensitive with your emotions and really listen to what you are saying. Avoid using alcohol or other substances to keep your feelings away. In the long run this will only hurt you. Focus on the positive aspects of the breakup. Writing will help you organize your thoughts and begin to process all of the difficult emotions that go along with a breakup. Specifically writing about what went right in the breakup is better for you than just venting. Was he honest and straightforward when he told you he was into someone else? Did he let you know what was going on before it got serious with the new person? It's important to give yourself time to heal. Straining yourself too hard, like jumping straight into a new relationship, overworking yourself, or just pushing yourself to move on can make the situation worse. Emotional injuries, like physical injuries, require time to fully heal. Give yourself the space to rest and recover. Don't be afraid to say no if friends want you to go out and you don't feel like it. True friends will understand that you need time before you can return to your normal way of being. It's easy in our culture to buy into the idea of there being only one person for you, but in reality there are a lot of people in the world that you are compatible with. Avoid telling yourself stories about how this person was the only one for you, or that you'll never find anyone like him. In all likelihood you will find someone else, and he might be even better than this guy. You may eventually find an amazing fit with someone, but when that happens then neither of you will want to break up.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of self-care in the aftermath of a romantic breakup, as it helps in the recovery process. It advises maintaining a healthy lifestyle through proper eating, sleeping, and exercising, which can boost positivity by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. Seeking support from friends and engaging in self-care activities with them can be helpful. Distracting oneself from the pain may seem appealing, but it can prolong the healing process, making it difficult to move on and maintain healthy future relationships. Instead, the article suggests talking to a trusted friend who will be sensitive and listen to one's emotions. It discourages resorting to alcohol or other substances as a coping mechanism, as it can cause long-term harm. Focusing on the positive aspects of the breakup, such as honesty and communication, can prove beneficial. Writing about these aspects can help process emotions and can be more effective than merely venting. The article cautions against rushing into new relationships or pushing oneself too hard, as emotional injuries require time to heal, just like physical injuries. Allowing oneself space to rest and recover is essential, and it's important to prioritize one's well-being, even if it means declining social invitations from friends. Lastly, the article addresses the widely-held belief that each individual has only one perfect match. Instead, it reassures readers that there are likely many people with whom they may be compatible. It encourages individuals to avoid focusing on the belief that their former partner was the only one for them or that they won't find a better match.

Do these mean the same? He played only one appearance in 2012 and then debuted 4 times the following year . He debuted in 2012 making only 1 appearance and then played 4 times the following year .","completion":"While both sentences convey similar ideas regarding the individual's participation in the game, they do not mean exactly the same thing. Let's analyze them separately: 1. Sentence 1: \\"He played only one appearance in 2012 and then debuted 4 times the following year.\\" This sentence suggests that the individual played in 2012 with only one appearance (referring to just one game or match). However, the use of the term \\"debuted\\" in the latter part of the sentence, \\"debuted 4 times the following year,\\" is not accurate since a debut implies a first appearance or introduction. A player can only debut once, and the repetition mentioned in this sentence does not make sense in this context. 2. Sentence 2: \\"He debuted in 2012 making only 1 appearance and then played 4 times the following year.\\" This sentence is more coherent and clear. It explains that the individual debuted, or made their first appearance, in 2012, participating in only one game or match. The sentence then goes on to provide information about the following year, stating that the individual played four times. The use of \\"played\\" instead of \\"debuted\\" in the second half of the sentence is more appropriate in this context. In conclusion, while both sentences discuss the individual's participation over two years, they are not identical in meaning. The first sentence contains an improper use of the term \\"debuted,\\" while the second sentence is clearer and accurately describes the individual's participation in 2012 and the year that followed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the first name of the person who has released his most personal album to date? Answer the above question based on the context below: Youssou N'Dour: I Bring What I Love is a music-driven film that explores one man's power to inspire global change. The film unfolds at a pivotal moment in the life of Youssou N'Dour—the best-selling African pop artist of all time. N'Dour has long been renowned for bringing people of diverse nations and backgrounds together through his collaborations with such musical superstars as Bono, Paul Simon, and Peter Gabriel. But when he releases his most personal and spiritual album yet, he instead alienates his Muslim fans in Africa. Although he garners accolades in the West, N'Dour must brave controversy and rejection at home as he sets out to win his audience back. Director Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi tracks N'Dour's journey over two years – filming his life in Africa, Europe, and America. He initially releases his album Egypt in the hopes of promoting a more tolerant face of Islam. Yet, when his fellow Senegalese reject the album, and denounce it as blasphemous, he takes this as a challenge to go deeper, to reach out to those who would attack him, and to work even harder to use his songs to unite a divided world. The resulting portrait is not just of a musician, but also that of a world in which pop culture now has equal power to incite fury and invite new connections.

Ahmed Kathrada, who was jailed alongside Nelson Mandela, said that Mr Zuma's resignation would end a \\"crisis of confidence\\" in the government. Mr Zuma said on Friday he would repay the money but would remain in his post. He has faced widespread calls for his resignation from South Africa's opposition. South Africa's highest court ruled that Mr Zuma had failed to uphold the constitution by ignoring instructions to repay some of the 16m in state funds spent on renovations at his private residence. In a televised address on Friday, Mr Zuma made no reference to the calls for his resignation. Can Zuma survive after apology? The leadership of Mr Zuma's party, the African National Congress, said it was united behind its leader, but the intervention of 86-year-old Mr Kathrada, a party veteran, may carry weight. Along with Mr Mandela, Mr Kathrada was among eight ANC activists sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of trying to overthrow the apartheid government during the 1963-1964 Rivonia Trial. In an open letter published in South African media, Mr Kathrada said: \\"In the face of such persistently widespread criticism, condemnation and demand, is it asking too much to express the hope that you will choose the correct way that is gaining momentum, to consider stepping down? \\"I know that if I were in the president's shoes, I would step down with immediate effect.\\" The scandal is arguably the biggest yet to hit Mr Zuma, who has fended off accusations of corruption and cronyism since before he took office in 2009. The public protector, an anti-corruption body, ruled in 2014 that 23m of public money had been improperly spent on Mr Zuma's rural home in Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal province, and ordered him to reimburse part of the expense. South African papers are abuzz with reactions to President Jacob Zuma's apology for improper spending on his rural home, and speculation about what he will do next. The Johannesburg Star's Janet Smith says Mr Zuma must be observing events in Brazil , where there are growing calls for the resignation of President Dilma Rousseff over corruption charges. The Sowetan's report about Mr Zuma's apology is overshadowed by the ongoing saga involving the president and the Indian-born Gupta family, which has allegedly been allowed undue influence. The paper's front-page comment yesterday was headlined \\"It's official: he's a failed president\\" In the Mail and Guardian, Carien du Plessis foresees difficulties for the ruling ANC if Mr Zuma were to resign, saying: \\"In a party split down the middle in more or less equal factions... things are more likely to fall apart.\\" Business Day's reports about the apology includes opposition Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane's description of it as an insult, and ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe's efforts to discourage calls for the president to step down. The president claimed he had acted \\"in good faith\\" and \\"never knowingly and deliberately set out to violate the constitution\\". \\"Any action that has been found not to be in keeping with the constitution happened because of a different approach and different legal advice,\\" he said, before issuing an apology for the \\"frustration\\" caused. The case had been brought by two opposition parties, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the Democratic Alliance (DA). They have launched impeachment proceedings against Mr Zuma, but these are unlikely to be successful because of the ANC's large majority in parliament.

And I want everybody to have the right and opportunity to improve their country,\\" he told reporters after an appearance announcing his candidacy on NBC's \\"Meet the Press.\\" Asked why he should be president, the longtime consumer advocate said, \\"Because I got things done.\\" He cited a 40-year record, which he said includes saving \\"millions of lives,\\" bringing about stricter protection for food and water and fighting corporate control over Washington. Calling Nader's move \\"very unfortunate,\\" Sen.","completion":"Dianne Feinstein expressed concern that Nader's candidacy could potentially draw votes away from the Democratic nominee and unintentionally bolster support for the Republican candidate. \\"Ralph Nader has a long history as an advocate, but this isn't the time for a third-party candidate to potentially divide the progressive vote,\\" she told CNN in a statement. Despite these concerns, Nader remained steadfast in his decision to run and quickly began forming his campaign team. He announced a platform that emphasized campaign finance reform, environmental protection, universal healthcare, and workers' rights, attracting a significant following among progressive voters who felt frustrated with the political establishment. The two major party nominees, Democratic candidate John Smith and Republican candidate Jane Doe, both acknowledged Nader's entry into the race and vowed to focus on engaging voters and outlining their policy proposals, rather than worrying about the impact of his candidacy. As the election season progressed, Nader's campaign continued to gain momentum – particularly in several key battleground states. Pundits debated the influence of Nader's campaign on the race, with some arguing that he was providing a necessary voice for disaffected voters and others asserting that he was damaging the chances of the Democratic nominee. In the end, the election proved to be one of the closest in US history. Some analysts theorized that Nader's presence in the race had played a role in dividing voter support among progressives, ultimately giving the Republican candidate a narrow advantage in several crucial states. In the aftermath of the election, Nader defended his decision to run, pointing out that his campaign had brought national attention to important issues such as corporate influence in politics and the need for significant environmental reforms. Despite the outcome, he vowed to continue his work as an advocate for the public and as a force for political change in the United States. The election's results fueled ongoing conversations about the role of third-party candidates in the American political system. The increased visibility of Nader's campaign and its impact on the race sparked renewed discussions about the importance of alternative voices in politics and the merits of potentially overhauling the nation's electoral process to accommodate them. Though Ralph Nader did not achieve his goal of becoming president, his campaign left a lasting impact on the American political landscape and served as a catalyst for further debate on the role of third-party and independent candidates in shaping the future of the nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Hamburg, Jarrah had a succession of living accommodations, but he apparently never resided with his future co-conspirators. It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-American discussions. Meeting three to four times a week, the group became something of a \\"sect\\" whose members, according to one participant in the meetings, tended to deal only with each other. Atta's rent checks for the apartment provide evidence of the importance that the apartment assumed as a center for the group, as he would write on them the notation \\"Dar el Ansar,\\" or \\"house of the followers.\\" In addition to Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah, the group included other extremists, some of whom also would attend al Qaeda training camps and, in some instances, would help the 9/11 hijackers as they executed the plot: Said Bahaji, son of a Moroccan immigrant, was the only German citizen in the group. Educated in Morocco, Bahaji returned to Germany to study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. He spent five months in the German army before obtaining a medical discharge, and lived with Atta and Binalshibh at 54 Marienstrasse for eight months between November 1998 and July 1999. Described as an insecure follower with no personality and with limited knowledge of Islam, Bahaji nonetheless professed his readiness to engage in violence. After reading the above, is \\"Dar el Ansar, which means house of the followers\\" the correct answer to the question \\"The four became somewhat of a sect meeting 3 to 4 times a week and what was it that Atta would write on the rent checks?\\"?

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust?, using the article: A Late Preclassic tomb has been excavated, believed to be a royal burial. This tomb has been designated Burial 1; it was found during excavations of Structure 7A and was inserted into the centre of this Middle Preclassic structure. The burial is also associated with Stela 13 and with a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels and other artifacts found at the base of Structure 7A. These ceramics date the offering to the end of the Late Preclassic. No human remains have been recovered but the find is assumed to be a burial due to the associated artifacts. The body is believed to have been interred upon a litter measuring 1 by 2 metres (3.3 by 6.6 ft), which was probably made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust. Grave goods include an 18-piece jade necklace, two earspools coated in cinnabar, various mosaic mirrors made from iron pyrite, one consisting of more than 800 pieces, a jade mosaic mask, two prismatic obsidian blades, a finely carved greenstone fish, various beads that presumably formed jewellery such as bracelets and a selection of ceramics that date the tomb to AD 100–200.In October 2012, a tomb carbon-dated between 700 BC and 400 BC was reported to have been found in Takalik Abaj of a ruler nicknamed K'utz Chman (\\"Grandfather Vulture\\" in Mam) by archaeologists, a sacred king or \\"big chief\\" who \\"bridged the gap between the Olmec and Mayan cultures in Central America,\\" according to Miguel Orrego.

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows.

Article: Dior was born in Normandy in 1905, and his family's original plans for him included a career in the diplomatic service, but by the time he was twenty-three, with his parents'money, he opened a small art gallery in Paris. By 1931, the money had been used up. Dior's friends in the art gallery, asked him to draw and he took his first step at designing and drawing. His first job was with Lucien Lelong from whom Dior learned his craft . In February,1947, Dior started the New Look in his first major Paris collection. He was backed by a famous textile producer, Boussac, who looked after the dollars, while Dior looked after the fashions. Dior knew nothing about cutting and sewing, but he was good at fashion design. The New Look started an entirely different look to costume, with a tiny waist, a rounded shoulder and a shapely bust , usually with a low-cut neckline and a long full skirt. To women who had lived through the war years, the femaleness of the New look was a great success, for people were tired of tile extremely plain, wartime restrictive fashions. It is said that dresses by Dior were \\"constructed like buildings\\", but young people were attracted to his design, and all over the western world, manufacturers plunged into the production of his new style. Dior's revolutionary designs lighted up a whole cycle of fashion, rounded, gentle, feminine, a delight in elegance. A New Look House of Dior opened in 1948, followed by one in London. Considered as King of Couture(women's clothing)for years, the Dior empire grew until it covered every country in the western world, and included furs, hosiery, jewelry, perfumes, men's wear and on and on. More than 1,000 people worked at the Paris headquarters then. His sudden death in 1957 when he was 53 years old did not stop the growth of the House of Dior.

Answer the above question based on the context below: American pressmen had been alerted to an upcoming Buddhist demonstration to coincide with Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda in the north of Saigon. The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying \\"Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!\\" Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face.

In the women's singles, top seed Serena Williams will face Madison Keys on Sunday in an all-American final. World number three Murray, who will be 29 on Sunday, broke serve four times as he won in 59 minutes. The first semi-final was delayed by an hour because of heavy rain, and the players were forced off for 15 minutes during the first set. \\"I think it is the first time since I've been on Tour that I've not had a chance to hit balls before going on to the court,\\" said Murray. \\"It pretty much rained non-stop and then they flipped the schedule around so I didn't feel that comfortable coming on to court. \\"But he made a few mistakes and I served well to make it easy for myself.\\" In between the showers, Murray was at his ruthless best against world number 52 Pouille, playing his first ATP Masters semi-final. The 22-year-old looked nervous as he dropped serve from 40-0 in the fourth game and - after that brief rain delay - Murray broke again to clinch the set. It was a similar story in the second set, with Murray repeatedly drawing his opponent into the net and setting up the passing shot. Two more breaks of serve gave Murray the match and he left the Centrale Court in sunshine, having surpassed his best effort of reaching the last four in 2011. \\"A lot of the best players of all time have played, won and competed for the title here, so I'm very happy to get the chance to do that,\\" added Murray. \\"After 10 years of kind of struggling on the clay and especially this event maybe not playing my best, I'm happy to be there.\\" Murray completes his preparation for the French Open, which starts on 22 May, by facing world number one Djokovic in Sunday's final.

Question: Given the background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). and the situation: Two teams of athletes were attending a competition. Brown team arrived in time and started their warm up, but Green team arrived late and skipped their warm up so they experienced some people getting injured. Answer the following question: Which team experienced fewer muscle injuries? Answer:","completion":"The Brown team experienced fewer muscle injuries because they arrived in time and properly performed their warm-up routine. Warming up helps increase blood flow to the muscles, increases the heart rate, and prepares muscles for physical activity, reducing the likelihood of injury.

If we strictly go by the numbers provided in the premise, it states that LSC grantees reported closing 1,038,662 million civil legal cases for the year 1999. This figure is significantly less than 10 million. However, it's important to note that there seems to be a typographical error in the data provided— \\"1,038,662 million” is an extremely large number that isn't logical in the given context. Assuming that the accurate figure is 1,038,662 (over one million cases), it still does not reach the 10 million mark stipulated in the hypothesis. Thus, we wouldn't be able to confirm or support the hypothesis that LSC grantees closed more than 10 million legal cases. We also need to consider the fact that this data is only for one year, 1999. If we were to consider the cumulative total of cases closed over multiple years, the number might potentially reach or even exceed 10 million cases.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Remy came up behind Jan to scare her today. Given the context: How would Jan feel as a result? Possible answers: surprised, fun loving, calm Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, Jan would most likely feel surprised as a result of Remy coming up behind her to scare her. Let's analyze the situation further to better understand why the other possible answers might not be as fitting. When somebody sneaks up behind another person with the intention to scare them, it usually means that the person approaching, in this case, Remy, wants to evoke an unexpected reaction, like sudden fear or a startle from the one being scared, in this case, Jan. Physiologically, this response can be attributed to the body's fight or flight reaction, affecting an individual's adrenaline levels and causing an instinctive, unforeseen reaction to a perceived threat. If we take a look at the other possible answers, we can see why they might not be as appropriate given the context: 1. Fun loving: While it is possible that Jan might consider Remy's attempt to scare her as something fun-loving or playful in retrospect, it is not the primary emotion that she is likely to feel at the moment she is being scared. Furthermore, Jan's experience of fun in this situation depends on her personality traits, the relationship she shares with Remy, and her personal preferences for such pranks or tricks. This makes \\"fun loving\\" a less certain response than the one of being surprised. 2. Calm: This emotional response might be one of the least likely in this context, as being scared usually triggers a sudden reaction, which implies that a person's calmness might be disrupted momentarily. Assuming that Jan didn't see Remy sneaking up behind her or was not anticipating this act, her composure would likely be disrupted when Remy scares her, making it difficult for her to remain calm in that specific moment. In conclusion, given the context and the nature of Remy's action, it is most reasonable to believe that Jan would feel surprised by this occurrence. Although it is possible that she might express additional or different emotions after the initial surprise based on her personality and relationship with Remy, these are more dependent on individual factors and less on the specific given context regarding Remy's attempt to scare Jan."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Balanini pirates, fervent Muslims, disputed the coast of northeastern Borneo (modern Sabah) with the sultanate of Brunei. Sarawak's coast and jungle interior were controlled by the Iban — Sea Dayak pirates and Land Dayak slash-and-burn farmers. (The Dayaks practiced head-hunting, a ritual that was believed to bring spiritual energy to their communities. ) The region was unproductive and without great resources, except for the Sarawak river valley, where the Chinese mined for gold and antimony. Brunei chiefs traded the metals through Americans in Singapore. In 1839, the governor of Singapore sent James Brooke (1803–1868) to promote trade links with the Sultan of Brunei. He had been an audacious cavalry officer in the Anglo-Burmese wars and now exploited the situation for his own benefit. In exchange for helping the regent end a revolt of uppity Malay chiefs, Brooke was made Rajah of Sarawak in 1841, with his capital in Kuching (founded by the Malays just 11 years earlier). He tried to halt the Dayaks' piracy and head-hunting while defending their more \\"morally acceptable\\" customs. His attempts to limit the opium trade met with resistance by the Chinese in Bau, who revolted. His counter-attack with Dayak warriors drove the Chinese out of Bau and across the Sarawak border. Thereafter, Chinese settlement was discouraged and did not achieve the commercial dominance it enjoyed on the peninsula. In 1863, Brooke retired to Britain, handing Sarawak over to his nephew Charles. More reserved and remote but a better administrator and financier than his uncle, Charles Brooke imposed on his men his own austere, efficient style of life. He brought Dayak leaders onto his ruling council but favored the time-honored colonial practice of divide-and-rule by pitting one tribe against another to keep the peace. Northeast Borneo (Sabah) was \\"rented\\" from the Sultan of Brunei by British businessman Alfred Dent.

We found that blocking such autophagy, but not canonical autophagy, inhibits mitochondrial clearance, in turn, preventing iPSC induction. Furthermore, AMPK seems to be upstream of this autophagic pathway and can be targeted by small molecules to modulate mitochondrial clearance during metabolic reprogramming.

Some fell to their knees, clutching the gritty stuff as though it were a long-lost child. Others lifted it to their lips to savor a taste of the home they left behind decades ago. Exiles -- who face never returning to Tibet as long as it is under Chinese rule -- stood on Tibetan soil this week, fulfilling a desire that has burned within since they fled westward across the Himalayas. Only, this week, they were able to do it in Dharamsala, the Indian hilltown that functions as the de facto capital of the refugee community. The display was the work of New York artist Tenzing Rigdol, 29, who clandestinely trucked in sacks containing 22 tons of dirt from Tibet to Dharamsala to construct his installation. He did not want to disclose details of the soil's journey, fearful of the repercussions of the act of smuggling. All he would say is that it was a \\"complicated process that took 17 months.\\" Rigdol then spread the dirt over a stage the size of a basketball court and called it \\"Our Land, Our People.\\" He invited Tibetans to walk on his dirt, write on it or pick up a microphone to express themselves. He knew it could never be the same as actually returning to Tibet, but perhaps, he thought, it would spark a sliver of that feeling. He thought of his father on Wednesday when the installation opened and people lined up, many overwhelmed with emotion. The only wish his father had was to see Tibet one more time. But he fell ill in 2007 and died. A father's unfulfilled wish drove his artist son to create something that would allow the displaced to be able to \\"return\\" home again. And others like him, who were born outside of Tibet, to finally feel native earth they have never had under their feet. \\"There are so many like my father who wanted to return,\\" Rigdol said. \\"And many more who have never been to Tibet.\\" Tenzin Dorjee, 31, remembers receiving cell phone texts at 4:30 in the morning when his excited friend first came up with his idea. The message was so long that it got broken into three. \\"He was saying he had this idea to transport a large amount of soil from Tibet,\\" Dorjee said. \\"I was blown away. My first reaction was: how is that possible?\\" But then Dorjee began visualizing the project and how much of an impact it was sure to have on Tibetan exiles. \\"The implications,\\" he said, \\"seemed historic.\\" Known as the \\"roof of the world,\\" Tibet is a remote Buddhist region governed by Communist China. Beijing claims its sovereignty over Tibet goes back centuries and views the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, as a separatist. About 150,000 Tibetans live in exile, a majority of them in Dharamsala, according to their governing body. The Dalai Lama set up residence there after Chinese forces crushed a 1959 Tibetan uprising. The Dalai Lama summoned Rigdol to his residence after the opening of the installation Wednesday, Rigdol said. Rigdol carried with him some of the Tibetan dirt. Using his index finger, the Dalai Lama, wrote Tibet in the dirt and blessed the soil. Meanwhile, monks in their flowing maroon and saffron robes queued up, as did parents holding babies. \\"It was very exciting,\\" said Tenzing Geche, 22, a monk who was a baby when his family left Tibet. He touched the dirt and felt a connection like no other. \\"I felt I was back in my own country,\\" he said. Tenzing Tfuengue, 17, has never been to Tibet -- he was born and raised in India. He has longed to go to Tibet, feel the air there, drink the water, see the land that possesses his soul. \\"Today, (Rigdol) made it a little bit possible,\\" Tfuengue said. For Lhadon Tethong, 35, a Canadian visiting family in Dharamsala, the installation was bittersweet. It was completely inspiring at one moment and in another, as she watched elderly Tibetans fall to the ground, sadness overcame her. \\"I am normally better with words than this,\\" she said, unable to complete her sentence. There was no overt political statement in Rigdol's art, but some Tibetans hoped it would inspire resistance to Chinese rule. China blames Tibetan unrest on the exiled community. But no matter the consequences, Rigdol's art will carry on. The installation will stay up until Friday. But when it closes, Tibetan exiles will be allowed to take some of the dirt with them, a reminder always of the land they long to see. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1. New York artist Tenzing Rigdol brought 22 tons of Tibetan soil to Dharamsala, India, the de facto capital of the refugee community, creating an art installation for displaced Tibetans to \\"return\\" to their homeland. 2. Racing against time and opposing Chinese rule, Rigdol's project took 17 months to complete, and he titled the stage-sized installation \\"Our Land, Our People.\\" 3. Tibetans who visited the installation were overwhelmed with emotion, with many feeling a connection to their homeland they had never experienced before. 4.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Who are the four people whose wedding receptions are being held in the same hotel?, using the article: Maura is a down on her luck single mother who's facing eviction from her house, which lead her to the rash decision to marry an illegal immigrant, Wilson, in exchange of €9,000. Maura's daughter Molly believes that her mother truly loves Wilson and that she's getting a new father. Meanwhile, Freddie, a nice guy with OCD-esque habits, is remarrying the selfish and very image-conscious Sophie after a recent divorce. The receptions for both weddings are being held in the same hotel. Freddie and Maura's paths keep crossing, leading to Sophie wrongly assuming that the two are involved in an illicit affair. To complicate matters, two immigration officers arrive at the wedding reception to investigate Wilson and Maura. Eventually Molly learns that her mother is involved in a scam and has no feelings for Wilson. Believing her suspicions of an affair to be true, Sophie flees the wedding. Presuming Freddie responsible, Sophie's aggressive father loses his cool and attempts to assault Freddie. Meanwhile, Sophie has gone to a pub in Dublin with some working class girls who support her decision to run away as they believe Freddie to be a lecherous cheater. Sophie gets drunk with her new friends while Freddie is frantically trying to find her to keep his marriage afloat.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that conducted the December 1900 performance where the man who was called up for military service in 1896 played solo viola? ? Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.

Founded in the year 1040, and established as a \\"kaupstad\\" or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada, the city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 and with Sweden from 1814 to 1905 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, the city was moved closer to Akershus Fortress during the reign of Christian IV of Denmark and renamed Christiania in his honour. It was established as a municipality (\\"formannskapsdistrikt\\") on 1 January 1838.

It's unclear why the backhoe was on the track near Chester, just south of Philadelphia. The two fatalities were found on or near the backhoe, Pennsylvania Emergency Management spokeswoman Ruth Miller said. The big unanswered questions: Why did the train continue its route from New York to Savannah, Georgia, when Amtrak construction workers may have been on the track? Or why didn't the construction workers move if a train was coming? The train was carrying about 341 passengers and seven crew members when it crashed, Amtrak said. The impact caused the lead engine of the train to derail. Even before the crash, passenger Glenn Hills said he knew something was wrong. He didn't see the backhoe that lay ahead on the track. But \\"there was a lot of debris in the track, and we started driving through that,\\" the Brooklyn resident said. \\"There was a lot of gravel noise.\\" But the mess wasn't confined to the track, Hills said. \\"I looked outside, and it looked like we were in this brown cloud,\\" he said, speculating that the dustiness came from construction or high winds. \\"We were rolling into this storm, this sandstorm.\\" That's when passengers started panicking. \\"People are yelling at that point,\\" he said. \\"There was a woman screaming a prayer.\\" Then the train slammed into the backhoe. Hills said the impact didn't feel severe from the second passenger car, where he was sitting. He likened it to the feeling of a roller coaster abruptly stopping at the end of the ride -- \\"but scarier.\\" Other passengers weren't so lucky. \\"There was tremendous impact on the first car,\\" Hills said. He said the roof of that car was torn open, and several windows were broken. \\"It feels like a nightmare,\\" he said. \\"It felt like this is that experience that I've feared in the past.\\" Amtrak said it was providing limited service between Philadelphia and Wilmington, Delaware, as the Federal Railroad Administration and National Transportation Safety Board investigate. The crash came less than a month after an Amtrak train headed from Chicago to Los Angeles It also came almost a year after -- one that left eight people dead and more than 200 injured. Sunday's crash near Philadelphia made Hills consider whether he should fly more. \\"I rely on Amtrak a lot, and I travel for my job in the Northeast Corridor a lot,\\" said Hills, who works in the specialty food industry. \\"This incident has really fed my fears.\\" But is it enough to make him stop riding trains? \\"Unfortunately, no.

To do this, we can add 98 to both sides of the equation. -4*f - 98 + 98 = -114 + 98 -4*f = -16 (We subtracted 98 from both sides to isolate the term -4*f.) Step 2: Solve for f. Now, we want to get f by itself. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by -4.

Answer choices: - gloves - skin - shoes - hats - sweat - cocoa - Masks - fur Answer:","completion":"In addressing the question of what prevents heat loss from the body after losing hair, it is essential to understand that the main cause of heat loss in the absence of hair is through radiation and convection from the skin. Among the options provided, several of the items may assist in preventing heat loss, but the most relevant option is hats. Hats, when designed and worn correctly, can significantly reduce heat loss after losing hair as they cover the head and provide insulation against cold temperatures. In this context, hats play the most crucial role in preventing heat loss from the body in the absence of hair. Here is a brief overview of the other options and their relevance to preventing heat loss after losing hair: - Gloves: Gloves help keep the hands warm, particularly when exposed to cold weather, but they don't contribute directly to reducing heat loss from the head. Therefore, they are not the primary solution for heat loss prevention in the absence of hair. - Skin: As the outermost layer covering the body, the skin plays a major role in heat regulation. It releases sweat to cool down the body and constricts blood vessels close to the surface to minimize temperature loss. However, in the case of hair loss, the skin alone may not be very effective in preventing heat loss due to its natural mechanisms. - Shoes: Similar to gloves, shoes help keep the feet warm, but they have no direct impact on preventing heat loss from the head, making them an unsuitable solution for this specific question. - Sweat: Sweat is a natural cooling mechanism that aids the skin in maintaining optimal body temperature. It works by evaporating from the skin's surface and absorbing heat. In the case of hair loss, sweat does not prevent heat loss; its role is to regulate body temperature. - Cocoa: While cocoa may provide a temporary sense of warmth when consumed, it does not have any direct impact on preventing heat loss from the body or head. Its role is more in promoting brief internal warmth. - Masks: Masks are designed to cover the mouth and nose, primarily as a protective barrier against infections or air pollution. They provide limited insulation, having minimal impact on preventing heat loss from the body or head. - Fur: Fur is an insulating material found on many animals, providing warmth, and protection from cold environments. Synthetic fur found in clothing and accessories serves a similar purpose. However, as fur is present on animals and not humans, it isn't the option in addressing heat loss in hairless individuals. In conclusion, amongst the given options, hats are the most appropriate choice for preventing heat loss from the body after losing hair. They specifically target the head area and provide necessary insulation to minimize heat loss through radiation and convection. Other items, such as gloves, shoes, and masks, play a role in overall body temperature regulation and insulation but do not directly impact heat loss from the head."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Before tampering with your computer, it is important to make sure the computer is powered down and unplugged. Each computer is different. Consult your user's manual or manufacturer's web page to learn how to open your computer to access the hard drive. For desktop PCs, you can generally remove the side panel of the computer tower. For laptop computers, you can generally remove the bottom of the computer below the keyboard. In some cases, a hard drive may have a ribbon cable, and a power cable attached to the motherboard. In other cases, the hard drive may be directly attached to a port on the motherboard. If it has any cables attached, detach them. If the hard drive is connected to the motherboard, pry it loose from the port it's connected to. If you want to salvage any of the other computer parts, be sure to touch something metal or wear static wrist bands to prevent static discharge that can damage the inside of the computer The hard drive is generally housed in it's own compartment. It may be held in place with screws. If so, remove the screws and then slide the hard drive out of it's compartment. Unscrew all the screws holding the top on. You will need the T-9 sized wrench for most hard drives. Sometimes there's an air seal. You will need to remove this. Once you get the top off you will see two or three stacked, silver disks (called platters). Put scratches on the surface of the platters with the Torx wrench. Now start smashing it with the hammer. Do this outside on a hard surface (such as concrete). Be sure to wear safety glasses to protect against flying debris. Glass platters (found on newer drives) will shatter. If you have a large hammer (a 10 lb sledge for instance): you can forgo opening the drive - a few good hits with a big hammer can split open the metal casing and mangle the platters, even on old full-height 5.25\\" drives with metal (rather than glass) platters. Solid-state drives (SSDs) do not have platters on the inside.

Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been \\"rather distressed\\". Two days later, he wrote again: \\"I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her\\". Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: \\"I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good\\". Consequently, he was baptised \\"Albert Frederick Arthur George\\" at St. Mary Magdalene's Church near Sandringham three months later.[a] As a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, he was known formally as His Highness Prince Albert of York from birth. Within the family, he was known informally as \\"Bertie\\".

Article: Having a vaguely-defined goal can make it difficult to follow through on your efforts and track your progress. However, having a clear, well-defined goal will help you stay driven and know how far you've come. Your goal should be as clear and actionable as possible. Remember to focus on either a process goal or an outcome goal. Keep in mind, though, that you can work toward multiple goals at once. For instance, you might have an outcome goal of getting an “A” in English, and process goals along the way that help you earn that “A.” For example, instead of just saying your goal is to get through your math class, figure out what you hope to accomplish. Do you want to become more proficient in math (a process goal), or earn a good grade (an outcome goal)? Whenever you set a goal for yourself, it's important to recognize how you've progressed in working towards it. That's why you should always set goals with clear, measurable progress marks and keep track of your efforts every step of the way. Determine in advance how you will measure success. Ask yourself, \\"How will I know when I've accomplished my goal?\\" You can mark off successes when you reach checkpoints along the way. You can even use a reward system. Choose both short-term and long-term measures of success. For example, you might measure success in the short-term by looking at how much studying and homework you get done in a week, and in the long-term by watching how your grades improve over the course of the semester. Even a good, well-defined goal could be difficult to achieve without a clear action plan. When you set your goal, make sure you include action-oriented steps as part of your goal development. That way you'll know what you're trying to accomplish and, more importantly, how you'll get there. Be very clear in how you intend to achieve your goal. Having action-oriented steps means developing clear guidelines that lay out what (specifically) you will need to do at every step along the way. Think about the steps your goal will require, both in the short-term and in the long-term. Focus on what specifically you will need to do. For example, action-oriented steps might include completing your homework ahead of time, reviewing your notes every day after class, and arranging a meeting with your instructor. It's important to dream big, but it's also important to know what you can realistically accomplish with the materials you currently possess and the time frame you're given. Don't bite off more than you can chew, but at the same time don't give yourself a task that's too easy. An example of a realistic goal would be to improve your course grade by one letter before the end of the semester. An unrealistic goal, by comparison, would be to turn an F into an A by the end of the semester. Be aware of what could potentially hinder your success and plan accordingly so that these obstacles do not impede your progress towards accomplishing your goal. For instance, if your goal is to get a good grade on an essay, you’ll want to be aware of other assignments that could affect the amount of time you spend working on the essay. If you're working within a school calendar, the end of that semester might be the end of your time frame. However, there's still plenty of flexibility in terms of what can be done and when it needs to be done by. Decide in advance when your goal needs to be accomplished. Once you have a firm deadline, work your way backwards to determine when you need to begin your work and when various milestones along the way must be met. For example, if you're working within the time frame of a semester, you might decide that you'll accomplish your goal before finals week. That means working backwards to figure out what needs to be completed and when. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of setting clear, well-defined goals, distinguishing between process and outcome goals, and having a realistic action plan to achieve them.

Write highlights for this article: The man who rescued an 11-year-old girl lost in a dense Florida swamp said Wednesday that God led him directly to her and that finding her was no surprise. James King said he set out on his own to look for Nadia Bloom on Tuesday, trusting that he was going in the right direction even when that meant through water or dense brush. \\"I was expecting to hear her voice,\\" King told CNN. \\"So I'm yelling, 'Nadia!' and at one point, I yell, 'Nadia!' and I hear 'What?' And I said that way -- right there.\\" Tanya Bloom, Nadia's mother, said later Wednesday that the family is \\"so fortunate God used him to bring her back.\\" \\"She's doing remarkably well,\\" Bloom said. \\"She has swollen feet and lots of bug bites and scratches, but she's doing great.\\" Dr. Mary Farrell, who treated the girl when she arrived at the hospital, said that Nadia was in good shape but that she would remain hospitalized a little longer because of a bacterial infection. \\"When she got here, she was a little bit dehydrated but she had been resuscitated pretty well,\\" Farrell said, \\"and she looked remarkably well considering she had been out for four and half days.\\" King said he was surprised at the good shape Nadia was in. She had been missing since Friday. Shoeless and covered in insect bites, she was in otherwise good condition, he said. \\"She was not panicked. She looked like she had been sitting there, waiting on me,\\" he said. The two of them then stayed in the swamp, near Lake Jesup in central Florida, while King called authorities. When he got hold of the 911 dispatcher, he put Nadia on the phone. \\"Hi. This is Nadia. I'm the girl who got lost,\\" came the little girl's voice. King said it took him \\"two hours of rough time\\" trekking through the swamp to find Nadia. He said he figures it took Nadia just as long to reach the same spot. She told King that she had gone on a nature walk and simply got lost. \\"We are so, so grateful,\\" Nadia's father, Jeff Bloom, said. \\"I can't even express how we felt when she was found -- beyond words.\\" The swamp was so dense, King said, that the rescuers who carried Nadia out on a black cloth stretcher Tuesday had to use machetes to cut through the brush, bushes and trees. \\"I see it as an answer to a lot of people's prayers,\\" King told CNN. \\"I'm just very thankful, I'm thankful that God used me as a part of it to be able to find her. It's definitely a miracle. \\"I didn't know where she was. The only person who knew where she was was God, and I asked him and he led me directly to her, straight -- well, as straight as you can go through the swamp.\\" King said he prayed the whole time he was searching, even when it seemed like he was going in the wrong direction. In one case, he said, there was water all around and he didn't know where to go. \\"He said, 'Go that way.' And I'm looking at water. I said, 'Lord, are you sure?' He said. 'I got ya.' And as soon as I start walking, the ground under the water is solid. It's only about a foot and a half deep. He took care of me all the way there.\\" The disappearance of Nadia, described as mildly autistic, had sparked an Amber Alert that was canceled when King found her. Both King and Nadia's family at one time attended the same church, Metro Church in Winter Springs, Florida, but they didn't know one another -- though King said Nadia did seem to register him as a friendly face when she was found. The church held an open-air thanksgiving service to celebrate Nadia's return Tuesday evening. \\"Give the glory to God,\\" Nadia's father told reporters after seeing his daughter Tuesday. King had brought trail mix and drinks to give to Nadia if he found her, but he also brought another important item -- toilet paper. The swamp vegetation was so thick that the helicopter that came to retrieve Nadia and King couldn't see them on the ground. King said he heard the chopper overhead and tried to give the dispatcher directions for the pilot, but it still didn't work. \\"I had brought toilet paper for signaling, and so I covered the top of a couple of bushes that were in more of an open area than I was in,\\" King told CNN. \\"They still had a hard time finding me, but I used that on the top (of the bushes) and they finally were able to locate it.\\" Authorities questioned King after they got to safety, something King said was unexpected but understandable, especially given his ability to find Nadia so quickly. \\"They also have a job to do,\\" he said. \\"They have a responsibility to the community to make sure there is no foul play. And so I understand that, I understood it completely.\\" Coming out of the swamp was a blur with lots of hugs and praise, King said. He said he hopes to be able to see the Bloom family again, and that Nadia even hinted he'd be welcome: \\"She said she might invite me to her pizza party.\\"","completion":"In the dense Florida swamp, 11-year-old Nadia Bloom was found and rescued by James King, who claimed that he was led by God to locate the girl.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Enormous super typhoon Neoguri lashing Okinawa and targeting Japan Satellite image of Neoguri (NOAA) The first super typhoon of 2014 is currently battering Okinawa and is on a collision course with southwest Japan. Named Neoguri – meaning “raccoon” in Korean – the potentially destructive storm has peak winds of 150 mph. In recent hours, the storm has weakened modestly due to both a structural re-organization known as an eyewall replacement cycle and some dry air wrapping into its center. But the sprawling cyclone is forecast by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center to re-intensify, with maximum sustained winds reaching as high as 160 mph in about 24 hours. Should it achieve this intensity, it would match the strongest storm on the planet so far in 2014 (tropical cyclone Gillian, from the Australia cyclone region). WeatherBell Analytics meteorologist Ryan Maue, calling Neoguri a “run-of-the-mill super typhoon”, is skeptical it will attain such extreme intensity. “Its [large] size is working against it,” Maue said. “I’m not buying the eyewall replacement cycle bringing it back to life.” JTWC convinced eyewall replacement cycle will lead to re-intensification #Neoguri. I’m skeptical w/so much dry air. pic.twitter.com/OkxXDUoJ31 — Ryan N. Maue (@RyanMaue) July 7, 2014 Irrespective of short-term increases or decreases in strength, the storm should begin to steadily weaken in 36 hours as it moves into cooler water and makes landfall in southwest Japan. For the moment, the storm is buffeting Okinawa and surrounding islands. The Stars and Stripes blog reports: “Actual winds between 40 and 56 mph are occurring.” American storm chaser Josh Morgerman is positioned on the tiny Japan island of Kumejima about 90 kilometers west of Okinawa, where he reports deteriorating conditions: Howling, rattling windows, near-hurricane gusts lash Miyako-jima as #TyphoonNeoguri closes in. 979.7 mb. #iCyclone pic.twitter.com/NCFw2Xz2J6 — Josh Morgerman (@HurricaneJosh) July 7, 2014 Links: Radar views of typhoon: Miyakojima | Okinawa This region – known as the Miyako Islands – is predicted to experience the worst of the super typhoon. Reports Mashable’s Andrew Freedman: Japan has issued its highest weather alert for these islands, anticipating major damage. Specifically, the JMA issued its first-ever “emergency weather warning” for Miyakojima Chiho, which is expected to be close enough to the storm to experience its eyewall, where the worst winds and highest waves will be located. Waves of 45 to 50 feet in height may hit the Miyako Islands, with similar wave heights possible in Okinawa, depending on the storm’s exact path. JMA has issued Emergency Warnings for Okinawa and Typhoon Warnings for the lower Ryukyus. #Neoguri pic.twitter.com/cMYtNTpehy — Anthony Sagliani (@anthonywx) July 7, 2014 Landfall in southwest mainland Japan should occur around July 9 local time. “Though it will weaken by then, winds could still be over 100 mph by the time it reaches the main islands of Kyushu, Shikoku and western portions of Honshu, home to tens of millions of people,” predicts The Weather Channel. Jeff Masters of Weather Underground expects significant flooding when the storm comes ashore: Nagasaki had upwards of 8 inches of rain on Thursday, and parts of Kyushu saw 10 inches of rain on Friday, thanks to a stalled stationary front over the island. With the soils already saturated from these heavy rains, the torrential rains from Neoguri are sure to cause major flooding on Wednesday and Thursday. Much of Japan is likely to be impacted, as the projected track carries the storm right through its heart. While areas in southwest Japan like Sasebo bear the brunt of the storm, torrential rain and strong winds will blast through the country, including Kyoto and Tokyo. Neoguri track forecast (Joint Typhoon Warning Center) Neoguri is the third typhoon of 2014 in the West Pacific. Summary:","completion":"A super typhoon named Neoguri is hitting Okinawa and is heading towards southwest Japan. Neoguri is a very strong storm with winds of 150 miles per hour. The storm might get weaker, but it can also become stronger with winds up to 160 miles per hour. The storm is expected to slowly weaken as it moves into cooler water and then makes landfall in southwest Japan. Japan has issued its highest weather alert, and they expect big waves and strong winds in some areas. The typhoon will likely cause a lot of rain and flooding in many parts of Japan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute at the age of five? ? Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\". At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. Before you decide to confront your neighbors about their noise levels, you should try your best to assess their situation, particularly if this noise problem is a new issue. Consider the following sorts of questions, the answers to which might affect whether you decide to talk to them or how you decide to talk to them: Do they have a new baby? If they do, they are surely aware that their infant is wailing and are trying to calm him or her. Indeed, they are most likely more stressed out about the baby's crying than you are. Consider giving it a little bit of time to let the new parents and baby settle into a routine before you decide to talk to them. Do they work nights? If so, there may be no way around them making noise while getting ready for work (showering, going down the stairs, starting their car, etc.) or coming home from their shift. Of course, if they are excessively loud (blasting music while they shower, for example), you may want to talk to them. On the other hand, if the noises they are making are what you would reasonably expect from anyone getting ready for their day, you won't have much of a case. Is their pet a new adoption who hasn't yet had time to adapt to its new home? If so, your neighbors and their pet may just be going through an adjustment period. You may want to consider waiting for a while to see if they manage to get their new pet settled and find strategies for dealing with its noise. You are aiming for the best possible outcome, where your neighbor is receptive and sympathetic to your complaint. Thus, choosing the appropriate time and place to talk things over with them is important. Ideally, you will be able to talk to your neighbor when they are not being noisy or disruptive, especially if the problem occurs in the middle of the night (when no one is at their best) or if you are angry while the noise is going on. Try to pick a time when you are rested and calm, and also when you have reason to believe that your neighbor is similarly rested and won't feel ambushed. Of course, if the noise is unbearable, you may not be able to wait, in which case we give you advice on how to confront them at these times in subsequent steps. In order to avoid putting your neighbor on the defensive, you should try not to surprise them at an inopportune time or place. It's best to avoid confrontations when it's clear that your neighbor is not prepared for a discussion, and it's even better if you can alert them to your need to talk and arrange for a time that works for both of you. For example, it's not a good time to confront when your neighbor when she has just gotten home a twelve hour shift, or when she is clearly struggling to get all her kids off to school. Rather than demanding that she give you her attention right then and there, you can try something like the following, after you see that she's got everyone buckled in: “Hey Kathy, I see that you're busy right now, but are you free for a short chat later this afternoon? I'd like to talk about some noise issues that I'm sure we'll be able to work out together.” There may come a time when you have to become more assertive if your neighbors do nothing to reduce their noise, but you don't want to be hostile when you confront them initially. Your neighbors are far more likely to be receptive if you approach them politely and calmly. Instead of banging on their door angrily, or having the first words out of your mouth be “Your d*% kids have been keeping me up all night!”, try easing into the conversation by asking them how everything has been going for them lately. If there is any way for you to compliment them or generally find a way to demonstrate your friendliness and willingness to work with them, then do so. For example, you may be there to talk to them about how their new dog barks while they are out of the house. So long as you aren't allergic and the dog is otherwise well-behaved, give the pup a good pet and compliment the owners on how beautiful she is. You can then lead into your issue: “Spot is gorgeous and clearly attached to you already. I think that may be related to why I'm here: you may not know it, but when you're out of the house, Spot barks and cries almost continually. I think this may be because she's dealing with separation anxiety. I was hoping we could come up with a plan to address that today.” If you can find ways to make your neighbor be sympathetic towards you, it is more likely that they will take your complaints seriously and commit to reducing their noise levels for your benefit. Once you've explained to your neighbor what activity or behavior of theirs is disturbing you, make sure that you clearly explain how it is negatively affecting you. Demonstrate to them that your problem isn't with them, but that it is with the noise and how it is interfering with your life. For example, if their music is keeping you up at night, try the following: “Chris, you clearly have excellent taste in music—I'd like to get that playlist from you if I can—but the walls between our apartment are pretty thin, and I've been having a really hard time getting to sleep because of it. I've got to get up early for work, so this is becoming an issue.” Rather than just demanding that your neighbors shut up or stop making noise altogether, it will help if you are prepared with a plan. Be sure to let your neighbor know how you would like the situation to be resolved. Try to offer a reasonable plan that acknowledges your neighbor's right to live their own life in their own home. For example, if your issue is that your neighbor's dog has been barking while they are out, you can suggest that they crate the dog at certain times or place it in a different room in the house when they are out. You could also suggest that they shut their blinds and curtains and leave the television or radio on when they are out (which can reduce the dog's distractions and thus hopefully its barking). If your neighbor's music has been keeping you up, rather than just demanding that they turn it off, you could try the following suggestion: “Given that I try to be asleep by 10pm would you be willing to turn the music off or switch to using headphones by then?” Summary:","completion":"Before confronting neighbors about noise issues, assess their situation, consider the timing and approach them calmly and politely, offering reasonable solutions to achieve a peaceful resolution."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Rap mogul Suge Knight to surrender in connection with deadly hit-and-run, lawyer says Jan. 29, 2015: A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department investigator photographs the scene of an accident at a parking lot in Compton, Calif. A lawyer for Marion 'Suge' Knight, a Death Row Records founder, says Knight was driving a car involved in an accident. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) An attorney for rap mogul Marion \\"Suge\\" Knight says he is working with Los Angeles County sheriff's officials to have Knight surrender for questioning in connection with a deadly hit-and-run Thursday. MyFoxLA, citing attorney James Blatt, reported that Knight was at the wheel of a car that struck two men shortly before 3 p.m. local time in Compton. One of the men died, while the other was taken to a hospital. The injured man's condition was not immediately available and neither man's name was released. The Los Angeles Times reported that the tragedy stemmed from an altercation that occurred on the set of the forthcoming film \\"Straight Outta Compton,\\" a biopic about the rap group NWA. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Capt. John Corina said that the two men Knight argued with went to a nearby restaurant about 20 minutes after the confrontation Corina alleged Knight followed the men there in a red truck and ran them over in the parking lot. Witnesses told the paper the truck hit the men, then backed over them before fleeing the scene. The incident is being investigated as a homicide. Blatt claimed to the Associated Press that Knight was trying to escape from a pair of attackers and said he was confident that his client will be cleared of wrongdoing. Knight co-founded Death Row Records with Dr. Dre in 1991 and built it into the first successful mainstream rap label behind acts like NWA, Snoop Dogg, and Tupac Shakur. Knight was at the wheel of the BMW Shakur was riding in when he was shot and killed following a boxing match in Las Vegas. Knight has had repeated brushes with the law. In 1997, he was sentenced to nine years in prison for violating the terms of his probation in an earlier assault case. He was released in 2001. In 2008, he was arrested in Las Vegas on suspicion of drug possession and aggravated assault and pleaded guilty to a charge of misdemeanor battery the following year. He is currently waiting trial alongside comedian Katt Williams on charges of second degree robbery in connection with the theft of a photographer's camera.

Explanation: In the paragraph, the person takes the tool apart and starts working on it. So, the best answer is (c), where they continue working on the tool by unscrewing items and tightening it using the screwdriver. Why other answers are wrong: (a) doesn't make sense because they are already taking the tool apart, not measuring it. (b) isn't right because the person is working on the tool, not rubbing it on the carpet or showing products. (d) isn't correct because there's no mention of a knee joint or building any shape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Conservatives attack Supreme Court Nominee Sonia Sotomayor's background ON PAPER, Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor resembles one of her would-be colleagues on the high court: Princeton undergrad, Yale Law School, an editor on the Yale Law Journal, experience as a prosecutor and years of service on the federal bench. Yet Judge Sotomayor, President Obama's pick to replace retiring Justice David H. Souter, is not being compared by some conservatives to Princeton/Yale alum Samuel A. Alito Jr., widely acclaimed as smart and qualified when he was nominated. Instead, they are trying to peg her as \\"President Obama's Harriet Miers,\\" after the nominee of President George W. Bush who took herself out of contention as conservatives savaged her reputation and raised doubts about whether she was smart enough for the job. Why is that? After all, Judge Sotomayor boasts the very qualifications that these conservatives claimed Ms. Miers lacked. Ms. Miers was in part lambasted by conservatives -- unfairly, we noted at the time -- because she did not meet the now-cliched criteria of graduation from elite schools and experience as a judge. Judge Sotomayor's educational pedigree is top-notch, and she served six years on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York before spending the past 11 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Ms. Miers, conservative critics complained, lacked a substantial paper trail, leading some to worry about whether she was more liberal than her record let on. Judge Sotomayor can't be tagged as a stealth candidate, given her two-decade track record of opinions on topics as varied as immigration, eminent domain, corporate law and the First Amendment. Because it is difficult to dismiss her academic credentials and her professional experience, some on the right have resorted to the politics of personal destruction. Curt Levey of the Committee for Justice said in a radio interview that Judge Sotomayor was picked because \\"she's a woman and Hispanic, not because she was the best qualified.\\" Former congressman Tom Tancredo sank to even greater depths when he called Judge Sotomayor a \\"racist\\" for her past affiliation with the Hispanic advocacy group, the National Council of La Raza; Mr. Tancredo called La Raza \\"a Latino KKK without the hoods or the nooses.\\" Former Bush adviser Karl Rove implicitly questioned Judge Sotomayor's intelligence, saying in an interview with PBS host Charlie Rose that \\"I know lots of stupid people who went to Ivy League schools.\\" No doubt, but would Mr. Rove have said the same thing in connection with Justice Alito? There are plenty of lines of inquiry that should be explored to better discern Judge Sotomayor's qualifications and judicial philosophy. We look forward to a vigorous debate about Judge Sotomayor's more controversial and consequential cases. We would like to hear more from Judge Sotomayor on how gender and ethnicity might help -- as she put it -- a \\"wise Latina\\" judge come to a \\"better\\" conclusion in some cases than a white, male jurist. (The president recently said Judge Sotomayor regretted her choice of words.) Above all, we'd welcome a confirmation process that sets aside rancid stereotypes and sexist assumptions in order to explore the record and philosophy of a woman whose work could affect the country for some time to come. Do you have a different view of this issue? Debate a member of the editorial board today in the Editorial Judgment discussion group. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses the conservative attacks on Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor's background. Despite her impressive qualifications, such as being a Princeton undergraduate, Yale Law School graduate, and having experience as a prosecutor and a federal judge, some conservatives are attempting to compare her to the failed nominee Harriet Miers. Critics argue that Sotomayor was chosen because of her gender and ethnicity, rather than her qualifications. The article condemns these personal attacks and highlights the importance of a thorough confirmation process that focuses on Judge Sotomayor's qualifications and judicial philosophy, rather than on unfair and baseless comparisons or stereotypes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Towards the end of the war as the role of strategic bombing became more important, a new command for the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific was created to oversee all U.S. strategic bombing in the hemisphere, under United States Army Air Forces General Curtis LeMay. Japanese industrial production plunged as nearly half of the built-up areas of 67 cities were destroyed by B-29 firebombing raids. On 9–10 March 1945 alone, about 100,000 people were killed in a conflagration caused by an incendiary attack on Tokyo. LeMay also oversaw Operation Starvation, in which the inland waterways of Japan were extensively mined by air, which disrupted the small amount of remaining Japanese coastal sea traffic. On 26 July 1945, the President of the United States Harry S. Truman, the President of the Nationalist Government of China Chiang Kai-shek and the Prime Minister of Great Britain Winston Churchill issued the Potsdam Declaration, which outlined the terms of surrender for the Empire of Japan as agreed upon at the Potsdam Conference.

Context: This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now? Question: Who is the hairdresser? Options: A. The narrator's mother B.

Article: A plush penthouse in one of New York's most expensive buildings is headed to foreclosure, signaling new troubles for the high-end real-estate market. The 6,200-square-foot, full-floor unit at One57 is scheduled to go to foreclosure auction next month, according to Bloomberg. The apartment, known as Apartment 79, sold in 2014 for just under 51 million. The identity of the buyer is unknown because it was purchased through an anonymous limited liability corporation called One57 79 Inc. The LLC took out a loan from Luxembourg-based Banque Havilland in 2015. When the borrower defaulted, the bank forced a sale. When it opened in 2014, One57 was the shining symbol of a new class of luxury super-towers in Manhattan. Rising to over 1,000 feet, apartments were selling for nearly 7,000 a square foot, largely to overseas buyers. Billionaire hedge funder Bill Ackman and other partners bought the biggest penthouse for just about 90 million. Yet starting last year, an oversupply of luxury towers and a scarcity of overseas buyers have hurt the top of the market. New development sales fell 25 percent in the latest quarter and units at One57 are selling for discounts of more than 20 percent. The 51 million apartment is scheduled to head to auction on July 19. Another apartment that sold for 21 million at One57 went to foreclosure auction earlier this month, but there's no word yet on the result. ||||| Billionaire’s Row is headed toward Skid Row now that a second luxury condo at 157 W. 57th St. is slated to be sold in a foreclosure auction. The building, known as One 57, is home to the city’s only 100 million condo. It was the city’s tallest residential building for a short time until nearby 432 Park Ave. was completed. The latest unit in the building to hit foreclosure is a full-floor penthouse bought for 50.9 million in 2014 by a mystery buyer who hid the purchase behind an LLC, One57 79 Inc., according to PropertyShark. The foreclosure auction was first reported by Bloomberg. It could be the city’s most expensive residential foreclosure ever. The buyer took out a 35.3 million mortgage from a Luxembourg bank, Banque Havilland SA, in 2015 and never repaid the loan, so the bank is forcing a sale. Last month, The Post reported that a 56th-floor unit at One57 was also slated for a foreclosure auction. Around 30 residential properties in Manhattan have been scheduled to go to foreclosure auction for the first time during the first quarter of 2017, PropertyShark’s Nancy Jorisch told The Post. One57, created by Extell Development’s Gary Barnett, was funded by a subsidiary of an Abu Dhabi company linked to a multibillion-dollar global money-laundering investigation, The Post revealed last year. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A luxury penthouse apartment at One57, one of New York's most expensive apartment buildings, is due for foreclosure next month.

The buyer of Apartment 79, who remains anonymous, purchased the property through an LLC called One57 79 Inc and then defaulted on their loan from Luxembourg-based Banque Havilland, leading the bank to force a sale.

It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French.

But first the movie, it's a typical TV movie version of a play which means it doesn't have the flair of the original film version with William Holden. What they couldn't afford to hire more than twelve people as extras? Why move the movie up to 1966? So you could give the little sister a line about the Vietnam war protests? Why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movement? As for the casting, some hits some misses. Jay O. Sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes. He's believable as an ex-BMOC jock but he doesn't have the raw sensuality of William Holden. I always thought Brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him (pardon the pun). Gretchen Moll was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played. She didn't project the innocence or ignorance that the character required. Maybe it's because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be. But then again Holden was ten years too old. Bonnie Bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and Mary Steenburgen can't seem to make up her mind whether she was playing Blanche duBois or Katharine from \\"The Taming of The Shrew\\". As for Mr. Inge's play, I always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue. \\"The Twilight Zone\\" I believe offer a likely epilogue with the episode, \\"Spur of the Moment\\" where a young Diana Hyland was being chased by a bitter older Diana Hyland, because the younger Diana Hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to Hal Carter.

Inner city areas tend to have higher population densities than outer suburbs, with more of the population living inside multi-floored townhouses and apartment buildings. - Shoreditch is an inner city district in the historic East End of London and modern Central London within the London Borough of Hackney, lying immediately to the north of the City of London. - Founded in 1914 , the Geffrye Museum explores the home from 1600 to the present day . Named after Sir Robert Geffrye , a former Lord Mayor of London and Master of the Ironmongers ' Company , it is located on Kingsland Road in Shoreditch , London . The museum is set in beautiful 18th - century Grade I - listed almshouses of the Ironmongers ' Company , built in 1714 thanks to a bequest by Sir Robert Geffrye . The museum was extended in 1998 with an innovative yet architecturally sympathetic new wing designed by Branson Coates Architects . Surrounding the museum is a walled herb garden , created in 1993 , and a series of period gardens which show how domestic gardens have changed over the last 400 years . The herb and period gardens are open from 1 April to 31 October . Evocative displays of London , middle - class living rooms and gardens illustrate homes and home life through the centuries , reflecting changes in society , behaviour , style and taste . The many aspects of home are brought to life through an imaginative and inspirational programme of special exhibitions and events throughout the year . The museum 's popular Christmas Past exhibition is held annually each winter , with the eleven period rooms authentically decorated for the season . In addition , the museum 's restored 18th - century almshouse , taken back to its original condition and offering a rare glimpse into the lives of London 's poor and elderly in the 1780s and 1880s , is open to the public on specific days . In May 2015 , the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded the Geffrye Museum a grant of £ 11m to support its exciting plans to develop the museum for the future . The museum is now actively fundraising the balance of £ 4m .

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Old Street is a street in central and east London that runs west to east from Goswell Road in Clerkenwell, in the London Borough of Islington, to the crossroads where it meets Shoreditch High Street (south), Kingsland Road (north) and Hackney Road (east) in Shoreditch in the London Borough of Hackney. - Shoreditch High Street is the old main street of Shoreditch, London. It is part of the A10 road and connects Norton Folgate to the south with Kingsland Road to the north. It constitutes a segment of the Roman Ermine Street, which ran directly north from London to Lincoln and York. The parish church of St Leonard's, Shoreditch is situated at the north-east end of the road at the crossroads where it meets with Hackney Road. This part of the road is wholly within the London Borough of Hackney; below Boundary Street, the eastern side lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The high street enters the City of London at Norton Folgate. - An almshouse is charitable housing provided to enable people (typically elderly people who can no longer work to earn enough to pay rent) to live in a particular community. They are often targeted at the poor of a locality, at those from certain forms of previous employment, or their widows, and are generally maintained by a charity or the trustees of a bequest. - A community is commonly considered a social unit (a group of people) who have something in common, such as norms, values, or identity. Often - but not always - communities share a sense of place that is situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood). Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community. People tend to define those social ties as important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions like family, home, work, government, society, or humanity, at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties (micro-level), \\"community\\" may also refer to large group affiliations (or macro-level), such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities. - Hertfordshire (often abbreviated Herts) is a county in southern England, bordered by Bedfordshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Essex to the east, Buckinghamshire to the west and Greater London to the south. For government statistical purposes, it is placed in the East of England region. - Dalston is a district of the London Borough of Hackney in North East London, England. Dalston began as a hamlet within the parish of Hackney, which developed on either side of Dalston Lane. As the area urbanised, the term came to apply to surrounding areas including the old centres of Kingsland and Shacklewell, which are now considered part of Dalston. - Hackney Road is a London arterial route running from Shoreditch Church to Cambridge Heath in the London Borough of Hackney. The route runs between the areas of Bethnal Green and Haggerston. It lies close to the border between the boroughs of London Boroughs of Hackney and Tower Hamlets. - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around 43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century. - Central London is the innermost part of London, England. There is no official definition of its area but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government. - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire.

First question: Why didn't the British invade Nepal during the British Raj in India? Second question: Why was Nepal not colonized by the British, like they did to India? Are these two questions asking the same thing? a). no; b). yes;","completion":"b). yes; Both questions revolve around the core theme of British not colonizing or invading Nepal during the British Raj in India, and they delve into the factors that contributed to this historical outcome. To address the questions, it is important to explore the reasons why Nepal was not colonized by the British. 1. Geographical barriers: Nepal is surrounded by massive mountain ranges such as the Himalayas, making the terrain difficult to maneuver through. This proved to be a large obstacle for the British to invade and successfully conquer the region. 2. Gurkha warriors: The Nepalese Gurkha soldiers were exceptionally skilled and fierce fighters. The British experienced first-hand their prowess during the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814-1816). The British recognized their military strengths, and, instead of invading or subjugating Nepal, formed an alliance that allowed them to recruit Gurkha soldiers into the British army. 3. Treaty of Sugauli (1816): Following the Anglo-Nepalese War, the British and Nepalese signed the Treaty of Sugauli. This treaty provided the British with control over specific territories and a resolution to the conflict between the nations. It created an environment based on mutual respect and a buffer between British India and China, which the British valued. 4. Benefits of a buffer state: As mentioned earlier, the British valued Nepal as a buffer state between their Indian territory and China. Nepal also acted as a barrier against potential Russian influence. There was strategic value in maintaining a friendly relationship with Nepal rather than conquering and incorporating it into the British Empire. 5. Political and diplomatic considerations: The British had their hands full managing the rest of their Indian territory. The administration recognized that the costs and risks associated with the military conquest and governance of Nepal might not outweigh the benefits of colonization. Due to these factors, they chose to preserve diplomatic ties and avoid direct rule. Both questions are essentially examining the same subject, the reasons behind British not colonizing or invading Nepal, but from slightly different angles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ryan didn't take time to eat a healthy breakfast. (B). Jason didn't take time to eat a healthy breakfast.","completion":"Ryan had more energy than Jason because (B) Jason didn't take time to eat a healthy breakfast. A healthy breakfast is essential for providing the body with the necessary nutrients and fuel it needs to kick start the day. It not only replenishes our energy reserves after a long night of sleep, but also helps in maintaining physical and mental well-being throughout the day. In the case of Ryan and Jason, their contrasting levels of energy can be explained by their differing morning routines, specifically, the importance placed on having a nutritious breakfast. Jason, who didn't take time to eat a healthy breakfast, most likely found himself feeling sluggish and low in energy as the day progressed. Breakfast helps in regulating blood sugar levels, and by skipping it, Jason may have experienced energy crashes and mood swings. Moreover, the lack of a balanced breakfast could have caused him to feel hungry later in the day, leading to a higher likelihood of making unhealthy food choices for a quick energy boost, such as consuming high-sugar or high-fat snacks. On the other hand, Ryan ensured that he started his day with a healthy breakfast, which helped him feel satisfied and energized throughout the day. His meal would have contained a good balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats, along with vitamins and minerals that support proper functioning of the body and brain. For instance, complex carbohydrates provide a steady release of energy, proteins help in building and repairing tissues, and healthy fats support brain function and cell growth. As a result of taking the time to prioritize and consume a wholesome breakfast, Ryan was able to better focus on his daily tasks, be more productive, and maintain a positive mood. Moreover, by having the energy to remain physically active, Ryan could engage in physical activities which further boosted his overall well-being. In conclusion, the difference in energy levels between Ryan and Jason can be attributed to their contrasting approaches to breakfast time. While Ryan paid attention to the significance of a proper and nutritious meal, Jason neglected this crucial aspect of a healthy lifestyle. Eating a balanced breakfast has a direct impact on energy levels, mental focus, and mood – attributes which made all the difference between Ryan and Jason's performance throughout the day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer.

An idealistic young Indian man, T.K. Neelan (Rahul Bose) finds himself torn between his ambitions for the future and his loyalty to tradition when people in his village learn of an affair between his British boss and close friend Henry Moores (Linus Roache) and a married village woman Sajani (Nandita Das). Henry and T.K. are working on constructing a road in rural Kerala. The start of the film focuses on the affair between Henry and his house-maid Sajani. They make love near a waterfall, witnessed by two children who flee. Both Henry and Sajani are married to different partners and both know of each other's marriages. Henry's wife Laura and son Peter return from their vacation in England. Sajani is distraught but Henry assures Sajani that she is the one he loves. Sajani's violent husband finds out about her infidelity and brutally beats her. Sajani flees to Henry's house; Henry instructs T.K. to take her away into hiding. T.K tells Sajani never to come back as she is now disgraced and her presence in the village will endanger Henry's life. Sajani does not believe T.K but leaves nonetheless. During this time, resentment towards the British grows stronger; news about an adulterous act between an Indian woman and a British man would be inflammatory. Sajani's love for Henry drives her back to Henry's house. Henry tells her to leave and admits that he does not love her. A distraught Sajani finds T.K's handgun (a gift from Henry), shoots herself in the chest and dies. T.K. and Henry throw her body in the river to conceal her death. Sajani's disappearance garners interest in the village. Sajani's brother Manas and husband gather the men of the village to search the jungle for her.

Options: - vaporate - cool off - form crystals - melt - keep things cold The answer is \\"melt\\" because A:","completion":"If ice is not ice anymore, it has undergone a phase change from a solid state to another state, typically liquid or gas. The answer is \\"melt\\" because: A: When ice absorbs heat, the molecules' kinetic energy increases, causing them to move faster and farther apart from one another. This results in the transition from a solid (ice) to a liquid (water) state, a process that is referred to as \\"melting.\\" The other options provided do not accurately describe what happens to ice when it is no longer in a solid state: 1. Vaporate: The term \\"vaporate\\" may be a misspelling of \\"evaporate,\\" which is a process in which a substance changes from a liquid to a gas state. Evaporation occurs with water, not ice. For ice to evaporate, it first needs to melt into water. 2. Cool off: \\"Cool off\\" implies the removal of heat, which would maintain ice's solid state or even make it colder, not change it into something other than ice. 3. Form crystals: Ice itself is a crystalline solid, so forming crystals is not a process that changes ice into a different state. 4. Keep things cold: This is an action that can be performed using ice – not a process that happens to the ice itself which causes it to become something other than ice. Therefore, among the given options, \\"melt\\" is the most appropriate answer to describe the process where ice changes and is no longer ice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Two American scientists told the people in industrial nations that they would be much healthier if they ate more of the same kind of foods eaten by humans living more than 10,000 years ago. The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on earth, but the way we live has changed greatly. Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in life style and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses. These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times. So they are called \\"diseases of civilization\\". Many cancers and diseases of the blood system, including heart attacks and strokes are examples of such diseases. Scientists noted that early stone-age people used very little alcohol or tobacco, probably none. Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise, but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today. Stone-age people hunted wild animals for their meat, which had much less fat than farm animals. They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables, and fruits. They did not use milk and other dairy products, and they made very little use of grains. But today, we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods. We eat six times more salt than stone-age people. We eat more sugar. We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein and much less vitamin C. People today probably do not want to live as people thousands of years ago did, but scientists say that we would be much healthier if we ate as those ancient people did, cutting the amount of fatty, salty and sweet foods. Options: A Ancient people did a great deal of physical exercise. B People today have a lot of alcohol. C People today have more tobacco. D Food is quite different between life today and life in ancient times. Answer: D Food is quite different between life today and life in ancient times.

Pro-Brexit ministers face Cameron ultimatum The prime minister has told colleagues at the current G7 summit in Bavaria that all ministers will have to toe the official line. Mr Cameron said that unlike Harold Wilson, who allowed Labour ministers to campaign on both sides of a Common Market referendum in 1975, he expected \\"everyone in government\\" to fight on the same side. \\"I've been very clear that if you want to be part of the government, you have to take the view that we are engaged in an exercise of renegotiation, have a referendum and that will lead to a successful outcome,\\" he said. Meanwhile, Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, dismissed demands by some Tory MPs in the new group for the Westminster parliament to have a unilateral veto over any EU law. \\"That's not achievable, that's not negotiable, because that would effectively be the end of the European Union,\\" he told the BBC. He said a group of national parliaments working together should be able to show a \\"red card\\".

(By the way: The plot is so predictable that it does not make any difference if you read this or not anyway) If you are wondering whether to see \\"Coyote Ugly\\" or not: don't! It's not worth either the money for the ticket or the VHS / DVD. A typical \\"Chick-Feel-Good-Flick\\", one could say. The plot itself is as shallow as it can be, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the American Dream. The young good-looking girl from a small town becoming a big success in New York. The few desperate attempts of giving the movie any depth fail, such as the \\"tragic\\" accident of the father, the \\"difficulties\\" of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend, and so on. McNally (Director) tries to arouse the audience's pity and sadness put does not have any chance to succeed in this attempt due to the bad script and the shallow acting. Especially Piper Perabo completely fails in convincing one of \\"Jersey's\\" fear of singing in front of an audience.

However, she ended up going broke because no one could get money to buy. What might her business have been? Here are possible answers to this question: - bunkrupt - real estate - stock market - bank - treasure chest I believe the correct choice is \\"real estate\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The most plausible answer for Sarah's business in this scenario is \\"real estate\\", and there are several reasons for this conclusion. First, real estate is a capital-intensive business, which means that Sarah likely had to invest a significant amount of money upfront to acquire property and develop it. She might have bought land, buildings or both, with the expectation of profiting from rental income, property appreciation, or reselling the assets. In essence, real estate often requires a significant initial investment, which aligns with the fact that Sarah expected a fortune. Second, the real estate market is highly sensitive to economic fluctuations and changes in consumer purchasing power. If, as mentioned in the question, people are unable to get money to buy, it implies an unfavorable economic environment. This could result from factors such as high-interest rates, low wages, or a lack of job opportunities – all of which negatively impact the affordability of property. In such a climate, the demand for property would shrink, causing its value to stagnate or decline. Subsequently, Sarah would have difficulties in leasing or selling her assets, which could result in a significant loss of income. As properties are generally considered to be illiquid and long-term investments, Sarah may have found it difficult to recuperate her losses quickly, leaving her on the verge of bankruptcy. Third, when looking at the other options: - A \\"bunkrupt\\" (sic) does not represent a type of business; it seemingly is a misspelling of the term bankrupt. - The \\"stock market\\" generally refers to the trading of stocks and shares, which would be less applicable as Sarah's primary business. Although investing in stocks can be profitable, it is less likely that her entire fortune would be built around a single stock. - A \\"bank\\" is also an unlikely answer, as it usually serves as a mediator between lenders and borrowers. Banks primarily profit from the spread between the interest they charge on loans and the interest they pay on deposits. This scenario would be less affected by people struggling to get money unless it led to a widespread default on loan repayments. - A \\"treasure chest\\" refers to a container for storing valuables, and it does not represent an actual business venture. In conclusion, based on the provided information and potential answers, the most reasonable choice for Sarah's business would be real estate. This industry's high investment nature, sensitivity to economic fluctuations, and potential impact on her fortune align with the scenario described in the question. Events out of her control, such as an economic downturn, can adversely affect Sarah's business, leading to financial difficulties and ultimately bankruptcy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What if two children push a swing at the same time? Would the swing go higher? Yes, together their force would be more. It is common for forces to be combined. Most objects on Earth have at least two forces acting on them. Do you know what one of them is? Of course, that force is gravity. How many forces do you have on you right now? Gravity pulls you down toward the center of Earth. Your legs exert a downward force. They hold you up against the pull of gravity. Consider the example in Figure 1.3. A book is resting on a table. Gravity pulls the book downward. It has a force of 20 newtons. At the same time, the table pushes the book upward. Its force is also 20 newtons. The table opposes the pull of gravity.

This can be done by subtracting 75 from both sides of the equation. -23 - 75 = -7*r Simplifying the left side gives: -98 = -7*r Step 3: Solve for \\"r\\" To solve for \\"r\\", we need to get rid of the coefficient -7.

The modus operandi of a recent series of robberies leads the police to believe that Robie is active again; they attempt to arrest him, but he gives them the slip. Robie visits a restaurant. The staff are his old gang from his French Resistance days, paroled based on patriotic war work as long as they keep clean.

Robie can prove his innocence if he can catch the new Cat in the act. He enlists the aid of an insurance man, H. H. Hughson (John Williams), who reluctantly obtains a list of the most expensive jewelry owners currently on the Riviera. Widow Jessie Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis) and her daughter Frances (Grace Kelly) top the list. Robie strikes up a friendship with them. Jessie's delighted but Frances offers a pretense of modesty.

Suffering (Pāli: दुक्ख dukkha; Sanskrit दुःख duḥkha) is also a central concept in Buddhism.

The answer to the question: What was the full name of the person who died on 10 October 1646? is inside the article: By the reign of Henry VII the cathedral was complete, appearing much as it does today (though the fittings have changed). From 1508 to 1546, the eminent Italian humanist scholar Polydore Vergil was active as the chapter's representative in London. He donated a set of hangings for the choir of the cathedral. While Wells survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries better than the cathedrals of monastic foundation, the abolition of chantries in 1547 resulted in a reduction in its income. Medieval brasses were sold, and a pulpit was placed in the nave for the first time. Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, William Turner established a herb garden, which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.Elizabeth I gave the chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, creating a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended with the onset of the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailor, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair. The bishop went into retirement and some of the clerics were reduced to performing menial tasks., can you guess it ?

The single, circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in a nucleus, but instead occupies a specific location, the nucleoid, within the cell (Figure 10.2). Although the DNA of the nucleoid is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a compact size, there are no histone proteins and thus no nucleosomes in prokaryotes. The packing proteins of bacteria are, however, related to the cohesin and condensin proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes. The bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell. The starting point of replication, the origin, is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane (Figure 10.15). Replication of the DNA is bidirectional, moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously. As the new double strands are formed, each origin point moves away from the cell wall attachment toward the opposite ends of the cell. As the cell elongates, the growing membrane aids in the transport of the chromosomes. After the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell, cytoplasmic separation begins. The formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called FtsZ directs the partition between the nucleoids. Formation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site. A septum is formed between the nucleoids, extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell. When the new cell walls are in place, the daughter cells separate. Q: The single circular dna chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in what, but instead occupies a specific location called the nucleoid within the cell?

How much time do you have? \\"I can tell you that I don't think there's any other developed country in the world that has remotely the problem we have,\\" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said after the shooting rampage in Colorado. There are an estimated 270 million guns in the hands of civilians in the United States, making Americans the most heavily armed people in the world per capita. Yemen, a tribal nation with no history of strong central government or the rule of law, comes in a distant second. From Washington to the well-stocked shelves of Walmart stores nationwide, guns are regarded in the United States as a commonplace if controversial consumer item for millions of law-abiding hunters, collectors and citizens concerned about their safety. They are also in the hands of thousands of killers too; a Washington-based anti-gun lobby says those guns shoot more than 100,000 people a year. In 2010, there were more than 30,000 deaths caused by firearms when the number of homicides, suicides and accidental deaths are tallied. America's collective memory -- of the Wild West in the 1800s, the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King half a century ago and the front-page news from last week -- is marked time and time again by guns. \\"It's undeniable,\\" writes Clayton Cramer, author of \\"Armed America: the Remarkable Story of How and Why Guns Became as American as Apple Pie.\\" \\"Guns are at the center of much of America's history, its legends, and its horrors.\\" There were guns in America long before the America we know today was even born. Early settlers in several states were required by law to own and maintain weapons as a matter of collective defense. By the time the United States was established, its citizens had taken up arms not only against their Native American neighbors but the army of their own king. Their new constitution reflected that in its Bill of Rights, declaring that \\"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\\" For more than two centuries, that remained an important but largely overlooked guarantee, subjected to a modest series of controls. But in 2008 and 2010, landmark Supreme Court rulings gave that constitutional right sweeping new power, dramatically diminishing the authority of state and local governments to limit gun ownership. Gun-friendly lawmakers have been active, too. Roughly half of the 50 U.S. states have adopted laws allowing gun owners to carry their guns openly in most public places. About as many states have \\"stand your ground\\" laws that allow people to kill if they come under threat, even, in some cases, if they can escape the threat without violence. The laws are being driven by politics, and the politics are being driven by groups such as the National Rifle Association. Once a relatively modest organization of gun enthusiasts and hunters, it has become one of the most powerful political groups in the country. The Washington Post estimates that the NRA succeeded in helping elect four out of every five candidates it endorsed in the most recent congressional election. In addition to that extraordinary impact in Congress, it has been working to overturn gun-control laws in the courts. The NRA and other gun-rights groups have allied themselves with the Republican Party and, especially, a sector of the American public suspicious of government intrusions into private life and often flatly hostile to Washington. Read Dana Bash: For Democrats, gun politics are bad politics. \\"When they tell you that a government ban on certain firearms will somehow make you safer, don't you believe it, not for a second, because it's a lie just like the lies they've told you before,\\" NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre told a recent gathering of his members. \\"Their laws don't work.\\" Poll results suggest most Americans wouldn't agree. CNN and Gallup surveys going back years suggest that Americans are split between those who approve of current gun-control laws and respondents who would like to see them made more restrictive. Americans who'd like no controls at all are a small minority. But even after the rampage in Colorado, American attitudes and laws aren't likely to change much. Last year's nearly fatal shooting of congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords didn't move her state or federal colleagues to adopt any new gun control measures. Both President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney issued statements in the hours after the Colorado shootings, and Sunday, Obama flew to the state to visit with shooting victims and their families. But neither proposed any changes to American attitudes toward guns. \\"You know, soothing words are nice, but maybe it's time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country,\\" said New York's Bloomberg, who is both a declared \\"independent\\" politically and a vocal proponent of gun control. America is not unique. Norwegians are marking the first anniversary of a shooting massacre that took the lives of 69 people at a summer camp outside of Oslo. Eight more people were that day killed by a bomb in the Norwegian capital itself. The confessed killer is awaiting the verdict of his trial. But America seems to be the place the whole world thinks of when apparently ordinary people use guns for grotesque acts of violence. America stands alone in its historic and cultural attachment to guns. America stands armed. Do you own a gun? Tell us why. Opinion: Mass murder and powerful firearms. Opinion: Gun control or carry permits won't stop mass murder. Opinion: Fear drives opposition to gun control. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

They are typically wire antennas multiple wavelengths long, through which the voltage and current waves travel in one direction, instead of bouncing back and forth to form standing waves as in resonant antennas. They have linear polarization (except for the helical antenna). Unidirectional traveling wave antennas are terminated by a resistor at one end equal to the antenna's characteristic resistance, to absorb the waves from one direction. This makes them inefficient as transmitting antennas. Now answer this question: What is the resistor equal to?","completion":"In the context of unidirectional traveling wave antennas, the resistor at one end is equal to the antenna's characteristic impedance or resistance. This resistor serves the purpose of absorbing the voltage and current waves traveling in one direction, preventing reflections and formation of standing waves, which are undesirable in a traveling wave antenna's operation. Characteristic impedance is a crucial parameter in antenna design and is typically represented by the symbol Z₀. It is a measure of the resistance faced by the electromagnetic waves as they travel along the transmission line (or antenna in this case). The characteristic impedance is inherent to the antenna, and it depends on various factors such as the antenna's geometry, materials used, and surrounding environment. Connecting a resistor equal to the characteristic impedance at one end of the traveling wave antenna ensures that the transmitted energy is effectively absorbed with minimal reflections. This termination helps to maintain the desired radiation pattern, achieve broader bandwidth operation, and improve the performance of the antenna. In summary, in unidirectional traveling wave antennas, the resistor at one end is equal to the antenna's characteristic impedance to facilitate the absorption of voltage and current waves traveling in one direction. This termination is crucial for the efficient operation of traveling wave antennas, preventing standing waves and allowing for broader bandwidth functionality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: The United States and Great Britain both prohibited the international slave trade in 1808, but the domestic trade, with sales to the Deep South , expanded dramatically, and many captives were shipped by the coastwise slave trade . Question: when slavery abolished","completion":"The abolishment of slavery in the United States cannot be simply answered with a \\"yes\\" or \\"no,\\" as it requires a more in-depth response to provide an accurate understanding of the historical events surrounding it. Slavery was abolished in the United States in several stages. The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, was an executive order that declared all slaves in the Confederate states to be free. However, this proclamation did not immediately free all slaves, as it only applied to the states in rebellion against the Union and did not pertain to the border states that allowed slavery. The turning point for the nationwide abolishment of slavery came with the passage of the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution. This amendment, ratified on December 6, 1865, decisively abolished slavery throughout the entire United States and its territories, stating: \\"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\\" It is important to note that while the United States and Great Britain both prohibited the international slave trade in 1808, this action did not outlaw slavery itself. Slavery continued to exist, especially in the United States, where the domestic slave trade expanded as demand for slave labor grew in the Deep South due to the expansion of the agricultural economy. The coastwise slave trade facilitated the movement of enslaved people from the northern states to the southern states and further entrenched slavery in the nation. Therefore, to answer the question, \\"When was slavery abolished?\\"—slavery was officially abolished in the United States on December 6, 1865, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For those ages 65 and older, this year's vaccine helped in just 9% of cases against the predominant strain, a percentage deemed to be statistically insignificant by the CDC. Factoring in all ages, the vaccine helped in 56% of cases, which is on the low side historically, reports Reuters. \\"We simply need a better vaccine against influenza, one that works better and lasts longer,\\" says CDC chief Thomas Frieden. Vaccines are generally less effective in older people, but that's not enough to explain the poor showing among seniors, whose hospitalization rates for the flu this year have been especially high, reports AP. Expand this summary.","completion":"USA Today reports that senior citizens, aged 65 and older, may not have benefited much from this year's flu vaccine as it was only effective in 9% of cases against the predominant strain, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This percentage is considered to be statistically insignificant and highlights the need for the development of a more effective vaccine, especially for older individuals who are more susceptible to the virus. This year's vaccine's overall success rate, across all age groups, stands at 56%— a figure that is lower than the historical average. CDC chief Thomas Frieden calls for the creation of a better vaccine against influenza that can provide improved protection and longer-lasting immunity. While it is generally acknowledged that vaccines tend to be less effective in older people due to their weaker immune systems, this alone fails to account for the particularly poor performance of this year's flu vaccine among seniors. The hospitalization rates for senior citizens with the flu have been especially high, notes the Associated Press, underscoring the urgency of creating a more potent vaccine. It is important for researchers and the medical community to continue working towards better understanding the factors that contribute to the reduced effectiveness of vaccines in older individuals and invest more resources into the development of improved flu vaccines. The fact that the flu vaccine worked only modestly well for a majority of the population this year serves as a reminder that it remains crucial for people to take other preventive measures, such as practicing good hand hygiene, avoiding close contact with those who are sick, and staying home when experiencing flu-like symptoms. These precautions can help to prevent the spread of the virus and minimize the health risks associated with the flu. For senior citizens, it is particularly important to remain vigilant in protecting their health during flu season. In addition to receiving the annual flu vaccine, seniors should also focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle by adopting practices such as eating well, getting regular exercise, and obtaining adequate sleep. These habits can help to strengthen the immune system and reduce the likelihood of complications from the flu. Furthermore, healthcare providers need to be proactive in advising their older patients on ways to prevent the flu and to closely monitor their health condition during flu season. This can include recommending antiviral medications in high-risk situations, providing regular check-ups, and ensuring a swift response in the event of flu-related complications. In conclusion, the poor performance of this year's flu vaccine among senior citizens is a cause for concern and underscores the need for the development of more effective vaccines. Meanwhile, the medical community must emphasize the importance of preventive measures, healthcare providers should closely monitor the health of older patients during flu season, and seniors should focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle to reduce the risk of complications from the flu."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Information: - Time Warner, Inc. (also known as AOL Time Warner from 2001-2003; stylized as TimeWarner) is an American multinational media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered in New York City. It is currently the world's third largest entertainment company in terms of revenue, after Comcast and The Walt Disney Company. It was also once the world's largest media conglomerate. Time Warner was first founded in 1990 with the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The current company consists largely of the assets of the former Warner Communications (as well as HBO, a Time Inc. subsidiary prior to the merger), and the assets of Turner Broadcasting (which was acquired by the company in 1996). Time Warner currently has major operations in film and television, with a limited amount in publishing operations. Among its most popular assets are HBO, Turner Broadcasting System, The CW Television Network, Warner Bros., CNN, DC Comics, and as of August 2016, Hulu, owning 10%. In the past, other major divisions of Time Warner included Time Inc., AOL, Time Warner Cable, Warner Books and Warner Music Group. All of these operations were either sold to other investors or spun off as independent companies from 2004 to 2014. - Constipation refers to bowel movements that are infrequent or hard to pass. Constipation is a common cause of painful defecation.

It has a population of approximately 32 million, making it the 42nd most populous country in the world. It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and east; Iran in the west; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in the north; and China in the far northeast. Its territory covers , making it the 41st largest country in the world. - Satellite television is according to \\"article 1.39\\" of the International Telecommunication Unions (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR) a \\"Broadcasting-satellite service\\". - Home Box Office (HBO) is an American premium cable and satellite television network that is owned by Time Warner through its respective flagship company Home Box Office, Inc. Programming featured on the network consists primarily of theatrically released motion pictures and original television series, along with made-for-cable movies and documentaries, boxing matches, and occasional stand-up comedy and concert specials. - Sherwin David \\"Wood\\" Harris (born October 17, 1969) is an American actor. He is best known for his roles as the drug kingpin Avon Barksdale on the HBO crime drama \\"The Wire\\", cocaine dealer Ace in \\"Paid in Full\\" and high school football player Julius Campbell in the 2000 film \\"Remember the Titans\\". - Avon Randolph Barksdale is a fictional character in \\"The Wire\\", played by Wood Harris. Avon is one of the more powerful drug dealers in Baltimore, Maryland, running the Barksdale Organization. His Organization territory is based in the heart of west Baltimore's ghetto, solidifying his power in the drug trade. - Opium (poppy tears, with the scientific name: \\"Lachryma papaveris\\") is the dried latex obtained from the opium poppy (scientific name: \\"Papaver somniferum\\"). Opium latex contains approximately 12 percent of the analgesic alkaloid morphine, which is processed chemically to produce heroin and other synthetic opioids for medicinal use and for the illegal drug trade. The latex also contains the closely related opiates codeine and thebaine, and non-analgesic alkaloids such as papaverine and noscapine. The traditional, labor-intensive method of obtaining the latex is to scratch (\\"score\\") the immature seed pods (fruits) by hand; the latex leaks out and dries to a sticky yellowish residue that is later scraped off and dehydrated. The word \\"meconium\\" (derived from the Greek for \\"opium-like\\", but now used to refer to infant stools) historically referred to related, weaker preparations made from other parts of the opium poppy or different species of poppies. - Boxing is a combat sport in which two people wearing protective gloves throw punches at each other for a predetermined set of time in a boxing ring. - Naltrexone is a medication that reverses the effects of opioids and is used primarily in the management of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence. - Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the microscopic air sacs known as alveoli. Typical signs and symptoms include a varying severity and combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing, depending on the underlying cause. Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and conditions such as autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired with community, hospital, or health care associated pneumonia. Vaccines to prevent certain types of pneumonia are available. Other methods of prevention include handwashing and not smoking. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics. If the pneumonia is severe, the affected person is generally hospitalized. Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low. Pneumonia affects approximately 450 million people globally (7% of the population) and results in about 4 million deaths per year. Pneumonia was regarded by William Osler in the 19th century as \\"the captain of the men of death\\". With the introduction of antibiotics and vaccines in the 20th century, survival improved. Nevertheless, in developing countries, and among the very old, the very young, and the chronically ill, pneumonia remains a leading cause of death. Pneumonia often shortens suffering among those already close to death and has thus been called \\"the old man's friend\\". - Opiates are alkaloid compounds naturally found in the opium poppy plant \\"Papaver somniferum\\". The psychoactive compounds found in the opium plant include morphine, codeine, and thebaine. The term \\"opiate\\" should be differentiated from the broader term \\"opioid,\\" which includes all drugs with morphine-like effects, including opiates, semi-synthetic opioids derived from opiates (such as heroin, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, and oxymorphone), and synthetic opioids which are not derived from opiates (such as fentanyl, buprenorphine, and methadone). All opioids, including the opiates, are considered drugs of high abuse potential and are listed on various \\"Substance-Control Schedules\\" under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act of the United States. - The Barksdale Organization is a fictional drug dealing gang on the television series \\"The Wire\\". Many of the characters featured in season one of The Wire belong to this organization. Season one largely deals with the Baltimore Police Department setting up a Major Crimes Unit to investigate the organization. The Barksdale Organization is led by Avon Barksdale who is portrayed as the most powerful drug kingpin in Baltimore. - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet. - Melvin Douglas \`\` Little Melvin '' Williams ( December 14 , 1941 -- December 3 , 2015 ) was an American actor and criminal . He was known for trafficking heroin in his native Baltimore , Maryland , in the 1970s and 1980s . He appeared as an actor in the HBO series The Wire , which explores many Baltimore - related subjects , including narcotics trafficking , and served as an inspiration for the character of Avon Barksdale . - Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli, such as stubbing a toe, burning a finger, putting alcohol on a cut, or bumping the \\"funny bone\\". Because it is a complex, subjective phenomenon, defining pain has been a challenge. The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: \\"Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.\\" In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition. - Heroin, also known as diamorphine among other names, is an opiate typically used as a recreational drug for its euphoric effects. Medically it is occasionally used to relieve pain and as a form of opioid replacement therapy alongside counseling. Heroin is typically injected, usually into a vein; however, it can also be smoked, snorted or inhaled. Onset of effects is usually rapid and lasts for a few hours. Common side effects include respiratory depression (decreased breathing) and about a quarter of those who use heroin become physically dependent. Other side effects can include abscesses, infected heart valves, blood borne infections, constipation, and pneumonia. After a history of long-term use, withdrawal symptoms can begin within hours of last use. When given by injection into a vein, heroin has two to three times the effect as a similar dose of morphine. It typically comes as a white or brown powder. Treatment of heroin addiction often includes behavioral therapy and medications. Medications used may include methadone or naltrexone. A heroin overdose may be treated with naloxone. An estimated 17 million people as of 2015 use opiates such as heroin, which together with opioids resulted in 122,000 deaths. The total number of opiate users has increased from 1998 to 2007 after which it has remained more or less stable. In the United States about 1.6 percent of people have used heroin at some point in time. When people die from overdosing on a drug, the drug is usually an opioid. Heroin was first made by C. R. Alder Wright in 1874 from morphine, a natural product of the opium poppy. Internationally, heroin is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. It is generally illegal to make, possess, or sell heroin without a license. In 2015 Afghanistan produced about 66% of the world's opium. Often heroin, which is illegally sold, is mixed with other substances such as sugar or strychnine. - David Judah Simon (born February 9, 1960) is an American author, journalist, and a writer/producer of television series.

As noted below, its major effects included updating the Paris Convention of 13 July 1931 to include the vast number of synthetic opioids invented in the intervening thirty years and a mechanism for more easily including new ones. From 1931 to 1961, most of the families of synthetic opioids had been developed, including drugs in whatever way related to methadone, pethidine, morphinans and dextromoramide and related drugs; research on fentanyls and piritramide was also nearing fruition at that point. - The verb license or grant license means to give permission. The noun licence (British, Indian, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Irish, or South African English) or license (American English) refers to that permission as well as to the document recording that permission. - Opioids are substances that act on opioid receptors to produce morphine-like effects. Opioids are most often used medically to relieve pain, and by people addicted to opioids. Opioids include , an older term that refers to such drugs derived from , including morphine itself. Other opioids are semi-synthetic and synthetic drugs such as hydrocodone, oxycodone and fentanyl; antagonist drugs such as naloxone and endogenous peptides such as the endorphins. The terms and are sometimes encountered as synonyms for opioid. is properly limited to the natural alkaloids found in the resin of the opium poppy although some include semi-synthetic derivatives. , derived from words meaning or , as an American legal term, refers to cocaine and opioids, and their source materials; it is also loosely applied to any illegal or controlled psychoactive drug. In other jurisdictions all controlled drugs are legally classified as \\"narcotics\\". The term can have pejorative connotations and its use is generally discouraged where that is the case. Primarily used for pain relief, including anesthesia they are also used to suppress cough, suppress diarrhea, treat addiction, reverse opioid overdose, and suppress opioid induced constipation. Extremely strong opioids are approved only for veterinary use such as immobilizing large mammals. Opioids act by binding to opioid receptors, which are found principally in the central and peripheral nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. These receptors mediate both the psychoactive and the somatic effects of opioids. Opioid drugs include partial agonists and antagonists, which produce moderate or no effect (respectively) but displace other opioids from binding in those receptors. The side effects of opioids may include itchiness, sedation, nausea, respiratory depression, constipation, and euphoria. Tolerance and dependence will develop with continuous use, requiring increasing doses and leading to a withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt discontinuation. The euphoria attracts recreational use, and...

At 9:59, an Air Force lieutenant colonel working in the White House Military Office joined the conference and stated he had just talked to Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. The White House requested (1) the implementation of continuity of government measures, (2) fighter escorts for Air Force One, and (3) a fighter combat air patrol over Washington, D.C. By 10:03, when United 93 crashed in Pennsylvania, there had been no mention of its hijacking and the FAA had not yet been added to the teleconference. The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: \\"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\\" The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening. The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes, while the children continued reading.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Q: My daughter is a junior in high school and has been on an individualized education program since fourth grade. She plans to go to college and intends to finish with a master's degree. Her performance in general is fairly good, but test scores are very low. She has held many leadership and volunteer positions. We have been advised to have her write an essay about how her learning disability is a barrier that she has to get over. Will that help or hurt her chances for admission? ---- Deborah A: First let me answer the question on low standardized test scores (ACT/SAT). There are hundreds of colleges that are \\"test optional\\" which means students can choose not to release their test scores in the application process. Admission decisions at these colleges for students who do not submit their test scores are made based on other factors. A list of test optional colleges can be found at fairtest.org. It is important, however, to make sure that the college is the right fit academically regardless of the test optional policy. You also asked if your daughter should write about her disability and if this would hurt her chances of being admitted. Please know that colleges do not deny admission based on disability. \\"Disclosing\\" a learning disability in a personal statement within the college application can certainly help. By writing a personal statement, students can potentially _ , for example, their understanding of the challenge they face. They might also prove an improved grade trend in that subject area, and show interest in more complex courses in spite of this disability. More importantly, a student disclosure can show self-confidence, motivation and an understanding of the disability. ---- Ms. Kravis Options: A She is applying for a master's degree. B She is very active in her high school. C Her disability prevents her studying well. D She has difficulty getting over her learning disability. Answer: B She is very active in her high school.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Sousveillance is the recording of an activity by a participant in the activity, typically by way of small wearable or portable personal technologies. The term \\"sousveillance\\", coined by Steve Mann, stems from the contrasting French words \\"sur\\", meaning \\"above\\", and \\"sous\\", meaning \\"below\\", i.e. \\"surveillance\\" denotes the \\"eye-in-the-sky\\" watching from above, whereas \\"sousveillance\\" denotes bringing the camera or other means of observation down to human level, either physically (mounting cameras on people rather than on buildings), or hierarchically (ordinary people doing the watching, rather than higher authorities or architectures doing the watching). - The Corps of Royal Marines (RM) is the United Kingdom's amphibious light infantry force, forming part of the Naval Service, along with the Royal Navy. The Royal Marines were formed in 1755 as the Royal Navy's infantry troops. However, the marines can trace their origins back to the formation of the English Army's \\"Duke of York and Albany's maritime regiment of Foot\\" at the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company on 28 October 1664. - The Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1537 by King Henry VIII and is considered one of the oldest military organisations in the world. Today it is a registered charity whose purpose is to attend to the \\"better defence of the realm\\", this purpose is primarily achieved by the support of the HAC Regiment and a detachment of Special Constabulary to the City of London Police. The word \\"artillery\\" in \\"Honourable Artillery Company\\" does not have the current meaning that is generally associated with it, but dates from a time when in the English language that word meant any projectile, including for example arrows shot from a bow. The equivalent form of words in modern English would be either \\"Honourable Infantry Company\\" or \\"Honourable Military Company.\\" - Behavior is the range of actions and mannerisms made by individuals, organisms, systems, or artificial entities in conjunction with themselves or their environment, which includes the other systems or organisms around as well as the (inanimate) physical environment. It is the response of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs, whether internal or external, conscious or subconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary. - The 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group is a Royal Marines unit of the British Armed Forces . The unit resources include communications , information operations , information systems , intelligence , surveillance , and Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance ( ISTAR ) . It is a redesignation of the former brigade headquarters battalion , the UK Landing Force Command Support Group , which was previously known as HQ & Signals Squadron RM. The unit 's title harks back to the original 30 Commando ( which in turn became 30 Assault Unit RM ) , formed in 1942 . This unit was tasked to move ahead of advancing Allied forces , or to undertake covert infiltrations into enemy territory by land , sea or air , to capture much needed intelligence , in the form of codes , documents , equipment or enemy personnel . In 2013 , 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group were granted the freedom of Littlehampton , West Sussex , in honour of the original unit being based in the town during the Second World War . - The Crown dependencies are three territories of the United Kingdom: the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, and the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel. Being independently administered jurisdictions, they do not form part of either the United Kingdom or the British Overseas Territories. They are self-governing possessions of the Crown (defined uniquely in each jurisdiction). Internationally, the dependencies are considered \\"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\\" rather than as sovereign states. As a result, they are not member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. However, they do have a relationship with the Commonwealth, the European Union, and other international organisations and are members of the BritishIrish Council. They are not part of the European Union (EU), although they are within the EU's customs area. - The British Armed Forces form the military of the United Kingdom, tasked with defence of the country, its overseas territories, and the Crown dependencies. They also promote the UK's wider interests, support international peacekeeping efforts, and provide humanitarian aid. - The English Army existed while England was an independent state and was at war with other states, but it was not until the Interregnum and the New Model Army (raised by Parliament to defeat the Royalists in the English Civil War) that England acquired a peacetime professional standing army. At the restoration of the monarchy, Charles II kept a small standing army, formed from elements of the Royalist army in exile and elements of the New Model Army, from which the most senior regular regiments of today's British Army can trace their antecedence. Likewise, Royal Marines can trace their origins back to the formation of the English Army's \\"Duke of York and Albany's maritime regiment of Foot\\" at the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company on 28 October 1664. - Postal interception is the act of retrieving another person's mail for the purpose of ensuring that the mail is not delivered to the recipient, or to spy on them. - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Light infantry (or skirmishers) are soldiers whose job was to provide a skirmishing screen ahead of the main body of infantry, harassing and delaying the enemy advance. Light infantry was distinct from medium, heavy or line infantry. Heavy infantry were dedicated primarily to fighting in tight formations that were the core of large battles. Light infantry fought in open-order, often in close co-ordination with heavy infantry, where they could screen the heavy infantry from harassing fire, and the heavy infantry could intervene to protect the light infantry from attacks of enemy heavy infantry or cavalry. Heavy infantry originally had heavier arms and more armour than light infantry, but this distinction was lost as the use of armour declined and gunpowder weapons became standardized. - Humanitarian aid is material and logistic assistance to people in need. It is usually short-term help until the long-term help by government and other institutions replaces it. Among the people in need belong homeless, refugees, victims of natural disasters, wars and famines. The primary purpose of humanitarian aid is to save lives, reduce suffering and respect to human dignity. Humanitarian aid is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises including natural disasters and man-made disaster. The primary objective of humanitarian aid is to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity. It may therefore be distinguished from development aid, which seeks to address the underlying socioeconomic factors which may have led to a crisis or emergency. - Peacekeeping refers to activities intended to create conditions that favor lasting peace. Research generally finds that peacekeeping reduces civilian and battlefield deaths and reduces the risk of renewed warfare. - Surveillance (or ) is the monitoring of the behavior, activities, or other changing information, usually of people for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting them. This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment (such as CCTV cameras), or interception of electronically transmitted information (such as Internet traffic or phone calls); and it can include simple, no- or relatively low-technology methods such as human intelligence agents and postal interception. The word \\"\\" comes from a French phrase for \\"watching over\\" (\\"sur\\" means \\"from above\\" and \\"veiller\\" means \\"to watch\\"), and is in contrast to more recent developments such as sousveillance. - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service. - A troop is a military sub-subunit, originally a small formation of cavalry, subordinate to a squadron. In many armies a troop is the equivalent element to the infantry section or platoon. Exceptions are the Royal Horse Artillery and the US Cavalry, where troops are subunits that compare to an infantry company or artillery battery. - Internet traffic is the flow of data across the Internet. What is the relationship between '30 commando information exploitation group' and 'naval service'? Answer:","completion":"The 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group is a Royal Marines unit of the British Armed Forces. The Naval Service, which consists of the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines, is a part of the British Armed Forces tasked with defending the country, its overseas territories, and the Crown dependencies. Therefore, the relationship between the 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group and the Naval Service is that the 30 Commando is a unit within the Royal Marines, which in turn falls under the larger umbrella of the Naval Service."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, if the exhausted runner had the misfortune to bring the pharaoh unhappy news, his head was cut off Shades of that spirit spread over today's conversations. Once a friend and I packed up some peanut, butter and sandwiches for an outing. As we walked light-heartedly out the door, picnic basket in hand, a smiling neighbor looked up at the sky and said, \\"Oh boy, bad day for a picnic. The weatherman says it's going to rain.\\" I wanted to strike him in the face with the peanut butter and sandwiches. Not for his stupid weather report, but for his smile. Several months ago I was racing to catch a bus. As I breathlessly put my handful of cash across the Greyhound counter, the sales agent said with a broad smile. \\"Oh that bus left five minutes ago.\\" Dreams of head cutting! It's not the news that makes someone angry. It's the unsympathetic attitude with which it's delivered. Everyone must give bad news from time to time, and winning professionals do it with the proper attitude. A doctor advising a patient that she needs an operation does it in a caring way. A boss informing an employee he didn't get the job takes on a sympathetic tone. Big winners know, when delivering any bad news, they should share the feeling of the receiver. Unfortunately, many people are not aware of this. When you're tired from a long flight, has a hotel clerk cheerfully said that your room isn't ready yet? When you had your heart set on the toast beef, has your waiter merrily told you that he just served the last piece? It makes you, as traveler or diner, want to land your fist fight on their unsympathetic faces. Had my neighbor told me of the upcoming rainstorm with sympathy, I would have appreciated his warning.

The Trevi Fountain, or \\"Fontana di Trevi\\" in Italian, is an iconic symbol of the city, located in the Trevi district of Rome. This Baroque-style masterpiece was designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini in 1762. The fountain is an amalgamation of art, history, and legend. The central figure of the sculpture portrays Oceanus, the Titan god of water in ancient Roman mythology. This water deity is escorted by two Tritons, who are depicted as guiding the shell-shaped chariot through the water. They embody the contrasting moods of the sea, with one taming a more spirited seahorse, while the other steers its calm counterpart. To the sides, Abundance and Salubrity signify the fountain's purpose of ensuring a continued supply of water to the city. The Eternal City, Rome, is a historical and cultural treasure trove, with attractions catering to a diverse range of interests. From ancient sites such as the Colosseum, Pantheon, and the Roman Forum, to piazzas teeming with life and beauty like Piazza Navona and Piazza di Spagna, there is no shortage of sights to explore. Moreover, the spiritual significance of Rome is evident in the presence of the Vatican City - the heart of the Roman Catholic Church. As home to both St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, adorned with Michelangelo's awe-inspiring ceiling frescoes, the Vatican holds immense cultural and religious importance. Besides these well-known attractions, Rome also offers exquisite dining experiences featuring authentic Italian cuisine, vibrant nightlife, and shopping opportunities. From gelaterias offering mouthwatering gelato flavors to world-famous fashion houses situated in the city's elegant streets, there is always something to suit every taste in Rome.

Choices: - affecting systems - nervous systems - immune systems - reproductive systems A: Answer:","completion":"Examples of organ systems in a human include the skeletal, nervous, and immune systems, as well as reproductive systems. Skeletal System: The skeletal system comprises of bones, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments. It provides structural support, protection, and stability for the human body. The skeletal system's primary functions include supporting the body's weight, facilitating movement by working with muscles, protecting vital organs such as the brain, spinal cord, heart, and lungs, producing blood cells through bone marrow, and serving as a mineral and energy reserve. Nervous System: The nervous system is a complex network of nerves and specialized cells called neurons that transmit signals between different parts of the body. It has two main components: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain and spinal cord, and it acts as the body's control center, processing information from the senses, coordinating movement, and controlling physiological functions. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the CNS to the body's muscles, glands, and sensory receptors, enabling the central nervous system to communicate with the rest of the body. Immune System: The immune system defends the body against infections, diseases, and foreign substances. It consists of a complex network of cells, tissues, organs, and molecules that work together to recognize and eliminate harmful substances or pathogens like bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The immune system has two primary components: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. The innate immune system is the body's first line of defense, providing immediate, non-specific protection against pathogens. The adaptive immune system is responsible for specific, long-term defense against specific pathogens and involves the production of antibodies and the activation of immune cells. Reproductive System: The reproductive system in humans is responsible for the production, development, and maturation of gametes (sperm and eggs) and the fertilization process, which leads to the development of a new individual. In males, the reproductive system includes the testes, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and penis. These structures are involved in the production, transport, and release of sperm. In females, the reproductive system includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina. These structures are involved in the production and maturation of eggs, fertilization, and development of the embryo and fetus during pregnancy. In conclusion, the human body consists of various organ systems that perform essential functions for maintaining life, such as the skeletal, nervous, immune, and reproductive systems. Each of these systems plays a crucial role in various aspects of the organism's overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A hero American diver who helped in the search for the body of a senior government minister killed in a plane crash in the Philippines last year has been murdered with a shotgun blast in the face. Matthew Caldwell, 59, who had joined two British divers in the search and recovery of the body of Interior Secretary Jessie Robredo was hit at point blank range with a 12-gauge shotgun, said Senior Superintendent Adolfo Samala of Las Pinas police. Mr Caldwell, who was living in the Philippines, was a member of the Philippine Coast Guard Auxilliary and was widely recognised for his courage. Deep sea diver: Matthew Caldwell, 59, who was living in the Philippines, was a member of the Philippine Coast Guard Auxilliary and was widely recognised for his courage. He was among the first to be called upon in August last year when a Piper Seneca plane carrying Mr Robredo crashed in the waters off Masbate. Because of the great depth at which the aircraft was believed to be lying, Mr Caldwell's skills, along with those of two unidentified British divers, were required to search for the wreckage. Local hero: Caldwell joined two British divers in the search and recovery of the body of Interior Secretary Jessie Robredo (pictured), who died when his plane crashed in the waters of Masbate. He had attended a meeting of the coast guard on Thursday night when shortly afterwards he became involved in an argument with a security guard as he and his live-in partner, Miss Jeanelyn Flora, 36, were heading to their home in Las Pinas, five miles south of Manila. According to police the security guard, named as Ericson Elacquio, prevented Mr Caldwell from entering his road because he said the American had not paid monthly dues to the homeowners' association. When the guard continued to refuse to raise a wooden beam blocking the road, Mr Caldwell got out of his Toyota Corolla and tried to raise the barrier himself. It was then, as tempers flared, said Superintendent Samala, that the security guard raised his shotgun and fired it straight into Mr Caldwell's face, killing him instantly. The guard and a companion commandeered a motor cycle and spend off into the night. 'We have launched a major search for him,' said Superintendent Samala. 'We are confident we will find him.' As well as helping to locate the wreckage of the aircraft carrying Mr Robredo, Mr Caldwell had previously been involved in recovering bodies from a sunken wood-hulled passenger ship, the Catalyn B., which collied with a steel-hulled fishing vessel on Christmas Even, 2009.","completion":"A brave American diver named Matthew Caldwell, who once helped find a missing important person in a plane crash, was sadly killed in the Philippines.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Native American sand paintings are a very beautiful and popular art form for collectors today. But traditionally, the paintings are created to heal a person during a ceremony. The type of image and ceremony used is determined by the disease which the person is suffering from. The sand painting may contain an image of the Holy People. The tribe medicine man may ask the Holy People to help him paint the image and therefore help heal the person in need. When the medicine man finishes painting, he checks its accuracy. The order and the symmetry of the painting symbolize the harmony which a patient wishes to achieve in his or her life. The accuracy of a sand painting is believed to determine its healing effects. In some cases, more than one sand painting might be used in a healing ceremony. During the ceremony, the person who needs healing will sit on the Native American sand painting. The sand painting serves as an entrance for the spirits and through the painting, the person can absorb the healing energies from these spirits. The sand paintings were not originally meant to be sold or hung on the wall. Once the ceremony is completed, the sand painting must be destroyed, thus allowing the sand to return to the Earth. This is necessary because the sand painting is now seen as poisonous, having absorbed the illness, and must be destroyed. The entire ceremony, from the painting to the destroying is usually completed within a 12-hour period. The medicine man never wrote down how to perform the healing ceremony, but it was passed down from generation to generation. The Pueblo tribe was the first tribe to create Native American sand paintings, but the art soon spread to many other tribes. Today, it is the Navajos who are the most active in creating Native American sand paintings. It is believed that it was a medicine man named Fred Stevens who was the first person to create a Native American sand painting for sale in the 1950s. A trader, Rex Bollin, recommended Fred to sell sand paintings since they were so beautiful.... Question: Why would people destroy the sand paintings after the healing ceremony? Options: A: Because the paintings are useless after the ceremony. B: Because people don't know how to keep the paintings for long. C: Because the paintings are believed to contain illnesses. D: Because the paintings are believed to contain the spirit of God.

Ottawa (CNN)Christianne Boudreau's voice wavers slightly as she recounts how her little boy became an ISIS militant. Every word seems tinged with anger and regret, but most of all, purpose. The process of radicalization is gradual and persuasive, she said. And deadly. Her son, who joined ISIS's ranks in Syria, was killed in fighting there more than a year ago. \\"It's so easy for them to get to our children, to access our children,\\" she said. Boudreau's son, Damian Clairmont, converted to Islam after a troubling period in high school in Calgary, Canada. The mother remembers her son's religion bringing him peace. She didn't suspect anything when Clairmont told her he was leaving for Egypt to study Arabic. Canadian security officials came to her door in 2013, breaking the news that Clairmont was suspected of being a militant and was likely in Syria, not in","completion":"Egypt as he had claimed. Shock and disbelief soon gave way to despair as Boudreau realized the extent of her son's deception and his involvement with ISIS. The once-apprehensive mother grappled with the escalating situation, struggling to comprehend how her child had been led down this dark path. Damian Clairmont's radicalization began soon after his conversion. He reportedly attended a mosque in Calgary, where he was introduced to the ISIS ideology. The radical teachings exploited his vulnerabilities, altering his perception and filling him with extremist beliefs. The allure of camaraderie and the prospect of a utopian Islamic society lured him away from his family. As Boudreau spent sleepless nights worrying about her son, she reached out to other families who had experienced similar heartache. Through her extensive research and interactions, Boudreau gained insight into the tactics employed by extremist groups to lure in vulnerable individuals, particularly Western youth. Additionally, she began to recognize the warning signs of radicalization, which she had missed in Damian's case. Desperate to bring attention to this epidemic, Boudreau started sharing her story with anyone willing to listen. She sought to raise awareness of the deceptive tactics employed by radical groups and demonstrated the need for better early-intervention programs. Boudreau ultimately became an advocate in the fight against radicalization by founding a support organization that helps families prevent their loved ones from falling into the hands of extremist groups. Boudreau's work is a testament to her tireless efforts in preventing radicalization and assisting families in coping with their grief. Her message acts as a warning to parents everywhere: it can happen to anyone. She emphasizes the importance of open communication with children, fostering safe spaces for dialogue, and addressing misconceptions about religion and culture. Today, Christianne Boudreau is a driving force in combating radicalization. She pushes for the development of deradicalization programs, educates parents and communities about the warning signs, and equips them with the necessary tools to intervene before it's too late. Boudreau's life has undoubtedly been changed by the loss of her son, but her purpose remains steadfast: to prevent other families from enduring a similar tragedy. As the global community continues to grapple with the ever-evolving threat of extremist ideologies, Boudreau's story serves as a poignant reminder of the human aspect behind the headlines. It emphasizes the critical need for a multifaceted approach to combat radicalization and highlights the vital role played by families and communities in this ongoing battle. Her resolve, forged from grief, is a powerful instrument in steering youth away from the clutches of extremist groups and towards a future unblemished by their influence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This new music resonates with her fans, who become inspired by her resilience and raw vulnerability. Hilary's viral cardiomyopathy continues to progress, with medical treatments generating limited progress. As her health reaches an all-time low, she is placed on the waiting list for a heart transplant. Time is running out, but hope flickers as she and Jason remain determined to make the most of whatever life has left in store. In the climax, Hilary undergoes a risky heart transplant surgery, and while her survival is not guaranteed, we see her immense courage and strength in facing the unknown. The film ends with Hilary in recovery, uncertain of her future but more alive than ever, as her connection with Jason and her undying love for music continue to fuel her spirit. \\"Fading Beats\\" is an emotional and inspiring film that explores the struggles of living with a chronic illness and the unwavering power of love and passion to help one rise above life's challenges.

In November 2006, the duo performed at several venues, including Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne as well as numerous tour dates throughout 2007. In 2008, Sasha and Digweed kicked off an American tour with a performance at the Winter Music Conference. The duo played at mainly larger venues on the weekends and smaller (750-1000 people) shows on weekdays. Sasha described their music as \\"driving and dark\\" with \\"a little throwback of Twilo sounds\\".Sasha runs a music studio and lives in New York City, and maintains a house in London. He brings his wife with him on his frequent tours. Sasha finds the constant touring to be physically tiring, though he also feels that he thrives on it. While fans may regard Sasha to be a DJ \\"hero\\", he is uneasy with fame; Sasha considers himself \\"shy at heart\\" and is typically uncomfortable discussing his personal life. He has mentioned on numerous occasions that he is so busy with DJing and production that he rarely has any free time.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: obscene and non-obscene. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency, for example because it too obviously relates to sex or contains language regarded as taboo in polite usage. Problem:Comment: Maybe there needs to be a Nationwide sweep to squash all the gangs like a swarm of biting ants into the pavement! Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Define the categories - obscene and non-obscene. Usage: Obscene comments are offensive to the public sense of decency and may relate to sex or contain taboo language. Non-obscene comments do not meet these criteria. In this case, the comment does not contain any offensive or taboo language and is non-obscene. Part #2: Determine if the comment is offensive to the public sense of decency. Usage: In the given comment, the author expresses the need for a nationwide sweep to eliminate gangs. Although the comparison to \\"biting ants\\" and \\"pavement\\" could be considered violent imagery, the comment isn't offensive to public decency as it concerns a societal issue. Thus, it is not obscene. Part #3: Check if the comment obviously relates to sex. Usage: The comment does not contain any content that relates to sex. It discusses the issue of gangs. Therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria of an obscene comment in this regard. Part #4: Check if the comment contains taboo language. Usage: The comment includes words like \\"nationwide sweep,\\" \\"squash,\\" \\"gangs,\\" and \\"biting ants.\\" None of these words are considered taboo language. Thus, this comment doesn't contain any taboo language and is not obscene.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Generate a question that has the following answer: Eugene for the following movie plot: Long ago, a drop of sunlight became a golden flower capable of healing illness, decay and injury. For hundreds of years the flower is used by Mother Gothel to retain her youth until it is discovered by soldiers of a nearby kingdom, Corona. They use the flower to heal their ailing queen, who soon afterwards gives birth to Princess Rapunzel. While attempting to recover the flower, Gothel discovers that Rapunzel's hair has the flower's healing properties. However, attempting to take just the hair by cutting a piece from it destroys its power, and so she kidnaps Rapunzel and raises her as her own daughter in an isolated tower. Once a year, the King and Queen release sky lanterns on Rapunzel's birthday, hoping for their daughter's return. Nearing her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel asks Gothel for permission to leave the tower and discover the source of the lanterns, but Gothel refuses, telling her that the outside world is a dangerous place. Elsewhere, a thief known as Flynn Rider has stolen Rapunzel's crown from the kingdom and inadvertently discovers the tower after ditching his cohorts, the Stabbington brothers. Rapunzel captures Flynn and discovers the crown, but is unaware of its significance. Rapunzel plans to show Flynn to Gothel in order to prove she can take care of herself, but when Gothel becomes enraged at Rapunzel's insistent desire to leave, she asks for a special paint that will take Gothel three days' round trip to obtain and return. Gothel agrees and departs. Rapunzel convinces Flynn to escort her to see the lanterns in exchange for the crown. During their excursion, Flynn takes Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling, a pub filled with the frightening people Gothel warned Rapunzel about, but who instead are charmed by Rapunzel's innocence. When the royal soldiers appear searching for Flynn, the pub regulars help the pair escape. The soldiers give chase, led by Maximus, one of the lead horses in the royal army, and locate them at a dam. The dam is inadvertently breached, and the resulting deluge traps...

Here is a news article: In a profanity-laced interview in the new NME, recently hatched pop icon Lady Gaga had some strong words for anyone who thinks her song \\"Born This Way\\" sounds a lot like Madonna's \\"Express Yourself.\\" The very notion, in fact, is downright \\"retarded,\\" and any co-writing credit should go to Capital H-I-M. When the interviewer first broached the tender subject — observing that \\"a bit of ['Born This Way'] does sound quite a lot\\" like Madonna's song — Gaga vehemently denied having knowingly referenced it, saying, \\"I am not stupid enough to put out a record and be that moronic.\\" But the interviewer pressed on, and that's when she really went off: No. Listen to me. Why the f**k? I'm a songwriter...Why would I try to put out a song and think I'm getting one over on everybody? That's retarded. If you put the songs next to each other, side by side, the only similarities are the chord progression. It's the same on that's been in disco music for the last 50 years. Just because I'm the first f**king artist in 25 years to think of putting it on Top 40 radio, it doesn't mean I'm a plagiarist. It means I'm f**king smart. Sorry. The reporter then changed the subject to Gaga's new single, \\"Judas.\\" But the singer, now in tears, only wanted to talk about \\"Born This Way.\\" I feel like honestly that God sent me those lyrics and that melody...There's no way for something that pure to be wrong. Not to add yet another sermon, but it's getting a little difficult to stay sympathetic to Gaga's divine cause when she casually throws around terms like \\"retarded.\\" Last time I checked, the intellectually disabled were born that way, too.

Scott read more about nitrogen-fixating and sulfate-reducing bacteria, while his colleague Brett read more about non-respiratory anaerobe bacteria and facultative anaerobes. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student read less about the production of the highly toxic dimethylmercury? Hint: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: A treatment plan should be tailored to your condition, physical and mental health history. It may use detoxification, behavioural or other counselling, medication, evaluation, and follow up treatment. A treatment plan should help you to stop using drugs, stay drug free, and live the life you want to live. Your doctor should ask you about substance abuse in a non-judgemental manner, and try to learn more about your quantity, frequency, duration, and route of administration of drug. If you do not have an insurance plan, you can still find medical attention for drug rehabilitation. Finding medical help without insurance is more difficult but entirely feasible. Go to a community health care clinic. Community health care clinics offer services that are just as good as the private health care clinics. They have sliding scales so that you pay what you can afford. Find a cash based medical provider. There are doctors who work on a cash only system. Since they do not have to deal with the insurance bureaucracy, they can sometimes pass along savings to the customer. Use web based tools to find a doctor you can afford. For instance, you can use the OkCopay website to search for a doctor that meets your needs and price range. Consider the location, price, duration, and style of treatment at the facility. Some recovery facilities are focused on the spiritual aspects of addiction. A medical model is emphasized at other facilities. Look into whether your insurance policy covers drug rehabilitation programs. Rehabilitation can be difficult to get coverage for under your insurance. Talk to your insurance provider, especially if you have a dual diagnosis of psychiatric and substance abuse, which is common. If so, then your insurance policy is more likely to cover the costs. Consider whether you need a place that addresses both spiritual and medical aspects of your condition. This form of therapy emphasizes the need to learn new skills and behaviors in the recovery process. Cognitive-behavioral therapy empowers the individual with effective ways of coping with the urge to take drugs. The skills learned during this form of therapy can be retained years after recovery has been completed. Behavioral therapy can also help you avoid triggers. It can help you cope with and avoid the people, places, and things you associate with taking drugs. It can help to talk to people who are going through similar experiences. There are many support groups for people who are trying to overcome drug abuse. People who participate in support groups are typically more likely to remain clean and sober because it allows them to surround themselves with non-users. Cocaine Anonymous is a support group for people who want to get clean from cocaine and other mind altering substances. Check out a meeting in your area. Narcotics Anonymous is a support group for people wishing to recover from narcotics. The only requirement to join is a desire to stop using drugs. Nicotine Anonymous is a support group for people hoping to quit smoking and nicotine addiction.","completion":"A treatment plan for drug rehabilitation should be customized to an individual's condition, considering their physical and mental health history. Detoxification, counseling, medication, evaluation, and follow-up treatments are all potential components of a plan. The aims are to stop drug use, maintain a drug-free life, and achieve personal goals. Doctors should approach the topic sensitively and inquire about drug use details. Lack of insurance shouldn't deter someone from seeking help; options include community health care clinics with sliding payment scales, cash-based medical providers, and web-based tools to find affordable doctors. It's essential to consider factors like location, cost, treatment duration, and treatment style when choosing a facility. Furthermore, explore the extent of insurance coverage for rehabilitation, as psychiatric conditions may increase the likelihood of approval. Therapies can address spiritual, medical, and behavioral aspects of addiction, teaching coping strategies and trigger avoidance. Support groups, such as Cocaine Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and Nicotine Anonymous, can help individuals overcome addiction by connecting them with others experiencing similar challenges."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],R={key:0},N={key:1};function j(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
