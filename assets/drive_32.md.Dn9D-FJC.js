Unaware of the history that lurks within the walls, Tom eagerly moves in, planning to restore the house to its former glory. His best friend, Barnaby, an ambitious and enigmatic archaeologist, excitedly offers to help Tom uncover the mansion's hidden secrets. As the two friends embark on their renovations, they stumble upon a series of spine-chilling events that lead them to believe the house is haunted. Barnaby becomes increasingly obsessed with unraveling the supernatural phenomena, much to Tom's concern. As they dig deeper, they discover that the house once belonged to a notorious spiritualist named Tom-Tom, who was believed to have used the mansion as a secret chamber to perform dark rituals. Tom begins to experience disturbing nightmares and encounters with malevolent apparitions. His mental and physical health starts to deteriorate. Barnaby, increasingly consumed by his own obsession with Tom-Tom's dark legacy, becomes distant and secretive. One day, he mysteriously disappears, leaving Tom utterly confused and terrified. Desperate and alone, Tom hires a psychic medium, Cassandra, to help him uncover the truth behind the hauntings. As they explore the house, they find a hidden room, a chamber where Tom-Tom held séances and communicated with spirits. Inside, they discover a journal unveiling Tom-Tom's sinister intentions – he had been trying to open a portal to the spirit world, intending to unleash its dark forces upon the living. Cassandra reveals a shocking truth: Barnaby, a secret admirer of Tom-Tom's work, had been using Tom and his inherited house as a means to continue Tom-Tom's experiments. Believing Tom's tormented state would make him a perfect vessel for the spirits, Barnaby locks him up in Tom-Tom's hidden chamber. Fighting against time, Tom and Cassandra must now work together to stop Barnaby's malevolent plot and save Tom from the diabolical spirits that threaten to consume him. As they unravel the dark secrets of Tom-Tom's house, they discover a powerful bond that connects them to each other and the spirits that haunt the mansion. In a thrilling climax, Cassandra's psychic abilities and Tom's determination force Barnaby to confront the dark forces he unleashed. Together, they succeed in closing the mysterious portal, trapping Barnaby within the spirit world where he pays for his treachery. The film concludes with Tom and Cassandra stepping out of Tom-Tom's house, finally free from its haunting past. A newfound friendship between them emerges as they embark on a journey to heal their spirits, leaving the dark history of the mansion behind them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? OPT: 1). yes 2). no","completion":"2). no The name of China's oldest stage art is \\"Peking Opera\\" or \\"Beijing Opera\\" (Jīngjù in Chinese). Peking Opera is a performing art form that combines music, vocal performance, mime, dance, and acrobatics. It originated in the late 18th century and became fully developed and recognized by the mid-19th century. This art form is unique because it combines multiple cultural elements, including ancient legends, folktales, and various regional dialects. Peking Opera is characterized by its elaborate makeup, colorful facial patterns, intricate costumes, and distinctive singing style, which differs from the Western operatic tradition. Performers use exaggerated gestures and movements to convey emotions and stories, making it an art form that is both visually and audibly engaging. The development of Peking Opera traces back to the Qing Dynasty, when different opera troupes from Anhui and Hubei provinces came together to perform for Emperor Qianlong's birthday celebration. Over time, they absorbed elements from other forms of Chinese performance arts, such as the Han Opera and Kunqu, eventually evolving into the Peking Opera style known today. Peking Opera is a significant aspect of Chinese culture, as it reflects the country's history, social customs, and artistic values. There are four main types of roles in a Peking Opera performance: Shēng (male roles), Dàn (female roles), Jìng (painted face roles, usually depicting powerful or supernatural characters), and Chǒu (clown or comic roles). Each role type has its own particular performance style, vocal technique, and distinct facial makeup patterns. In modern times, there has been a decline in the popularity of Peking Opera due to the increasing influence of Western culture and entertainment options, such as movies and television shows. However, efforts are being made by the Chinese government and cultural institutions to preserve and promote the art form, ensuring that Peking Opera remains a vital part of China's cultural heritage. For example, the Peking Opera has been included in UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2010, highlighting its significance not only to China but also to the world's cultural landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Adam wants to show his little brother a trick. He gets a bucket of water and says to him \\"I bet i can turn this bucket upside down and no water will fall out\\". His brother doesn't believe him of course. So Adam takes the bucket by the handle and quickly starts spinning it in a circle. Will the centripetal force on the bucket increase or decrease as Adam spins it faster? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's go through the concept of centripetal force step by step: 1. When an object moves in a circular path, it experiences a force that's directed towards the center of the circle, called centripetal force. 2. Centripetal force is necessary to keep the object moving in a circle and is given by the equation Fc = mv^2/r, where Fc is centripetal force, m is mass, v is tangential velocity, and r is the radius of the circle. Now, let's apply these concepts to Adam's spinning bucket experiment: 1. As Adam spins the bucket, the water inside it moves in a circular path. The centripetal force Fc acts on the water to maintain its circular motion. 2. When Adam spins the bucket faster, the tangential velocity (v) of the water increases. 3. According to the centripetal force equation, if the mass (m) and radius (r) remain constant, but the tangential velocity (v) increases, then centripetal force (Fc) will increase as well (since Fc ∝ v^2). In conclusion, the centripetal force on the bucket will increase as Adam spins it faster. This increased force helps to keep the water inside the bucket, preventing it from falling out even when the bucket is turned upside down at the top of the circular path."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores. and a hint : An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Please answer this question : Which cousin learned more about predators with no natural predators? Answer:","completion":"Liam learned more about predators with no natural predators. He focused his research on apex predators, which are animals at the top of the food chain, with no natural predators of their own. These predators occupy the highest trophic levels in their ecosystems and play a significant role in maintaining balance among other populations of species. Apex predators are important subjects of study in the fields of wildlife management, conservation, and ecotourism because of their influence on ecosystem health and dynamics. Fox, on the other hand, concentrated on the study of grazers and large herbivores, which are usually primary consumers in the food chain and prey for the predators, including apex predators. Understanding the relationship between apex predators, such as wolves, and their prey, like large herbivores, allows researchers to better comprehend the interactions between species and their ecosystems. This knowledge helps inform strategies for protecting and preserving natural habitats and promoting biodiversity. In summary, Liam gained more knowledge about predators with no natural predators by studying apex predators, while Fox focused on grazers and large herbivores, which are typically the prey for apex predators and other predatory species within the food chain. Both cousins' investigations contribute to a greater understanding of food chain dynamics and the importance of each species' role in maintaining balance within ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In office from 1969 to 1973 who was Richard Nixon’s first Vice President????","completion":"Richard Nixon's first Vice President during his first term in office from 1969 to 1973 was Spiro T. Agnew, a Republican politician who had served as the Governor of Maryland prior to becoming Vice President. Spiro Theodore Agnew was born on November 9, 1918, in Baltimore, Maryland, to Theodore Spiros Agnew, a Greek immigrant, and Margaret Marian Pollard Agnew, an American-born woman of German and English descent. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1942 with a B.A. in Chemistry and later obtained a law degree from the University of Baltimore School of Law in 1947. Agnew began his political career in 1957 when he was appointed to the Baltimore County Board of Appeals. He then went on to serve as the County Executive of Baltimore County (1962-1966) and was elected as the Governor of Maryland in 1966, serving until 1969. As Governor, Agnew was known for his efforts to reform local government, address social and environmental issues, and combat racial discrimination and civil unrest. Richard Nixon selected Spiro Agnew as his running mate for the 1968 presidential election, primarily due to Agnew's appeal to conservative, working-class voters and the growing \\"silent majority\\" in the United States. The Nixon-Agnew ticket won the 1968 election against the Democratic candidates, Hubert H. Humphrey and Edmund S. Muskie. As Vice President, Agnew developed a reputation for his outspoken and controversial statements, which gained both support and criticism from different ends of the political spectrum. He was an advocate for the Nixon administration's policies, particularly on law and order, and frequently attacked the political opposition and the media in his speeches. However, Agnew's time in office was plagued by legal troubles. In 1973, he was investigated for allegations of extortion, bribery, and income tax evasion during his tenure as Baltimore County Executive and Governor of Maryland, activities that had continued secretly during his vice presidency. Under increasing pressure from both political parties and the public, Agnew negotiated a plea deal and resigned from office on October 10, 1973. Upon Agnew's resignation, he pleaded no contest to a single charge of tax evasion, leaving the vice presidency vacant until Gerald Ford was nominated and confirmed by Congress to fill the position. Agnew's resignation marked the first time in U.S. history that a Vice President left office due to criminal charges and remains a significant event in American political history. After leaving office, Agnew largely retreated from public life, working as an international business consultant and occasionally writing and making public appearances. Spiro T. Agnew passed away on September 17, 1996, at the age of 77."},{"prompt":"Question: James wanted to add space for an extra guest, so he bought a hide bed sofa.

Ben Mockridge is a young man proud of his 4 handgun and enamored of \\"cowboyin'\\". He asks Frank Culpepper if he can join his cattle drive to Fort Lewis, Colorado. Culpepper (a reformed gunslinger) reluctantly agrees and sends Ben to the cook to be his \\"little Mary\\". Ben quickly discovers that the adults have little interest in young'ns, and no interest in \\"showing him the ropes\\". Culpepper nevertheless assigns Ben tasks the greenhorn handles poorly—or simply fails at—repeatedly causing serious trouble. After rustlers stampede the herd, Culpepper tracks them to a box canyon. When the rustlers' leader demands 50 cents a head for having rounded up and taken care of the cattle, Culpepper will have none of it. He and his hands kill the rustlers, not hesitating to gun down disarmed men, or repeatedly shoot anyone still moving. They lose four of their own in the fight.

Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was. It isn't until Murch, disguised as the grunting muscle man \\"Chicken,\\" threatens Abe with being thrown down an elevator shaft, that Abe gives up the location of the diamond—his safe deposit box, and he also gives up the key to it.

The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. Paragraph: Rob is an environmental scientist. He is looking at two samples of soil, sample A and sample B. Sample A is from Amazon Rain-forest, where they get one of the highest rainfall in the world. Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would sample B rocks have more or less chemical reactions? A:","completion":"Sample B rocks would have less chemical reactions. This is because the Atacama Desert has one of the lowest rainfall levels in the world, which means less rainwater passes through the soil and reacts chemically with the particles. In contrast, the high rainfall in the Amazon Rainforest increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Process: - An organism dies - Water seeps into the remains - Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals - Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden - The minerals form a fossil. suppose there is a drought happens, how will it affect more water seeps into the remains. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in the given scenario can be classified as directly impacting a step of the process. To elaborate further, let's take a closer look at each step of the fossilization process and how a drought would affect it: 1. An organism dies: The drought would not directly impact this step, as it does not have a direct influence on the death of the organism. The organism may die from various reasons, such as predation, disease or old age. 2. Water seeps into the remains: This is the step that would be directly impacted by a drought. Due to the lack of water during a drought, the water seepage into the organism's remains would be significantly reduced. The limited water availability would make it more difficult for the necessary minerals to make their way into the remains, which is an essential part of the fossilization process. Therefore, the drought directly affects this step by reducing the water seepage. 3. Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals: As the water seepage is directly affected by the drought, this step would also be impacted, but in an indirect manner. Since less water seeps into the remains, the chances of minerals dissolving in the water are lower, leading to fewer crystal formations. 4. Crystallized minerals cause the remains to harden: This step is also indirectly affected, as fewer crystals are formed due to the reduced mineral dissolution in the previous step. Consequently, the remains would not fully harden, and the fossilization process would be less successful. 5. The minerals form a fossil: Ultimately, the formation of a fossil would be indirectly impacted, as the previous steps in the process have been negatively affected. The reduced water seepage, along with the limited crystals and hardening of the remains, would hinder the success of a complete fossil. In summary, the drought can be classified as a perturbation that directly impacts the water seepage step of the fossilization process. This direct impact on water seepage subsequently has a cascading effect, indirectly influencing the subsequent steps, ultimately affecting the successful formation of a fossil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: If you were trying to push a box and wanted the one with the most friction which would you push light box or Heavy box? Paragraph : Its harder to overcome friction between heavier objects and the floor than it is between lighter objects and the floor. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, if you were trying to push a box and wanted the one with the most friction, you would choose to push the heavy box. The paragraph states that it is harder to overcome friction between heavier objects and the floor than it is between lighter objects and the floor. Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of such motion of two surfaces in contact. It acts as a resisting force that makes it difficult for objects to slide or move against each other. In the case of pushing a box, the frictional force exists between the bottom surface of the box and the floor. The amount of friction between two surfaces is related to the normal force acting on them, which is the force exerted perpendicular to the surfaces in contact. In general, the greater the normal force, the greater the friction between the surfaces. Heavier objects exert a larger normal force on the surfaces they are in contact with, as compared to lighter objects. Thus, when a heavier object is in contact with the floor, it experiences a higher frictional force that opposes its motion as compared to a lighter object in a similar situation. In conclusion, if you want to push a box and experience the most friction, you should select the heavy box, as the frictional force opposing its motion would be greater as compared to a lighter box. This increased friction would make it more difficult for you to push the heavy box, but it would also provide you with a better understanding of the effects of friction on the motion of objects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Emiliano Zapata Salazar (Spanish pronunciation: [emi'ljano sa'pata]; 8 August 1879 - 10 April 1919) was a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution, the main leader of the peasant revolution in the state of Morelos, and the inspiration of the agrarian movement called Zapatismo. Zapata was born in the rural village of Anenecuilco in Morelos State, where peasant communities were under increasing pressure from the small landowning class who monopolized land and water resources for sugar cane production with the support of dictator Porfirio Diaz. Zapata early on participated in political movements against Diaz and the landowning hacendados, and when the Revolution broke out in 1910 he was positioned as a central leader of the peasant revolt in Morelos. Cooperating with a number of other peasant leaders he formed the Liberation Army of the South of which he soon became the undisputed leader. In mid-March 1919, Gen. Pablo Gonzalez ordered his subordinate Col. Jesus Guajardo to commence operations against the Zapatistas in the mountains around Huautla. But when Gonzalez later discovered Guajardo carousing in a cantina, he had him arrested, and a public scandal ensued. On March 21st, Zapata attempted to smuggle in a note to Guajardo, inviting him to switch sides. The note, however, never reached Guajardo but instead wound up on Gonzalez's desk. Gonzalez devised a plan to use this note to his advantage. He accused Guajardo of not only being a drunk, but of being a traitor. After reducing Guajardo to tears, Gonzalez explained to him that he could recover from this disgrace if he feigned a defection to Zapata. So Guajardo wrote to Zapata telling him that he would bring over his men and supplies if certain guarantees were promised. Zapata answered Guajardo's letter on April 1, 1919, agreeing to all of Guajardo's terms. Zapata suggested a mutiny on April 4. Guajardo replied that his defection should wait until a new shipment of arms and ammunition arrived sometime between the 6th and the 10th. By the 7th, the plans were set: Zapata ordered Guajardo to attack the Federal garrison at Jonacatepec because the garrison included troops who had defected from Zapata. Pablo Gonzalez and Guajardo notified the Jonacatepec garrison ahead of time, and a mock battle was staged on April 9. At the conclusion of the mock battle, the former Zapatistas were arrested and shot. Convinced that Guajardo was sincere, Zapata agreed to a final meeting where Guajardo would defect. On April 10, 1919, Guajardo invited Zapata to a meeting, intimating that he intended to defect to the revolutionaries. However, when Zapata arrived at the Hacienda de San Juan, in Chinameca, Ayala municipality, Guajardo's men riddled him with bullets. After he was gunned down, they then took his body to Cuautla to claim the bounty, where they are reputed to have been given only half of what was promised. Zapata's body was photographed, displayed for 24 hours, and then buried in Cuautla. Pablo Gonzalez wanted the body photographed, so that there would be no doubt that Zapata was dead: \\"it was an actual fact that the famous jefe of the southern region had died.\\" Although Mexico City newspapers had called for Zapata's body to be brought to the capital, Carranza did not do so. However, Zapata's clothing was displayed outside a newspaper's office across from the Alameda Park in the capital.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The questions are not the same, but they are related. The first question focuses on overcoming an existing obsession, while the second question concerns the development of obsessions. 1. Best way to stop being obsessed with something: Step 1: Recognize the obsession The first step to overcoming an obsession is to become aware of it. Acknowledge that you are having obsessive thoughts about a particular subject or person. Step 2: Identify the triggers Try to identify what causes the obsession to resurface. Triggers could be environmental, emotional, or related to your daily routine. Recognizing these triggers can help you avoid them or learn to cope with them more effectively. Step 3: Implement healthy coping strategies Develop healthy coping strategies to deal with obsession, such as engaging in mindfulness techniques, deep breathing exercises, and physical activities that can help redirect your focus. Step 4: Replace the obsession with healthier alternatives Find alternative activities, interests, or hobbies that will fill the void left by the obsession. By investing in activities that stimulate the mind or body, you can redirect your thoughts and energy away from the obsession. Step 5: Seek professional help if necessary If the obsession is causing significant distress or interfering with daily life, it might be helpful to consult with a mental health professional. 2. How do obsessions develop: Obsessions can develop due to a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Some possible causes are: a. Genetics and neurobiology: A predisposition to develop obsessions might be influenced by genetic factors and brain chemistry. b. Personality traits: People with certain personality traits like perfectionism, excessive responsibility, and high levels of anxiety are more prone to develop obsessions. c. Life experiences: Stressful life events, trauma, or significant changes in personal circumstances can trigger the development of obsessions. d. Fear of losing control: Sometimes, people develop obsessions to cope with fears of losing control in certain areas of their lives. e. Coping mechanism: In some cases, obsessions develop as a coping mechanism for dealing with unpleasant emotions or a difficult situation. Overall, the two questions focus on different aspects of obsessions, but understanding both aspects can provide valuable insight into the nature of obsessions and how to overcome them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What Blockbuster Video Can Teach Us About Economics The great Austrian School economist Ludwig Von Mises once wrote that the entrepreneur who fails to use his capital to the \\"best possible satisfaction of consumers\\" is \\"relegated to a place in which his ineptitude no longer hurts people's well-being.\\" Von Mises meant that successful businesses are successful because they fill an unmet need. If they're unsuccessful, it is often because they have failed the consumer. In that case bankruptcy is an economic good for relieving those the market has left for dead of any further capital to destroy. The demise of Blockbuster ( BBI - news - people ) Video offers some lessons about Schumpeterian creative destruction, the necessary role of short-sellers in making markets transparent and the role of capital in rewarding winners and losers. Once a popular growth stock among investors, Blockbuster is now a sick company teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. While it would be foolish to cheer Blockbuster's decline, its descent speaks to the importance of allowing companies no longer fulfilling market needs to go bankrupt. In better days Blockbuster was popular among investors. Its share price reached a modern high of 19 in 1999, and with good reason. Just as Wal-Mart's ( WMT - news - people ) customers benefit from the volume discounts secured by the world's largest retailer, so did Blockbuster's movie-fan customers gain from the lower prices for movie rentals that this volume buyer could command. This was certainly an improvement on the fractured video-store industry of the past, populated by local owners with no pull with the big studios. But as often happens as companies grow, Blockbuster concentrated on perfecting its existing service while beating competitors offering the same instead of looking into ways that outsiders might destroy its business model altogether. Schumpeter long ago noted that entrepreneurs disrupt: For Blockbuster, the \\"disrupter\\" in question was Netflix ( NFLX - news - people ). Indeed, popular as the Blockbuster brand was, getting to the video store in order to take advantage of its services was a hassle for customers--as was returning videos on time to avoid paying late fees. The rise of Netflix from well outside the traditional retail space meant these problems were solved in one fell swoop. Netflix entered the market offering a monthly fee for movies, DVDs by mail and no limits on how long its customers could keep the movies in question. With no retail spaces of its own to drive up costs, Netflix out-innovated a former innovator with a service that licked the late-fee problem and didn't require customers to leave their houses. Blockbuster ultimately copied the Netflix model with a mail-order service with the added benefit of dropping already-watched DVDs at its retail locations, but, as evidenced by the share prices of both companies, its actions were too little, too late. Netflix shares are presently trading in the 70 range vs. Blockbuster's shares that are now 30 cents. As it always does, creative destruction has given customers what they want. And with video-on-demand increasingly prevalent, what's unknown is whether Netflix will be out-innovated on the way to oblivion as the market for movies perhaps shifts again. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about how Blockbuster Video, a once popular and successful business, failed to adapt to changes in the market and is now close to bankruptcy. It talks about how Blockbuster was once able to offer customers a good service due to the lower prices it could command. However, they did not evolve when Netflix introduced a new and more convenient way of renting movies, making Blockbuster's service seem outdated. This shows us the importance of businesses adapting to changes in the market and the effect of creative destruction on companies that do not meet the consumers' needs."},{"prompt":"Process: - A tree produces seeds - The seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, etc - The seeds reach the ground - Grow into new trees - These new trees produce seeds - The process repeats itself over and over - Question: suppose more boilers are added happens, how will it affect MORE forest formation.

What is a place with only one telephone book that many people can use? - desk - house - at hotel - bedroom - library The best answer is","completion":"The best answer is \\"library.\\" A library is a public institution that provides various resources to the community, such as books, periodicals, audio-visual materials, and digital resources. One of the essential services that a library offers is providing information to the community, and this includes maintaining a telephone directory for public use. In a library, a telephone book is accessible to anyone who needs to look up a phone number or address. This makes it an ideal place for a single telephone book that many people can use. Libraries promote easy access to information for all community members, making them the perfect location for a shared resource like a telephone directory. Additionally, librarians are present to help individuals locate the required information or assist with other inquiries. In comparing the other options provided: 1. Desk - A desk is a piece of furniture typically used in an individual workspace, such as an office or home. A telephone book on a desk is not easily accessible to many people since it would be situated in a private area meant for a single person. 2. House - A house is a private residence, and the telephone book would only be readily available to the occupants of the house. This does not allow for widespread use by many people outside the household. 3. At the hotel - A hotel can potentially have some shared resources for guests, such as a telephone book in the lobby or at the front desk. However, as hotels primarily serve the guests staying there, access to a telephone book may be limited to those guests. Public access may not be granted for non-guests, reducing the number of people who can use it. 4. Bedroom - A bedroom is a room within a private residence that serves as a sleeping area. Like a house, a bedroom is not meant for public access, making a telephone book kept in a bedroom unlikely to be available to many people. In conclusion, a library is the most suitable place for a telephone book that many people can use as it is a public institution designed to provide resources and information to the community. Other options have limited access or are intended for private use and are not suitable for a shared resource like a telephone book."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki addresses reporters after testifying before a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing on VA health care, on Capitol Hill in Washington May 15, 2014. WASHINGTON The top health official at the Department of Veterans Affairs resigned on Friday amid a scandal over allegations of deadly healthcare delays, but critics dismissed the gesture as \\"damage control\\" because he planned to retire this year anyway. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki said in a statement he accepted the resignation of Dr. Robert Petzel, VA undersecretary for health, and acknowledged the need to ensure more timely treatment of America's military veterans. The White House said President Barack Obama supported Shinseki's decision. Petzel's resignation, which came a day after he and Shinseki testified before Congress, appeared unlikely to calm the anger over the scandal, with one critic rejecting the move as \\"damage control\\" and the American Legion renewing its call for Shinseki himself to step down. \\"Characterizing this as a 'resignation' just doesn't pass the smell test,\\" said Republican Congressman Jeff Miller, the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. Tom Tarantino, the policy chief for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said: \\"We don't need the VA to find a scapegoat. We need an actual plan to restore a culture of accountability throughout the VA.\\" American Legion National Commander Daniel Dellinger said the resignation \\"is not a corrective action but a continuation of business as usual,\\" adding the organization wanted Shinseki and Allison Hickey, the undersecretary for benefits, to resign. \\"Dr. Petzel was already scheduled to retire this year so his resignation now won't really make that much of a difference,\\" Dellinger added. \\"VA needs a fundamental shift in leadership if it is to defeat its systemic lack of accountability.\\" Republican Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas described Petzel's resignation as \\"damage control\\" and said the Veterans Health Administration chief \\"should not shoulder the blame for VA's failure.\\" Petzel's resignation came a day after he appeared alongside Shinseki at a hearing about accusations that VA medical facilities in Phoenix covered up long wait times for patients, including 40 who died while awaiting care. In announcing the decision, Shinseki stopped short of blaming Petzel for delays and did not explicitly say why he resigned. In a statement last September, the VA said Petzel planned to retire in 2014 and the department was taking steps to find candidates to replace him. Two VA officials declined to elaborate on the reason for Petzel's resignation. The VA has put three senior officials in Phoenix on administrative leave after doctors there said they were ordered to hold veterans' names for months on a secret waiting list until a spot opened up on an official list that met the agency's two-week waiting time goals. Allegations have been reported about similar cover-up schemes at VA medical facilities in at least seven other cities. The agency runs the largest U.S. healthcare group, overseeing some 1,700 hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and other facilities. Shinseki has ordered a nationwide audit of appointment and scheduling practices at all VA hospitals and clinics. (Additional reporting by David Lawder and Thomas Ferraro; editing by Bill Trott and Diane Craft) ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — The top official for veterans' health care resigned Friday amid a firestorm over delays in care and falsified records at veteran hospitals. Veterans Secretary Eric Shinseki says he has accepted the resignation of Robert Petzel, the department's undersecretary for health care. Shinseki had asked for the resignation, a department official later said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for attribution. The announcement came a day after both men were grilled at a four-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, where lawmakers and veteran groups expressed exasperation of long-standing problems at the department. Meanwhile, House Republicans scheduled a vote for Wednesday on legislation that would give Shinseki more authority to fire or demote senior executives and administrators at the agency and its 152 medical centers. When senior leaders in the VA \\"fail the men and women who have put their lives on the line for our country, they deserve a pink slip - not a bonus,\\" House Speaker John Boehner said Friday. While some Republicans in Congress have called for Shinseki to resign, Boehner is not among them. Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, wrote the bill before a former VA clinic director told his committee last month that up to 40 veterans may have died while awaiting treatment at the Phoenix VA center. The whistleblower also said the hospital kept a secret list of patients waiting for appointments to hide delays in care. \\"VA's widespread and systemic lack of accountability is exacerbating all of its most pressing problems, including the department's stubborn disability benefits backlog and a mounting toll of at least 31 recent preventable veteran deaths at VA medical centers across the country,\\" Miller said. Reports of long waits for appointments and processing benefit applications have plagued VA for years. The agency has shortened backlogs but the Phoenix problems have triggered an election-year firestorm. President Barack Obama on Wednesday tasked his deputy White House chief of staff, Rob Nabors, to review VA health care policies and procedures in light of new reports about Phoenix and other VA facilities. \\"As we know from the veteran community, most veterans are satisfied with the quality of their VA health care, but we must do more to improve timely access to that care,\\" Shinseski said in a statement Friday. He thanked Petzel for four decades of service to veterans. Petzel was scheduled to retire this year, and Shinseki last fall had convened a commission to recommend candidates for presidential appointment to be the new undersecretary. VA is required by law to convene a commission to seek and review candidates for the position. It was unclear what Petzel's exact retirement date was to be. In his position, Petzel oversaw what officials say is the largest health care delivery system in the U.S. The VA operates 1700 hospitals, clinics and other facilities around the country. They employ about 300,000 people and serve about 6.5 million veterans and other beneficiaries each year.

The Browns tied it up when Zane Gonzalez kicked a 31-yard field goal to make it 3-3. The Titans retook the lead with Succop's 23-yard field goal to make it 6-3 at halftime. The Browns then tied it up when Zane Gonzalez nailed 47-yard field goal to make it 6-6 for the only points in the third quarter. The Titans then moved ahead in the fourth quarter after Succop kicked another field goal from 46 yards out to make it 9-6. The Browns forced overtime when Gonzalez nailed a 54-yard field goal to make it 9-9. In overtime, the Titans scored the eventual game-winning field goal when Succop nailed it from 47 yards out to make the final score 12-9. With the overtime loss, the Browns fell to 0-7. The loss led to Browns starting 0-7 for only the 4th time in franchise history (1975, 1999, and 2016). It was the first time in 23 games under Hue Jackson that the Browns failed to score a touchdown. This game was the first such occurrence since Week 17 of the 2015 season. During the third quarter, star left tackle Joe Thomas suffered an injury to his arm and was knocked out of the rest of the game, making this the first time since joining the Browns in 2007 that he had missed an offensive play.

Sentence: \\"Mary loves him.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"A linguist would likely rate the sentence \\"Mary loves him\\" as acceptable linguistically, based on several linguistic principles and components. To provide a detailed explanation, let's breakdown the key linguistic aspects that contribute to the acceptability of this sentence. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the rules that govern the structure of sentences in a language. In English, the typical word order follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern. In the sentence \\"Mary loves him,\\" the subject (Mary) is followed by the verb (loves) and the object (him). This structure adheres to the SVO pattern, making the sentence syntactically acceptable. 2. Grammar: Grammar encompasses the rules governing the construction of phrases, clauses, and sentences in a language. When examining the grammar of this sentence, we observe that the verb \\"loves\\" agrees with the subject \\"Mary\\" in both number (singular) and person (third person). The verb is also in the present tense, which is appropriate for describing an ongoing action or state. The pronoun \\"him\\" serves as the direct object, and it is used correctly to refer to a male person. Thus, the sentence is grammatically acceptable. 3. Semantics: Semantics deals with the meanings of words, phrases, and sentences in a language. In this sentence, \\"Mary\\" is a proper noun and denotes a particular person. The verb \\"loves\\" carries a clear meaning, expressing a strong affection or emotional bond between the subject and object. The pronoun \\"him\\" is used to refer to a male person, and its meaning is context-dependent; it relies on the presence of an antecedent, which is not provided in this sentence. However, this is common in standalone sentences and does not make it unacceptable linguistically. The semantics of the sentence are therefore understandable and convey a clear message. 4. Morphology: Morphology pertains to the study of the internal structure of words and how they are formed in a language. In this sentence, all the words are well-formed and appropriate for their respective roles. \\"Mary\\" is a proper noun, \\"loves\\" is formed by attaching the regular third-person singular suffix \\"-s\\" to the base form of the verb \\"love,\\" and \\"him\\" is the correct form of the masculine pronoun used in the object position. Consequently, the sentence is morphologically acceptable. 5. Pragmatics: Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which context influences the interpretation of meaning in a language. Although the sentence \\"Mary loves him\\" does not provide the broader context, such as whom \\"him\\" refers to or why Mary loves him, the sentence remains functionally communicative. Pragmatically, it allows the interlocutor to infer some specific information (Mary's feelings) and introduce further questions or conversation points to seek clarification of the missing context. Taking into account these linguistic aspects, a linguist would generally rate the sentence \\"Mary loves him\\" as acceptable linguistically, as it adheres to the key principles of syntax, grammar, semantics, morphology, and basic pragmatic understanding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Emily Nagoski is a badass Ph.D. who teaches human sexuality. She wrote a book – Come As You Are. Here’s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can’t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book. In this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress — a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women’s sex lives. THE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES This concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go? That’s right, you STOP! Ok, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another. If your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time. This isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).

Here are possible answers to this question: - sing songs - lay eggs - falling down - reproduce - spread wings I believe the correct choice is \\"spread wings\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"Indeed, the correct choice is \\"spread wings,\\" as it best describes the process of how birds leave the nest for the first time. Bird nests serve as a shelter for the eggs and a safe space for the baby birds, also known as fledglings, to grow and develop. As fledglings mature, they eventually become capable of leaving the nest and living independently. This event is called fledging. Their journey out of the nest involves several stages, some of which include learning and practicing essential skills for survival. Here is a more detailed explanation of the process: 1. Nestling stage: After hatching, baby birds are referred to as nestlings. During this stage, they are usually blind, featherless, and rely entirely on their parents for food, warmth, and protection. They stay within the confines of the nest as they develop their muscles and grow feathers. 2. Growing feathers: Over time, nestlings develop feathers, first as downy fluff and eventually as proper contour and flight feathers. Feathers are essential for insulation, protection, camouflage, and, most importantly, flight. 3. Developing muscles: While still in the nest, nestlings start to exercise their muscles by stretching and flapping their wings. This helps them build the strength necessary for flight. 4. Perching and hopping: As their muscles and feathers develop, fledglings start practicing perching on the edge of the nest or tree branches. They might also attempt short hops between close branches or within the nest to further improve their balance and coordination. 5. Food begging and exploration: During this stage, fledglings begin to associate their parents' arrival with food. They may venture out of the nest to be closer to the parents and beg for food more effectively. This behavior also encourages them to become more confident in leaving the nest. 6. Taking flight: Finally, after all the preparation and practice, a fledgling will spread its wings and take its first flight. The initial flights are often shaky and may involve a lot of falling or gliding, but fledglings gradually gain confidence and improve their flying capabilities. Parents continue to feed and supervise their young ones for a few days or weeks after they fledge, ensuring they learn essential skills such as finding food and avoiding predators. In summary, leaving the nest is more than just a simple act of spreading wings. It is a complex and gradual process involving the development of feathers and muscles, practicing essential skills, gaining confidence, and the fledgling's first attempts at flight. Spreading wings is perhaps the most critical aspect of this process, as it ultimately allows fledglings to become independent, self-sufficient birds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

England physio Gary Lewin was carried off on a stretcher with a dislocated ankle in bizarre circumstances after Daniel Sturridge's equaliser. Lewin, a former member of Arsenal's physio staff, picked up the injury after standing on a water bottle while celebrating England's 37th-minute leveller - and was even carried off on the stretcher usually reserved for his players and will fly back to England. Roy Hodgson's staff jumped off the bench in celebration but Lewin, who will be replaced by Steve Kemp for the remainder of the tournament, immediately fell to the floor and repeatedly banged the ground with his fist. Sore one: Gary Lewin was taken off in the fist half after hurting his ankle in the dugout. Lewin was left in pain after standing on the water bottle in Manaus and needed urgent medical treatment. England manager Roy Hodgson and Italy coach Cesare Prandelli talk while Lewin is treated. The physio was said to be 'gutted' after being stretchered off from the side of the pitch in Manaus on Saturday night. Attention: Lewin injured himself while celebrating Sturridge's equalising goal against Italy. Concern: It was a mystery initially who had gone down after Sturridge's goal in the 2-1 loss to Italy. The 37th minute incident saw Lewin receiving medical treatment from both FIFA officials and players before he was ushered down the tunnel. Lad-up: The physio left the playing area on a stretcher after slipping while celebrating Daniel Sturridge's goal. Lewin was stretchered off after he dislocated his ankle by standing on a water bottle while celebrating. 'That was a very sad moment for us,' England boss Roy Hodgson said. 'In celebrating the goal he jumped up, landed on a water bottle and dislocated his ankle. 'It was very painful. He was taken to hospital. The doctor set it, put it back in at the side of the field, but it's the end of the World Cup for Gary.' Lewin left the field on a stretcher after a short break in play, with the team's Twitter official feed, @england, swiftly confirming the severity of the injury. 'England physio Gary Lewin was injured during celebrations for @england's goal,' the post said. 'He has dislocated his ankle. Get well soon Gary #3Lions' The Football Association later said the 50-year-old Londoner had suffered a fracture and dislocation. An FA spokesperson added: 'We do have another physio with us - Steve Kemp.' With little known about the protocol for injured medical staff, given the rarity of the situation, Lewin was quickly surrounded by a crowd of around a dozen staff from both sides and FIFA. Lewin was first team physio at Arsenal for 22 years and became an England physio in 1996 alongside his job at the North London club. But in 2008 he quit the Gunners to become Head of Physiotherapy for the national side. In 2007, Lewin was credited with possibly saving John Terry's life in the League Cup Final after the Chelsea captain swallowed his tounge and Lewin, then Arsenal physio, was first off the bench to assist him. During his time at Arsenal he was also credited with saving striker Eduardo's career after he suffered a horror leg break. Hodgson’s staff haven’t had much luck with injuries recently – assistant manager Ray Lewington is on crutches after emergency knee surgery 24 hours before the team’s final friendly against Honduras.

While Ender's Game touched on the mindset of alien creatures, and focused mostly on human beings, Speaker for the Dead digs deep into both. Ender is much older in the story, and has a very different standing with society. His siblings play an interesting part that is also very different from Ender's Game. The thing that will stick with you about any Ender story though isn't the action or the strange aliens: its the reality of human behavior, and the incredible \\"what if\\"s presented throughout each story.

After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave. The truck will not start. The battery has melted so they return to the house. As they take stock of the situation they hear scrabbling sounds from the roof and discover that an alien has made its way in through an open window. Kurt leads the way up the stairs and begins to search. Tommy takes the opportunity to go into his bedroom and change his soiled pants when he is ambushed by an alienâit (apparently) puts him in a trance, investigates his camera, and slips away, leaving Tommy with no memory of the encounter. Tommy is awakened by the shouts of Kurt, who has trapped an alien in an adjacent room. They are greeted by a laser shot and Kurt responds with his shotgun. Everyone retreats downstairs. A ball of light floats into the house and puts Renee into a coma.

We have this equation: 1034 = 82*x - 38*x - 138*x Now, let's look at the x parts: 82*x, -38*x, and -138*x. All the x's are friends that we can add or subtract together. Let's do that! 82*x - 38*x - 138*x = (82 - 38 - 138) * x Now, we'll do the math inside the parentheses: 44 - 138 = -94 So now the equation looks like this: 1034 = -94*x Now we need to find out what x is. We do this by dividing 1034 by -94. Imagine we have 1034 candies, and we need to divide them into equal groups of -94 (even though we can't have negative candies, but it's just to understand the idea). 1034 ÷ -94 = -11 So, x is equal to -11!

There's a lot of exploration, puzzle-solving to find your way through the game, and, of course, some creepy monsters to deal with. It's a part of the famous Resident Evil series, so if you're willing to dive into something new, I strongly recommend giving it a go. Aliana: Sounds interesting! I'm a little scared, but at the same time, I'm intrigued. So, what about Battlefield 5? I've heard that series is well-known for its intense action and amazing graphics. Damari: Oh, absolutely. Battlefield 5 is a first-person shooter set during World War II, and it's visually stunning. The game offers a gripping single-player campaign as well as epic multiplayer battles. You'll engage in intense firefights, use a variety of historically accurate weapons, and pilot various types of vehicles. The game's massive, detailed maps and destructible environments make for an unforgettable gaming experience. Aliana: Sounds epic!

Add or subtract terms to isolate the variable (r) 3. Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable to solve for the variable Here is the step-by-step solution: 1. Combine like terms: The given equation is: 40*r - 26629 + 93527 = -766*r There are no like terms on the left side of the equation but we can combine the constants: 40*r + 66898 = -766*r 2. Add or subtract terms to isolate the variable (r): In order to isolate r, we need to get rid of the r values on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 766*r to both sides of the equation: 40*r + 66898 + 766*r = -766*r + 766*r This simplifies to: 806*r + 66898 = 0 3. Subtract the constant term from both sides of the equation: 806*r = -66898 4. Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable to solve for the variable: To solve for r, we need to isolate it by dividing both sides of the equation by 806: r = -66898 / 806 5.

By using a DSL modem, you can access the internet through your phone line without interrupting your landline connection. In this article, we will walk you through the process of setting up and optimizing your DSL modem, ensuring a smooth and efficient internet experience with minimal downtime. 1. Choose the right DSL modem Before you can set up your DSL modem, make sure you have the appropriate hardware for your network. You can either purchase a standalone modem or a modem-router combo, depending on your needs and preferences. A modem-router combo unit provides the functionality of both a modem and a router in one device, simplifying the setup process and reducing clutter. 2. Plug the DSL modem into your computer Once you have your DSL modem, it's time to connect it to your computer. Locate the Ethernet port at the back of your modem and connect an Ethernet cable to it. Plug the other end of the cable into the Ethernet port on your computer. This will establish a direct line of communication between your modem and computer, allowing you to configure the modem settings and access the internet through the device. 3. Plug the DSL modem into the wall cable socket Next, locate the telephone jack in your wall and connect the DSL modem to it using a DSL cable or a phone cord provided with your modem. Make sure that the cable you use is compatible with DSL service, as a regular telephone cable may not work. This connection will enable the transmission of DSL signals from your telecommunication provider to your modem. 4. Plug in the DSL modem's power cord Connect the power adapter provided with your modem to the power port on the device. Plug the other end into an electrical outlet. Turn the modem on by pressing the power button, if applicable. Wait for the modem to initialize and establish a connection with your DSL provider. This process may take a few minutes, and you should see various indicator lights on the modem light up as the connection is established. 5. Log in to the modem's administrative screen Once your modem is connected and powered on, you need to access its administrative interface to configure the settings. Open a web browser on your computer and enter the modem's default IP address in the address bar. Common IP addresses for modems include 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, and 10.0.0.1. You can find your specific modem's IP address in the user manual or on a label attached to the device. 6. Enter your DSL account username and password After navigating to the modem's IP address, you will be prompted to enter a username and password. By default, most modems are configured with \\"admin\\" as the username and \\"password\\" as the password. If these credentials don't work, consult your modem's manual or contact your ISP for assistance. Once logged in, locate the internet or WAN settings page. Enter the DSL account username and password provided by your internet service provider (ISP). This information is crucial for establishing a connection to the internet, so make sure you enter the details correctly. If you are unsure about your DSL account credentials, contact your ISP for assistance. 7. Save your settings After entering your DSL account information, review your modem settings, and apply any necessary changes. Save the updated settings and your modem will apply the new configuration. You may need to restart the modem for the changes to take effect. 8. Test your internet connection Once your modem settings have been updated and the device has restarted, check your internet connection by opening a web browser and visiting a website. If you can access the site without any issues, your DSL modem setup is complete. 9. Optimize your modem settings (optional) To improve the performance of your DSL connection, you may want to optimize your modem settings. Consult your modem's user manual for recommended settings to ensure the best possible internet experience. Conclusion Setting up a DSL modem is relatively simple, even for those without technical expertise. By carefully following these steps and consulting your modem's user manual, you can enjoy a stable and fast internet connection with minimal downtime. Additionally, optimizing your modem settings can help maximize your internet performance and provide a hassle-free online experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Trump administration's decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census divided Capitol Hill on Tuesday, with Democrats saying the addition could skew the results and alter millions in government funding, while some Republicans praised it as a \\"commonsense\\" move. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced late Monday the next effort to count every resident in the country will include a question about citizenship status. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020. The deadline for finalizing the questions is Saturday. In a memo late Monday, Ross said he chose to include the query at the urging of the Department of Justice, which said it needed the citizenship data to better enforce a law protecting minority voting rights. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the addition of the question, rejecting the notion that it might result in less federal aid to immigrant communities in the U.S. if immigrants are undercounted. Republicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision, which revives a practice that was abandoned in 1950, after being in place for more than 100 years, according to the Commerce Department. \\"It is imperative that the data gathered in the census is reliable, given the wide-ranging impacts it will have on U.S. policy. A question on citizenship is a reasonable, commonsense addition to the census,\\" Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement Tuesday. But Democrats said the question would have the opposite effect — discouraging undocumented immigrants and citizen family members from responding to the census, undermining the accuracy of the results. \\"We cannot accept an incomplete or unfair count in 2020 — too much is at stake,\\" Rep. Carolyn Maloney, co-chair of the Congressional Census Caucus, told VOA. \\"The census mandated by the [U.S.] Constitution affects the way that Federal and state funds are distributed and how district lines are drawn for both the city, state and Federal level.\\" After the end of this story, Maloney is probably A. not enough information B. chairing another committee C. still co-chair of the committee D. not chairing any committee A:","completion":"C. still co-chair of the committee"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The conversation begins with Alan asking Joan when she will be home. Joan responds by saying she has plans to study with her friend, Laura, after classes. At this point, Alan inquires if she'll be home by 7 pm, possibly because he wants to spend some quality time with her or ensure that she's there for dinner. He mentions that he is making his famous chicken wings, which could be an attempt to entice her to come home early or to simply let her know that there is something special for dinner. Joan then brings up the importance of her grades and subtly hints that she might prioritize her studies over being home by 7 pm. She might be questioning whether her father values her studies or subtly seeking his approval and understanding. Alan, in a light-hearted manner, responds by seemingly expressing mock disappointment that his chicken wings are not as important as Joan's grades. He then clarifies that he is only joking and fully supports her decision to prioritize her studies. His playful, supportive response demonstrates an understanding of Joan's concerns and reassures her that her education is indeed essential. Overall, this conversation reflects the loving relationship between a parent and a child, as they balance family time, academic priorities, and a shared sense of humor.

One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B. Which fruits had most probably gone through heated sugar syrup, bowl A or bowl B? Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Answer:","completion":"The fruits that had most probably gone through heated sugar syrup are in bowl A, as these are the glace fruits prepared by the instructor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The website says a credit card will help children master responsible spending habits and give parents the chance to teach them some valuable lessons. It's absolutely true that kids should learn about how a credit card works and how to use it responsibly. But the idea that they need a card of their own to practise this is questionable. Yes, credit cards are a teaching tool, but it's the time you spend educating them about money management that does the teaching, not the piece of plastic. Sit down with your child--here we are referring to teens and walk them through your credit card statements. Point out important things like the due date, late fee warning, and APR . If you have good credit, adding a child as an authorized user onto one of your credit cards also provides teachable moments. Allow kids to use the card to make specific purchases and require their participation in payment. Since the card is still in your name, you can take them off it at any point and cut off their access if they're not able to handle the responsibility. Another option is to set them up with an account at a local bank that offers free use of a debit card . Unlike credit card, the debit card has no overdraft function. Children can only use the card to pay for things and the money is taken directly from their bank account. If the account is empty, the worst that will happen is the card being declined at a cash register. Question: What is the purpose of adding kids as credit card authorized users?

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What is Lewis' first name in the future? Movie plot title: Meet the Robinsons Movie plot: Lewis is an aspiring 12-year-old inventor at an orphanage whose inventions have been scaring off potential parents. He decides that his mother, who abandoned him at the orphanage as an infant, is the only one who ever truly loved him and works on a machine to scan his memory to locate her. Taking his memory scanner to his school's science fair, Lewis meets 13-year-old Wilbur Robinson, a mysterious boy claiming to be a time cop from the future. Wilbur needs to recover a time machine that a man wearing a bowler hat has stolen. Lewis tries to demonstrate the scanner, but it falls apart, throwing the science fair into chaos. Upset, Lewis leaves while the Bowler Hat Guy, with the help of a robotic bowler hat named Doris, repairs and steals the scanner. Wilbur meets Lewis at the orphanage and asks him to repair the scanner. Lewis agrees to do so only if Wilbur can prove he is telling the truth, which Wilbur does by taking them to the year 2037 in a second time machine. When they arrive, however, Lewis says he can use the time machine instead of the scanner, and he and Wilbur get into an argument and crash. Wilbur then asks Lewis to fix the time machine, but Lewis has another condition: Wilbur has to take him to visit his mother afterwards. Reluctantly, Wilbur agrees and hides Lewis in the garage. Lewis doesn't stay there for long, however, and ends up meeting the rest of the Robinsons except for Cornelius, Wilbur's father, who is away on a business trip. Following Lewis, the Bowler Hat Guy and Doris unsuccessfully try to kidnap him. Meanwhile, the Robinsons offer to adopt Lewis, but change their mind when they learn that he's from the past. Wilbur admits to lying to Lewis about taking him back to see his mom, causing Lewis to run off in disgust. Lewis then discovers that Cornelius Robinson is, in fact, a future version of himself, and Wilbur is his future son. Lewis also finds out that the Bowler Hat Guy is a grown-up version of Lewis' roommate, Michael \\"Goob\\" Yagoobian. Because he was always kept awake by Lewis...

Given the question: Process: - The liver removes toxins from the blood - Liver also cleans blood that has just been enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion - Liver processes the good stuff into forms that the rest of the body can use - Waste or stuff your body doesn't need can be carried by bile back into the intestine or into the kidneys - The liver also produces a digestive juice called bile that helps the body absorb fat into the bloodstream - The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen for the body to use as fuel when needed. suppose Better materials found happens, how will it affect the liver having to work SOFTER. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","completion":"directly impacting a step of the process To explain further, if we suppose that better materials are discovered or produced that can help the liver function more efficiently, this would directly impact one or more steps in the liver's process of detoxification and metabolism. These better materials could come in the form of enhanced enzymes, improved cellular structures, or advanced chemical compounds that could aid the liver in performing its functions. When better materials are found that can affect the liver's functions, it can lead to the liver working \\"softer,\\" as it would require less effort to perform the same tasks. Some potential outcomes of this improvement could include: 1. Enhanced detoxification: The liver's ability to remove toxins from the blood might be improved, allowing the liver to work more efficiently and potentially reducing the risk of liver-related health issues. 2. Improved metabolic processing: The liver's ability to process vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients, as well as storing carbohydrates as glycogen, could be optimized. This may lead to better overall body functions, as nutrients would be more readily available throughout the body. 3. Efficient bile production: If the better materials impact bile production or the constituents of bile itself, it may result in more efficient digestion and absorption of fats. This could lead to better utilization of nutrients and reduced strain on the liver. 4. Reduced workload: When the liver functions more efficiently, it could lead to a reduced workload on the organ, potentially reducing the risk of liver damage or disease. It is important to note that while the introduction of better materials can have a direct impact on one or more steps of the liver's process, these changes could simultaneously have indirect impacts on other aspects of liver function or overall health.

Upon correcting the spacing, we get the following: \\"Specifying the size of the reservoir, the weight load on the coastal zone, and picked up materials for the registration of the coast (sand, pebbles, boulders), we come to the choice of the construction of the reservoir.\\" It seems that the sentence is related to the construction of a reservoir along a coastal area, taking into consideration various factors. In order to better understand each aspect, let's break down the sentence and discuss each element: 1. Specifying the size of the reservoir: Before constructing the reservoir, it is essential to determine its size, capacity, and physical dimensions (length, width, and depth). This information will help the engineers and experts to design a reservoir capable of meeting the water management, storage, or distribution needs of the intended region. 2. The weight load on the coastal zone: Understanding the weight load supported by the coastal zone is important, as it directly affects how the reservoir will be constructed. This weight load includes the reservoir's mass, the water it holds, and any added structures like gates and spillways. Engineers need to account for the coastal zones' existing sediments and geology to ensure that the reservoir's weight can be adequately distributed or managed without causing erosion or other stability issues. 3. Picked up materials for the registration of the coast (sand, pebbles, boulders): Gathering information about the materials found along the coast, such as sand, pebbles, and boulders, will help in the planning and execution of the reservoir construction. These materials can not only impact the stability and structural integrity of the reservoir but might also be utilized as resources during the construction process. Furthermore, the presence of these materials affects the wave action and coastal erosion, which could impact the overall success and longevity of the reservoir. 4. The choice of the construction of the reservoir: After considering all of the above factors – the size of the reservoir, the weight load on the coastal zone, and the materials found along the coast – the engineers, contractors, and decision-makers involved in the project can make informed choices about the design, construction materials, methods, and overall feasibility of the reservoir construction. This process is crucial for ensuring that the reservoir effectively serves its intended purpose while minimizing any negative impacts on the surrounding environment and coastal region. In conclusion, when constructing a coastal reservoir, it is vital to consider various factors such as the reservoir's size, the weight load on the coastal zone, and the materials found along the coast to make informed decisions about the design and construction process. These factors ultimately contribute to the success and longevity of the reservoir, as well as its ability to support the intended water management goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person in whose place Hugh Robertson was appointed complex manager at Rockefeller Center? The management of Rockefeller Center shifted around this time. In November 1936, John Todd was featured in two New Yorker articles that emphasized his role in the complex's construction. At the same time, Nelson was gaining clout within Rockefeller Center Inc., and he disagreed with nearly all of Todd's suggestions. Nelson's father, John, was relinquishing his responsibilities, since the Rockefeller family's youngest son David had moved out of the family home at 10 West 54th Street, and John was now focusing on his own personal life. By April 1937, Todd regretted his decision to be featured in The New Yorker. In March 1938, Nelson became the president of Rockefeller Center Inc. He then fired Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. Nelson and Robertson wanted to avoid workers' strikes, which would delay the completion of construction. Nelson, Robertson, and the workers' unions agreed to a contract in which the unions would not strike, Robertson would not lock out union workers, and both would agree to arbitration if a labor dispute arose. Rockefeller Center was one of Nelson's primary business ventures until 1958, when he was elected Governor of New York.Public relations officials were hired to advertise the different parts of the complex, such as the gardens and the plaza. Merle Crowell set up a viewing platform on the east side of Rockefeller Center and founded the facetious \\"Sidewalk Superintendents' Club\\" so the public could view construction.

A military source told the Yonhap news agency every part of Pyongyang \\"will be completely destroyed by ballistic missiles and high-explosives shells\\". Yonhap has close ties to South Korea's government and is publicly funded. On Friday North Korea carried out what it said was its fifth, and largest, nuclear test. The international community is considering its response. The US says it is considering its own sanctions, in addition to any imposed by the UN Security Council, Japan and South Korea. Pyongyang responded on Sunday by calling the threats of \\"meaningless sanctions... highly laughable\\". The South Korean military official told Yonhap that Pyongyang districts thought to be hiding the North's leadership would be particularly targeted in any attack. The city, the source said, \\"will be reduced to ashes and removed from the map\\". The BBC's Korea correspondent Steve Evans says the South is using the same bloodcurdling rhetoric that the North frequently uses about the South Korean government in Seoul. He says there has been rising criticism within South Korea of the government as its attempts to isolate the North have failed to deter leader Kim Jong-un's nuclear ambitions. News of South Korea's attack plan for the North is believed to have been revealed to parliament following Friday's nuclear test. Meanwhile, the US's special envoy for North Korea says Washington is considering taking unilateral action against Pyongyang. \\"North Korea continues to present a growing threat to the region, to our allies, to ourselves, and we will do everything possible to defend against that growing threat,\\" Sung Kim said. \\"In addition to sanctions in the Security Council, both the US and Japan, together with [South Korea], will be looking at any unilateral measures as well as bilateral measures as well as possible trilateral cooperation.\\" North Korea is banned by the UN from any tests of nuclear or missile technology and has been hit by five sets of UN sanctions since its first test in 2006. The North said Friday's test had been of a \\"nuclear warhead that has been standardised to be able to be mounted on strategic ballistic rockets\\". Estimates of the explosive yield of the latest blast have varied. South Korea's military said it was about 10 kilotonnes, enough to make it the North's \\"strongest nuclear test ever\\". Other experts say initial indications suggest 20 kilotonnes or more. The nuclear bomb dropped by the US on Hiroshima in 1945 had a yield of about 15 kilotonnes.","completion":"Following North Korea's fifth and most substantial nuclear test yet, South Korea, supported by the United States and Japan, have threatened destructive retaliation, indicating that Pyongyang could be completely leveled by ballistic missiles and high-explosive shells especially targeting areas believed to be hiding North Korean leadership; the threat is the latest escalation in an ongoing conflict between the North, South, and their global allies in response to North Korea's continued development of nuclear weapons, a pursuit banned by the United Nations and previously resulting in five sets of sanctions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Second question: This is an algebra problem. To solve it, we need to simplify the expression given. Here's how we do it step by step: a^2b(xa^2b+a^4b) First, let's distribute a^2b to each term inside the parentheses: a^2b * xa^2b + a^2b * a^4b This becomes: (ax^1 * a^2 * b^2) + (a^2 * a^4 * b^2) Now, let's combine the a's and b's: a^(1+2) * b^2 + a^(2+4) * b^2 This simplifies to: a^3b^2 + a^6b^2 We can see that both terms have a common factor, which is a^3b^2.

Context: For active people, regular training is as important part of maintaining and increasing fitness. About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session. The pain and soreness after training needs sufficient time to recover from before another hard session can be performed. A very plausible theory pushed for many years is that the post-exercise oxidative stress in the body is the primary cause of the muscle damage and fatigue experienced. If you could reduce this oxidative stress, then it would allow quicker recovery, and then more time spent training. What this theory ignores though is that oxidative damage is a natural part of how the body adapts to stressful exercise, allowing the body to repair and grow stronger to allow higher levels of performance in the future. A small scale study has previously found that trained and untrained individuals who dose up on antioxidant supplements impair important exercise training adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and production of oxidative stress defence proteins. Now researchers have extended this study by looking at the effect of antioxidants in trained female runners, and published their findings in the European Journal of Sports Science. Twenty-three well trained female runners took part in three separate 3-week training blocks where they took either 1 gram of vitamin C, blackcurrant juice, or a placebo drink for each of the training blocks. Each of the dietary interventions involved drinking a similar volume of fruit drink of a total of half a litre per day split over the morning and evening.

Answer: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC is a block-oriented motion-compensation -based codec standard developed by the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) together with the ISO/IEC JTC1 Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). Question: what is mpeg4 avc or sp/asp A:","completion":"Yes, your answer about H.264/MPEG-4 AVC being a block-oriented motion-compensation-based codec standard developed by the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) together with the ISO/IEC JTC1 Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) is correct. Now, let me address the question you asked: \\"what is MPEG-4 AVC or SP/ASP?\\" MPEG-4 AVC, also known as H.264, is a video compression standard that provides good video quality at low bit rates. It is widely used in various applications, including video streaming, videoconferencing, and Blu-ray discs. The standard was jointly developed by the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) and the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), as you correctly mentioned. SP (Simple Profile) and ASP (Advanced Simple Profile) are two profiles under the MPEG-4 Part 2 video compression standard, which is also known as MPEG-4 Visual. These profiles define different sets of encoding tools and compression capabilities to cater to different video applications and devices. Simple Profile (SP) is designed for low-complexity video encoding. It supports mainly progressive video with resolutions up to 352x288 pixels and is suitable for applications like videoconferencing and streaming on the internet. Advanced Simple Profile (ASP), on the other hand, includes more advanced encoding tools and supports interlaced as well as progressive video. This profile is aimed at providing better compression efficiency and video quality for a wide range of applications, including high-quality video streaming and broadcasting. In summary, MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) is a highly efficient video compression standard with widespread adoption, while MPEG-4 SP/ASP are profiles under the MPEG-4 Part 2 standard, aimed at different video encoding complexity levels and various applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When it was sold recently in New York for 27000, the seller, Mr. Oliver Pitt, was asked to explain how the picture had come into his possession. Pitt said, \\"I didn't know it was so valuable. I'm not an art expert. Photography is my hobby. I bought 'Fisherman' in Italy in 1970 for 140.the picture was dirty, and I couldn't see the artist's signature.

Q:Given the following context: Lancaster's career designing for the theatre began and ended with Gilbert and Sullivan. His first costumes and scenery were for the Sadler's Wells Ballet's Pineapple Poll (1951), John Cranko's ballet with a story based on a Gilbert poem and music by Sullivan. His last were for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's revival of The Sorcerer (1973). In between, he designed more productions for the Royal Ballet, as well as for Glyndebourne Festival Opera, the Old Vic and the West End. It was a matter of mild regret to him that of the twenty plays, operas and ballets that he designed between the two, only one was for a thoroughly serious piece, Britten's Peter Grimes, for the Bulgarian National Opera in Sofia in 1964.Only two of Lancaster's theatre designs have remained in use in 21st-century productions, both by the Royal Ballet: Pineapple Poll and La fille mal gardée. In an article on the latter in 2016, Danielle Buckley wrote, \\"Lancaster's surrealist and stylized designs for Fille amplify the story's pantomime quality, and the exaggerated burlesque of its comedy – but the backdrops of fields that roll into the distance, bundles of hay, dreamy skies and village cottages provide the idealized, pastoral context that the story needs\\". Buckley adds that Lancaster’s designs have been criticised for locating the ballet in no particular time or place – \\"except, that is, of a 1960s London view of idyllic country life\\".Lancaster's stated view was that stage sets and costumes should reflect reality, but \\"through a lens, magnifying and slightly over-emphasising everything which it reflects\\". Sir Geraint Evans commented on how Lancaster's designs helped the performer: \\"[His] design for Falstaff was superb: it gave me clues to understanding the character, and reflected that marvellous, subtle sense of humour which was present in all his work.\\" answer the following question: What was the last year Lancaster created costumes and scenery?

Soon afterward, in April 1993, Albini remarked to the Chicago Tribune that he doubted Geffen would release the completed album. Albini commented years later that in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation \\"from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label. All I know is ... we made a record, everybody was happy with it. A few weeks later I hear that it's unreleasable and it's all got to be redone\\". While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, Newsweek ran a similar article soon afterwards that did. Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to Newsweek that said that the article's author \\"ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous [sic] information\\"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in Billboard. Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek to complain about the article.Nirvana wanted to do further work on the recorded tracks, and considered working with producer Scott Litt and remixing some tracks with Andy Wallace (who had mixed Nevermind). Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had an agreement with the band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement. Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic. The band decided against working with Wallace and chose to remix and augment the songs \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" and \\"All Apologies\\" with Litt at Seattle's Bad Animals Studio in May 1993.

What about someone saying \\"Don't worry, just have one little sip\\"? Most people have their first drink by the time they're 13. That first drink can be the start of a troubled life. Drinking can make teens feel good, but that lasts only a short time. Alcohol clouds your brain and limits your ability to make decisions. Excessive drinking gradually makes your brain shrink and can cause serious damage. Over-drinking can cause learning disabilities and damage your memory. It distorts your vision and leads to blackouts. Teenagers often think that drinking will give you more energy, but alcohol isn't an energy drink; it's a depressant. Drinking and driving is one of the top causes of death for teen boys. An alcohol-related motor vehicle crash kills one person every 33 minutes and injures someone every two minutes. The rate of teenagers driving drunk is so high that the government is trying to pass new laws restricting teen driving. When we get to high school, friends start pressuring us to drink. High school students see alcohol as glamorous and a way to become popular. I created a survey at my school. Twenty-four of the 63 respondents predicted they would drink in high school. Eleven said maybe, and 28 said they don't plan on drinking. Regardless of what they say now, things can change. Teens starting high school want to fit in. Some people will do anything to be accepted, including potentially(,) hurting themselves. They think that one drink won't do anything.

Early humans lived in small populations of nomadic hunters and gatherers. Human beings remained in Africa until about 40,000 years ago. After that, they spread throughout Europe, Asia, and Australia. By 10,000 years ago, the first human beings colonized the Americas. During this long period of time, the total number of human beings increased very slowly. Birth rates were fairly high but so were death rates, producing low rates of population growth. and the situation: Archaeologists studied data about human settlements. One was 100,000 years old called village R, and the other one was about 9,000 years old called village N. The older settlement was located in Africa, the other one wasn't. Answer the following question: Which village had more people that were hunters? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, it is likely that Village R, the older settlement located in Africa 100,000 years ago, had more people who were hunters compared to Village N, the 9,000-year-old settlement. The reason behind this is that the earliest members of the human species evolved around 200,000 years ago in Africa, and they primarily lived as nomadic hunters and gatherers in small population groups. As humans spread and settled in different continents, their ways of living changed, leading to adaptations in their lifestyle and food practices. By the time of Village N's existence (9,000 years ago), humans had already reached America, suggesting that other regions of the world underwent several cultural and technological advancements. During this period, the Neolithic Revolution was taking place, which led to the development of agriculture, animal domestication, and sedentary lifestyles. This would mean that the inhabitants of Village N were more likely to engage in farming and raising livestock as opposed to hunting and gathering. Therefore, Village R most likely had more people engaged in hunting compared to Village N."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The building was sold in 1549 by Buonaccorso Pitti, a descendant of Luca Pitti, to Eleonora di Toledo. Raised at the luxurious court of Naples, Eleonora was the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici of Tuscany, later the Grand Duke. On moving into the palace, Cosimo had Vasari enlarge the structure to fit his tastes; the palace was more than doubled by the addition of a new block along the rear. Vasari also built the Vasari Corridor, an above-ground walkway from Cosimo's old palace and the seat of government, the Palazzo Vecchio, through the Uffizi, above the Ponte Vecchio to the Palazzo Pitti. This enabled the Grand Duke and his family to move easily and safely from their official residence to the Palazzo Pitti. Initially the Palazzo Pitti was used mostly for lodging official guests and for occasional functions of the court, while the Medicis' principal residence remained the Palazzo Vecchio. It was not until the reign of Eleonora's son Francesco I and his wife Johanna of Austria that the palazzo was occupied on a permanent basis and became home to the Medicis' art collection.Land on the Boboli hill at the rear of the palazzo was acquired in order to create a large formal park and gardens, today known as the Boboli Gardens. The landscape architect employed for this was the Medici court artist Niccolò Tribolo, who died the following year; he was quickly succeeded by Bartolommeo Ammanati. The original design of the gardens centred on an amphitheatre, behind the corps de logis of the palazzo. The first play recorded as performed there was Andria by Terence in 1476. It was followed by many classically inspired plays of Florentine playwrights such as Giovan Battista Cini. Performed for the amusement of the cultivated Medici court, they featured elaborate sets designed by the court architect Baldassarre Lanci.

Plot title: Yellow Submarine Movie plot: Pepperland is a cheerful, music-loving paradise under the sea, protected by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The titular Yellow Submarine rests on an Aztec-like pyramid on a hill. At the edge of the land is a range of high blue mountains. The land falls under a surprise attack from the music-hating Blue Meanies, who live in or beyond the blue mountains. The attack starts with magical projectiles fired from big artillery stationed in the blue mountains. The Blue Meanies seal the band inside a music-proof blue glass globe, they render the Pepperlanders immobile as statues by shooting arrows and dropping giant green apples upon them (a reference to the Apple Records music label), and drain the countryside of colour. In the last minute before his capture, Pepperland's elderly Lord Mayor sends Old Fred, an aging sailor (whom the mayor calls \\"Young Fred\\"), to get help; he runs to the Yellow Submarine and takes off in it (\\"Yellow Submarine\\"). Old Fred travels to Liverpool (\\"Eleanor Rigby\\"), where he follows the depressed and aimless Ringo and persuades him to return to Pepperland with him. Ringo collects his \\"mates\\" John, George, and finally Paul in The Pier, a house-like building on the top of a hill. The five journey back to Pepperland in the yellow submarine.

After each has finished their performance, the scores result in a tie for the gold medal. During their acceptance of the gold medal, the two skaters engage in a public altercation that results in them being banned permanently from the men's figure skating division.A few years pass, and each has seen a disintegation in their skating career. Michaels (Ferrell) finds work in a no-name children's production and MacElroy (Heder) finds himself working in a retail store fitting others for ice skates amongst other things.While working at the retail shop, an obsessed fan of MacElroy comes to him and pleads with him to continue his dream of being a champion figure skater. He points out a technicality that would allow MacElroy to re-enter the National Figure Skating Assocation, not in the men's division, but in the pair's division. The only problem is he needs to find a partner.A short time later MacElroy and Michaels end up encountering one another during MacElroy's search for a partner and proceed to have another televised brawl.

They are present mainly as positively charged ions dissolved in water. The sodium-potassium pump moves sodium ions (Na + ) out of the cell and potassium ions (K + ) into the cell. In both cases, the ions are moving from an area of lower to higher concentration. Energy in ATP is needed for this \\"uphill\\" process. Figure below shows how this pump works. Trace these steps from left to right in the figure Now, I have a new situation: Ben and Andy studied minerals and micro-nutrients. Ben studied more about magnesium, zinc and molybdenum, while his buddy Andy studied about sodium and potassium. Answer this question please: Which person studied less about Energy in ATP ? Answer:","completion":"Both Ben and Andy focused on studying different minerals and micronutrients, with Ben studying magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum, and Andy studying sodium and potassium. It is important to note that ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is not directly related to these minerals and micronutrients, but rather serves as the energy currency in cells, including the energy needed for the sodium-potassium pump to function. The sodium-potassium pump, which is vital for maintaining an appropriate balance of ions within cells and facilitating numerous cellular processes, relies on the energy provided by ATP to move the sodium and potassium ions against their gradients. As the energy required for the sodium-potassium pump is derived from ATP, it can be assumed that Andy, who studied sodium and potassium, would have more exposure to the role of ATP in providing the necessary energy for this process. On the other hand, Ben's focus on magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum would likely involve studying their various roles and functions within biological systems, including their contributions to enzyme reactions, cellular structure, and overall health. While ATP and its role in energy transfer may be relevant to some of these topics, it is not the central focus of Ben's studies. Therefore, in comparison, it can be deduced that Ben studied less about energy in ATP compared to Andy. This is because Andy's research topic, involving sodium and potassium, would directly require an understanding of the role of ATP in the \\"uphill\\" process of moving these ions against their concentration gradients, while Ben's research focus on magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum would be less directly related to ATP's role in providing cellular energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My two year old knocked it off my desk top. I was very disappointed. Dont waste your money. Wish that I could give it zero stars Answer: Answer:","completion":"The product review provided has a negative tone. Several factors contribute to this interpretation, indicating that the reviewer is not satisfied with their purchase and would not recommend it to others. First, the title \\"zero stars\\" itself implies strong dissatisfaction as the reviewer wishes they could rate the product even lower than the minimum allowable rating. Notably, many platforms use a star-based rating system, with one star typically being the lowest score and representing a very unfavorable evaluation of a product or service. By asserting that they would like to give zero stars, the reviewer emphasizes the extent of their disappointment and frustration. Second, the review discusses specific issues with the product and highlights its failure to meet basic requirements or expectations. Particularly, the reviewer states that the item \\"won't stay put when you punch it,\\" which conveys a sense of irritation as the product does not perform its intended function. This exacerbates the negative tone when paired with the fact that a small child could easily knock it off a desktop. As a result, this outcome undermines the product's quality and its potential reliability in the eyes of the reviewer. Furthermore, the reviewer explicitly advises potential consumers against purchasing this product, stating, \\"Don't waste your money.\\" This direct warning serves to underline the negative tone of the review, as the reviewer wants to deter others from experiencing the same disappointment they did. Lastly, the general sentiment of the review consistently focuses on disappointment and frustration. Using phrases like \\"I was very disappointed\\" and \\"Wish that I could give it zero stars\\" serve to reinforce the overall negative tone of the review. Consequently, the reviewer suggests that potential buyers seek alternative products or entirely disregard this one. In summary, this product review features a distinctly negative tone, driven by the reviewer's dissatisfaction with its performance and overall experience. By detailing specific issues, explicitly discouraging others from buying the product, and wishing to give \\"zero stars,\\" the reviewer emphasizes their frustration and the magnitude of the product's drawbacks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who had an ongoing revival? , can you please find it? Agrippina (HWV 6) is an opera seria in three acts by George Frideric Handel with a libretto by Cardinal Vincenzo Grimani. Composed for the 1709–10 Venice Carnevale season, the opera tells the story of Agrippina, the mother of Nero, as she plots the downfall of the Roman Emperor Claudius and the installation of her son as emperor. Grimani's libretto, considered one of the best that Handel set, is an \\"anti-heroic satirical comedy\\", full of topical political allusions. Some analysts believe that it reflects Grimani's political and diplomatic rivalry with Pope Clement XI. Handel composed Agrippina at the end of a three-year sojourn in Italy. It premiered in Venice at the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo on 26 December 1709. It proved an immediate success and an unprecedented series of 27 consecutive performances followed. Observers praised the quality of the music—much of which, in keeping with the contemporary custom, had been borrowed and adapted from other works, including the works of other composers. Despite the evident public enthusiasm for the work, Handel did not promote further stagings. There were occasional productions in the years following its premiere but Handel's operas, including Agrippina, fell out of fashion in the mid-18th century. In the 20th century Agrippina was revived in Germany and premiered in Britain and America. Performances of the work have become ever more common, with innovative stagings at the New York City Opera and the London Coliseum in 2007. Modern critical opinion is that Agrippina is Handel's first operatic masterpiece, full of freshness and musical invention which have made it one of the most popular operas of the ongoing Handel revival. A:","completion":"The first name of the person who had an ongoing revival is George. This is in reference to George Frideric Handel, the composer of Agrippina (HWV 6) mentioned in the article.

As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of.

Article: The 11 billion self-help industry is built on the idea that you should turn negative thoughts like \\"I never do anything right\\" into positive ones like \\"I can succeed.\\" But was positive thinking advocate Norman Vincent Peale right? Is there power in positive thinking? Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are. The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your friend who is slow to learn that he has the potential of an Einstein, _ . In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written. In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, \\"I am lovable.\\" Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation . In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts. The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic viewpoint. Call it the power of negative thinking. Question: According to the study of the Canadian researchers, _ .

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Some people in Seoul on Tuesday said they are happy just to see U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un talking to each other rather than trading threats of war. “I am very happy because it is an epoch breakthrough after 70 years of division,” said Lee Jun-keun, a salesman working for a retail business. Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others... Question: Who commended Trump for his ongoing commitment to continuing peace keeping efforts with North Korea?

On his return to Nuremberg in 1495, Durer opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this). Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.

Input: sweep of the house. During this sweep, the police noticed two weapons and a marihuana growth set-up. Once police saw this, they withdrew from the premises to obtain either a warrant or consent for a more thorough search. But for appellant’s warrantless seizure, police would not have conducted the protective sweep, which led to the discovery of the items for which the police ultimately sought consent to search.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Judy Chicago (born Judith Sylvia Cohen, July 20, 1939) is an American feminist artist, art educator, and writer known for her large collaborative art installation pieces about birth and creation images, which examine the role of women in history and culture. By the 1970s, Chicago had founded the first feminist art program in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as needlework, counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. Chicago's most well known work is The Dinner Party, which is permanently installed in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. In 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at Fresno State College, hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work. At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she decided to teach off campus to escape \\"the presence and hence, the expectations of men.\\" She taught the first women's art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the Feminist Art Program, a full 15-unit program, in the spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, Vanalyne Green, Suzanne Lacy, Cay Lang, Karen LeCocq, Jan Lester, Chris Rush, Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, Faith Wilding, Shawnee Wollenman, Nancy Youdelman, and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. All of the students and Chicago contributed 25 per month to rent the space and to pay for materials. Later, Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro reestablished the Feminist Art Program at California Institute of the Arts. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by Joyce Aiken in 1973, until her retirement in 1992. Chicago is considered one of the \\"first-generation feminist artists,\\" a group that also includes Mary Beth Edelson, Carolee Schneeman, and Rachel Rosenthal. They were part of the Feminist art movement in Europe and the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art. Chicago became a teacher at the California Institute for the Arts, and was a leader for their Feminist Art Program. In 1972, the program created Womanhouse, alongside Miriam Schapiro, which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art. With Arlene Raven and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles Woman's Building in 1973. This art school and exhibition space was in a structure named after a pavilion at the 1893 World's Colombian Exhibition that featured art made by women from around the world. This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as \\"an experimental program in female education in the arts. Our purpose is to develop a new concept of art, a new kind of artist and a new art community built from the lives, feelings, and needs of women.\\" During this period, Chicago began creating spray-painted canvas, primarily abstract, with geometric forms on them. These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the \\"feminine\\". Chicago was strongly influenced by Gerda Lerner, whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of women's history would continue to struggle independently and collectively. was chicago the leader of the feminist movement","completion":"Though this article does not directly state that Judy Chicago was the leader of the feminist movement, it does mention that she is considered one of the \\"first-generation feminist artists,\\" and was a key figure in the development of feminist writing and art. Chicago also founded the first feminist art program in the United States and co-founded the Los Angeles Woman's Building, further showcasing her significant contributions to the feminist movement within the art world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fill the baking dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dishes, then bake.; *Place the ramekins filled with cream batter into a baking dish.Fill the garlic press with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dishes, then bake.;","completion":"The better solution for preparing ramekins to bake creme brulee is: *Place the ramekins filled with cream batter into a baking dish. Fill the baking dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dishes, then bake. This method is the best approach for baking creme brulee for a few reasons: 1. Uniform heat distribution: Placing the ramekins filled with the cream batter into a baking dish allows for even heat distribution during the baking process. This ensures that the creme brulee cooks evenly and achieves its characteristic smooth and creamy texture. 2. Water bath method: Filling the baking dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the ramekins is a technique called a \\"bain-marie\\" or \\"water bath.\\" The purpose of using a water bath is to provide a gentle, indirect heat source that ensures even cooking. As water can only reach a maximum temperature of 212°F (100°C) before it turns into steam, it helps to prevent the delicate creme brulee from overheating, curdling, or cracking, which could ruin the dessert's texture. 3. Easy handling: By placing the ramekins within a baking dish, it becomes easier to transfer them in and out of the oven. Instead of individually handling each ramekin, you could simply grasp the sides of the baking dish to move all ramekins at once. Moreover, the higher walls of the baking dish can prevent any sloshing or spilling of the hot water during transportation. The second option mentioned: *Place the ramekins filled with cream batter into a baking dish. Fill the garlic press with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dishes, then bake. This method doesn't make sense, as the garlic press has nothing to do with the process of baking creme brulee. It seems to be an error in the description. In fact, a garlic press is a kitchen gadget used for mincing or pressing garlic cloves - it's unrelated to the process of baking or preparing ramekins for creme brulee.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student learned less about ants that manage large herds of aphids ? Hint: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony.

Among the nominees are five English players, including Raheem Sterling, Luke Shaw, John Stones, Eric Dier, and Calum Chambers. This award, handed out annually, is reserved for players under the age of 21 who standout in Europe's top leagues. Since its inception in 2003, the European Golden Boy award has helped highlight the future stars of the football world, with illustrious past winners such as Wayne Rooney, Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero, and Paul Pogba, among others. Rooney remains the only previous English winner of the prestigious award, having claimed it in 2004 during his time at Everton. Manchester City's Raheem Sterling, who joined the club from Liverpool in 2015, is arguably the most well-known of the English nominees. The winger has seen a meteoric rise in his playing career, becoming an instrumental figure for both his club and the England national team. His impressive performances in recent seasons have made him one of the top contenders for this year's award. Luke Shaw, the Manchester United left-back, has also earned his place among the nominees, following his resurgence under current United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Shaw's relentless dedication and hard work have seen him transform into one of the league's best fullbacks, overcoming injury obstacles and receiving praise from both fans and experts alike. Everton's commanding center-back, John Stones, has also been making waves in the Premier League, earning himself a spot on the Golden Boy shortlist. Despite facing some criticism early in his career, Stones has continued to develop into an intelligent and composed defender, becoming an important figure for both the Toffees and the England national team. Tottenham Hotspur's Eric Dier has been a consistent and versatile performer for his club, playing both in the midfield and as a center-back. His commitment to the team and flexibility in multiple positions make him a valuable asset for Tottenham, which has ultimately led to his nomination for the Golden Boy award. Finally, Arsenal's Calum Chambers has shown his potential as a versatile defender since joining the Gunners in 2014 from Southampton. Though his Arsenal career has experienced ups and downs, including loan spells at Middlesbrough and Fulham, Chambers has managed to establish himself as a strong and reliable option in the defensive line. It is clear that the quality of young English talent is on the rise, as evidenced by the European Golden Boy award nominees. With Raheem Sterling, Luke Shaw, John Stones, Eric Dier, and Calum Chambers making the 40-man shortlist, the future indeed looks promising for English football as these young stars continue their development. The winner of the prestigious award will be announced later this year, and could potentially mark the second time an English player receives the honor since its origination in 2003."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device With the Dons and Celtic the only clubs never to have lost top flight status, it is the longest supporters have waited for one to come along. When Maurice Edu cancelled out a Kari Arnason opener at Ibrox 56 months ago, no one foresaw the length of time that would elapse without one of Scotland's headline matches. A powder-keg head-to-head that is, according to some Ibrox legends, as intense as anything a Rangers-Celtic game conjures up. Rangers captains of the past Terry Butcher and Barry Ferguson talk of \\"hatred\\" and \\"nastiness\\" but, with the game a sell-out, Aberdeen fans are clearly relishing a return. Many in light blue have accused the Dons of \\"raising their game\\" against Rangers but the men in red prevailed just once in the last 13 games against them before the Ibrox club's 2012 financial implosion. However, those matches came before manager Derek McInnes arrived at Pittodrie to steer the club to the upper echelons of the table with Aberdeen a very different animal under the former Ibrox midfielder. Despite Walter Smith's presence, Pittodrie tended to be an unhappy hunting ground throughout his second spell in charge with the Ibrox legend winning just once in the Granite City after replacing Paul le Guen. \\"Aberdeen always have a good attitude towards games against Rangers,\\" Smith declared after a 1-0 loss in the north east in 2009. No doubt a thinly-veiled barb given they had won just twice in their previous 12 league games that season. Pittodrie has been a struggle for many Rangers teams, but in particular the ones that came up against Alex Ferguson's all-conquering side. Incredibly, during Ferguson's eight-year tenure at Aberdeen, Rangers could only muster one single victory at Pittodrie. Ferguson would lose just five times to Rangers in league games, with four of those at Ibrox. If Rangers' Pittodrie record in the late 1970s and early 80s was dreadful, Aberdeen's record at Ibrox since the early 90s has been atrocious. Brian Grant and Eoin Jess were the heroes in a 2-0 win in Govan in September 1991. It was Aberdeen's first visit to Ibrox since they lost by the same score-line four months earlier, costing them the Premier Division title. But they haven't won there since. That's 42 visits, 0 victories. And it's not just against Rangers they have struggled against at Ibrox as that figure includes a League Cup semi-final loss to Celtic and in the last four of the Scottish Cup to St Johnstone. Ferguson led Aberdeen to 17 league victories over the Ibrox club and since his departure, almost exactly 30 years ago, the Dons have beaten Rangers on 18 occasions in top flight matches, with 11 different managers. When seeking the answer to the why this fixture is so heated, one of the main reasons is simple and sporting, very few head-to-heads between the pair have been meaningless over the years. From the 1970s, this has been a heavyweight clash, with silverware often up for grabs. The list of on-pitch incidents are lengthy. Particularly those involving John McMaster and Willie Johnston and Neil Simpson and Ian Durrant. Robbie Winters being pelted with coins, Fernando Ricksen's kung-fu kick on Darren Young, Kyle Lafferty feigning a head-butt from Charlie Mulgrew. It is a game that requires vigilance and cool heads on and off the pitch. During Rangers' four-year rise to the Premiership they faced many top flight opponents along the way. Aberdeen were not one of them. And despite the headlines and goading that will continue in the build-up to this eagerly-awaited meeting, it is worth noting that it is an important league game. Both have designs on challenging Celtic for the title yet they both find themselves four points off the pace having played a game more than the champions.

Here is a news article: MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) — Kansas State says it will pay a 5,000 fine after its marching band shaped itself into the rival Jayhawk mascot and what appeared to be a large phallus during a halftime show. The school said Tuesday that band director Frank Tracz (trays) will miss the Nov. 28 game against Kansas and that university officials must approval future halftime shows. The university says it decided to pay the self-imposed fine after the Big 12 Conference warned of potential sportsmanship and ethical conduct violations. The controversy erupted after Saturday's space-themed halftime show during the team's home opener against South Dakota. One formation featured the Kansas State band forming the University of Kansas mascot and a phallic looking Starship Enterprise crashing into it. Tracz has apologized for what he described as a \\"misinterpretation.\\" ||||| Kansas State officials have apologized for a marching band routine during Saturday night's season opener that involved the rival Jayhawks and appeared to be adult-oriented in nature. The Kansas State marching band's director will meet with university administrators Tuesday afternoon. The Pride of Wildcat Land marching band's halftime performance Saturday night included a routine where the band created the image of a University of Kansas Jayhawk and what the band's announcer said was the \\"starship Enterprise.\\" The Enterprise then approached the Jayhawk, which then broke up, with band members marching in different directions. Some saw something other than the starship Enterprise, claiming that the image was \\"obscene.\\" Jayhawk fans immediately voiced their complaints about the show on social media. Band leaders announced that the whole thing was a misunderstanding, and that the show was simply \\"the starship Enterprise attacking the beak of the bird.\\" But Kansas State President Kirk Schultz issued an apology following the performance. The story immediately went viral and has been picked up by People Magazine, The Chicago Tribune, London's Daily Mail and many other publications. Band members say their show has been misinterpreted, and Lawrence Journal World sports editor Tom Keegan says that is possible. \\"Maybe they're so nerdy they didn't realize how it looked (to fans)\\" Keegan said while appearing on KCTV5's Off the Bench Sunday night. Keegan also suggested that Kansas State football coach Bill Snyder would not be happy about the situation. \\"Can you imagine at Bill Snyder Family Stadium that went on?\\" Keegan said. \\"Can you imagine how livid, how embarrassed, how ashamed that Bill Snyder must be?\\" Whether Keegan's correct, and the band leaders and members are just too \\"nerdy\\" to understand how their show looked to some others, or whether they're just making excuses for a decision to make fun of their arch rivals, their show has certainly attracted worldwide attention and energized the KU-Kansas State rivalry. The meeting between leaders of the marching band and university administrators will be at 2 p.m. Tuesday. Copyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life.

Article: Tony Burke, Australia's environment minister, says he won't decide until next year whether the koala should be protected as an endangered species. He was expected to make his decision by the end of October. But that decision has been put off. Burke said he needed more time to go over the latest information about the koala's population. In September, an Australian Senate committee reported that there was no question the koala's population is on the decrease. \\"But they may not yet be eligible for listing as a threatened species,\\" said Senator Doug Cameron. \\"To have such a significant Australian icon included on the threatened species list would be a national shame.\\" The koala is found only in the eucalyptus forests of Australia. And its population is reported to have fallen sharply for many reasons, including the cutting down of forests to make way for human beings' development, their own illness, climate change and killings by other animals such as wild dogs. And every year many koalas are hit by cars as they are trying to cross the busy roads. Putting off the decision on protection for the koala \\"is really bad news,\\" said Debbie Pointing, the president of the Koala Action Group. \\"We've worked tirelessly for many years to gather data on the populations,\\" Pointing said. \\"That data should be enough to make a decision.\\" However, Burke pointed out that the Australian government had spent at least 6.3 million on koala conservation efforts since 1996. senators listed efforts that are already underway in Queensland - the construction of special koala bridges as well as fences along roads, to keep the animals out of harm's way. Some people say that is not enough. \\"What we're doing at the moment is likely to drive this species to extinction,\\" Queensland University zoologist Bill Ellis said. \\"Koalas are an iconic Australian animal,\\" Burke told Australians. \\"They hold a special place in the hearts of Australians.\\" But it is a fact that if more isn't done to protect the koala, they might soon hold a place only in...

Given the question: Title: drying Review: found this to be rather drying and the scent isnt great.Iwas hoping the green tea scent would come thru more.used it once and wont again. Is the review positive or negative? The answer is:","completion":"The review is negative. The review provides several clues that point towards a negative sentiment. Firstly, the reviewer describes the product as \\"rather drying\\". In most contexts, especially in beauty, personal care, and cleaning products, 'drying' has a negative connotation. It often implies that the product makes the user's skin feel dry, which is usually an undesirable effect. Next, the reviewer describes the scent of the product, stating that it \\"isn't great.\\" This is also an indicator of their dissatisfaction with the product. A 'great' smell is typically essential to a good user experience, particularly in sectors like beauty, personal care, and cleaning products. Thus, not having a satisfactory scent contributes to their negative sentiment. The reviewer then expresses disappointment because they were expecting the \\"green tea scent would come thru more\\". This demonstrates the product did not meet their expectations in terms of fragrance intensity or quality, adding to the negative sentiment. Finally, the statement \\"used it once and won't again\\" clearly expresses the reviewer's unwillingness to reuse the product, suggesting they were extremely dissatisfied with it. Therefore, given these factors, this can be concluded as a negative review. The reviewer's language and feedback do not indicate any positive feelings or satisfaction with the product, and they express disappointment and dissatisfaction in multiple ways.

Either you got the whole message and loved every minute or you couldn't wait for it to be over. It would definitly help to read and enjoy the book before watching the movie. I doubt anyone could have hoped for a better transfer from book to screen. There is so much energy in this movie if your eyes are pointed the right way.Some fans only seem to appreciate F&L as a drug-culture flick, but it really goes alot deeper than that. It's about two guys desperatly searching for the world they once knew and attempts to tear down alot of the \\"hippie\\" ideologies that many were stuck with after the summer of love. A real masterpiece from both Thompson and Gilliam. Answer:","completion":"The review seems to be quite positive despite acknowledging that the perceived quality of the product can vary depending on viewer's preference. The reviewer states their belief that the movie is a \\"real masterpiece\\" from the creators. They also mention that it is a strong adaptation from the book which indicates that the story's essence may have been well-captured. The reviewer also tips potential viewers on ways to enhance their viewing experience, suggesting that reading and enjoying the book before watching the movie would likely increase appreciation of the film. Despite recognizing that some fans may appreciate the film primarily as a \\"drug-culture flick,\\" the reviewer argues that the film goes deeper than that, painting a complex picture of two individuals searching desperately for their old world and challenging prevailing ideologies. Given these points, the review would likely increase the chances of someone buying or investing time into this product, provided they have either a favourable view of the book or an interest in the themes the reviewer mentions. However, the statement \\"Either you got the whole message and loved every minute or you couldn't wait for it to be over,\\" signals a polarizing reaction; people may either love or hate it based on their personal preferences. So overall, if the potential buyer aligns with the tastes of the reviewer or is intrigued by the challenge of fully \\"getting the message,\\" this review likely increases the chances of purchase. Conversely, buyers who are discouraged by complexities or perceived challenges in understanding may be less likely to purchase based on this review.

Plans by Labour to charge visitors from the US and 55 other countries who don't require a visa to enter the UK have been met with dismay by airlines. Under the proposals, nationals in countries enjoying a 'visa waiver' system of fast-track permission to enter the UK will be hit with a charge of around £10 per visit, which the party said would more than cover the £45 million cost of 1,000 extra border guards. That is a similar sum as the US charges for its equivalent service and Labour said tourism experts did not anticipate it would have any impact on the numbers choosing to travel to Britain. Under Labour's plans, passengers who don't require a visa to enter the UK could be met with a £10 entry fee (File Photo) But Nathan Stower, chief executive of the British Air Transport Association (BATA), voiced serious concerns over the proposals. 'While we welcome the desire to improve the customer experience for passengers arriving at the UK border, airlines have significant concerns about this proposal,' he said. 'Visitors from countries like the USA and Australia already pay the highest air passenger tax in the world to fly to the UK – £71 from next April – contributing billions of pounds to the Treasury. Adding yet another charge will make the UK more uncompetitive in attracting tourists, businesses and inbound investment. 'It is not clear how this proposed charge would be collected. The vast majority of visitors from those countries that are not required to obtain a visa to enter the UK, such as the USA, do not currently provide information to UK authorities ahead of their visit. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper believes changes need to be made on the UK's immigration policy. It might not just be your passport you need to show to enter the UK, but also an extra £10. 'Furthermore, if more money were to be raised from airline passengers alone, it would only fair for this to fund improvements in the border at airports and not at other ports of entry such as Calais.' Regular increases in the cost of general visas since 2010 - from £68 to £83 - had not resulted in reduced visitor numbers from countries not benefiting from waiver arrangements, aides said. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the plan as part of a wider program of wider reforms she believe needs to be introduced to the UK's policy on immigration. As many as 5.5 million travellers a year will be subject to the new fee - more than two in five of those from America, with Australians and Canadians the next largest groups. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article reports on plans from the Labour party in the UK to implement a fee for visitors from the United States and 55 other countries who do not require a visa to enter the UK. This proposal has been met with objections, particularly from airlines. The plan involves a proposed charge of around £10 per visit, a measure intended to offset the cost of 1,000 additional border guards, which is estimated at £45 million. The Labour party has compared this proposed charge to a similar one in the United States and has stated that they anticipate no major impacts on tourism numbers. Nathan Stower, the chief executive of the British Air Transport Association (BATA), has expressed significant concerns regarding this proposal. He points out that visitors, particularly from countries like the U.S and Australia, already contribute substantial amounts through air passenger taxes, and adding another charge could potentially discourage tourism, business, and investment in the UK. Furthermore, Stower raises questions about the methods of collecting this proposed charge, as many visitors, especially those not required to obtain a visa, do not currently share their information with UK authorities prior to their visit. He also suggests that if an extra fee is collected from airline passengers, it should be used to improve the airport borders, not other points of entry. The article also mentions that there were regular increases in the cost of general visas from £68 to £83 since 2010, which did not affect the inbound passenger traffic much. Labour's Shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, unveiled this plan as part of a broader reform initiative she believes needs to be integrated within the UK’s immigration policy.

Choices: - ground - finger - petri dish - water - soap The rationale to choose \\"water\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Water is the most likely place for bacteria to be slimy among the choices provided. The rationale behind choosing water as the answer can be explained from multiple perspectives including bacterial survival, growth, and biofilm formation. These aspects are discussed below for all the mentioned options: 1. Ground: Although the ground can house various types of bacteria, it is not the most conducive environment for bacterial growth when it comes to being slimy. The soil may contain moisture, which supports bacterial growth, but the bacterial colonies present on the ground are often localized and not slimy. 2. Finger: Our skin contains a diverse bacterial population, including hands and fingers. However, our fingers are not an ideal location for bacterial growth in terms of sliminess either. The surface of the skin, which is constantly subjected to friction, exposure to various surfaces, and handwashing, does not provide a favorable environment for slimy bacterial growth. Additionally, the constant use of our fingers would deter any biofilm formation or slimy bacterial colonies. 3. Petri Dish: A petri dish can maintain a slimy bacterial culture if it contains the appropriate growth media for the bacteria and if the dish is left undisturbed for an extended period. However, the sliminess of the bacterial growth depends on the particular species. Some bacterial colonies may become slimy, while others may remain dry. So, although a petri dish can potentially support slimy bacterial growth, it is not the most likely option since it is highly determined by the laboratory conditions and specific bacterial species. 4. Water: Water provides an environment that is ideal for bacterial growth and sliminess. The presence of moisture and nutrients in the water support the rapid growth and reproduction of bacteria, leading to the formation of biofilms. Bacterial biofilms are slimy structures formed by bacterial communities that adhere to each other and to surfaces, protecting the bacteria within from external factors, such as chemicals and predators. The abundant presence of moisture in water allows bacteria to grow and spread, ultimately creating a slimy surface or mass. Sliminess is a typical characteristic of bacterial growth in water pipes, lakes, streams, and moist surfaces where water is present. Therefore, water is the most likely place to find slimy bacteria among the given options. 5. Soap: Although soap can become contaminated with bacteria, it is not a suitable environment for the growth of slimy bacteria. Soap is designed to remove dirt, grease, and bacteria from surfaces, and its chemical composition can often inhibit bacterial growth. Additionally, soap is predominantly used in the presence of water, so any slimy bacteria growing on soap would likely be washed away during use. To conclude, water is the most favorable environment for bacteria to be slimy due to the nurturing and protective conditions that support bacterial growth and biofilm formation. The other options provided may contain bacteria, but they do not foster the ideal conditions for the formation of slimy bacterial colonies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first one she is calling Glubber, and the second she has named Malk. To try to figure out what type of products these new materials may be used for, Nelly is performing various tests. The first test she is doing is securing one end of the material to a table and then pulling on it and letting it go. When she performs this test on some Glubber, the material quickly snaps back toward the table. Performing the same process with some Malk, the material slowly crawls along the floor as it makes its way back to the table. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which material is less resistant to changing shape? Hint: Something that is elastic can return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. This property is called elasticity . As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force . The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Malk is less resistant to changing shape. In the paragraph above, it is described that when Nelly performs a test by securing one end of the material to a table and pulling on it, Glubber quickly snaps back toward the table. This suggests that Glubber has a higher elasticity, as it can return to its original shape quickly after being stretched. It exerts a stronger elastic force that allows it to spring back to its original shape, indicating its resistance to shape change. On the other hand, when Nelly performs the same test with Malk, the material slowly crawls along the floor as it makes its way back to the table. This suggests that Malk has a lower elasticity than Glubber, as it takes a longer amount of time for it to return to its original shape after being stretched. This slower response implies that Malk is less resistant to changing shape when compared to Glubber. In summary, based on the tests performed by Nelly and the information provided in the paragraph, Malk appears to be less resistant to changing shape compared to Glubber. It has a lower elasticity, meaning it exerts a weaker elastic force and takes more time to return to its original shape after being stretched."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Do these two sentences mean the same thing? Possible answers: [a]. no; [b]. yes;","completion":"[b]. yes; Both sentences convey the same central idea, which is that during MacDonald's retirement, he wrote/compiled a resource called the \\"Macdonald dictionary of Canterbury biographies,\\" consisting of 12,000 biographies, now held or managed by the Canterbury Museum. In Sentence 1, the term \\"compiled\\" is used, while in Sentence 2, the term \\"wrote\\" is used. Although these words have slightly different connotations, in this context, they essentially describe the same process of creating this dictionary of biographies. \\"Compiled\\" suggests that MacDonald gathered these biographies, potentially from other sources or works, whereas \\"wrote\\" implies that he authored the biographies himself. Regardless, both words indicate that MacDonald was behind the creation of this collection. Additionally, Sentence 1 uses the phrase \\"held by,\\" while Sentence 2 uses \\"run by\\" to describe the relationship between the biographies collection and the Canterbury Museum. The phrases differ ever so slightly in meaning: \\"held by\\" implies that the museum possesses and stores the biographies, whereas \\"run by\\" suggests that the museum actively manages or curates the collection. Despite the nuanced difference between the two phrases, it is clear that the Canterbury Museum is responsible for the 12,000 biographies in question. In both sentences, the key elements remain consistent: MacDonald's retirement, the creation of the \\"Macdonald dictionary of Canterbury biographies,\\" the presence of 12,000 biographies, and the Canterbury Museum's involvement with the collection. Consequently, these sentences can be seen as having the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: The person took a ibuprofen after experiencing a headache, what happened to him next? Options: - feel relieved - cross street - learn to swim - walk - act responsibly Explain why a human would choose \\"feel relieved\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"feel relieved\\" as the answer to the question above because ibuprofen is a common over-the-counter medication that is widely used to help relieve pain, such as headaches. When taken in appropriate doses, it can effectively reduce inflammation and alleviate pain, providing a sense of relief for the person experiencing the headache. The other options presented in the question do not directly relate to the act of taking ibuprofen for a headache. These options include: - Cross street: This is an unrelated action to taking medication for a headache and does not describe the possible outcome of taking ibuprofen. - Learn to swim: This is also an unrelated action and does not explain the possible effects of taking ibuprofen for a headache. - Walk: While taking a walk can sometimes help alleviate a headache, it does not directly relate to the specific action of taking ibuprofen. - Act responsibly: This option could be interpreted in various ways and does not specifically address the outcome of taking ibuprofen for a headache. Given the context of taking ibuprofen to treat a headache, \\"feel relieved\\" is the most appropriate answer as it directly addresses the intended result of the action, which is to reduce pain and discomfort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Trivia question: What is the geographical term for a ring-shaped coral island And the answer is?","completion":"The answer to the trivia question is \\"atoll.\\" An atoll is a ring-shaped coral island, or a collection of small islets, surrounding a central lagoon. This geographical term is often associated with the coral reefs that form in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Atolls are formed over millions of years through the process of coral reef development around underwater volcanic islands. It begins with a fringing reef, which forms close to the shore of an island. As the volcanic island sinks back into the ocean due to erosion and subsidence (the process where an island gradually lowers due to the weight of the volcanic rocks and the cooling of the Earth's crust), the corals continue to grow upward and outward to reach sunlight, thereby forming a barrier reef. The barrier reef encircles a lagoon that eventually replaces the volcanic island, which has sunk entirely beneath the water's surface. The atoll is the final stage of this process, characterized by a ring-like shape with a central lagoon and small islets or islands formed by the rim of coral reefs. In some cases, these lagoons may be connected to the open ocean through channels. Atolls are home to an array of marine life, including various species of fish, invertebrates, and other sea creatures. They provide essential habitat and feeding grounds for these organisms, and their rich biodiversity makes them vital ecosystems in our planet's oceans. The Maldives, found in the Indian Ocean, and the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu in the Pacific are well-known examples of atoll formations. Charles Darwin, the renowned naturalist, was the first to present a detailed theory on the formation of atolls and the coral reef development process during his voyage around the world aboard the HMS Beagle in the 19th century. His observations and discoveries led to a deeper understanding of the geological and ecological processes at work in creating these unique structures. In conclusion, the geographical term for a ring-shaped coral island is an atoll. These fascinating and ecologically significant formations are the result of coral reefs growing around sinking volcanic islands over millions of years, eventually creating a ring-like structure with a central lagoon and small islets. Atolls play a crucial role in supporting marine life and contribute to the incredible biodiversity found in our planet's oceans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry. Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources...

Article: The Gunpowder Plot was conspiracy to kill King James I, as well as the members of the House of Lords and Commons at the re-opening of Parliament. It was designed by a group of Catholics in protest against the anti-Catholic laws that were being introduced by the king. Robert Catesby was the leader of the group. It was he and his cousin, Thomas Wintour, and two other friends, Thomas Percy and John Wright, who formed the center of the group. They were joined by nine more men; among them was Guy Fawkes, from the city of York in the north of England. Fawkes found a store room directly under the House of Lords and rented it out under the false name of John Johnson. The conspirators stored thirty-six barrels of gunpowder there, and Fawkes, who was an explosives expert, was to light the fuses on 5th November 1605. The plot failed because one of the conspirators, Francis Tresham, sent a letter to his relative, who was a member of the House of Lords. The letter warned him not to attend the opening ceremony of Parliament. The letter was passed on to the authorities, who took action. Guy Fawkes was found in the cellar on the night of 4th November with the thirty-six barrels and a number of fuses. He was imprisoned and ill-treated, eventually giving away the names of the conspirators. Soldiers of the king surrounded Holbeach House, in the Midlands, where they knew the conspirators to be hiding. In the fight that followed, four of them were shot dead, including Catesby and Percy, who were actually killed by the same bullet. The others were imprisoned and hanged along with Guy Fawkes on 31st January 1606. These days, on 5th November, children all over Britain celebrate Guy Fawkes Night by building huge bonfires and lighting fireworks. It's a family tradition and an occasion to eat potatoes baked by the flames. There is always a 'guy' on top of the fire, a model of Guy Fawkes, dressed in the clothes of the 17th century.

Place your camera. Place your lights. Use the rule of thirds. Make sure your shooting location is quiet before filming. Edit your video.\\" Article:","completion":"Article Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Producing High-Quality Videos Creating high-quality engaging video content is an art that combines both technical skill and creative vision. It requires a balanced blend of understanding the right background, placement, lighting, composition, as well as editing proficiency. Step 1: Choose Your Background The first step in video production involves identifying a suitable background. This aspect is paramount since the background can significantly influence the mood and tone of the video. It helps to ensure that the background complements the subject or topic of your video, rather than being a distraction. This could be a solid, neutral colour for a professional look, a natural setting for more relaxed videos, or an environment relevant to the theme of your content. Choosing the right background not only improves the aesthetic appeal of the video but also increases viewer engagement. Step 2: Place Your Camera Once you have chosen the ideal background, the next step requires the strategic positioning of your camera. Camera placement can have a profound effect on viewer interpretation. It is crucial that the camera is placed at eye level to establish a relatable and genuine connection with the viewer. It’s also vital to contemplate the framing and positioning based on the type of shot you need. Always ensure you have a tripod or a property camera setup to reduce shake and provide a better viewing experience. Step 3: Light it Up Good lighting is vital to produce high-quality video content. Lighting sets the scene’s mood and greatly impacts the perception and professionalism of the video. Soft, natural lighting is often best, but in spaces where lighting is poor, using professional lighting kits can hugely enhance the video's quality. Ensure lighting is placed strategically to illuminate the subject properly without causing harsh shadows or overexposure. Step 4: Use the Rule of Thirds When composing your shot, the 'Rule of Thirds' is a useful guideline to consider. Imagine your scene divided into nine equal parts by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines. Placing your subject along these lines or at their intersection can add balance and interest to your composition, making it more engaging for the viewers. Step 5: Ensure a Quiet Location for Filming This step often gets neglected in the preparation for video production, yet it is one of the most crucial aspects. Ensuring a quiet location for filming is key to capturing clear audio without disruptions. Audio quality is as important as video quality, and background noise can adversely affect the viewing experience. Step 6: Edit Your Video Lastly, after successfully shooting the video, the task is not over yet. Your raw footage requires fine-tuning and polishing through video editing. This phase can totally transform the appearance and quality of your video.

St. John Richardson Liddell (September 6, 1815 – February 14, 1870) was a prominent Louisiana planter who served as a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. He was an outspoken proponent of Southern emancipation of slaves. Liddell was murdered by a former Confederate Officer near his home in 1870. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"St. John Richardson Liddell wanted to keep slaves locked up\\"?","completion":"To analyze whether the conclusion \\"St. John Richardson Liddell wanted to keep slaves locked up\\" is true based on the given paragraph, let's break down the key information in the text: 1. St. John Richardson Liddell was a Louisiana planter and a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. 2. He was an outspoken proponent of Southern emancipation of slaves. 3. Liddell was murdered by a former Confederate Officer in 1870. Step 1: Identify the topic of interest, which is St. John Richardson Liddell's stance on slavery. Step 2: Look for information in the paragraph that is directly related to slavery. We find that he was an \\"outspoken proponent of Southern emancipation of slaves.\\" Step 3: Determine if the conclusion aligns with the information provided. The statement \\"St. John Richardson Liddell wanted to keep slaves locked up\\" contradicts the fact that he supported Southern emancipation of slaves. Based on the information provided, we cannot conclude that \\"St. John Richardson Liddell wanted to keep slaves locked up\\"; rather, the paragraph suggests the opposite – that he was a supporter of Southern emancipation of slaves."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First question: This question is asking for the limit of the function when x gets closer and closer to 0. Imagine a point moving closer and closer to zero along the line. To find this limit, we can use something called L'Hôpital's Rule. After applying this rule twice, we find that the answer to this question is 1/2.

But the expression (the math stuff inside the limit) is different from the first one. It looks more complicated, right? So, to make it simpler, we can use something called the Binomial Theorem to help! After using this, we find that the answer to this question is 45/9, which is actually equal to 5.

The gladiator munus was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice, probably because death was not its inevitable outcome or purpose. Even so, the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods, and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the di manes or other gods.

This article: Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.Guinea remained Makeba's home for the next 15 years, and she and her husband became close to President Ahmed Sékou Touré and his wife, Andrée. Touré wanted to create a new style of African music, and all musicians received a minimum wage if they practised for several hours every day. Makeba later stated that \\"I've never seen a country that did what Sékou Touré did for artists.\\" After her rejection from the US she began to write music more directly critical of the US government's racial policies, recording and singing songs such as \\"Lumumba\\" in 1970, (referring to Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated Prime Minister of the Congo), and \\"Malcolm X\\" in 1974. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose popularity declined markedly in the US after her marriage?, what is it ?","completion":"The name of the person whose popularity declined markedly in the US after her marriage is Makeba."},{"prompt":"Q:Given the following passage \\"Since the Carnation Revolution of 1974, which culminated in the end of one of Portugal's most notable phases of economic expansion (that started in the 1960s), a significant change has occurred in the nation's annual economic growth.[citation needed] After the turmoil of the 1974 revolution and the PREC period, Portugal tried to adapt to a changing modern global economy, a process that continues in 2013.

The first part of the sentence, \\"Michael has accomplished more in his career than Kenneth,\\" indicates a comparison between the career achievements of Michael and Kenneth and sets up an expectation that the reason for this difference will be explained. Option 1, \\"Michael worked hard every step of the way,\\" offers this explanation. It implies that Michael's sustained hard work throughout his career has contributed to him having more accomplishments than Kenneth. On the other hand, option 2, \\"Kenneth worked hard every step of the way,\\" does not provide a clear explanation for the difference in career achievements between the two. While it acknowledges that Kenneth has also put in considerable effort in his career, it does not directly relate this effort to the comparison made in the first part of the sentence. Instead, it leaves the reader wondering how Kenneth's hard work relates to the point being made.

Barcelona face Arsenal in the Champions League on Tuesday. Luis Enrique's side go into the first leg of the last-16 tie at the Emirates unbeaten in 32 league and cup games and aiming for unprecedented back-to-back Champions League titles. Spain's top two teams - Barca and Real - previously negotiated their own TV deals, but have now been stopped from doing so under a new Spanish law. It means new rules will see rights to show La Liga pooled and sold collectively, bringing it more in line with the Premier League - which will see the bottom club still earn £99m next season. He added: \\"The Premier League is the best football competition. It has the most interest for fans and most revenues. They are doing things good and keeping teams in the competition where everyone being equal is of interest for everybody. \\"We have different budgets in Spain and it would be difficult for someone like [current Premier League leaders] Leicester to be top of the league. \\"Our rivals are the Premier League, they are the big adversaries. We have to do our best to increase our revenues and our financial situation to make the talent of our teams stay with us. \\"That is why I am so worried and we are working on this. We want to keep the talent at home. \\"I know our players are in touch with other clubs, it's normal. None of our players said they want to leave. Most get better economical offers, but our players are not in Barcelona for the money, they are there because of the football and the fans' commitment.\\" This summer, ex-Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola will take over at Manchester City. The Spaniard won 14 trophies in four years at the Nou Camp. City's chief executive officer Ferran Soriano and director of football Txiki Begiristain both previously worked at Barcelona. \\"I don't think City are replicating anything,\\" said Bartomeu. \\"Like a lot of clubs in the world, they have a project to make the club grow. \\"Some of their people used to be with us at Barcelona and they are bringing their experience to the club. This is normal because in Europe there is the movement of professionals from one to another. \\"Pep will do well at any club, he is a very good coach and did a fantastic job at Barcelona. He was in the playing arena for years and I had the privilege of working with him for two years.

Argentine Messi has 27, Brazilian Neymar 23 and Uruguayan Suarez has notched 41. Barcelona are currently top of La Liga, eight points clear of Atletico Madrid in second. \\"Right now, we are happy because we have the best players in the world,\\" said Bartomeu. \\"Messi is with us, Neymar is an incredible player of the future but Suarez brought the balance to them. Together, this trident is incredible. \\"The fans of Barcelona have never seen players do this: how they enjoy playing, the friendship they have between them and the locker room. Suarez is one of the keys to that. We are very happy with him, we knew he was an incredible player and he has been better than expectations.\\" Real Madrid topped Deloitte's Football Money League for 2015 - a list of the highest earning clubs put together by the professional services firm's sports business group. Real's 577m euros earnings (£439m) put Barcelona into second place with 560.8m euros (£426m), with Manchester United in third on 519.5m euros (£395m). But Bartomeu said his goal is to reach 1,000m euros (£780m) annual revenue to \\"develop our club and make it bigger\\". He said that in the next 12 months, Barcelona may decide to have \\"title rights holders\\" for the Nou Camp to help raise 420m euros (£327m) to refurbish the famous stadium and increase its 99,750 capacity. Bartomeu said there \\"may be controversy\\", but that all key decisions \\"would be voted on\\". One off-field issue which has led to speculation that Barcelona's top stars will leave Spain is problems with tax. Defender Javier Mascherano is expected to avoid jail despite admitting tax fraud, while fellow Argentina international and world player of the year Messi faces trial alongside his father in the summer over tax fraud charges. Team-mate Neymar has denied any connection with allegations of corruption and fraud surrounding his transfer to Barcelona. In a separate tax fraud case in his native Brazil, the striker has had 50m (£34.5m) of assets frozen by a court.

He claimed most of the players in Spain had been \\"in tax review\\" in the last few years and had paid extra taxes, but argued it was the \\"responsibility of their tax advisors if they do things correctly or incorrectly\\". Barcelona won their fifth Champions League crown last season, but what would happen if they didn't qualify for the competition one season? \\"Sometimes, for the interest of football, why not give wildcards like in tennis,\\" says Bartomeu. \\"Sometimes the top players don't qualify and are given wildcards for the interest. This can happen in football. That is the decision of Uefa. \\"Sometimes, clubs have a bad season and it is a big punishment to not play in the Champions League.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work.

Manowar is an American heavy metal band from Auburn, New York. Formed in 1980, the group is known for lyrics based on fantasy (particularly sword and sorcery) and mythology (particularly Norse mythology and Greco-Roman mythology). The band is also known for a loud and bombastic sound. In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that \\"these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... By 1983, the band left Liberty Records and struck a deal with Megaforce Records in the US and Music for Nations in Europe--signing the contract in their own blood. The signing was a cover story in the 1983 July-August issue No. 47 of Kerrang!. When Manowar returned home, they immediately went into a recording studio to produce what, in the intentions of the group, would have been a simple EP, but came out instead, due to the quantity and quality of the tracks made in that period, as the band's second album, Into Glory Ride. An EP was actually published in 1983 with the title Defender containing, as its main track, the eponymous song, which included more work by Orson Welles. The atmosphere of the album evoked classical heroic fantasy and mythology, and served as a predecessor to Viking metal. It contained several innovative features, both in style and sound, and led to a huge increase in the number of fans of the group, particularly in the United Kingdom, where the band planned a long tour that was ultimately canceled. The song \\"Defender\\" was later re-recorded and included in the Fighting the World album of 1987. To apologize for the failure of their UK tour, Manowar decided to dedicate their next album to the United Kingdom. The album, Hail to England, was recorded and mixed in just six days and was released in early 1984. Its promotional tour, \\"Spectacle of Might\\", had a large number of dates in England. The tour saw Manowar initially as support band for Mercyful Fate, but soon the group led by DeMaio was put in the headline slot. Manowar soon returned to work in the recording studio. After leaving Music for Nations, the quartet released Sign of the Hammer ten months after their previous album. The new record presented stark changes in rhythm, with very technical tracks characterized by a slow pace, like the epic \\"Mountains\\", and quick ones, as the eponymous \\"Sign of the Hammer\\". Its success enabled band to embark on a two-year world tour, after which they took 1986 off. Following further disagreements with their new label, the group changed record label to Atlantic Records in 1987. Via Atlantic, they released Fighting the World, which enjoyed more extensive distribution and increased the band's prominence in the international heavy metal scene. Album art was designed by Ken Kelly.

Article: Ever thought of moving to a new country? How about starting a new country? Patri Friedman is planning to do just that. He left Google years ago to set up the Seasteading Institute. And his dream is to build seasteads-----floating micro-nations in the middle of the ocean. So, what will life on a seastead be like? Probably a bit like life on a cruise liner , but much larger, with shops, gyms, swimming pools, schools and other areas. In fact, the early seasteads may actually be specially-rebuilt cruise liners. But as science advances, Friedman believes they'll become more like floating cities, with several hundred people. Seasteading raises a lot of questions. First of all, how will the new countries make money? The Seasteading Institute has suggested several money-making ideas, including ocean-based theme parks, casinos and fish farming. There's also the questions of safety. With storms, typhoons and pirates , the high seas are a dangerous place. However, the Institute says that it can stand bad weather and prevent crimes with its well-designed systems. So, is this just a day dream? Well, maybe not. One of the people behind the project is Peter Thiel. He founded PayPal and was one of the first investors in Facebook. So far, he's donated 500,000 to the project. And Friedman isn't wasting any time. He recently announced the creation of the Poseidon Award. This will be given to the first seastead with fifty people. Friedman is hoping to hand out the award in 2015. Question: Which of the following can be the best titles of this passage? Options: A: Seasteading: a new idea of living B: Seasteading: a wild way of farming C: Peter Thiel: a man behind the project D: Patri Friedman: a crazy day dreamer The answer is:","completion":"A: Seasteading: a new idea of living. This title encapsulates the overarching idea presented in the article. The main concept discussed was the concept of seasteading, which is creating floating micro-nations in the middle of the ocean as a new way of living. It is focused on the vision of Patri Friedman, the founder of the Seasteading Institute, who dreams of establishing seasteads as bustling microcosms of life with accommodations like shops, gyms, swimming pools, and schools. The title also connects to other aspects touched on in the article like the issues of finance, safety and infrastructure of these new sea-based communities. Option B: \\"Seasteading: a wild way of farming\\" misrepresents the main theme of the article. While fish farming was mentioned as a potential source of income for these floating utopias, it was not the key focus of the article and doesn't capture the main idea of creating an entirely new societal structure on the ocean. Option C: \\"Peter Thiel: a man behind the project\\", while not necessarily incorrect, is too narrow. Peter Thiel's role as a financial supporter of the Seasteading Institute and its projects is important, but the text mostly emphasizes on the ideas and goals of Patri Friedman, the founder. The article provides more coverage to the broader concept of seasteading rather than just focusing on Peter Thiel's involvement. Option D: \\"Patri Friedman: a crazy day dreamer\\" although it includes Patri Friedman, it negatively characterizes him and the seasteading idea as a crazy day dream, which undermines the serious planning, investment, and consideration for safety and logistics detailed throughout the article. Thus, it doesn't convey the full scope of the article's content. Hence, by covering the main theme and content of the article without reducing or misrepresenting any of it, Option A: \\"Seasteading: a new idea of living\\" can stand as the most appropriate title for this passage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Guatemala's government has declared a state of siege and sent hundreds of troops to a northern province where officials say a Mexican drug gang is overtaking towns and threatening residents. President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,\\" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. \\"In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,\\" he said.

A crash is heard as someone runs over their flower pot outside. Amina is the exact opposite of what a woman is supposed to be, wearing trousers, a button down shirt, and a worn hat, with her hair down and unkempt. She owns her own cafe, serves blacks and whites in the same area, and stands up to men of all sorts; In short, Amina is by no means typical. She runs her cafe with Jacob (David Dennis), an older black man who is very timid, and very quick to follow the rules. But when two policemen come to threaten the cafe for serving blacks along with whites, he bravely shields Madeleine (Grethe Fox), the white postmistress, from their unrestrained violent behavior. Madeleine thanks Jacob, and the first romance is kindled.Meanwhile, Miriam (Lisa Ray), is a typical Indian housewife having recently emigrated from India. She performs her duty of caring for her two children, and one on the way, while also taking dismissive comments and abusive tendencies from men, including her husband Omar (Parvin Dabas).

Article: The playwright George Bernard Shaw once said humorously, \\"England and America are two nations divided by a common language. If he were writing today, he might add 'divided by a common technology--- e-mail'\\". Two completely different styles of e-mail have formed on either side of the Atlantic-Euromail and Amerimail. Americail is informal and chatty. It's likely to begin with a \\"Hi\\" and end with a \\"Bye\\". The chances of Amerimail containing a smiley face or an \\"xoxo\\" are disturbingly high. We Americans are unwilling to dive into the meat of an e-mail. We feel we have to first inform recipients about our vacation on the island which was really excellent except the jellyfish were biting and the kids caught a cold, so we had to skip the whale watching trip, then about that investors ' meeting in New York. Amerimail is a bundle of contradictions, casual and yet direct, respectful yet over proud. In other words, Amerimail is America. Euromail is stiff and cold often beginning with a formal \\"Dear Mr. X\\" and ending with a simple \\"Sincerely\\". You won't find any mention of kids or the weather or jellyfish in Euromail. It's all business. It's also slow. Your correspondent might take days even weeks to answer a message. Euromail is exactly like the Europeans themselves. Recently about 100 managers were asked on both sides of the Atlantic whether they noticed differences in e-mail styles. Most said yes. Here are a few of their observations: \\"Americans tend to write (e-mail) exactly as they speak.\\" \\"Why don't you just call me instead of writing five e-mails back and forth?\\" \\"Europeans are less interested in checking e-mail\\". \\"In general, Americans are much more responsive to e-mail--they respond faster and provide more information.\\" So which is better, Euromail or Amerimail? I realized it's not popular these days to suggest we have anything to learn from Europeans, but I'm fed up with an inbox filled with casual, barely meaningful e-mails from friends and colleagues. If the alternative is a few earnestly written, carefully... Question: What are characteristics of Amerimail? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Informal and chatty\\"? A:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"Informal and chatty\\". Amerimail, which represents the American style of e-mail communication, is indeed characterized by its informal and chatty nature. It typically begins with a friendly \\"Hi\\" and ends with a casual \\"Bye.\\" It is not uncommon for Amerimail to contain emojis, such as smiley faces or \\"xoxo.\\" In addition to its informality, Amerimail often includes personal anecdotes or stories before getting into the main subject of the e-mail. This can include updates about vacations, family life, or other personal matters, as Americans hesitate to jump straight into the main topic without sharing these details. While being informal, Amerimail can be considered direct in the sense that it gets to the point, even though it may be buried under personal information. At the same time, it can also be seen as respectful by fostering a more personal connection with the recipient and demonstrating a willingness to share personal experiences. In a nutshell, Amerimail embodies the American culture with its blend of casualness and directness, demonstrating a mix of informality, openness, and friendliness in e-mail communication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A second-rate boarding school is run by the tyrannical and mean Michel Delassalle (Meurisse). The school is owned, though, by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot). Delassalle also has a relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), another teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both, as well as unkind to the children. Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan to get rid of Michel forever. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface. Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained. Nicole sees in the paper that the police have found the corpse. However, when Christina goes to the morgue, she learns it is not actually Michel's body. There she meets Alfred Fichet (Vanel), a retired private detective. He becomes involved in the case, much to Nicole's chagrin. When Christina and Alfred come back, a boy is punished for breaking a window; the boy says it was Michel who punished him.

Question: I can use this background: A firm with high fixed costs requires a large number of customers in order to have a meaningful return on investment. This is where economies of scale become important. Since each firm has large initial costs, as the firm gains market share and increases its output the fixed cost (what they initially invested) is divided among a larger number of customers. Therefore, in industries with large initial investment requirements, average total cost declines as output increases over a much larger range of output levels. Now, I have a new situation: City D's mayor wants to invite more businesses in the city. Three firms, firm A, firm B, and firm C, took advantage of this opportunity. Firm A does not require large initial costs, but firm B and firm C require large initial costs. Firm B managed to increase its market share, but firm C failed to increase its market share. Answer this question please: Which frim's average total cost would decline, firm B or firm C? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided background information and the situation in City D, Firm B's average total cost would decline. The primary reason for this conclusion is the concept of economies of scale, which come into play when a firm with high fixed costs – such as Firm B and Firm C – gains a larger market share and increases its output. As more customers are acquired and output grows, these firms can spread their large initial investment over a greater number of customers, thus reducing the average total cost. Since Firm A does not require a large initial cost, it cannot take advantage of economies of scale in the same way as Firm B and Firm C. Therefore, discussing its average total costs would not be relevant to the question. In the case of Firm B and Firm C, both have high fixed costs due to their large initial investments. However, only Firm B managed to increase its market share, while Firm C failed to do so. As a result, Firm B can leverage its increased market share to spread its fixed cost over a larger customer base, which leads to a reduction in its average total cost. On the other hand, Firm C's failure to increase its market share means that it cannot distribute its initial investment as widely among customers. This implies that its average total cost would not decline as significantly, or may even stay high, due to its inability to achieve economies of scale. In conclusion, taking the background information and the specific situation in City D into account, Firm B's average total cost is the one that would decline, as it successfully increased its market share and output, allowing it to benefit from the economies of scale. In comparison, Firm C failed to achieve the same market growth, which would prevent its average total cost from declining."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose work fell from favor during his later years? , can you please find it? Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his...

Write a title for this article: Michael Mace at Rubicon Consulting, a small research firm based in Los Gatos, Calif., has done anybody interested in the iPhone two favors: 1) He published a first-rate piece of research on the impact of the device on its owners and Apple’s APPL competitors, and 2) He has made his results easily — and freely — available on the Web. The key findings — based on interviews with 460 randomly selected iPhone users in the United States — are summarized in a dozen Quick Facts and ten Implications, both available here. Some of the bullet points: The full 35-page white paper — with color charts — can be downloaded as a PDF from the same Rubicon site. It’s easy reading and worth your time. For those of you who don’t make it all the way to the white paper, three charts struck me as particularly useful. The first is a bar chart showing what people do with their iPhones — daily, occasionally or never. Checking e-mail jumps out as the No. 1 thing most do every day, but it’s interesting how many fewer actually compose e-mail on the device. And it’s also interesting to see what most iPhone users never or rarely do with the device — like buy music, watch videos or read maps. One function we wish had been included in the first chart — use the iPhone to make and receive phone calls — is explored in the pie chart below. It turns out, one out of three iPhone owners carry around two phones. The RIM RIMM BlackBerry is the most popular second phone — used by nearly one in ten iPhone owners. Mace speculates that that will probably change when the iPhone gets Exchange support. But we wonder how many iPhone owners keep a simple, cheap cell phone with them either because they’re running out their contract with their original carrier or because it just works better as a phone. The third chart is the one that shows whose ox got gored when Apple entered the smartphone market. The big loser was Motorola MOT ; nearly a quarter of iPhone owners traded up from a Razr. Another big slice comes from RIM, but Mace believes that it’s Microsoft MSFT — squeezed between Apple and GOOG — that faces the biggest challenge down the road. More on that below the chart. Here’s why Mace believes Microsoft faces “severe challenges” in the smartphone market: Microsoft’s Windows Mobile is sandwiched between two big competitors, Google and Apple. Apple is crafting hardware-software systems that deliver a great user experience, while Google is giving away an operating system to the very companies that license Windows Mobile today. It’s possible for Microsoft to try to compete on both fronts, but creating a proprietary device and at the same time selling an operating system to others is extraordinarily difficult (Palm tried to do it and ended up splitting the company in two). We think Microsoft should probably decide whether it wants to compete in devices (in which case it will need to create its own phones, as it did for music players with the Zune) or compete in operating systems (in which case it will probably have to give away Windows Mobile for free). Both alternatives are very high-risk, and require business models that are outside Microsoft’s core competencies. The company’s recent purchase of Danger, which designed the TMobile Sidekick, may indicate that it intends to go the device route.

Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogorou shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited.

News article: Toyota Says No Full Production Until Yearâs End The time frame was the longest yet described by a Japanese car company in assessing the continued effects of the supply chain disruptions caused by last month’s destructive quake and tsunami. Though Toyota’s 17 plants in Japan escaped the disaster relatively unscathed, factory lines are working at only half volume here and at 40 percent overseas, as vital suppliers in Japan’s worst-hit areas struggle to restart operations. Toyota had indicated this week that its Japanese operations would remain at half-speed through at least June 3, but was unwilling to speculate beyond that. And it had said on Tuesday that it would cut production at its North American plants by 75 percent in the next six weeks to conserve its limited supply of parts made in Japan. The two other main Japanese automakers, Nissan and Honda, are also operating at only about half of normal production volumes in Japan. At a briefing for reporters here on Friday, Akio Toyoda, president and chief executive of Toyota, said he expected to ramp up production gradually in Japan, starting in July, as more parts makers came back on line. Toyota will raise production at its overseas plants a month later, in August, to allow for the parts to arrive from Japan, Mr. Toyoda said. Production at home and overseas will return to predisaster levels at all factory lines and across all vehicle models by November or December, Mr. Toyoda said. “The damage has been so widespread in this unprecedented calamity that its economic effect is being felt throughout Japan and in every industry,” Mr. Toyoda said. He added that the automaker had dispatched employees to help recovery work at some of its most vital parts makers. The severe disruptions come as a painful blow to Toyota just as it had appeared set to shake off the effects of a sharp slowdown in sales after the global economic crisis, as well as its handling of a spate of recalls. The reduced production also highlights a downside to Toyota’s insistence on making almost half of its cars in Japan and shipping them overseas. Also, its celebrated just-in-time production system, which reduces parts inventories to a minimum, may have made the disruptions worse. The automaker estimates that it faces shortages of about 150 critical parts, down from about 500 immediately after the March 11 quake. Atsushi Niimi, executive vice president in charge of production, said that Toyota had switched suppliers in some cases to speed the recovery. He said it had been a bitter revelation to Toyota that its cars, even those produced overseas, still relied so heavily on Japanese parts. “We need to procure more parts overseas, and we also urge our suppliers to make more forays outside Japan,” Mr. Niimi said. He added that Toyota would diversify its supplier base over all to make its supply chain more resilient. “It’s something we don’t want to think about, “ he said, “but it is something we cannot avoid if we are to continue to do business in a quake-prone country.” Mr. Toyoda, the company chief, said continuing aftershocks made the outlook uncertain. He declined to comment on the effect of the disruptions on the company’s earnings. “We just had an aftershock yesterday,” he said. “As these continue, the rapid recovery we’ve seen can come undone. The future is impossible to predict.” Another concern is the severe energy shortage brought by the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station, 140 miles north of Tokyo, as well as damage to other power plants in the region. To avert a power supply collapse, the Japanese government initially instructed companies to reduce their energy use by as much as 25 percent. But frantic efforts by utilities to increase power generation at plants outside the worst-hit zones, as well as a public drive to conserve energy, has eased the energy shortfall, allowing the government to lower its directive to 15 percent. Mr. Niimi, the executive vice president for production, said that Toyota was discussing energy-saving measures with other automakers, like shutting production lines during the week and running them on weekends, when more electricity is available. Still, Mr. Toyoda said, the company was committed to keeping production — and jobs — in Japan. “Above all, we all love Japan,” he said. “As we face a national crisis, each company must do its part.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

The previous hundred years of peace and seclusion in Japan had created relative economic stability. The arts and architecture flourished. There were unanticipated consequences when the shogunate debased the quality of coins as a strategy for financing the appearance of continuing \\"Genroku\\" affluence.

Though not providing much direct information about the origins or history of the development of kabuki in prior periods, the works collected were written at a time when many of the standards of kabuki were being established and formalized; the work thus reflects the philosophies and aesthetics of one of kabuki's most formative periods. One of the earliest extant versions was originally published in 1776, as a set of woodblock printed books in four volumes. It is unclear whether the Analects were printed as a collection before this time, but references to the \\"seven writings\\" indicate that the works were considered together as a group, even if they were not published in such a fashion, since their creation in the early 18th century. - Yoshizawa Ayame I ( ) ( 1673 - 15 July 1729 ) was an early Kabuki actor , and the most celebrated onnagata ( specialist in female roles ) of his time .

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that had their contents auctioned on 6 May 1850? from the following article ? Etty had planned for a burial in York Minster, but neglected to cover the necessary costs in his will. With Yorkshire local government in political and financial chaos in the wake of the bankruptcy of George Hudson, there was no political will to organise a public subscription or to waive the fees, and as a consequence Etty was buried in the churchyard of St Olave's Church, his local parish church. On 6 May 1850 the contents of his studio were auctioned, in a total of 1034 lots including around 900 paintings; some of these paintings were incomplete studies later completed by other artists to increase their value. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, his works fetching huge sums on resale. He continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some, with Charles Robert Leslie observing in 1850 \\"It cannot be doubted that the voluptuous treatment of his subjects, in very many instances, recommended them more powerfully than their admirable art; while we may fully believe that he himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\".Six months after William's death, Betsy Etty married chemist Stephen Binnington, a distant relation of the Etty family. She moved into his house in Haymarket, and some time after his death moved to 40 Edwardes Square, where she died in 1888 at the age of 87. While Etty did have admirers, the patchy quality of his later work meant that he never acquired the circle of imitators and students that could have led to him being seen as the founder of the English realist movement, now considered to have begun in 1848 with the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais, two of the three founders of the Pre-Raphaelites, were heavily influenced by Etty's early works but recoiled from his later style.

Article: Introduction Blenheim Palace is one of the Europe's largest and greatest palaces. It was built between 1705 and 1722 as a reward of the British government to John Churchill, 1stDuke of Marlborough, for defeating King Louis XIV's army at Blenheim, a small Bavarian village on the Danube River. The palace was designed by Sir John Vanbrugh, which displayed strength and arm glory. It is the largest non-royal building in England and is now listed by the UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Winston Churchill In 1874, the palace was the birthplace of the duke's most famous _ . Winston Churchill, who was to become the UK's Prime Minister (some would say Britain's greatest 20th-century politician ) and Nobel prize winner for literature. It is also in Blenheim that Winston got married to Clementine Hozier in 1908. A lasting exhibition is devoted to the man's life, work and writings. Winston and his wife are buried in Bladon Church within the palace. Opening Hours & Admission Blenheim is still the home of the 11th Duke of Marlborough and is therefore not open all year round (although the park is). The palace opens its doors to visitors from 12 February to 11 December. Entry to the palace, park and gardens cost PS11.50 during the low season and PS13 during the peak season (Easter weekend and from 28 May to 11 September), or PS6/PS8 for the park and gardens only. The park is open all-year round from 9am to 4:45pm (last entry). Admission is PS2.50 for adults and PS1.50 for children. Note that numerous discounts exist for seniors, students, children and groups. Please refer to the official website for more details. Question: Why can not people visit Blenheim Palace all the year round? Options: A: They are too busy to afford the time.

You're not a girl Translate to Czech","completion":"To translate the phrase \\"You're not a girl\\" into Czech, I need to consider the grammar and vocabulary of the Czech language. Here are the steps I follow: 1. Identify the subject pronoun: \\"You're\\" is a contraction of \\"you are\\", where \\"you\\" is the subject pronoun. In Czech, the direct equivalent of \\"you\\" (singular) is \\"ty\\" and (plural) is \\"vy\\". I will use the singular form \\"ty\\" for this translation. 2. Identify the verb: The verb in the sentence is \\"are\\" (from \\"you're\\") which is a form of the verb \\"to be\\" in English. In Czech, the verb \\"to be\\" is \\"být\\", and its present tense form, corresponding to \\"are\\", is \\"jsi\\" for the singular form \\"ty\\". 3. Negate the verb: The sentence is negative, so I will add the Czech negation \\"ne-\\" to the verb \\"jsi\\" to get \\"nejsi\\". 4. Identify the noun: The noun in the sentence is \\"girl\\". The Czech equivalent of \\"girl\\" is \\"dívka\\". 5.

Write the answer: What word is used by Christians for the suffering and death of Jesus?","completion":"The word used by Christians for the suffering and death of Jesus Christ is \\"Passion.\\" The term traces its etymology back to the Latin word \\"passio,\\" which means \\"suffering\\" or \\"enduring.\\" In the context of the life of Jesus, the Passion specifically refers to the events and episodes leading up to and including His crucifixion. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the Passion, it is essential to outline the key events narrated in the four Gospels–Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John–which chronicle Jesus' final moments. Although the Gospels differ in some details and emphasis, they collectively present a poignant portrayal of the Passion of Jesus Christ. 1. The Last Supper: Before the suffering and crucifixion, Jesus shared a final meal with His disciples, now known as the Last Supper. This gathering is significant in Christianity as it is when Jesus instituted the sacrament of the Holy Eucharist, symbolized by the breaking of bread and sharing of wine, which represent His body and blood. 2. The Agony in the Garden: After the Last Supper, Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray. He was in deep distress, aware of the impending betrayal and the suffering to come. During this time, Jesus prayed to God, asking for strength to endure the painful ordeal. 3. The Betrayal by Judas and Arrest: One of Jesus' disciples, Judas Iscariot, had agreed to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. Led by temple guards and Roman soldiers, Judas identified Jesus with a traitorous kiss, leading to His arrest. 4. The Trials: Jesus was subjected to a series of trials that started with a preliminary hearing before the Sanhedrin (the Jewish supreme council) and the high priest. He was then presented to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea. Pilate initially found no guilt in Jesus and sent Him to Herod Antipas, ruler of Galilee. Unsuccessful in eliciting a confession, Antipas subsequently returned Jesus to Pilate, who eventually yielded to the crowd's demand to crucify Jesus in place of the criminal Barabbas. 5. The Scourging and Crowning with Thorns: Before crucifixion, Jesus was brutally beaten and scourged by Roman soldiers in an act of severe physical torture. In a cruel mockery of His claim to be the \\"King of the Jews,\\" the soldiers adorned Jesus with a purple robe and a crown made of thorns, causing unbearable pain and humiliation. 6. The Crucifixion and Death: Carrying the heavy wooden cross, Jesus was led to Golgotha (also known as the Place of the Skull) to be nailed to the cross alongside two criminals. Jesus endured unimaginable pain and suffering on the cross for several hours before He ultimately surrendered His spirit to God and passed away. 7. The Burial: After His death, Jesus' body was taken down from the cross, wrapped in a burial shroud, and placed in a tomb donated by a wealthy follower, Joseph of Arimathea. The Passion is central to Christian belief because it exemplifies Jesus' ultimate act of self-sacrifice for the spiritual redemption of humanity. This event, along with Jesus' subsequent resurrection, forms the basis of Christian faith and salvation. The Passion is observed and commemorated by Christians around the world, particularly during Holy Week–the final week of Lent–culminating in the solemn observance of Good Friday, the day on which Jesus was crucified."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How to measure the height of horses Purchase a horse measuring stick marked with hand measures. If a horse measuring stick is not available, a standard measuring tape is acceptable. Horse measuring sticks can be found at equestrian supply stores (tack shops), farm supply stores and from various online retailers.","completion":"Step 1: Approach the horse calmly. Before starting the measurement, it's necessary to approach the horse in a calm and non-threatening manner. This helps ensure the horse remains calm and cooperative during the measurement process. Step 2: Position the horse on a flat, level surface. To obtain an accurate measurement, the horse should be standing on a flat and level surface. Make sure all four hooves are on the ground and the horse is standing upright with its head in a natural position. Step 3: Locate the horse's withers. The withers is the ridge between the horse's shoulder blades. This is the point where the height of a horse is traditionally measured. Step 4: Place the measuring stick or tape against the horse. If using a horse measuring stick, position it vertically next to the withers, making sure the stick is perpendicular to the ground. If using a measuring tape, hold one end on the ground and extend the tape vertically, keeping it parallel with the horse's withers. Step 5: Take the measurement. Slide the leveling arm or marker on the measuring stick down to rest on the withers. If using a measuring tape, manually hold the tape in place at the highest point of the withers. Record the measurement in hand units, where one hand is equal to four inches (10 cm). Most measuring sticks will have hand units marked on them. If using a measuring tape, divide the total inches by four to convert to hands. Step 6: Double-check the measurement. To ensure the accuracy of the measurement, repeat the process at least once more. Compare the two measurements and make sure they are consistent. Step 7: Record the horse's height. Document the horse's height in hands and inches (or centimeters) for future reference, either in a logbook or in your preferred digital format. By following these steps, you can accurately measure the height of a horse using a horse measuring stick or a standard measuring tape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer choices: - Lift - kinetic - weight - motion - speed - direction - color - muscles Answer:","completion":"Pushing and pulling an object primarily affects its speed, but it can also impact other aspects, such as direction and motion. In order to provide a detailed response, let's first break down the effects of pushing and pulling on an object's different properties. 1. Lift: Lift is a force that acts on an object in the upward direction, usually associated with the force an airfoil generates as it moves through the air. Pushing and pulling on an object typically occurs along the horizontal plane, so it doesn't directly influence the lift that the object experiences. 2. Kinetic: Kinetic refers to the energy an object possesses due to its motion. When you push and pull on an object, you are transferring energy, which causes the object to accelerate or decelerate. In other words, pushing and pulling an object can increase or decrease its kinetic energy, depending on the direction and force applied. 3. Weight: Weight is a force due to gravity acting on an object's mass. Pushing and pulling do not have a direct impact on the weight of an object, as they don't change its mass or the gravitational force acting upon it. 4. Motion: Motion is the process of an object moving or changing its position. When you push or pull an object, you are creating motion by causing it to move. Therefore, pushing and pulling an object will influence its motion. 5. Speed: Speed is a scalar quantity that describes the rate of motion, or how fast an object is moving. Pushing and pulling an object can directly increase or decrease its speed, depending on the direction and magnitude of the force applied. 6. Direction: Direction is a vector quantity that indicates the orientation of an object's motion. When you push or pull an object, the force can change its direction, provided that the force is applied at an angle to the object's initial direction. 7. Color: Color is a property of an object that depends on the wavelengths of light it reflects, absorbs, or transmits. Pushing and pulling an object do not affect its color, as these actions have no impact on its physical or chemical properties related to light interaction. 8. Muscles: The term \\"muscles\\" is not applicable to objects, as it refers to the contractile tissues in animals responsible for producing motion. Therefore, pushing and pulling an object will not increase its \\"muscles.\\" To conclude, pushing and pulling an object can increase its speed, while also impacting its kinetic energy, motion, and direction. However, these actions do not have any direct effect on an object's lift, weight, color, or \\"muscles.\\""},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

An inmate walked out of a notorious open prison dubbed ‘Holiday Bay’ because he wanted to avoid the ‘temptation of illegal drugs’, a court heard. Graeme Shepherd, 41, browsed in a village post office and strolled around the village of Hollesley for three hours before being arrested in the grounds of a church. His barrister told a court he had taken ‘positive action’ to escape Hollesley Bay prison in the hope of being sent back to a closed jail, after an earlier formal request for a transfer had been turned down by the open jail. Graeme Shepherd fled Hollesley Bay jail (pictured) as he claimed he wanted to avoid the 'temptation of illegal drugs' Alan Wheetman, defending, said the request to be moved from the category D jail at Hollesley, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, was refused because Shepherd had refused to name prisoners involved in the supply of drugs. Mr Wheetman told Ipswich Crown Court on Tuesday: ‘He realised that in order to get away from Hollesley Bay he would have to take some positive action. 'He realised that anyone who escaped would be transferred back to closed conditions. ‘He has found it difficult in an open prison because of the temptation of illegal drugs. He says there is an awful lot of drugs in Hollesley Bay.’ Lee Chapman (pictured) previously claimed drugs were readily available at the prison as well as mobile phones. Mr Wheetman said Shepherd had been free of drugs since 2009 and had undergone regular voluntary testing in prison. Prosecutor Hugh Vass said Shepherd was found missing by a prison officer carrying out a morning roll call on December 11. Shepherd, who is serving an indefinite sentence for robbery, was located in the grounds of All Saints Church, Hollesley, by a policeman later that day. Mr Vass said: ‘He said he didn’t want to go back to drug taking and had done it for his own safety.’ Shepherd admitted escaping from lawful custody on December 11 and was ordered to serve an additional four months on top of his original sentence by Judge Rupert Overbury. Hollesley Bay prison has long been nicknamed Holiday Bay because of its relaxed atmosphere and sea views. A serving prisoner claimed in November last year that drugs and phones were easily available at the prison and that women had stayed overnight at the jail. The claims were made at Ipswich Crown Court by a barrister representing Lee Chapman, 34, before the defendant was sentenced for carrying out six burglaries while on the run from the jail - where he was serving a life sentence for arson with intent to endanger life, and burglary. Prison bosses strenuously denied the claim that women were permitted to sleep at the jail and said the possession of drugs or phones by inmates was treated as a criminal offence. Another inmate William Barlow, 30, who also went on the run because he did not like the jail’s ‘lax attitude’ to drugs was jailed for four weeks last October. Ipswich Crown Court heard how the defendant wanted to escape the jail as he is trying not to take illegal drugs. Ipswich Crown Court head how former drug user Barlow hoped to get caught and transferred to another prison even though he only had two weeks left to serve of a three and a half year sentence for burglary. He claimed he had to get away because other inmates were putting pressure on him to bring Class A drugs into the jail. In October, bank raider Kevin Smith, 29, went on the run from the prison just ten days after he had arrived. He had been transferred to the jail just two months into a five year term for conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to steal a motor vehicle.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 0 = -77*a + 40*a - 185 for a. Solve this problem.","completion":"Okay little buddy, let's solve this simple equation together step by step! We want to find the value of 'a' that makes the equation true. The equation is: 0 = -77*a + 40*a - 185 1. First, we combine the 'a' terms: -77*a + 40*a = (-77 + 40) * a = -37*a So now, our equation looks like this: 0 = -37*a - 185 2. Now we want to isolate 'a', so we'll move 185 to the other side of the equation by adding 185 to both sides: 0 + 185 = -37*a 185 = -37*a 3. The last step is to divide by -37 to find the value of 'a': a = 185 / -37 And we find that a = -5.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: The Golgi apparatus is a large organelle that is usually made up of five to eight cup-shaped, membrane-covered discs called cisternae, as shown in Figure above . The cisternae look a bit like a stack of deflated balloons. The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages different substances for secretion out of the cell, or for use within the cell. The Golgi apparatus is found close to the nucleus of the cell, where it modifies proteins that have been delivered in transport vesicles from the RER. It is also involved in the transport of lipids around the cell. Pieces of the Golgi membrane pinch off to form vesicles that transport molecules around the cell. The Golgi apparatus can be thought of as similar to a post office; it packages and labels \\"items\\" and then sends them to different parts of the cell. Both plant and animal cells have a Golgi apparatus. Plant cells can have up to several hundred Golgi stacks scattered throughout the cytoplasm. In plants, the Golgi apparatus contains enzymes that synthesize some of the cell wall polysaccharides.

To provide a more detailed and long response, including the key information, the answer could be restructured as follows: The name of William Paley's book that claims divine beneficial design is \\"Natural Theology, or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity, Collected from the Appearances of Nature,\\" often referred to simply as \\"Natural Theology.\\" Published in 1802, the book presents a comprehensive argument for the existence of God based on the evidence of order, purpose, and design visible in the natural world. Paley's ideas were influential in British natural philosophy and theology of his time. In \\"Natural Theology,\\" Paley employs a teleological argument, which means that he argues from the design or purpose in nature to the existence of a Designer, who is God. The book is famous for its \\"watchmaker analogy,\\" where Paley suggests that just as a watch, with its intricate and purposeful mechanism, implies the existence of an intelligent watchmaker, the complex structures and processes observed in the natural world imply the existence of a divine Creator. Paley's work considers multiple examples of intricate mechanisms in nature, such as the structure of the eye, as evidence for the notion of divine design. He believed that adaptation in living organisms could be explained by the Creator acting through natural laws, specifically designing each species with a particular purpose and function within the natural order. This way of thinking was later challenged by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, which proposed that adaptation and the appearance of design in nature could be a result of natural processes rather than a conscious Designer. In conclusion, the book in question is \\"Natural Theology\\" by William Paley, which advocates for the existence of a divine Creator responsible for the beneficial design observed in nature. This work and its ideas have played an important role in the historical development of science and religion debates."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Each sprayer is different, so read the instruction manual before starting. Usually, you fill the sprayer's bucket with your chosen paint. You then attach the sprayer pump to the bucket. Sprayers usually come with different nozzles depending on which part of the fence you're painting, so choose the correct nozzle to begin. Unless you're only painting a small portion of the fence, choose the largest nozzle first. As you continue painting and need to get into cracks and crevices, use smaller, more precise nozzles as needed. Remember to use an oil-based fence that is safe for wood and exterior use and choose a day that is not very windy. Use horizontal strokes for horizontal panels and vertical strokes for vertical ones. Allow the primer to dry before proceeding. Drying times vary, so refer to the instructions on the can of primer for precise drying times. Keep your nozzle about six to eight inches away from the fence. Use a steady back and forth motion to spray your fence. For horizontal panels, move up and down. For verticals ones, move back and forth. After spraying down one panel, go over your work at a perpendicular line of about 90 degrees. This leaves a crisscross pattern on your fence that eliminates streaks. Make sure not to make arcs at the ends of each stroke. This will spray paint in unwanted places. After your paint dries, examine your fence. Decide whether or not a second coat is necessary. If you chose a quality paint, you can probably get by with a single coat. However, if your paint is a little thin, add an extra coat after the first 1 dries. Check your paint's instructions to see how long it takes to dry. Most paints need to dry overnight.

Question: What position did Eziquiel Carrerra play for the Blue Jays? Passage 1:Nehru's foreign policy was the inspiration of the Non-Aligned Movement, of which India was a co-founder. Nehru maintained friendly relations with both the United States and the Soviet Union, and encouraged the People's Republic of China to join the global community of nations. In 1956, when the Suez Canal Company was seized by the Egyptian government, an international conference voted 18–4 to take action against Egypt. India was one of the four backers of Egypt, along with Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the USSR. India had opposed the partition of Palestine and the 1956 invasion of the Sinai by Israel, the United Kingdom and France, but did not oppose the Chinese direct control over Tibet, and the suppression of a pro-democracy movement in Hungary by the Soviet Union. Although Nehru disavowed nuclear ambitions for India, Canada and France aided India in the development of nuclear power stations for electricity. India also negotiated an agreement in 1960 with Pakistan on the just use of the waters of seven rivers shared by the countries. Nehru had visited Pakistan in 1953, but owing to political turmoil in Pakistan, no headway was made on the Kashmir dispute.

At the Targa Florio it was team's sole front-engine entry, with Mairesse and Pedro Rodríguez driving. They retired after one of the drivers crashed during practice. 0780TR returned to the factory for repairs and modification of its nose to TRI/61 style. This was completed in time for the car to be run by the factory-supported North American Racing Team in the 1961 1000 km Nürburgring. Driven by Pedro Rodríguez and his younger brother Ricardo, the car finished second behind the Maserati Tipo 61 of Lloyd Casner and Masten Gregory. The Rodriguez brothers had to pit late in the race after destroying a front wheel, eliminating any chance of a win. The car then was entered by Scuderia Ferrari in the 1961 24 Hours of Le Mans, driven by Mairesse and Mike Parkes. After a poor start, they finished second, again behind Hill and Gendebien. They ran third for much of the race, achieving second when the Rodríguez brothers' 250 TRI61 retired with broken pistons with two hours to go. In the season-ending Pescara 4 Hours 0780TR was driven to victory by Scuderia Ferrari's Lorenzo Bandini and Giorgio Scarlatti, despite an oil leak that saw Bandini fall back to 27th. From this position, he regained second place with his rapid pace and won when the leading Camoradi Maserati Tipo 61 retired. Passage 3:The Blue Jays opened the scoring in the third inning with five runs. Ezequiel Carrera walked with one out, moved to second on a wild pitch, then scored on Josh Donaldson's double. Back-to-back singles by Edwin Encarnacion and Jose Bautista made it 2–0. After Russell Martin walked to load the bases, Troy Tulowitzki cleared them with a triple. Rangers' starter Cole Hamels threw 42 pitches that inning, the most pitches in an inning he had ever thrown. Next inning, Melvin Upton Jr.'s leadoff home run made it 6–0. Rangers' shortstop Elvis Andrus's throwing error to first allowed Devon Travis to reach. He moved to second on a passed ball, then scored on Josh Donaldson's single to make it 7–0 and knock Hamels out of the game. The Rangers bullpen tossed 4 scoreless innings, but after back-to-back singles to lead off the ninth off Jake Diekman, Bautista hit a three-run home run amid boos from the Rangers crowd, giving the Blue Jays a 10–0 lead.

The scientists are foiled by an extremely dense layer of material at the boundary between the two. To penetrate the barrier and reach the magma below, they intend to detonate an atomic device at the bottom of the hole. The leader of the project, Dr. Stephen Sorenson (Dana Andrews), who is secretly dying of cancer, believes that the atomic device will burn its way through the barrier, but the project's chief geologist, Dr. Ted Rampion (Kieron Moore), is convinced that the lower layers of the crust have been weakened by decades of underground nuclear tests, and that the detonation could produce a massive crack that would threaten the very existence of Earth. The atomic device is used and Rampion's fears prove justified, as the crust of the Earth develops an enormous crack that progresses rapidly. Sorenson discovers that there was a huge reservoir of hydrogen underground, which turned the small conventional atomic explosion into a huge thermonuclear one that was millions of times more powerful. Another atomic device is used in the hope of stopping the crack, but it only reverses the crack's direction. Eventually the crack returns to its starting point at the test site, and a huge chunk of the planet outlined by the crack is expected to be thrown out into space. Sorenson remains at the underground control center to record the event despite pleas by his wife Maggie to evacuate with the rest of the project staff.

Chief Blount captured Chief Hancock, and the settlers executed him in 1712. In 1713 the Southern Tuscarora lost their Fort Neoheroka, located in Greene County. About 950 people were killed or captured and sold into slavery in the Caribbean or New England by Colonel Moore and his South Carolina troops. His forces were made up of 33 white men and more than 900 Native American allies, mostly Yamasee and Cherokee, historic competitors to the Tuscarora. At this point, the majority of the surviving Southern Tuscarora began migrating to New York to escape the settlers in North Carolina. Their leader declared that those remaining in the South after 1722 were no longer members of the tribe. They joined the Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Confederacy, and were accepted as the sixth nation. The remaining Tuscarora signed a treaty with the settlers in June 1718. It granted them a tract of land on the Roanoke River in what is now Bertie County. This was the area already occupied by Tom Blount, and was specified as 56,000 acres ; Tom Blount was recognized by the Legislature of North Carolina as King Tom Blount. The remaining Southern Tuscarora were removed from their homes on the Pamlico River and forced to Bertie. In 1722 the colony chartered Bertie County.

Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Antifreeze could also be called “antiboil” because it also raises the boiling point of the water in a car radiator. Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the radiator above 100 °C, which is the boiling point of pure water. If the water boils, it could cause the engine to overheat and become seriously damaged. However, if antifreeze has been added to the water, the boiling point is much higher. For example a 50 percent antifreeze solution has a boiling point of 129 °C. Unless the water gets hotter than this, it won’t boil and ruin the engine. Now, I have a new situation: Rob is an auto mechanic. He was checking the radiators of his car and truck. He put antifreeze into the car radiator, but didn't put any antifreeze into the truck radiator. He was wondering how the vehicles would fare in coming hot weather. Answer this question please: Which vehicle would do worse in hot weather and hot engine, car or truck? A:","completion":"The truck would do worse in hot weather and hot engine conditions, because Rob didn't put any antifreeze into the truck radiator. Without antifreeze, the boiling point of the water in the truck radiator would be lower (100 °C) compared to the car radiator that has antifreeze (boiling point of 129 °C with a 50 percent antifreeze solution).

The woman killed in a deranged driver’s bloody Times Square rampage on Thursday was an 18-year-old tourist who lived in a small Michigan town but loved the glittery spectacle of New York City. Alyssa Elsman of Portage, Mich., was vacationing with family when she and her 13-year-old sister found themselves in the path of the speeding car driven onto a sidewalk by Richard Rojas, 26, who also injured 21 other pedestrians in the attack. The siblings were struck just before noon as they walked along the sidewalk of Seventh Avenue, between West 42nd and 43rd streets, police officials said. Elsman was pronounced dead at the scene. Her sister was taken to an area hospital, cops said. Less than an hour before the horrific crash, Elsman had posted a video on Instagram showing her standing atop the red staircase above the TKTS booth in Duffy Square, where she had visited one year ago. The sisters had been on vacation with their mother and one of Alyssa’s friends, Alyssa’s devastated boyfriend, Trevor West, told The Post. West said he knew something was wrong when Elsman didn’t respond to a text message he had sent her. “She would always text me back as quick as she could, and when I didn’t hear from her or her friend I knew something horrible happened,” West said. “I knew something was wrong.” West, who had started dating Elsman six months ago, said she was “everything” to him. “She motivated me, loved me, gave me everything I needed that I couldn’t give myself. And now that she’s gone, I don’t know how I’m going to fill that void,” West said. “I don’t know how I’m going to function without her ever again.” Elsman had told him she was enjoying her trip to the Big Apple, West recalled. But she also said she had started feeling sick while walking around Thursday morning. “She felt better in Times Square,” West said. “Then I didn’t hear from her.” Rojas was bent on committing murder and wanted cops to kill him, police sources told The Post. Of the 22 people injured in the crash, four were in critical condition as of Thursday night and three were in serious condition, authorities said. Elsman attended Portage Central High School and worked as a “carhop,” or roller-skating server, at a Sonic Drive-In, according to her Facebook page. She had been scheduled to return to Michigan on Tuesday. A witness, El Marvin, recalled seeing a young woman apparently dead on the ground. “I saw a girl, young . . . She was on the ground,” said Marvin, 38. “Her forehead was busted. Blood everywhere. She was gone. A police officer took his handkerchief and put it over her face. He was crying.” Another witness, Julio Sanchez River, 20, was delivering food in the area at the time and ducked inside a building when he saw Rojas’ car barreling toward him. “There were clothes and shoes everywhere,” he said. “I saw a bunch of people in the aftermath that got injured. It was a pretty scary sight. It was really gruesome.” Meanwhile, Mayor Bill de Blasio visited victims’ families at Bellevue Hospital on Thursday afternoon. “You are going to have to be strong now,” de Blasio was overheard telling relatives outside the pediatric ward.

(May 18) AP Emergency workers work at the scene after multiple people were injured when a vehicle struck numerous pedestrians May 18, 2017, in Times Square in New York City. (Photo: GARY HE, EPA) Staff and students at Portage Central High School are grieving the loss of a 2016 graduate who died today when a vehicle careened into a crowd in New York City's Times Square, killing the girl and injuring her sister and 21 others. Alyssa Elsman, 18, was a kind, compassionate student known around the school for selling delicious muffins she baked in a cooking class, principal Eric Alburtus said. \\"We're all kind of a mess,\\" he said late this afternoon as the community absorbed the shocking news. Related: A man who appeared to be intoxicated steered his car onto a sidewalk in Times Square around midday, killing Elsman and injuring 22 others including Alyssa's 13-year-old sister Ava. Ava attends Portage Central Middle School. The driver, 26-year-old Richard Rojas, was tackled by pedestrians and taken into custody. Alburtus was in a meeting when a news alert popped up on his phone about the crash. Later, about 2 p.m., he received calls from friends of the Elsman family who told him Alyssa had died. \\"Alyssa was wonderful young lady,\\" he said. \\"When you first got to know her, you would perceive that she was shy or quiet. The more you got to know her, the more you would realize she was funny, and thoughtful, and compassionate to other people.\\" Alburtus met with teachers this afternoon to tell them the news. The school is bringing in grief counselors Friday for students. “Our deepest sympathies go out to the Elsman family,” Portage Public Schools Superintendent Mark Bielang said in a statement. “It is the most devastating kind of sad when a wonderful person in our community is lost so young, and under such heartbreaking circumstances.” People from as far away as Belgium and Guatemala flooded Elsman's Facebook page with messages of condolence. The page says she worked as a carhop at a Sonic restaurant. Portage resident Olivia Lemke, 18, said her family moved next door to the Elsmans on Calico Avenue in Portage about a decade ago. She said the Elsmans, who no longer live next door, took an annual trip to New York City, and she guesses that’s why the sisters were in Times Square. Lemke recalled meeting Elsman on the playground of nearby Lake Center Elementary School. They became fast friends, lasting through when both graduated from Portage Central High School last year. “They were together a lot,” Olivia’s mother, Kristen Lemke, said. “If one wasn’t (at one house), the other was (at the other house). They spent a lot of time together.” Olivia Lemke described Elsman as a “wallflower.” She said Elsman had a tight-knit friend group of about four people along with many friendly acquaintances. “She was a good person and a family person,” Kristen Lemke said. “She took care of her brother and sister a lot and she was always there.” “I went to her for everything — literally,” Olivia Lemke added. “She was honest.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the band member that wrote all the lyrics on the album that went to number one in UK? from the following article ? In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

Get aboard if you want to learn more about this underground transportation system. This is an unusual form of transportation, because it is a tunnel that trains travel through and not an actual form of transportation. The Chunnel is actually the English nickname for the Channel Tunnel. In French, it is called le tunnel sous la Manche. It is a rail tunnel beneath the English Channel at the Straits of Dover. It connects Cheriton in Kent, England with Sangatte in northern France. It is the second longest rail tunnel in the world. Did you know that the British and the French had a race whi1e they were building the Chunnel? The race was to see who could get to the middle of the tunnel first. The British won by a little bit. It took 15,000 workers over seven years to dig the tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1994. The completed Chunnel cost about 21 billion. But it all paid off, because it became very popular, very quick. Millions of people use it. Now it is getting even more popular. There are three complete tunnels in the Chunnel. The two outside ones are the passenger trains. The small inner one is a guidance train. The guidance train is not used for transportation. Each track is exactly parallel to each other. There are four different train systems in the Chunnel. The Eurostar is a high speed passenger service that connects London, Paris, Brussels, and Lille. The Eurotunnel shuttle is a rail ferry service. These shuttles carry cars. These are railcars that allow drivers to drive their vehicles on and off. There are also two Eurotunnel goods service trains. Now you know more about the Chunnel.

Summarize the following: Challenge yourself to talk to at least a couple new people every day. It can be tough to approach new people at school or work, especially if you’re naturally shy. Try to relax, remind yourself that everyone gets nervous, and take a step out of your comfort zone. For example, instead of eating lunch alone, look for someone you’ve never met and say, “Hey there! Is this seat taken?” Later on, they’ll probably notice you when you pass them in the hallway and say hello. If you’re nervous, remember that everyone has insecurities and gets shy, even if they seem totally confident on the outside. When you meet someone or have a conversation, smile naturally and look them in the eye. Try not to fake a smile and, if you have to, think of something that cracks you up without fail. When making eye contact, don’t stare without blinking, but look at the person directly to show you’re paying attention to them. Whether you’re having lunch with someone new or at a work meeting, try to think of thoughtful questions that show you’re engaged in the moment. When the person responds, try to pay attention to them instead of just thinking of something interesting to say. For example, if you’re at a new school, ask the person sitting next to you, “What do you do for fun? Are you in any clubs or do you play a sport?” Instead of asking another unrelated question after they respond, say something like, “Oh cool! I’ve never played hockey, but it’s fun to watch. Do lots of people go to games and show school spirit?” Once they respond, try mentioning an activity that you are interested in to build the conversation. From your music taste to snowboarding, an interest or hobby can make you more noticeable. However, you don't want to just adopt the interests of your crush or a popular person to get them to notice you. Figure out what you enjoy and do it. If you love a music genre, listen to as many tracks and artists as you can and learn about its evolution. Developing an interest or hobby can help you spark conversations and get noticed by like-minded people. If you already have an interesting hobby, you can use it to start conversations as well. Joining a club or sports team is another great way to meet new people and make deeper connections. Since everyone involved already has that activity in common, it can be a little easier to form relationships with your teammates. Running for student government is another great way to get recognized by your peers. If your workplace has a company team, join it or support it. For example, if there’s a company softball team but you’re not the best athlete, go to the game, cheer for your team, and bring a cooler with refreshments. Whether it’s a school dance or a company cocktail hour, do your best to attend social events. You have to put yourself out there if you want people to notice you. If you stay home, you could be passing up a good time or networking opportunity. If you’re an introvert, try to use it to your advantage at social events. Listen and observe while all the extroverts talk. Then, when the opportunity presents itself, you could say to someone, “I heard you mention Roald Dahl earlier. He’s my favorite author!” Whether the person is your crush or an executive at work, they’ll notice that you paid attention to them and sparked a meaningful conversation.","completion":"So, it's important to talk to new people every day, even if you're shy. Try smiling, looking in their eyes, and asking questions about what they like to do for fun. Join clubs and teams to meet more friends, and go to social events so people can notice you. Remember, it's okay to be a little nervous because everyone feels that way sometimes. Just be yourself and try to have fun when talking to others!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Add spaces between the words in the following text: Theideaofrepetitionorasystemofshapesisanoverallappliedconceptwhenitcomestoalmostanykindofdesigning.","completion":"The idea of repetition or a system of shapes is an overall applied concept when it comes to almost any kind of designing. In the design world, repetition is the intentional reuse of elements, patterns, or motifs to create structure, unity, and consistency. Whether it be in fashion, architecture, graphic design, or any other form of creative output, applying the concept of repetition can contribute to a more cohesive and aesthetically pleasing result. A system of shapes refers to the deliberate use of geometric shapes and forms to create a particular design or pattern. This can be seen in numerous instances, from logos and brand identities to intricate patterns found within textile and jewelry design. Integrating repetition and a system of shapes can lead to a wide range of benefits in the designing process: 1. Creating visual consistency: When elements are repeated within a design, it allows the viewer's eye to easily recognize and follow the pattern, making it more comprehensible and engaging. 2. Establishing a sense of unity: Repetition helps bring together separate components of a design, allowing them to function as a single coherent entity. This is particularly crucial in instances where various types of media and elements need to be integrated within a single design. 3. Enhancing brand identity: When a company consistently uses specific shapes and motifs, it helps to create a more recognizable identity. This can be seen in the Coca-Cola logo or Apple's distinct apple icon, which have become synonymous with their respective brands. 4. Adding visual interest: Repetition can also add interest and depth to a design when used creatively, especially if it comprises an intricate pattern or a dynamic arrangement of shapes. 5. Communicating hierarchy or emphasis: By repeating specific shapes or elements, a designer can draw attention to certain aspects of a design or create a sense of importance within the composition. 6. Encouraging rhythm and movement: The use of repetition and shapes in a design can also create a sense of rhythm, guiding the viewer's eye throughout the composition, highlighting key features, and creating a sense of flow. Overall, the use of repetition and a system of shapes is an essential concept that can elevate a design by making it more cohesive, balanced, and visually interesting. When applied effectively, this concept can contribute to enhanced communication, memorability, and aesthetic appeal in various design disciplines."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. White House Increases Overtime Eligibility by Millions Opponents argued that the measure could cost billions of dollars and would undermine the morale of salaried employees by requiring them to account for every hour of their workdays. “This is an extreme revision in the white-collar threshold,” said David French of the National Retail Federation. “By executive fiat, the Department of Labor is effectively demoting millions of workers.” Republican lawmakers, who are close to many of the industries that oppose the new rule, have vowed to block it during a mandated congressional review period. With Donald J. Trump as their presumptive presidential nominee, however, the issue is fraught with risk for Republicans. Any attempt to repeal the regulation could exacerbate an already palpable split between Mr. Trump’s blue-collar supporters and the party’s establishment donors and politicians. Paul Porter, a truck driver from Ava, Mo., who is a member of the Teamsters union and a supporter of Mr. Trump, said he already received time and a half after eight hours of work, but strongly favored the new overtime regulation. “I have friends who are managers who get taken advantage of terribly,” he said. The administration, for its part, expressed confidence it was holding the better political hand. “I welcome a debate in Congress about wages in this country,” Thomas E. Perez, the secretary of labor, said. “It crystallizes the difference between this president and the leadership in Congress.” Federal employment law provides two ways for most salaried workers to become eligible for overtime. The first is through a so-called duties test that essentially determines whether or not they are bona fide executives, administrators or professionals, which has historically meant spending most of their time exercising some decision-making authority. If not, they are supposed to be eligible for overtime pay. That method is open to interpretation. The second is more of a hard-and-fast standard, setting a salary level to determine eligibility for overtime, regardless of duties. So even for employees who are legitimately managers, if their salary is below the cutoff, they must be paid overtime. Certain categories of workers, like teachers, doctors and outside sales representatives, continue to be exempt from the regulation, though academics primarily engaged in research are not. The overtime rule dates back to the passage of the 1938 law that established a federal minimum wage. The cutoff has been raised several times over the years. In 2004, the Bush administration also made it easier to exempt workers above the cutoff under the duties test. Proponents like Mr. Eisenbrey urged the administration to raise the cutoff to about 51,000, which, in inflation-adjusted dollars, is roughly where it stood in 1975, when the Ford administration undertook the last major expansion of overtime eligibility. In addition to increasing the basic ceiling, which will be set to match the pay of full-time salaried workers earning at the 40th percentile of salaries in the country’s lowest-income region, currently the South, the new regulation will be updated every three years to keep pace with changes in pay. The Labor Department calculates that 4.2 million workers will become newly eligible for overtime. Other estimates put the number of newly eligible workers substantially higher. In addition, according to the department, nearly nine million more workers who should already be eligible for overtime under the current duties test will be protected against being denied overtime illegally. The most heated debate concerns the fate of those workers who are relatively far from the new cutoff. Critics argue that employers will simply lower the base wage for a majority of affected workers who work overtime, so that their overall pay, including overtime pay, will remain the same. A projection by the consulting firm Oxford Economics, prepared for the National Retail Federation, predicted that a “disproportionate number of workers” who became eligible for overtime and worked more than 40 hours would “see their hourly rates decreased by an equal amount, leaving their total annual earnings unchanged.” By contrast, Daniel Hamermesh, a labor economist at the Institute for the Study of Labor, predicted that base wages would fall somewhat over time, but that the higher overtime payments would more than offset any loss in regular salary levels. The regulation, which President Obama directed the Labor Department to work on in 2014 and which the department first proposed last July, provoked a deluge of comments from the public — nearly 300,000 in all. Many opponents argued that the new salary level would unfairly affect lower-wage regions of the country. The department decreased its proposed cutoff of 50,440 in response. It also changed its proposed annual indexing to once every three years, and decided against revisiting the 2004 changes to the duties test. Groups representing colleges and universities, local governments, and smaller nonprofits also expressed concerns about the cost of the new regulation. Elward Edd, an official at the Hopi Tribal Housing Authority in Arizona, which has a backlog of more than 500 homes to repair, said the burden of the new regulation would force him to scale back hiring to one construction crew from two. Mr. Edd said he was not certain the new regulation would apply to his tribe, but planned to follow it until obtaining clarity. Labor Department officials said it would not. Many critics argued that the need to closely monitor hours would impinge on workers’ freedom by preventing them from working as long as they like, and could damage an employee’s status and sense of self-worth. But at least some of the likely beneficiaries of the new overtime rule took issue with the prediction of looming morale problems. “That is so out of touch,” said Erin Clark, a postdoctoral fellow at Brandeis University who spends about 60 hours a week doing research on neurons and makes 46,344 after having earned a Ph.D. from Harvard. When the regulation goes into effect, Dr. Clark added, “it will at least feel like you’re out there in the job market with everyone else, on some sort of playing field, as opposed to this weird vestigial training position.” Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.

Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the White House's decision to increase overtime eligibility for millions of workers in the United States. The Obama administration introduced a new rule that raises the salary threshold under which workers qualify for overtime pay from 23,660 to 47,476 annually. This move is expected to benefit around 4.2 million workers who were previously not eligible for overtime. Opponents of the measure argue that it could cost billions of dollars and negatively impact the morale of salaried employees by requiring them to account for every hour of their workdays. David French, from the National Retail Federation, states that the Department of Labor is effectively demoting millions of workers through this action. Republican lawmakers, many of whom have close ties to the industries opposing the new rule, have vowed to block it during the mandated congressional review period. The issue presents potential risks for the Republicans, as any attempt to repeal the regulation could worsen the ongoing split between Donald Trump's blue-collar supporters and the party’s establishment donors and politicians.

The regulation will also be updated every three years to reflect changes in pay. Proponents of the new rule believe it will protect workers who should already be eligible for overtime. However, critics argue that employers may lower base wages for affected workers who work overtime, resulting in no change in their overall pay.

The +Audition was cancelled.; +Movie was cancelled.;","completion":"The planned audition for the new movie did not take place. The audition was cancelled due to a myriad of contributing factors that ultimately led to the decision to suspend the production of the movie temporarily. Subsequently, this also meant that the original movie was cancelled, ushering in a period of uncertainty and disappointment for all those involved in the project. The primary reason for the cancellation of the audition was budgetary constraints. The production company faced financial challenges that prevented them from proceeding with the initial plans for the movie. Inadequate funding often puts a strain on the entire production process, right from pre-production, which involves conceptualizing, writing, and eventual casting. Consequently, the producers were left with little choice but to put a halt to the auditions. Moreover, the cancellation of the movie was brought on by a combination of issues involving the script and disagreements among the creative team. Revisions to the script were abundant and persistent, making it difficult to move forward with the casting process. The writers and director had differing visions for the narrative and character development, causing delays and tensions within the production team. Sadly, these unresolved disagreements led to the decision to cancel the project. Casting, which plays a crucial role in shaping the overall film, was another factor that contributed to the cancellation of the movie. It had been proving difficult to find suitable actors who could bring the desired depth and nuanced performances required for the various roles. The lack of progress in casting ultimately rendered the audition process redundant since the pool of talent was insufficient to populate the major roles. Competition within the film industry also contributed to the decision to cancel the movie. With several other productions in the pipeline targeting the same demographic or exploring similar themes, the production company grew increasingly wary of entering a saturated market. As a result, the producers began to reassess the viability of the project and eventually made the difficult decision to cancel the movie, consequently cancelling the auditions as well. Lastly, external circumstances such as the global COVID-19 pandemic have significantly impacted many industries, including film production. Adhering to safety mandates and ensuring the health and welfare of cast and crew members has led to many movie projects being postponed or cancelled altogether. In the case of this particular project, such unforeseen global events added to the aforementioned challenges and ultimately contributed to the cancellation of the movie and its associated audition. In conclusion, the planned audition for the new movie did not take place due to several factors that led to not only the cancellation of the audition but also the movie itself. Financial difficulties, creative disagreements, casting challenges, market competition, and unforeseen global events cumulatively forced the difficult decision to halt the production and disappoint the involved parties. The film industry is complex and ever-changing, and these setbacks serve to remind all those who work in it to persevere and adapt in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They allege that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon in the aftermath of the blaze. Bernard Dempsey Jr., an attorney with Western Michigan Legal Services, the group that represents the tenants, said Alamo Hills gave the displaced families very limited opportunity to remove belongings. \\"They were given three days to get their stuff out, and if they couldn't get moved out in three days, their stuff was discarded,\\" Dempsey said. \\"Alamo Hills just threw it out.\\" Others, he said, lost possessions to looters after the March 23 blaze, which left 78 people temporarily homeless. According to the lawsuit, the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security. A spokesperson for PM One, the company that manages Alamo Hills, could not be reached for comment. Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court, which handles civil claims of less than 25,000. \\"We're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- 3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket expenses for their lost stuff,\\" Dempsey said. \\"They're not looking to get rich off this.

The girls accept the bet and that's when the troubles begin. As they race down a back road, the guys are pulled over by a local sheriff. The sheriff arrests them under suspicion of theft. Meanwhile, on another back road, the girls burn out their radiator. Finally, a man by the name of Kurt Martin appears walking down the road. He tells them that he was on his way to Las Vegas. He fixes the fan belt by using Lisa's expensive belt and replenishes the radiator with the girls drinking water. In return, he asks to be driven to Las Vegas. The girls get to Las Vegas first. Meanwhile, the boys get booked, photographed and thrown into a jail cell with a yuppy murderer, named Herb, and a biker/poet, named Ray. Finally the sheriff decides that the guys aren't suspects when he learns that the stolen Bronco was found and the real culprits were arrested in San Diego. But the Sheriff extorts 1,200 from Zack to let them out of the jail. In Las Vegas, the girls admire the 4 million Considine Diamond on display in the Stardust lobby.

Getty Trump on Fiorina's face: I made those comments as an entertainer Donald Trump didn’t mean any harm when he criticized fellow GOP 2016 presidential candidate Carly Fiorina’s face. He says he was just being the showman he is. “Many of those comments are made as an entertainer because I did The Apprentice and it was one of the top shows on television,” he told Greta Van Susteren on Thursday night. “Some comments are made as an entertainer and as everybody said, as an entertainer is a much different ball game.” Story Continued Below Trump who is leading in Republican polls has said comments that would have buried many other candidates. A Rolling Stone story Wednesday illustrates a scene where Trump watches Fiorina come onto the TV screen. “’Look at that face!' he cries. 'Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!' The laughter grows halting and faint behind him. 'I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not s'posed ta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?'” On Thursday night, he reiterated what he told CNN earlier — that the face comments were actually about her persona. “We’re really talking about not a physical thing, we’re talking about the persona. This is a women that gets tremendous publicity,” he said. “I don’t know why…her past doesn’t go along with the publicity she’s getting.” But it didn’t take long before he was back on his favorite punching bag: Jeb Bush. “When somebody knocks me like Jeb Bush or anybody else, I at least decide that I think it’s appropriate to fight back.” Van Susteren pointed out this wasn’t his first time saying controversial comments about women. Trump responded that he was leading with women, and many other groups. “I’d like to say that nobody understands and nobody wants to do more for women,” Trump said, a favorite line of his. “My wife was talking to me and she said you cherish women you really have to talk about it a little bit more.” Trump also addressed his spat with Dr. Ben Carson. Earlier Thursday he said Carson, who is the first person to successfully separate twins conjoined at the back of the head, was an “OK doctor.” Trump backtracked a bit, saying he’s sure some people will disagree with his views. “I’m sure he’s a good doctor, I think that he’s overrated as a doctor,” Trump said.

Trump responded later in the day, remarking that Jindal \\"did not make the debate stage and therefore I have never met him.\\" \\"I only respond to people that register more than 1 percent in the polls.

Having lots of enjoyable sex may put them at a greater risk for heart complications. The study, published in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior, looked at 2,204 people between the ages 57 to 85. The people were interviewed again five years later, in an effort to understand how sex impacts people’s health later in life. The report authors found that men who reported having at least weekly sex were more likely to report experiencing heart problems when they were interviewed again a few years later compared to men who were not sexually active. “Older men who found sex with their partner extremely pleasurable or satisfying had higher risk of cardiovascular events than men who did not feel so,” said study author Hui Liu, an associate professor of sociology at Michigan State University in a statement. Women, however, did not experience any increase in heart health problems with more sexual activity. In fact, women who reported feeling highly satisfied with their sex life had a lower risk of high blood pressure years later compared to women who didn’t hold the same level of satisfaction. Before older men give up on a healthy sexual relationship, it’s important to point out that the study only found a link between heart problems and sex, and it’s not definitive. More studies are needed to gain a clearer understanding of the benefits and risks of sex later in life, and whether the amount of sexual activity matters as people age. Liu recommends men have conversations with their physicians about their health and sexuality. Why might men have a higher risk for heart issues? While sex is shown to have health benefits, including better heart health, overdoing it late in life could be problematic, the study authors suggest. Overall, older men tend to have more sexual complications compared to younger men, and Liu argues that the exertion to reach orgasm could be causing heart stress. It’s also possible that medications men take to improve their sexual performance, like testosterone therapy, could be playing a role. However the researchers did not look at this connection in the study. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of the text include the following: 1. A new study published in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior suggests that older men who engage in frequent, satisfying sex might be at a greater risk for heart complications. 2. The study involved 2,204 people aged 57 to 85 and investigated the impact of sex on people's health later in life. 3.

Conversations with physicians about health and sexuality are recommended for older men. 7.

It's an excellent way to help our moms and dads around the house. In this article, we will learn three simple steps to care for your bed. Let's make our beds the comfiest and coziest place to rest! 1. Flip or Rotate the Mattress First, ask your mom or dad for help with this step. A mattress is the soft, squishy part of the bed that we sleep on. We need to flip (turn it over) or rotate (spin it around) the mattress to make it stay nice and comfy! Imagine you have a yummy sandwich. After eating half of it, you might flip it over to have a taste of the other side. That's just like flipping a mattress! It helps to wear out both sides evenly and makes for a comfy night's sleep. And if you just spin it around like a fun game, that's rotating! This is helpful because sometimes we sleep in one spot for many nights, and rotating it helps the mattress wear out evenly too. 2. Apply a Mattress Protector Next, we need a superhero to protect our mattress! Just kidding, we don't need a superhero. We need a mattress protector – a special cover that goes on top of the mattress. It's easy-peasy to put it on – just ask your mom or dad for help. A mattress protector is very important because it keeps our mattress clean from dirt, spills, and dust. Think about it like a shield that keeps our mattress safe and cozy. Putting on a mattress protector helps us sleep better and makes our mattress last longer too. 3. Make the Bed Now that our mattress is flipped and protected, it's time to make the bed! Gather your bed sheets, pillows, and comforter. Start by laying the bedsheet over the mattress. Pretend you're tucking in your teddy bear for bedtime – make sure it's snug and not crinkly. Next, let's fluff those pillows! Give the pillows some fun little shakes and pats, so they become extra-plump and soft. Then, place them nicely at the head of the bed. Lastly, let's cover the bed with your comforter. Spread it out like a big hug over the bed, and make sure it's smooth and covers the whole mattress. That's it! You've learned how to care for your bed in three easy steps: flipping or rotating the mattress, applying a mattress protector, and making the bed. Practice these steps with mom and dad, and soon, you'll be the best little helper in the house! Sweet dreams, kiddo!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Whatever the case, the Sun reports the fashion house is selling a mock white paper shopping bag for £876, which works out to roughly 1,110, and it's so popular it's sold out on Colette. It looks just like the free paper bags Balenciaga gives patrons their purchases in, only this one is made from calfskin and costs just a touch more.

If you've got 1,110 burning a hole in your pocket and you want to walk around town looking perpetually like you've just shopped at Balenciaga, this bag's for you. (Some people are getting heel surgery to fit into designer shoes.)","completion":"Title: Balenciaga's Mock Paper Shopping Bag: A Statement on Brand Loyalty or Just Another Fashion Troll? Introduction: French designer, Balenciaga, has always been at the forefront of high fashion and luxury goods. However, their recent release of the mock white paper shopping bag for a staggering £876 (around 1,110) has raised questions on whether the brand is making a social statement or just poking fun at its customers. The Mock Paper Shopping Bag: Initially spotted on the popular French retailer's website, Colette, this Balenciaga bag is currently sold out. At first glance, the bag looks strikingly similar to the free paper bags given to customers at Balenciaga shopping outlets. The major difference lies in the materials used - the mock paper bag is made from calfskin. Additionally, the bag also features numerous pockets and zippers, unlike the original free paper bag. A Trend of Trolling Fashion: Balenciaga's penchant for quirky designs and sharp wit is seen in their past releases, like the 2,145 IKEA-inspired blue shopping bag. Time magazine calls this design fad Balenciaga's \\"latest effort to troll the fashion world.\\" Is this a statement on brand loyalty? The mock paper shopping bag could be seen as an exploration of brand loyalty. Its popularity shows that the power of a brand name like Balenciaga still remains strong, whether it's a luxurious item or simply a replica of a disposable paper bag. Or, are they mocking their wealthy clients? While tapping into brand loyalty, it is also possible that Balenciaga is making fun of its wealthy clients by selling a high-priced version of a free shopping bag. The decision to charge such a hefty price for a bag that seemingly comes with Balenciaga's approval may leave some wondering if it's a tongue-in-cheek response. Conclusion: Balenciaga's mock paper shopping bag provokes a range of questions regarding its intent, but the extreme popularity and quick sell-out of the product indicate that the designer's target audience seems to be embracing the irony. Whether this is a statement on the fashion world's obsession with brands or an elaborate joke by the designer, seeking to make a statement through innovative design, Balenciaga has certainly captured the attention and wallets of fashion enthusiasts."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I can use this background: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Depending upon your situation, the tightness of your pants may be making your erection worse. Try discreetly loosening your pants. Sit down behind a table or desk and unbuckle your belt. If needed, unbutton and partially unzip your pants to give your erection more \\"breathing room\\" with less pressure. Be conscious of where you are. Don't be obvious. You don't want to be mistaken for some sort of pervert. If you have a bit of privacy, applying a cold pack to your crotch (outside your clothing) can soothe discomfort and encourage your erection to dissipate as well. If you've ever been in a cold swimming pool or outside on a cold day in shorts, you know that the penis and testes tend to retract towards the warmth of your body. While taking a cold shower is often considered the way to \\"cool off\\" raging sexual desires, a warm bath can actually provide a soothing, comfortable environment that may bring your erection to a faster conclusion. Light exercise, like walking on a treadmill or simple aerobics, can also help provide distraction and a shift in blood distribution. These alternatives are often used as initial efforts to end a possible case of priapism, in which the pooled blood becomes trapped in the shaft of the penis. If you have an erection that lasts for more than four hours for any reason, seek medical attention immediately. If not treated quickly, priapism can lead to permanent damage, including but not limited to erectile dysfunction. This may not be easy to do with an erection, but urinating can sometimes make an erection go away. Urination causes pleasant, relaxing feelings in your groin, which can make an erection feel less \\"tight\\" or \\"urgent.\\" Waking up in the morning with an erection is common for men of all ages. It can occur with or without the prompting of sexually-arousing dreams. Despite the degree of difficulty in hitting your target while you have an erection, urinating can often help bring it to a conclusion quickly. When it comes down to it, the most effective way to end an erection is to bring it to its natural conclusion. Barring a medical condition, ejaculation almost invariably causes an erection to end. Discreetly excuse yourself from the situation and find a private area: a bathroom, a bedroom, or anywhere else you feel sure that you won't disturb anyone. Do your business, clean up, and return to the situation relieved and ready to go. Avoid masturbating in public. If you do find yourself in a public place with an erection, find somewhere relatively private to do your thing. A lockable bathroom stall will do in a pinch, as long as you aren't loud or obvious about what you're doing. Public masturbation is illegal in many places, and you might disturb people if you aren't careful.","completion":"Tight pants can make an erection worse, so loosening them, finding privacy, and trying different methods like cold packs, exercise, or urination can help make the erection go away."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

Warner Bros. Records Inc. is an American major record label established in 1958 as the foundation label of the present-day Warner Music Group (WMG), and now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of that corporation. Warner Bros. Records was established on March 19, 1958, as the recorded-music division of the American film studio Warner Bros.. For most of its early existence it was one of a group of labels owned and operated by larger parent corporations. The sequence of companies that controlled Warner Bros. and its allied labels evolved through a convoluted series of corporate mergers and acquisitions from the early 1960s to the early 2000s. Over this period, Warner Bros. Records grew from a struggling minor player in the music industry to become one of the top recording labels in the world. In 2003, these music assets were divested by their then owner Time Warner and purchased by a private equity group. This independent company traded as the Warner Music Group before being bought by Access Industries in 2011. WMG is the smallest of the three major international music conglomerates and the world's last publicly traded major music company. Cameron Strang serves as CEO of the company. Artists currently signed to Warner Bros. Records include Sleeping with Sirens, Cher, Kylie Minogue, Kimbra, the Goo Goo Dolls, Sheryl Crow, Ciara, Gorillaz, Adam Lambert, Bette Midler, Blur, Duran Duran, Fleet Foxes, Jason Derulo, Kid Rock, Lily Allen, Linkin Park, Muse, Nile Rodgers, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the Black Keys, My Chemical Romance and Regina Spektor. 1. when were the music assets sold? 2. who was the parent company?

The report stated that there was a brush fire in the southwest part of Texas, where it was currently daytime. When he switched the channel, he saw another report about a different wildfire. This one was a forest fire in the northwest part of Seattle, where it was currently nighttime. Which area, Texas or Seattle, will have higher wind speeds at the time of the fire? Hint: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. A:","completion":"Based on the provided hint, Texas is likely to have higher wind speeds at the time of the fire compared to Seattle. This is due to the fact that it is currently daytime in Texas, which typically leads to higher temperatures, lower humidity, and increased wind speeds.

Factors contributing to habitat loss include: overconsumption, overpopulation, land use change, deforestation, pollution (air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination) and global warming or climate change.Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area. Conversion to \\"trivial\\" standardized ecosystems (e.g., monoculture following deforestation) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion. Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity – through clearing/draining land, discouraging weeds and \\"pests\\", and encouraging just a limited set of domesticated plant and animal species. In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).A 2007 study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and vice versa. \\"If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species.\\" Two continents had different histories. Asia was inhabited by many humans which destroyed most natural habitats through their activities. America was protective towards its environment and therefore thrived. Which continent destroyed habitats by overconsumption? A:","completion":"Asia is the continent that destroyed habitats by overconsumption. As mentioned in the question, Asia had a history of being inhabited by a large human population, which contributed to greater habitat destruction through their activities. The reasons for this overconsumption-driven habitat destruction include growing populations, increasing demands for resources, and rapid economic development. As a result, many natural habitats in Asia have been altered or destroyed to accommodate human needs and desires. Overconsumption can lead to various forms of environmental degradation, including deforestation, land conversion for agriculture or urbanization, pollution, and climate change. In Asia, the high demand for resources such as timber, agricultural products, and raw materials led to widespread deforestation, resulting in significant losses in tropical forests and biodiversity. These actions often disrupt ecosystems, leading to the endangerment or extinction of numerous species that rely on these habitats. Land use change in Asia is another critical factor contributing to habitat loss. As the human population grew, there was a continuous need to convert land for agriculture, industry, and urbanization purposes, which encroached upon and degraded natural ecosystems. This land use change, along with pollution and infrastructure development, further exacerbates habitat destruction and reduces the capacity of ecosystems to recover and maintain their resilience. In contrast, the Americas have historically had more stringent environmental protection policies that emphasized the need to conserve and protect natural habitats. Although the continent has not been immune to habitat destruction caused by human activities, the overall loss and degradation of ecosystems have been relatively lower compared to Asia. However, it is important to acknowledge that the Americas, too, face increasing environmental challenges due to development, climate change, and unsustainable resource consumption. In conclusion, it is Asia where overconsumption has led to more significant habitat destruction, driven by its large human population and increasing demands for resources. This has had severe consequences for biodiversity and ecosystems on the continent. It is essential for global efforts to focus on developing sustainable solutions that can help mitigate habitat loss, conserve biodiversity, and promote responsible resource consumption in both Asia and other regions around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation. Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body. It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients. First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday. Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood. Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. The answer is:","completion":"Which of the following statements is true about blood donation according to the article? A.

Objective: How to inflate a car tire. Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Options are: A). Remove valve stem cap, attach air nozzle, turn on and inflate, don't replace cap.. B). Remove valve stem cap, attach air nozzle, turn on and inflate, replace cap..","completion":"B). Remove valve stem cap, attach air nozzle, turn on and inflate, replace cap. This solution is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because it covers all the necessary steps in a logical order to properly inflate a car tire, ensuring safety and correct tire pressure. Let's analyze the steps in detail: 1. Remove valve stem cap: The valve stem cap is an essential component that keeps dirt and moisture away from the valve stem. Removing the cap allows you to access the valve itself, where you will need to attach the air nozzle in order to inflate the tire. 2. Attach air nozzle: Connecting the air nozzle to the valve stem is a crucial step as it is through this connection that the air will flow into the tire. The connection should be secure and tight to avoid any air leakage. There are different types of air nozzles available, and most tire inflators use the Schrader valve, which is standard for car tires. 3. Turn on and inflate: Once the air nozzle is securely connected, turning on the inflation mechanism allows the air to flow into the tire. You should always check the recommended tire pressure for your car, which can usually be found on a placard inside the driver's door, in the owner's manual, or on the tire sidewall. It's essential to keep a close eye on the tire pressure gauge (found on the air pump or a separate handheld gauge) while inflating to ensure that you don't overinflate or underinflate the tire. 4. Replace cap: After reaching the desired tire pressure and disconnecting the air nozzle, it's essential to replace the valve stem cap. The cap essentially functions as a secondary seal, helping to minimize air leakage from the valve stem and protect the valve from elements like dirt, moisture, and debris. A missing or damaged cap can lead to a slow air leak, causing your tire to lose pressure over time. This could affect your fuel efficiency, handling, and overall safety of the car. By following these steps in solution B, you can safely and efficiently inflate your car tire to the recommended pressure, ensuring optimal performance and safety on the road. Replacing the valve stem cap is a crucial aspect of inflating car tires, making option B the more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is the most abundant and widespread lead ore mineral and has been mined for its lead content for thousands of years. Galena is a lead sulfide mineral (PbS) that commonly occurs in hydrothermal veins, contact metamorphic environments, and in association with various other sulfide minerals. Galena's chemical composition is mainly composed of lead (86.6%) and sulfur (13.4%). Due to its high density, it is often found in large deposits and is easily recognizable by its metallic luster, cuboctahedral crystal structure, and its grey or silver color. Galena is a very dense and brittle mineral, which can be easily cleaved along three perfect cleavage planes, producing cubes or other shapes. The extraction and processing of lead from galena ore involve a combination of several steps. The process typically begins with the mining of the ore, which is followed by crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the mineral particles. After that, the ground ore is subjected to a froth flotation process to separate the lead sulfide from other associated minerals, such as zinc, iron, and copper sulfides. In the froth flotation process, the crushed and ground ore is mixed with water and various chemicals to create a slurry. Air is then introduced into the slurry, forming bubbles that rise to the surface carrying the hydrophobic lead sulfide particles. The froth on the surface, rich in lead sulfide, is collected and separated from the remaining gangue (unwanted minerals) in the slurry. This froth concentrate undergoes further purification and refining processes to extract the lead metal. After the froth flotation, the lead sulfide concentrate is roasted in a furnace, converting the lead sulfide to lead oxide (PbO). This step also helps remove any remaining sulfur as sulfur dioxide (SO2), which can be later used in the production of sulfuric acid. The lead oxide is then reduced to metallic lead (Pb) through a process known as smelting. This involves mixing the lead oxide with other materials, such as limestone or silica, and heating it above 1,000 °C in an oxygen-rich environment. Metallic lead separates from the mixture during this process and sinks to the bottom of the furnace, from where it can be collected and further refined. One of the final steps in lead production is refining, which involves removing any remaining impurities or non-lead components from the extracted lead. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as electrolysis, pyrometallurgical, and hydrometallurgical processes, depending on the specific composition of the initial lead metal. The pure lead is then cast into ingots or other forms and used for various industrial and manufacturing applications. Despite its widespread use, lead is highly toxic to humans, animals, and the environment. Prolonged exposure to lead can result in a variety of health issues, including neurological disorders, developmental issues in children, and other systemic problems. As a result, there have been increased efforts in recent years to minimize lead exposure and find alternative materials for various applications. Some countries have implemented strict regulations on the use of lead, including bans on lead-based paints and reduction of lead in gasoline."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

My guy had the prix fixe and the rest of us had a la carte. The service was perfect, and the presentation and ambience was lovely. We were all kindly given caviar (with dab of onions and cream fraiche on toast), which was supposed to be just for my guy with his meal. It was wonderful, and I'm not usually a caviar fan. Also the quality of the drinks was wonderful. We all ordered rasperry lemon drops, and they were the best I've ever had. The only reason I don't give five stars is that the menu was a bit limited and a bit too meat oriented.

Here is a premise: The east side of the square is dominated by the beautiful Beyazet Camii, built in the early 16th century by Sultan Beyazet II, son of Mehmet the Conqueror. Here is a hypothesis: The Beyazet Camii on the east side of the square dates back to the 16th century. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. This conclusion is based on the information provided in the premise and can be explained in detail as follows. The premise states two main points about the Beyazet Camii: 1. It is located on the east side of the square. 2. It was built in the early 16th century by Sultan Beyazet II, son of Mehmet the Conqueror. Now, let's analyze the hypothesis: The hypothesis states that the Beyazet Camii on the east side of the square dates back to the 16th century. Comparing the premise and the hypothesis, it becomes apparent that both statements convey similar information. The hypothesis simply condenses the information found in the premise without altering or contradicting anything. More specifically, the premise tells us that the Beyazet Camii is on the east side of the square, and the hypothesis reaffirms this by mentioning \\"the east side of the square.\\" Additionally, the premise states that the mosque was built in the early 16th century, and the hypothesis corresponds to this by asserting that it \\"dates back to the 16th century.\\" While the hypothesis doesn't mention the builder of the mosque or his relation to Mehmet the Conqueror, it does not deny or contradict this information either. In summary, the hypothesis is aligned with the premise in terms of both location and time of construction. Thus, if the premise is true, it logically follows that the hypothesis is true as well. Consequently, we can conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

My daughter was away at college preparing for her final exams and nursing boards. I knew that my daughter’s cat, who has been part of our family since my daughter was in second grade, was dying of a fast growing cancer. I couldn’t tell my daughter because I didn’t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred.

The increased bombing is the latest evidence the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan is significantly intensifying since U.S. President Donald Trump announced his new military strategy for the country in August. Coalition planes dropped 1,186 weapons on Afghanistan during the first three months of 2018, according to figures released by U.S. Air Forces Central Command. The previous record (1,083) was set during the height of the war in 2011. The U.S. has not released 2001 to 2003 airstrike data. Those figures do not include activity by the Afghan Air Force (AAF), which has stepped up its aerial bombardment since gaining the ability to conduct airstrikes two years ago. The AAF carries out between 4 to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense. If recent trends are any indication, 2018 is likely to get even more violent. Fighting traditionally picks up during the warmer months, and the coalition has expanded its bombing campaign against the Islamic State group, as well as narcotic labs and other Taliban revenue sources. But there is little indication the expanded airstrikes are helping end the conflict, says Thomas Johnson, an Afghanistan specialist who teaches national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. \\"It's basically a tactic of desperation,\\" said Johnson, author of Taliban Narratives: The Use of Power and Stories in the Afghanistan Conflict. \\"There's never been an insurgency in history that's been defeated purely through air power.\\" Even high-level U.S. military officials concede the conflict remains a stalemate.

Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Enters the lungs - The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs - Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled - The oxygen is pass throughout your body. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step of the process you mentioned pertains to the inhalation of oxygen. The whole sequence forms part of the respiratory process, which can be broken down into the following steps: 1. **Inhalation of Air**: The missing first step is the act of breathing in, or inhaling, which occurs when we take air into our lungs. This is enabled by the muscles of respiration - especially the diaphragm and intercostals (muscles between the ribs) contracting to increase the volume of the thoracic (chest) cavity. As the volume increases, the pressure within the thoracic cavity decreases, creating a pressure gradient between the atmosphere and the lungs. This pressure difference allows air to rush in, bringing with it vital oxygen. 2. **Air Enters the Lungs**: As you breathe in, air travels through your nose or mouth, down the pharynx, passes the epiglottis, and enters the trachea. The trachea splits into two bronchi, further split into bronchioles, finally reaches the air sacs or alveoli in the lungs, which is the site of gas exchange. 3. **Oxygen fills the Sacs in your Lungs**: Once the air reaches the alveoli, the oxygen it carries dissociates from the hemoglobin molecule and passes across the alveolar and capillary walls into the blood. 4. **Carbon Dioxide is Removed from the Lungs and Exhaled**: Meanwhile, carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular metabolism, travels from the blood across the capillary and alveolar walls into the lungs. This gas is removed from the body when we exhale. 5. **The Oxygen is Passed Throughout Your Body**: The oxygen-rich blood is then transported throughout the body by the circulatory system. As the blood reaches cells, oxygen dissociates from the hemoglobin and moves into the cells where it is used in metabolic reactions that produce energy essential for cellular processes. Therefore, the process you are referring to is one of the most important biological functions in humans, illustrating how our body obtains oxygen from the atmosphere and utilizes it at the cellular level while also removing waste products. The missing step, inhalation of air, is a vital initial step, beginning the journey of oxygen into the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here's the problem: -617 * f - 11,739 = 436 * f + 94 * f - 101,205 First, let's simplify the right side of the equation. We have 436 * f and 94 * f, so let's add those together: (436 + 94) * f = 530 * f Now our problem looks like this: -617 * f - 11,739 = 530 * f - 101,205 Next, we need to get all the \\"f\\" terms on one side and the numbers on the other side. So, let's add 617 * f to both sides: -11,739 = 530 * f + 617 * f - 101,205 Now combine the \\"f\\" terms on the right side: -11,739 = 1,147 * f - 101,205 Our next step is to get rid of that -101,205 on the right side. Let's add 101,205 to both sides: -11,739 + 101,205 = 1,147 * f Now, we find the result: 89,466 = 1,147 * f Almost there, buddy! Now, we just need to find out what f is equal to. To do that, we'll divide both sides by 1,147: f = 89,466 / 1,147 Finally, we get the value of f: f = 78 So, the solution to the problem is f = 78!

The sport offers various categories to cater to all levels of riders, including wave, freestyle, slalom, speed, and course racing. In this article, we will delve into the soaring world of kiteboarding, its categories, and its impact as an Olympic sport. Kiteboarding: A Brief Overview: Kiteboarding, also known as kitesurfing, is an exhilarating water sport that involves the user riding on a modified surfboard or kiteboard while being pulled by a large, controllable kite. The sport cultivates a perfect unison between the wind and water, allowing riders to showcase their skills and execute jaw-dropping aerial maneuvers. Due to its increasing popularity, the sport has also fostered a strong sense of community among its practitioners. Kiteboarding Categories: The diverse world of kiteboarding comprises five distinct categories, providing riders with multiple avenues to sharpen their skills and test their limits: 1. Wave: Wave kiteboarding has the rider using a surfboard or a specialized kiteboard to ride and maneuver on waves. This discipline demands excellent kite control, as well as the ability to read and predict wave patterns. 2. Freestyle: This category is arguably the most popular among kiteboarders. Freestyle kiteboarding showcases the rider's ability to perform impressive aerial tricks and stunts, such as handle passes, rotations, and inverted loops. 3. Slalom: In slalom kiteboarding, riders race through a course consisting of a series of buoys laid out in the water. The objective is to navigate the course as quickly as possible while demonstrating precise kite control and technical prowess. 4. Speed: The speed category highlights the swiftest and most agile riders in the kiteboarding community. Riders engage in time trials, attempting to achieve the fastest speeds possible over a set distance. 5. Course Racing: Course racing embodies a blend of speed and strategy, in which riders must complete a predefined course with multiple laps and buoy turns. Maintaining a balance between speed, kite control, and tactical decision-making is crucial in this category. Kiteboarding as an Olympic Sport: The decision to include kiteboarding in the 2016 Olympic lineup in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil signified a milestone moment in the evolution of the sport. As kiteboarding makes its Olympic debut, it brings a fresh, youthful dynamic to the games; simultaneously, it paves the way for further growth and development in the sport. The inclusion of kiteboarding in the Olympics is expected to attract new learners in droves, exponentially expanding its global following every year. Conclusion: Kiteboarding has carved a niche for itself among adrenaline junkies and water sports enthusiasts across the world. As it prepares to take center stage at the 2016 Rio Olympic games, the sport continues to traverse new heights and break boundaries. Catering to all levels of skill and interest through its five distinct categories, kiteboarding is truly a versatile and engaging sport that is steadily securing its place in the Olympic pantheon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His main focus is to reconcile with his estranged wife, Nikki (Brea Bee). She has moved away and obtained a restraining order against him after Pat had found her in the shower with another man and nearly beat him to death. His therapist, Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher), does his best to convince him to keep taking his medication, as a repeat of his violent outbursts might send him back to the clinic. But Pat tells him that he has a new outlook on life: he attempts to see the good, or silver linings, in all that he experiences. At dinner with his friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) and his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles), Pat meets Veronica's sister Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow with depression and relationship problems. Sparks fly between Pat and Tiffany and she tries to connect by offering casual sex, but Pat keeps focusing on getting Nikki back. Tiffany tries to get closer to Pat and even offers to deliver a letter to Nikkiâif, in return, he will practice dancing with her (which she does as a therapy) and to partner with her in an upcoming dance competition. He reluctantly agrees and the two begin a rigorous practice regimen over the following weeks. Pat believes the competition will be a good way to show Nikki that he has changed and become a better person. Patrizio hopes to open his own restaurant and has resorted to illegal bookmaking. Having put virtually all of his money on the outcome of a Philadelphia Eagles game, he asks Pat to attend as a \\"good-luck charm\\". Pat asks Tiffany for time off from practice to attend the game.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the language and tone consistently used throughout the review, it's clear that the customer is dissatisfied with the product. In their title, they use emotionally charged language such as \\"Worst video ever!\\". This already indicates a strong negative feeling toward the product. Such a label characterizes a deep level of dissatisfaction. Moving on to the body of their review, they are highly critical of the content of the video, saying \\"This is by far the worst video the WWF has ever produced.\\" They've compared the product negatively to other videos produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), implying they have a basis for their judgment and they see this one as the absolute worst. They further mention that the video has nothing to do with wrestling. Given that the WWF is a wrestling federation, this would suggest that the product did not meet the customer's expectations in terms of the content. They validate their statement by saying that watching the video is like having their teeth pulled, which is a common expression that suggests an experience was extremely unpleasant or painful. The customer's dissatisfaction extends to the point of recommending the video only as a sleep aid for insomniacs, a sardonic remark suggesting that the video is boring and uninteresting, unable to hold an audience's attention. This in itself indicates that not only did the product fail on a content level according to this customer, but also on something as fundamental as being engaging to its viewers. Thus, taking into account all these factors, it's evident that the customer was highly dissatisfied with the video produced by the WWF. Their review is filled with strong negative language, criticism of the product’s content, and sarcastic remarks about its entertainment value, all of which conclusively suggest dissatisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: In year 2200, David is an astronaut and an avid galaxy hopper from a planet hundred light years away. He ended up in the solar system in search of water. He identified three planets, planet A, planet B and planet C. Little did he know that less than a hundred years ago people used to call planet A as Earth, planet B as Venus, and planet C as Mercury. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which planet would have lower pressure on the surface, planet A or planet B? Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, planet A, which used to be called Earth, would have lower pressure on its surface compared to planet B, which used to be known as Venus. The explanation for this lies in the composition and thickness of each planet's atmosphere. Planet A (Earth) has a relatively thinner atmosphere with clouds mainly composed of water vapor. The atmospheric pressure at Earth's surface is largely influenced by the weight of the air column above it. Earth's atmosphere consists of various gases, such as nitrogen, oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases, as well as water vapor. On the other hand, planet B (Venus) has an incredibly thick atmosphere, consisting of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and significant amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid. Due to the density and composition of its atmosphere, the pressure on the surface of Venus is 90 times greater than that on the surface of Earth. This heightened pressure is a direct result of the crushing weight of Venus's atmosphere. The thick atmosphere of Venus also causes a strong greenhouse effect, contributing to its extremely high surface temperatures of 465°C (860°F), which is even hotter than planet C (Mercury), despite being farther from the Sun. In summary, planet A (Earth) would have lower pressure on its surface compared to planet B (Venus) due to the significant differences in their atmospheric compositions and densities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the below context: The Norwegian Bratvaag expedition, studying the glaciers and seas of the Svalbard archipelago from the Norwegian sealing vessel Bratvaag of Ålesund, found the remains of the Andrée expedition on 5 August 1930. Kvitøya was usually inaccessible to the sealing or whaling ships of the time, as it is typically surrounded by a wide belt of thick polar ice and often hidden by thick ice fogs. However, summer in 1930 had been particularly warm, and the surrounding sea was practically free of ice. As Kvitøya was known to be a prime hunting ground for walrus and the fogs over the island on that day were comparatively thin, some of the crew of the Bratvaag took this rare opportunity to land on what they called the \\"inaccessible island\\".Two of the sealers in search of water, Olav Salen and Karl Tusvick, discovered Andrée's boat near a small stream, frozen under a mound of snow and full of equipment, including a boathook engraved with the words \\"Andrée's Polar Expedition, 1896\\". Presented with this hook, the Bratvaag's captain, Peder Eliassen, assigned the crew to search the site together with the expedition members. Among other finds, they uncovered a journal and two skeletons, identified as Andrée's and Strindberg's remains by monograms found on their clothing.The Bratvaag left the island to continue its scheduled hunting and observations, with the intent of coming back later to see if the ice had melted further and uncovered more artifacts. Further discoveries were made by the M/K Isbjørn of Tromsø, a sealing sloop chartered by news reporters to waylay the Bratvaag. Unsuccessful in this, the reporters and the Isbjørn crew made instead for Kvitøya, landing on the island on 5 September in fine weather and finding even less ice than the Bratvaag had. After photographing the area, they searched for and found Frænkel's body, and additional artifacts, including a tin box containing Strindberg's photographic film, his logbook, and maps.

One of the key aspects of your alien characters should be how they look. To make your aliens seem convincing and interesting, you should try to be as detailed about their physical characteristics as you can. Because you are writing fiction, you have the ability to create as many strange and interesting details about your alien characters as you like. Avoid using familiar images or descriptions of aliens and use your imagination. Think about how the aliens walk and move their bodies. You should also think about how their bodies are proportioned. They do not necessarily need to walk on two legs and have limbs like humans. They may have physical characteristics that have evolved due to their world or environment. For example, maybe your aliens have antennas on their heads because they can feel shifts in the wind in their world, allowing them to hunt for food more effectively. You should also think about whether there are different genders in the alien world and how the bodies of different genders appear. You do not have to be limited by male or female genders. Maybe the alien race has a third gender that is asexual or a combination of male and female genders. Avoid creating the alien characters in the shadow of humans and get creative with language, thinking beyond English or other languages found on Earth. You may decide to create an alien language that may then be translated with the help of a computerized device or an implant in the human brain. Your alien race may also communicate in other ways besides language or words. Maybe they use their antennas to send messages to each other or have the ability to communicate through telepathy. Perhaps they use a system of body movements to communicate. The humans in your story may also be key characters in the narrative, so you should create humans that are just as interesting as the aliens. Your main character may be a human with a special ability or a unique characteristic. Creating nuanced humans in your story will make it that much stronger. For example, maybe your main character is a human who has been gifted with the ability to read minds. This human is then able to access the conversations of the alien overlords, who have enslaved the human race. This ability could allow the human to save the humans from the aliens and become the hero of the story. Once you have sketched out your characters, you should identify the central conflict. Doing this will give the story an end goal and frame the narrative for the reader. It will also allow you to use your characters to build tension in the story. The central conflict may be between your alien characters or between an alien character and a human character. For example, maybe the central conflict of your story is that aliens have taken over the human world because their planet is no longer habitable. This alien invasion may then result in a human hero who tries to fight the aliens with a special ability and help from other humans in his community. Or, maybe the central conflict is that humans have enslaved aliens who have crash landed on their planet. The humans may then try to hide the aliens and experiment on them. This may then result in one alien who tries to oppose his human captors.","completion":"In creating convincing and interesting alien characters, focus on their unique physical characteristics, communication methods, and the central conflict with humans, while infusing creativity and stepping beyond familiar tropes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the answer to this question? when was the first national draft used in the united states?","completion":"The first national draft in the United States occurred during the Civil War under the administration of President Abraham Lincoln. More accurately known as conscription, this mandatory enlistment for military service was an effort to replenish and boost the strength of the Union Army, which faced significant losses throughout the conflict. The Civil War began on April 12, 1861, as tensions between the North and South over issues like slavery and states' rights reached a boiling point. By 1862, it was clear that the war wouldn't end quickly, and the Union needed more troops to replace those lost in battle or through desertion. In response, the United States Congress passed the Militia Act of 1862, which allowed for the enlistment of African-American soldiers and included a provision for states to draft men if enlistment quotas were not met by volunteering efforts. However, this wasn't yet a nationwide draft. The first nationwide draft, called the Enrollment Act, was enacted on March 3, 1863. Also referred to as the Civil War Military Draft Act, this legislation called for all able-bodied men between the ages of 20 and 45, including immigrants seeking U.S. citizenship, to be eligible for conscription. However, this draft was not without controversy. The Enrollment Act allowed wealthier Americans to avoid service by hiring substitutes or paying a 300 fee to the government, which led to widespread resentment among the working and middle classes who were disproportionately affected. This anger culminated in the New York City Draft Riots in July 1863, resulting in the deaths of over 100 people, numerous injuries, and property damage. Despite the initial strife and discontent, the draft helped bolster the Union Army's ranks and ultimately played a role in the North's victory over the South. After the war, conscription was discontinued, but it would be reintroduced during World War I. In summary, the first national draft used in the United States was instituted on March 3, 1863, during the Civil War under President Abraham Lincoln's administration. It aimed to address the urgent need for more troops in the Union Army and eventually contributed to the Union's success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How do you do this: Once you have applied frosting to your window, what should be your next step?","completion":"Once you have applied frosting to your window, here is the step-by-step process for the next steps: Step 1: Smooth out the frosting After applying the frosting, it's important to smooth it out for an even and desired appearance. You can use a squeegee, a plastic scraper, or an old credit card to gently smooth out air bubbles and ensure the frosting is evenly distributed across the window. Reason: A smoother application will result in a more professional and visually appealing finish. Step 2: Allow the frosting to dry Let the frosting dry according to the manufacturer's recommended drying time. This can usually be found on the product packaging or instructions. Avoid touching the window or exposing it to extreme temperature changes during this time. Reason: Allowing the frosting to dry properly will ensure it adheres to the window surface and maintains its durability and appearance. Step 3: Clean up Once the frosting has completely dried, clean up any tools, materials, and the surrounding areas. Remove any protective coverings from nearby surfaces, and dispose of used materials according to local regulations. Reason: Cleaning up the workspace allows for better visibility and a safer environment. Additionally, proper disposal of materials is environmentally responsible and keeps the area tidy. Step 4: Inspect the results Examine the frosted window to ensure it meets your desired level of opacity and appearance. Check for any flaws or imperfections, such as air bubbles, unevenness, or leftover residue. Reason: Inspecting the results allows you to identify areas that may need improvement or reapplication while also ensuring the final outcome is both functional and visually appealing. Step 5: Make any necessary adjustments If you notice any issues during the inspection, you may need to make adjustments or reapply the frosting to certain areas. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for any necessary removal or reapplication procedures. Reason: Making adjustments as needed will ensure your frosted window is both visually pleasing and provides the desired level of privacy or light filtration. By following these steps after applying window frosting, you can achieve a polished and professional result while protecting your investment in the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When you walk on the road, you will find a lot of people riding bicycles to school, shops and anywhere else. Therefore , China is known as \\"the kingdom of bicycles\\". In China, many families have one or two bicycles. Compared(......) with cars, bicycles have many advantages. First, they are much cheaper than cars. Most Chinese can't afford cars, but they can afford bicycles. Second, bicycles are small enough to park anywhere, while cars need a larger piece of land to park. What's more, with lower speed, bicycles are safer than cars. However, bicycles also bring some problems. Some riders don't obey the traffic rules and some riders don't think about others' safety. So they ride too fast. During rush hours, too many bicycles may cause traffic jams. _ What problems can bicycles bring? A) Bicycles are more and more expensive. B) Riding bicycles is more dangerous than driving cars. C) There are no places for so many bicycles. D) Too many bicycles may cause traffic jams. Answer:","completion":"D) Too many bicycles may cause traffic jams. Bicycles, while being a popular and efficient means of transportation in China, can also bring about certain problems. The primary issue that arises due to the increased usage of bicycles is traffic congestion. When there are too many bicycles on the roads, especially during rush hours, it can lead to traffic jams. This is because the roads become overcrowded with riders, making it difficult for everyone to move at a comfortable pace and maintain order. Although bicycles are generally more affordable and environmentally friendly than cars, their popularity can be a double-edged sword. In addition to causing traffic jams, the increased number of bicycles on the roads can also contribute to other issues. For instance, some bicycle riders may not follow proper traffic rules or prioritize the safety of other road users. This can result in accidents or slow-moving traffic, causing inconvenience and disruptions to people's daily commutes. Furthermore, while bicycles are smaller and easier to park compared to cars, the sheer number of bikes in China might make it challenging to find suitable and secure parking spaces. This can lead to bicycles being parked haphazardly or in unauthorized areas, which can cause obstructions and inconvenience for pedestrians and other road users. In summary, the main problem associated with having too many bicycles in China is traffic congestion, which stems from overcrowded roads and can lead to traffic jams. However, there are also other associated issues such as unsafe riding behavior and challenges with finding adequate parking spaces. These problems highlight the need for effective urban planning and infrastructure development that can cope with the rising demand for bicycle usage in the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Bacteria enters the body - Bloodstream - Cells in the body are attacked - Cells are killed - Different kinds of sickness are formed. suppose less bacteria in environment happens, how will it affect MORE cells being damaged. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"If there are fewer bacteria in the environment, it would lead to fewer instances of bacterial infections and, as a result, fewer damaged cells. In this scenario, the supposed perturbation would be \\"indirectly impacting a step of the process.\\" Here's a more detailed explanation: When bacteria enter the body, they can cause an infection by multiplying rapidly and attacking various cells in the body. The severity of their impact on the body varies depending on the type of bacteria, the strength of the individual's immune system, and other environmental factors. The process you've described outlines the general sequence of events that follow when an infection affects the body: 1. Bacteria enters the body through various means such as ingestion, inhalation, or open wounds. 2. Bloodstream: Bacteria enter the host's bloodstream, which facilitates their travel throughout the body. 3. Cells in the body are attacked: Bacteria produce toxins or directly invade tissue, leading to cell damage. 4. Cells are killed: As infected cells die, the body's immune system attempts to clear dead cells and fight off the remaining invaders. 5. Different kinds of sickness are formed: As damage occurs at the cellular level, symptoms of illness or disease emerge depending on the affected area of the body. If there were fewer bacteria present in the environment, it would mean that individuals would have a lower probability of encountering harmful bacteria. With the reduced likelihood of bacterial infections, there would be fewer cases of cells being attacked and damaged by these bacterial pathogens. Consequently, less sickness and disease related to bacterial infections would develop. In this situation, the perturbation does not directly impact a step of the process since the steps themselves would remain unchanged. Instead, it indirectly impacts the process by influencing the likelihood of certain steps occurring based on the reduced presence of bacteria in the environment. By limiting the number of potential bacterial encounters, the probability of each step in the infection process would be lowered, ultimately leading to a decreased likelihood of cell damage and sickness."},{"prompt":"Q:Question: How many times Irmgard Moller stabbed in the chest If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Baader Meinhof Complex Context: The film begins on a nude beach in Germany in the late 1960s, where we are introduced to Ulrike Meinhoff, a respected journalist, and her family. Meinhoff and her husband are then guests at a party, where Meinhoff reads off a periodical that she wrote about the injustice of the Iranian Government. With the Shah of Persia arriving into Berlin, there is a rally in the streets, where half the people are protesting the injustice and the other half are praising. As the protesting goes on, the Iranian people end up going into the crowd and fighting the innocent German protesters with the help of the German Police; leaving many injured and a man killed. The next scene is of Meinhoff at a television studio arguing why she favors the protesters side instead of the Governments side, and watching the live recording on her television is Gudrun Ensslin, another activist. She explains to her parents how American Imperialism is completely corrupt while Meinhoff walks in on her husband having sex with another woman. Next, we are introduced to Andreas Baader, the ringleader of these revolutionaries who decide to name themselves The Red Army Faction (RAF). Their first major rebellious occurrence takes place in a department store, where they decide to set home made bombs and light it on fire.

Question: Information: - The River Severn (Welsh: \\"Afon Hafren\\", Latin: \\"Sabrina\\") is the longest river in the United Kingdom, at about . It rises at an altitude of on Plynlimon, close to the Ceredigion/Powys border near Llanidloes, in the Cambrian Mountains of mid Wales. It then flows through Shropshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, with the county towns of Shrewsbury, Worcester and Gloucester on its banks. With an average discharge of at Apperley, Gloucestershire, the Severn is the greatest river in terms of water flow in England and Wales. - Shrewsbury (or ) is the county town of Shropshire, England. It is on the River Severn and has a population of approximately 72,000. - Aston Pigott is a hamlet approximately 12 miles west of Shrewsbury within the parish of Worthen and Shelve . The current population stands at around 50 . The hamlet is situated on a small rise giving many of the properties an outstanding view across the Rea Brook valley to the Stiperstones . It contains three working farms that are mainly dairy and lamb farms . The hamlet is served primarily by Worthen which is 1 mile to the west . It adjoins Aston Rogers . The name Aston Pigott probably evolved from East Tun or Town and from the name of the Picot family of Norman descent . In 1180 Ralph Fitz Picot was granted lands by the Corbets , and it was Ralph 's descendants , notably Robert Pigot in 1255 followed by Howel Pigot who established the modern village name . Mains water arrived in 1947 and mains electricity in 1948 . - Shropshire (or ; alternatively Salop; abbreviated, in print only, Shrops; demonym Salopian ) is a county located between West Midlands in England and Wales. It borders Powys and Wrexham in Wales to the west and north-west, Cheshire to the north, Staffordshire to the east, Worcestershire to the south-east and Herefordshire to the south. Shropshire Council was created in 2009, a unitary authority taking over from the previous county council and five district councils. The borough of Telford and Wrekin has been a separate unitary authority since 1998 but continues to be included in the ceremonial county. - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish. - The name Rea Brook can refer to either of two brooks (a local term for a small river) in Shropshire, England. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Worthen is a village in Shropshire, England approximately 13 miles west of Shrewsbury. The village forms part of the Worthen with Shelve civil parish, which includes the hamlet of Little Worthen immediately to the north-east and the villages of Brockton and Pennerley, in addition to several smaller settlements. It sits in the Rea Brook valley. To the south are the Stiperstones and the Bromlow Callow, known for the small clump of trees on top. To the north is Long Mountain. - The Stiperstones is a distinctive hill in the county of Shropshire, England. It is a quartzite ridge formed some 480 million years ago. During the last Ice Age the summit stood out above the glaciers and was subject to constant freezing and thawing which shattered the quartzite into a mass of jumbled scree surrounding several residual rocky tors. At above sea level it is the second-highest hill in the county, surpassed only by Brown Clee Hill. Stiperstones' summit ridge is crowned by several rugged, jagged outcrops of rock silhouetted against the sky. What is the relationship between 'aston pigott' and 'shropshire'? Answer:","completion":"Aston Pigott is a hamlet located in the county of Shropshire, England. It is approximately 12 miles west of Shrewsbury, which is the county town of Shropshire. This hamlet lies within the parish of Worthen and Shelve and has a population of around 50 people.

Several reasons contribute to this assessment: 1. The reviewer mentions that the screenplay \\"lags badly in the middle,\\" which implies that the pacing and the story's progression are not up to their expectations.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Many People Stop Exercising After School, Study Finds Hello, little friends! Today we're going to talk about something very important: exercise! Have you ever played games outside, run around, or jumped up and down for fun? That's exercise, and it's good for your body and your heart. A big group of people called the British Heart Foundation did a study, which is like a big homework assignment, to find out when people stop exercising. They found that 21 per cent of the people they asked said the last time they exercised was when they were in school, college, or university. That means that when they finished school, they stopped being active and playing! But that's not all. The same study found out that the typical person in Britain, a country filled with nice people, stops exercising completely when they are 56 years old! This means that many grown-ups aren't taking care of their hearts and bodies like they should. It's essential not only for grown-ups but also for kids like you to exercise and have fun playing sports or other physical activities. Why is exercise important, you may ask? Well, exercising helps keep our muscles strong, makes our bones healthy, and even helps us feel happy. It's like a magic potion that makes everything better! So, what can we do to help everyone continue to exercise and stay healthy? We can spread the word! Remind your parents, grandparents, and other family members how fun and beneficial exercise is. Why not invite them to play outdoor games with you, or take a walk in the park together? Remember always to be active and have fun, as it keeps your body and heart happy. Let's all work together to make sure people keep exercising, even when they grow up, so everyone can live a healthy and happy life!

Because the vacancy occurred so quickly and so close to D-day, the party provided my association with a shortlist of seventeen candidates, of which about five were women. Following a long day of interviews in hot sunny rooms, the list was whittled down to a shortlist of three ... I was informed that I had been selected outright on the first ballot ... That pride, that sense of achievement, the knowledge that I was selected on the basis of my performance and merit above all other candidates on that day is what enables me to hold my head up high in this place.\\" Dorries's account of her own selection appears to contradict a news report which The Times ran at the time, reporting that Conservative Campaign Headquarters placed a majority of women on the shortlist and pressed for the selection of a female candidate: \\"Mrs Dorries, who has three teenage children, easily beat her 11 rivals and won the plum safe seat on the first ballot at the selection this weekend. Party officials were thrilled that the seat has gone to a woman. Previously, only two women had been selected in the 17 safe seats where sitting MPs have retired. Senior party figures had made clear to local dignitaries that they would like the seat to go to a woman and presented the constituency with a shortlist of seven women and five men to underline the point.\\" In a debate on Woman's Hour, broadcast on 22 August 2001, Dorries (as Nadine Bargery) had advocated all-women shortlists if the behaviour of Conservative selection committees did not change. In 2009 though, Dorries was highly critical of David Cameron's proposal to consider using all-women shortlists, arguing against a move which would create \\"two classes of MPs\\".

Movie plot: Ex-fighter pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) became traumatized after an incident during the war, leading to his fear of flying. Recovering his courage, Striker attempts to regain the love of his life from the war, Elaine (Julie Hagerty), now a stewardess. In order to win her love, Striker overcomes his fear and buys a ticket on a flight she is serving on, from Los Angeles to Chicago. However, during the flight, Elaine rebuffs his attempts.After dinner is served, many of the passengers fall ill, and Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen) quickly realizes that one of the meal options gave the passengers food poisoning. The stewards discover that the pilot crew, including Captain Oveur (Peter Graves) and Roger Murdock (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), have all come down with food poisoning, leaving no one aboard to fly the plane. Elaine is instructed by the Chicago control tower supervisor Steve McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges) to activate the plane's autopilot a large blow-up doll named \\"Otto\\" which will get them to Chicago but will not be able to land the plane. Elaine realizes that Striker is their only chance, and he is convinced to fly the plane, though he still feels his trauma will prevent him from safely landing the plane.McCroskey, after hearing Striker's name on the radio, sends for Striker's former commander, Rex Kramer (Robert Stack) to help talk him down. As the plane nears Chicago, Striker neglects to check the oil temperature which damages one of the engines while a bad thunderstorm reduces visibility, making the landing even more difficult. Thanks to Kramer's endless stream of advice, Striker is able to overcome his fears and safely land the plane with only minor injuries to some passengers. Striker's courage rekindles Elaine's love for him, and the two share a kiss while Otto takes off in the evacuated plane after inflating a female autopilot doll.

Terius Nash was born in Rockingham, North Carolina. He moved with his mother to Atlanta when he was two years old. After first learning to play trumpet in elementary school, Nash learned how to play the drums and guitar. His mother died in 1992 when Nash was fifteen years old, an event which would inspire him to write songs. In 2007 Nash signed a record contract with Def Jam Recordings and began working on his debut studio album Love Hate. The album was produced by The-Dream, his production partner Tricky Stewart, and Los da Mystro, and featured Fabolous and Rihanna. The album was written and recorded in eight days with twelve tracks making the final cut. Released December 11, 2007, on The-Dream's Def Jam imprint Radio Killa Records, the album featured the singles \\"Shawty Is a 10\\", \\"Falsetto\\" and \\"I Luv Your Girl\\" and received generally positive reviews from critics, as Rolling Stone called it \\"one of the most likable R&B records of the year\\" and UrbanMusicReviews.com said that the singer had \\"hit a home run\\". In June 2008, The-Dream was named Best New Artist at the BET Awards. Nash wrote and produced Beyonce's \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\", which was included on her third studio album I Am... Sasha Fierce and released in 2008. The song went on to win the Grammy Award for Song of the Year and Best R&B Song, becoming the first career wins at the Grammys for The Dream. On March 10, 2009, The-Dream released his second album Love vs. Money. He re-teamed with Tricky Stewart, who produced most of the tracks on the album, and Los da Mystro. The album featured Mariah Carey, Kanye West, and Lil Jon and featured the singled \\"Rockin' That Shit\\", \\"Walkin' on the Moon\\" and \\"Sweat It Out\\". Upon its release, the album received general acclaim from most music critics, based on an aggregate score of 83/100 from Metacritic and it was more commercially successful than its predecessor, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200. During the making of Love King, he recorded a song with T-Pain and expressed that he would like to make a collaborative album with Kanye West in the future. In January 2010, The-Dream stated he was finished recording the album and he called it the best of his three albums. The album was released on June 29, 2010. Before the album's release, The-Dream announced that Love King will be his last solo album. Once again produced by The-Dream, Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, and Los da Mystro, the album spawned the singles \\"Love King\\" and \\"Make Up Bag\\".

Here are possible answers to this question: - bowling alley - city - military base - fashion show - football game I believe the correct choice is \\"bowling alley\\", here's why: A:","completion":"Bowling Alley You are correct, the term \\"gutters\\" in the context of preventing a ball from becoming runway refers to a bowling alley. Gutters are the two long channels or depressions on either side of the lane in a bowling alley, extending from the front down to where the pins are set. When a ball is bowled, the gutters are meant to catch and return it to the ball return mechanism if it veers off course. Here's a brief explanation of why the other options are not the correct choice in this context: - City: Gutters in a city generally refer to the stormwater drainage systems on the sides of streets. These gutters do not prevent a ball from becoming runway but instead help channel away rainwater and melted snow. - Military Base: Gutters have no significant association with preventing balls from becoming runway on a military base. A military base has different types of infrastructure for various purposes, such as housing, transportation, and storage, but bowling is typically not a significant part of this infrastructure. - Fashion Show: In the context of a fashion show, a runway refers to the stage or walkway upon which models display clothing and accessories. Gutters have no relevance in a fashion show scenario, as these events do not involve any physical activity or sports equipment. - Football Game: In a football game, the term \\"runway\\" could refer to the distance a player runs when carrying the ball. However, gutters are not part of a football field and do not play any role in preventing a ball from becoming runway in football. In summary, a bowling alley is the correct choice because gutters are integral components of the bowling lane system and serve to catch and return a ball that veers off course, thereby preventing it from becoming runway."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \\"Bollywood.\\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollyhood--more than 800 films a year. The movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery, and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \\"masala\\" film. (\\"Masala\\" is an Indian word for a mixture of spices.) Another big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script even finished. The director and writers can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script by hand instead of taking time to type it. Bollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million U.S. dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million U.S. dollars for a Hollywood film--thirty times as much!

Q: Passage: South Africas mass unemployment dates back to the 1970s, and continued to rise through the 1980s and 1990s. Unemployment has increased substantially since the African National Congress came to power in 1994, going from 15.6% in 1995 to 30.3% in 2001. In the second quarter of 2010, the jobless rate increased to 25.3%, and the number of people with work fell by 61,000 to 12.7 million. The biggest decline in employment was recorded in the manufacturing industry, which shed 53,000 workers. Agriculture lost 32,000 jobs, employment in the construction industry fell by 15,000. In the third quarter of 2010, 29.80% of blacks were officially unemployed, compared with 22.30% of coloureds, 8.60 of Asians and 5.10% of whites. A:","completion":"Q: How many more percentage points did black unemployment increase compared to white unemployment between 1995 and 2001? A: Using 15.6% as a baseline statistic in 1995, the total unemployment increased to 30.3% in 2001. For blacks, the unemployment in the third quarter of 2010 was 29.80%, and for whites, it was 5.10%. The increase for blacks was (29.80 - 15.6) = 14.2 percentage points, and for whites, it was (5.10 - 15.6) = -10.5 percentage points.

Q: How many jobs were lost in the manufacturing, agriculture, and construction industries combined in the second quarter of 2010? A: The manufacturing industry lost 53,000 workers, agriculture lost 32,000 jobs, and employment in the construction industry fell by 15,000.

Movie title: The Bourne Ultimatum Context: Following his pursuit by Kirill (in The Bourne Supremacy), Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) evades Moscow police while wounded, and deals with more flashbacks of when he first joined Operation Treadstone. Six weeks later, CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) divulges the audiotaped confession of Ward Abbott, the late former head of Treadstone, to Director Ezra Kramer (Scott Glenn). Meanwhile, in Turin, journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) of The Guardian meets an informant to learn about Bourne and Operation Blackbriar, the program succeeding Treadstone. The CIA tracks Ross as he returns to London, after his mention of \\"Blackbriar\\" during a cell-phone call to his editor is detected by the ECHELON system. Bourne reappears in Paris to inform Martin Kreutz (Daniel BrÃ¼hl), the step-brother of his girlfriend Marie Helena Kreutz (Franka Potente), of her assassination in India, also in the previous film. Bourne reads Ross's articles and arranges a meeting with him at London Waterloo station. Bourne realizes that the CIA is following Ross and helps him evade capture for a while, but when Ross panics and ignores Bourne's instructions, Blackbriar assassin Paz (Ãdgar RamÃ­rez) shoots him dead, in the middle of a busy station, on orders of Deputy Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). Vosen's team, reluctantly assisted by Landy, analyzes Ross's notes and identifies his source as Neal Daniels (Colin Stinton), a CIA Station chief involved with Treadstone and Blackbriar. Bourne makes his way to Daniels's office in Madrid but finds it empty. He incapacitates gunmen sent by Vosen and Landy. Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), a former Treadstone operative who shares a history with Bourne, tells him that Daniels has fled to Tangier and aids his escape from an arriving CIA unit. Parsons learns that Blackbriar \\"asset\\" Desh Bouksani (Joey Ansah) has been tasked with killing Daniels.

Write an article based on this summary: Take a deep breath. Avoid making threats. Grab a notepad. Copy down the number. Write down the day and time. Give a coworker a handwritten note. Listen to the caller.","completion":"Title: Remaining Calm and Prepared During Stressful Phone Calls: A Step-By-Step Guide Introduction Stressful or unexpected phone calls can be daunting, making it essential to find ways to remain calm, organized, and level-headed. No matter the reason behind the call, following a practical approach can help handle the situation better and efficiently respond to the caller. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to navigate these challenging situations and ensure a positive outcome. Step 1: Take a Deep Breath The first step is to remain calm by taking a deep breath before responding. It is crucial to handle stressful situations without panicking or becoming overly emotional. Taking a deep breath can help you stay relaxed and focused on the task at hand. It will also help you gather your thoughts and make better decisions during the call. Step 2: Avoid Making Threats As tensions rise during difficult phone calls, the temptation to make threats can be challenging to resist. However, making threats is never the solution. It might escalate the situation, lead to possible legal issues, and prevent reaching a resolution. It is crucial to maintain a professional and courteous demeanor throughout the call and focus on addressing the issue at hand. Step 3: Grab a Notepad A necessary yet often overlooked step is keeping a notepad and pen nearby. Writing notes during a phone call will assist you in remembering important details and help you track the progress of the conversation. Moreover, having these notes will come in handy if there is any follow-up communication. Step 4: Copy Down the Number Jot down the caller's phone number on your notepad. This information will be useful if you need to call them back or report the call to authorities. It's essential to have a record of all incoming calls, so having the number handy ensures you can reference it later if necessary. Step 5: Write Down the Day and Time Document the day and time of the call. By doing so, you can accurately track the details of the conversation for future reference. These records may be important if the call is related to an ongoing issue, and keeping track of the call history could benefit you in the long run. Additionally, having a record of the timeline can provide context when reviewing communications. Step 6: Give a Coworker a Handwritten Note If the situation requires support from colleagues or higher-ups, prepare a handwritten note summarizing the call to share with them. Keep the note concise, but make sure to include relevant information such as the caller's name, number, and main concerns. Passing along this information to your coworkers can help achieve a quick and effective solution. This procedure also fosters a collaborative work environment where employees can support each other during challenging moments. Step 7: Listen to the Caller Lastly, give your full attention to the caller, intently listen to their concerns, and avoid interrupting them. Practice active listening skills by acknowledging what the caller is saying, asking clarifying questions, and repeating pertinent information to ensure you understand their perspective. Listening and empathizing with the caller is key to addressing the issue and achieving a positive outcome. Conclusion Handling difficult or stressful phone calls is challenging, but following these simple steps can make all the difference. By practicing effective communication, remaining calm, and keeping detailed notes, you will be better prepared to manage any unexpected situation that arises during a phone call."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They convey nearly the same information and are similar in their core message. However, there are a few subtle differences between the two sentences that prevent them from being exactly identical: 1. Sentence 1 mentions \\"Two robots share a kiss,\\" which does not provide any explicit information about the robots' gender or whether they represent a specific gender. Sentence 2, on the other hand, specifies the genders of the robots by mentioning, \\"A male and female robot are kissing.\\" The difference in detail might lead the reader to visualize different situations or attach different meanings to each sentence. However, this addition of extra detail about genders is not significant enough to make them dissimilar. 2. The structure of both sentences differs slightly. Sentence 1 is more concise, describing a single, shared action between the robots in the form of \\"share a kiss.\\" In contrast, Sentence 2 uses a subject-verb-object structure, implying a distinct action between the male and female robot, \\"are kissing.\\" However, this syntactic change does not drastically change the overall meaning of the two sentences. Overall, the meaning of these sentences is quite similar, but the slight differences in context and structure prevent them from being a perfect match, which is why I rate their similarity as 4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These properties can be different from the wood produced earlier in the tree's life. In some trees, the wood laid on late in the tree's life may be softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than the wood produced earlier. In other trees, the opposite may occur, with the wood becoming harder, denser, stronger, and less even-textured towards the end of the tree's life. These differences in wood properties may not necessarily correspond to the distinction between heartwood and sapwood.

However, in a smaller tree, the sapwood may be superior in these properties compared to the heartwood. The variations in wood properties near the end of a tree's life can be attributed to multiple factors, such as environmental conditions, local climate, and the tree's overall growth rate and health.

Question: Information: - A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. A computer requires programs to function, and typically executes the program's instructions in a central processing unit. - An application domain is a mechanism (similar to a process in an operating system) used within the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) to isolate executed software applications from one another so that they do not affect each other. Each application domain has its own virtual address space which scopes the resources for the application domain using that address space. - A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files. Such programs are sometimes known as \\"notepad\\" software, following the Microsoft Notepad. - Emacs and its derivatives are a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant, GNU Emacs, describes it as \\"the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor\\". Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s and continues actively . - A scripting or script language is a programming language that supports scripts, programs written for a special run-time environment that automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. Scripting languages are often interpreted (rather than compiled). Primitives are usually the elementary tasks or API calls, and the language allows them to be combined into more complex programs. Environments that can be automated through scripting include software applications, web pages within a web browser, the shells of operating systems (OS), embedded systems, as well as numerous games. A scripting language can be viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment; in the case of scripting an application, this is also known as an extension language. Scripting languages are also sometimes referred to as very high-level programming languages, as they operate at a high level of abstraction, or as control languages, particularly for job control languages on mainframes. - In computing, executable code or an executable file or executable program, sometimes simply an executable or binary, causes a computer \\"to perform indicated tasks according to encoded instructions,\\" as opposed to a data file that must be parsed by a program to be meaningful. These \\"instructions\\" are traditionally machine code instructions for a physical CPU. However, in a more general sense, a file containing instructions (such as bytecode) for a \\"software\\" interpreter may also be considered executable; even a scripting language source file may therefore be considered executable in this sense. The exact interpretation depends upon the use; while the term often refers only to machine code files, in the context of protection against computer viruses all files which cause potentially hazardous instruction execution, including scripts, are lumped together for convenience. - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. - Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic. - A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms. - XEmacs is a graphical- and console-based text editor which runs on almost any Unix-like operating system as well as Microsoft Windows. XEmacs is a fork, based on a version of GNU Emacs from the late 1980s. Any user can download, use, and modify XEmacs as free software available under the GNU General Public License version 2 or any later version. - Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating a mathematical sequence of steps known as an algorithm e.g. through computers. Computing includes designing, developing and building hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; and creating and using communications and entertainment media. The field of computing includes computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, information systems, and information technology. - Emacs Lisp is a dialect of the Lisp programming language used as a scripting language by Emacs (a text editor family most commonly associated with GNU Emacs and XEmacs). It is used for implementing most of the editing functionality built into Emacs, the remainder being written in C (as is the Lisp interpreter itself). Emacs Lisp is also referred to as Elisp, although there is also an older, unrelated Lisp dialect with that name. - GNU Emacs is the most popular and most ported Emacs text editor. It was created by GNU Project founder Richard Stallman. In common with other varieties of Emacs, GNU Emacs is extensible using a Turing complete programming language. GNU Emacs has been called \\"the most powerful text editor available today.\\" With proper support from the underlying system, GNU Emacs is able to display files in multiple character sets, and has been able to simultaneously display most human languages since at least 1999. Throughout its history, GNU Emacs has been a central component of the GNU project, and a flagship of the free software movement.

Benjamin entered the bedroom. 2. Isabella entered the bedroom. 3. The watermelon is in the green_box. 4. Isabella exited the bedroom. 5. Benjamin moved the watermelon to the red_bucket. Now we must determine the scenario: - Scenario 1: The individual's belief matches reality. - Scenario 2: The individual's belief does not match reality. - Scenario 3: An individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. In this story, Benjamin moved the watermelon after Isabella left the room, which means Isabella did not witness the watermelon being moved. Therefore, the scenario resembles scenario 3: an individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. The question is: Where does Benjamin think that Isabella searches for the watermelon? Since Isabella left the room before Benjamin moved the watermelon, Benjamin would believe that Isabella still thinks the watermelon is in the green_box. So, he thinks she would search for the watermelon in the green_box."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Duncan Lee Hunter (born May 31, 1948) is an American politician. He was a Republican member of the House of Representatives from California's 52nd, 45th and 42nd districts from 1981 to 2009. Hunter was the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee during the 108th and 109th Congress. Hunter sought the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States for 2008, but his campaign failed to attract significant voters or delegates in early primary and caucus states, and he dropped out after the Nevada Republican caucuses. Context: In 1980, Hunter was recruited to run for Congress in what was then the 42nd District against 18-year incumbent Democrat Lionel Van Deerlin. Hunter was initially an underdog in a district where Democrats outnumbered Republicans by almost 2 to 1. However, his attacks on Van Deerlin's record on national defense gained traction in a district dominated by military bases and personnel. Van Deerlin did not respond quickly enough, and Hunter narrowly defeated him. He was one of many Republicans swept into office from historically Democratic districts as a result of the \\"Reagan revolution\\"; Van Deerlin had been the district's only congressman since its creation in 1963. After the 1980 census, many of the more Democratic areas were cut out of Hunter's district, and he was reelected 13 more times with no substantive opposition. His district was renumbered as the 45th District in 1983 and the 52nd in 1993. In the 2006 general election, he defeated Navy veteran/minister John Rinaldi, a Democrat, and Michael Benoit, a Libertarian. Hunter was re-elected with 65 percent of the vote, a 33-point margin over Rinaldi. On March 20, 2007, Hunter announced that, as part of his presidential bid, he would not seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 2008. After his son, Duncan D. Hunter, announced his candidacy for his father's seat, the younger Hunter was recalled by the United States Marine Corps to serve in the Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan. During Duncan D. Hunter's active service, his wife, Margaret Hunter, campaigned on his behalf. On June 3, 2008 Duncan D. Hunter won 72% of the Republican Primary vote and became the Republican nominee to replace his father representing the 52nd District. Question: Had he ever lose a contest?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Duncan Lee Hunter did not lose a contest for the House of Representatives, but he did lose the contest for the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States in 2008. Even though his campaign didn't attract many voters or delegates, he was successful in the House of Representatives elections, serving in Congress from 1981 to 2009."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: It's a Wonderful Life Movie plot: This movie is about a divine intervention by a guardian angel, to help a man in distress. It opens with a a fanciful depiction of angels in heaven discussing a problem that has come up. They are receiving prayers from mortals, like \\"Please, God, something's the matter with Daddy\\". George Bailey (James Stewart) is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to Earth to stop him. They select Clarence (Henry Travers), a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job. The senior angels promise that Clarence will get his wings if he succeeds. The bulk of the movie is a replaying of George's life, by the senior angels and for Clarence's benefit, so that Clarence will understand George.George Bailey was a young man, living in a small town, but with big dreams. From an early age, he wanted to get away from Bedford Falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges. The first incident that Clarence sees is that, at age 12, George saved his younger brother Harry's (Todd Karns) life in an accident while playing on an ice-covered pond. George lost the hearing in his left ear due to being in the icy water. Shortly after that, while working part-time in Mr. Gower's (H.B. Warner) drug store, he prevents a mistake in a prescription from fatally poisoning someone. The two little girls in George's life at that point are Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame), who seem to be competing for his notice.George's father (Samuel S.

The softening of Scottish economic performance - much of it driven by the weakness in the oil and sector, though probably not all - has barely registered in the campaign. That may be because the worst appears to be over - or the best, if you're an oil consumer, and most of us are. The price per barrel of global benchmark Brent Crude ended April just above 47. Since dipping briefly below 30 in January, it has risen by nearly two-thirds. That sounds a lot. And it is. But it's worth remembering that the price is down by 30% on this time last year, and by 60% on its most recent peak, in June 2014. So what's going on, and what does it tell us about the future direction of travel? Last month saw members of OPEC, the cartel of major oil exporters, fail to agree on a way of limiting production so as to push prices up. It looks to some, such as Oxford Economics, as if the cartel is dead. Or like the Norwegian blue parrot, it's resting. That is partly because two big players, Saudi Arabia and Iran, have a growing regional rivalry. It is also because non-OPEC members have much more influence on prices than used to be the case. The price could have plummeted with that April failure to agree a freeze on production levels. But it didn't. It barely stumbled, and then continued its rising trend. Now, oil industry analysts are pointing to a continuing upside to the price. The boss of the International Energy Agency was the most recent to do so, commenting over the weekend. OPEC is next due to meet again in Vienna on June 2. But having ridden out the last failure to agree, and with prices rising despite that, there is less pressure to do a deal. The Saudis left little doubt that their decision in late 2014 to retain production levels in order to sustain market share was intended to drive their new US rivals out of production. Shale oil had followed on the shale gas boom in the USA. It helps explain why the country's crude oil production rose 57% between 2012 and 2015. But the nature of a shale well is that it depletes in up to a couple of years, and then the reservoir has to be re-fracked. There are only around half the shale rigs drilling in the US than there were a year ago. The low price has meant that it's not been worth going after more. Indeed, US shale drillers are in a lot of financial distress. Supply remains one million to two million barrels per day more than demand. The fall of US output should help ease back on that over-supply. It represents more than half of the 700,000 barrels per day decline in non-OPEC output expected this year. But America's frackers are ready to come back, if the price does. They will probably start doing so at around 55. The International Energy Agency estimates that Texas and the Dakotas kick back in at 60 to 65, and could then take a year or so to return to steady production. Before then, a rising price will lead to the release into the market of large stocks of oil that have been built up in the past 18 months. Commercial reserves in the OECD more developed nations, according to the International Energy Agency, stand at more than three billion barrels. That 60 to 70 range is seen as the most likely one for the price to stabilise, at least for a while. Back in the heart of OPEC, around the Persian Gulf, Iran is determined to ignore the cartel's pressure to keep total supply suppressed. Having been allowed to export since January, the Tehran government wants to get back to what it was producing before sanctions were imposed in 2011, and a bit more. It was then at 3.5m barrels per day, and according to industry analysis from Platt's consultancy, it's nearly back to that level. It has stated that it wants to average 4m barrels per day this year. Much of that is currently going to refineries in India and South Korea. It has recently become easier to insure tankers sailing out of Iran, meaning it will play a more significant role in supplying Europe in coming months. That's out of more than 95 million barrels produced globally each day, more than 10m of them from Saudi Arabia. which is part of more than 32m from OPEC countries. That OPEC figure is reckoned by Reuters surveying to have crept up again in April, helping to explain a fall in price at the start of the first, low-volume trading day of May. (If it helps get a sense of scale, the UK's output of oil and its gas equivalent has risen recently to 1.5m barrels per day.) Iraq is also ramping up post-war production, reaching 4.16m barrels per day in March. But some other countries are seeing it fall. Nigeria has disruptions from vandalism and attacks on its infrastructure. Venezuela's economy is in dire straits and Libya faces a civil war, so both have seen output cut by a shortage of power necessary to operate production plants. Oil extraction requires a lot of energy. Then there's the demand side of the imbalance. Last year saw demand growth strengthen a bit, having dipped with the stalling of emerging market growth. A more recent analysis from the IEA suggests that it is continuing to rise to 1.2m barrels per day more this year. That's a slower rate of rise than the back end of 2015, as China, Europe and the US demand eases. But while it's rising, it helps close the gap between demand and supply and get the market more balanced again. And there's another factor - the mighty greenback. The US dollar has weakened by around 6% against a basket of currencies since the start of the year, and that helps drive up the cost of a dollar-denominated commodity. What about the longer term? In a brave bit of forecasting, Edinburgh-based Wood Mackenzie energy consultancy last week put out a warning of a huge, 4.5m barrels per day supply shortage. That, it suggested, could be with us in 2035. The reasoning for this is that the industry has become much less effective, or lucky, at finding new oil reserves. Even before the price slump cut exploration budgets by 40 to 50%, the annual discoveries of liquid reserves of hydrocarbons fell by roughly half between 2008 and 2015. The average year has seen around eight billion barrels of oil found. Last year, it was less than three billion. A much harder calculation is how much demand there will be if the world's oil users are to meet their commitments to climate change targets. If governments are true to their word, with written agreement of the Paris accord signed in the past few days, and if technology helps renewable power replace fossil fuels, the oil market 19 years from now may look very different What is a summary of this text?","completion":"In the oil industry, many factors are influencing the global market and future direction. The failure of OPEC to limit production and the rivalry between major players, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, have led to less pressure to reach a deal. US shale production has played a significant role, with the nature of shale wells requiring re-fracking to maintain production levels. Supply remains higher than demand, and the decline in non-OPEC output is expected to ease, with US frackers returning to the market as oil prices rise. Large stocks of oil are built up and are likely to be released into the market as prices rise. The demand side of the equation has recently been influenced by the stalling of emerging market growth, and the weakening USD has driven up the cost of the dollar-denominated commodity. In the long term, the industry's ability to find new oil reserves has been less successful, and the commitment to climate change targets adds uncertainty to the future of oil markets. In summary, the oil industry faces numerous challenges and influences from both production and demand sides, with rivalries within OPEC, US shale production, weakening USD, and the global commitment to climate change creating an uncertain environment for the market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The ballet instructor, a seasoned professional with years of experience both as a performer and educator, understands the intricacies and nuances of this traveling toe move, known as a bourrée in the ballet world. As the woman glides across the floor with a series of small, quick steps en pointe, or on her toes, the ballet instructor notices that she exhibits an elegant fluidity in her upper body. Her arms are gracefully extended, her fingers gently curved, creating an arch known as port de bras. He sees that the woman's shoulders are aligned with her hips, an essential element to maintain balance and control during the bourrée. However, the ballet instructor also notes a few areas in need of improvement. He observes that the woman's supporting leg must remain more engaged and stable to maintain her balance, while her Achilles tendons need to be stretched to achieve a fully pointed toe position. Her core muscles could be engaged more actively to provide additional support to her lower back throughout the demanding move. Once the woman has completed her demonstration of the traveling toe move, the ballet instructor provides his constructive feedback. He begins by commending her fluidity and the graceful lines she creates with her upper body. Encouraging her to continue developing this natural grace, he points out the specific areas and techniques that need refining. He offers advice on how to improve her foundational strength and balance, such as core exercises, resistance training, and alignment work. He suggests incorporating various stretches and mobility exercises to achieve a more extensive toe point and recommends practicing slow, controlled movements to strengthen and stabilize her supporting leg during the bourrée. Not only does the ballet instructor address these technical aspects of the traveling toe move, but he also emphasizes the importance of musicality and artistic expression. He advises the woman to be mindful of the musical phrasing and accents, using them to her advantage in perfecting her performance quality. Spending time on understanding intent, emotion, and storytelling is crucial when bringing a ballet piece to life, creating a connection with the audience and breathing life into every step. By providing comprehensive, thoughtful feedback and guidance, the ballet instructor supports the woman in honing her ballet skills and refining the traveling toe move technique. He highlights the need for consistent practice, dedication, and patience, ensuring that she keeps pushing her boundaries and perfecting her craft, regardless of her current proficiency level. The woman, in turn, appreciates the constructive feedback and remains committed to overcoming the challenges presented by ballet, working to embody grace, strength, and artistry in every move she masters."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Please answer the following question: Process: - An airline reservation is made - The passenger arrives early at the airport - The luggage is checked - The passenger waits in line - The passenger shows their identification and gets a boarding pass - The passenger goes to their gate - The passenger gets in line when it's time to board - The person boards the plane - The plane arrives at the destination - The passenger gets off the plane at their destination. Question: suppose bad weather conditions happens, how will it affect less passenger waits in line. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"Bad weather conditions can have a significant impact on airline operations and passenger experiences. In the given context, the question asks how adverse weather conditions might affect the waiting time in line for passengers. The potential answers provided are A: more, B: less, and C: no effect. Between these choices, the most accurate answer is A: more. During bad weather conditions, flights may be delayed, canceled, or rescheduled. These changes can result in increased wait times at various stages of the travel process for passengers, including getting in line for check-in, boarding passes, security checkpoints, and boarding. These increased wait times can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, flight delays and cancellations can lead to confusion among passengers, as they try to understand the changes in their itineraries, seek information from airline representatives, or make alternative travel arrangements. This additional activity can cause congestion around the check-in and boarding pass kiosks and lead to longer lines for passengers. Secondly, when flights are delayed, passengers have to spend more time at the airport, waiting for updates and eventually boarding their flights. This can result in larger crowds at boarding gates and longer queues while boarding the aircraft. Additionally, airlines may have to handle multiple flights at the same time due to weather-related changes, leading to an increased workload for staff and longer wait times for passengers. Thirdly, in response to the weather conditions, airline and airport staff may implement additional safety and security measures, such as inspections of planes and airport facilities. These processes can take time and can further increase the waiting time for passengers. In conclusion, adverse weather conditions can significantly affect the waiting time for passengers at various stages of the travel process, often leading to increased wait times in line. Therefore, the answer to the question is A: more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Tsukamoto started making movies at the age of 14, when his father gave him a Super 8 camera. His cinematic influences included Akira Kurosawa. He made a number of films, ranging from 10-minute shorts to 2-hour features, until his first year at college when he temporarily lost interest in making movies. Tsukamoto then started up a theatre group, which soon included Kei Fujiwara, Nobu Kanaoka, and Tomorowo Taguchi, all of whom would continue to work with Tsukamoto up through the filming of Tetsuo: The Iron Man. - Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director in 1943, during World War II, with the popular action film \\"Sanshiro Sugata\\" (a.k.a. \\"Judo Saga\\"). After the war, the critically acclaimed \\"Drunken Angel\\" (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films.

Next question: what are the two longest rivers in the united states?","completion":"The two longest rivers in the United States are the Missouri River and the Mississippi River. 1. Missouri River: The Missouri River is the longest river in the United States, with a total length of approximately 2,341 miles (3,767 kilometers). It originates in the Rocky Mountains in western Montana, near the Yellowstone National Park. This river plays a significant role in the nation's history, as it was a principal part of the westward expansion of the United States. It served as a route for Native American tribes, explorers, fur trappers, traders, and settlers. The Missouri River flows through seven states: Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri, before joining the Mississippi River near St. Louis. Along the course of the river, several major cities are situated, such as Bismarck, Pierre, Sioux City, Omaha, and Kansas City. Aside from its historical importance, the Missouri River is also a vital source of water supply, hydroelectric power, and irrigation for the agricultural areas in the region. Efforts are being made to conserve and protect the river, as it is a crucial natural resource for local ecosystems and wildlife. 2. Mississippi River: The Mississippi River is the second longest river in the United States and one of the most famous rivers in the world. Its length is approximately 2,320 miles (3,730 kilometers), slightly shorter than the Missouri River. It flows from Lake Itasca in Minnesota and traverses through ten states; namely, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. This river also played an essential role in the history of the United States as a major transportation and trade route. The Mississippi River ends its course by emptying into the Gulf of Mexico. Along its journey, it passes through key cities such as Minneapolis, St. Paul, Quad Cities, St. Louis, Memphis, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans. The river is well-known for its cultural and historical importance, particularly in American literature and arts – reflected in works such as Mark Twain's \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\\" Mississippi River is highly important for commercial navigation, flood control, agriculture, and the regional ecosystem. It is home to a wide variety of aquatic and terrestrial species, and many wildlife refuges are scattered along its length. There are ongoing efforts to maintain its health and protect it from pollutants, sedimentation, and habitat destruction to maintain ecological balance and continued future utility. In summary, the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers are the two longest rivers in the United States, both vital and historically significant. They continue to have substantial economic, cultural, and ecological influence on the regions they pass through."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Title: 88 Minutes Movie plot: Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Jack Gramm (Al Pacino) testifies at the trial of suspected serial murderer Jon Forster (Neal McDonough), dubbed \\"The Seattle Slayer\\" by police. Gramm's testimony and expert psychiatric opinion are crucial to help convict Forster of the attempted killing of Janie Cates and the murder of Joanie Cates, who was drugged, hanged upside down, and killed after the killer broke into her home. After receiving his conviction by the jury, Forster taunts Gramm, saying \\"Tick-tock, Doc.\\" Nine years later, as Forster's execution date approaches, several similar torture murders with very similar circumstances occur. Gramm is questioned by a lawyer from the Attorney General's office as well as FBI Special Agent Frank Parks (William Forsythe) about his connection to the latest victim, Dale Morris, a former psychology student of Gramm's with whom he was at a party the night before, just hours before her death. On the way to his class, Gramm receives a phone call from someone using software to distort their voice, threatening he has 88 minutes to live. He later reports the call to his secretary Shelly (Amy Brenneman) and has her put together a risk assessment profile of potential perpetrators. Gramm receives another threatening phone call while teaching and becomes suspicious of his students, particularly Mike Stempt (Benjamin McKenzie). The Dean of students, Carol Johnson (Deborah Kara Unger), interrupts the class to evacuate the building due to a bomb threat called in. As he evacuates the lecture hall, Gramm finds a written threat on the overhead projector in the classroom as well as on his car, which has been vandalized in the parking garage.

Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.

His parents were of Bulgarian and Polish descent. His nickname growing up was \\"Dede\\". As a child, he displayed symptoms of his gigantism very early, reaching a height of 191 cm (6 ft 3 in) and a weight of 94 kg (208 lb) by the age of 12. Andre returned in the winter of 1990, but it was not to the World Wrestling Federation. Instead, Andre made an interview appearance for Herb Abrams' fledgling Universal Wrestling Federation on October 11th in Reseda, California. (the segment aired in 1991). He appeared in an interview segment with Captain Lou Albano and put over the UWF. The following month, on November 30th at a house show in Miami, Florida the World Wrestling Federation announced Andre's return as a participant in the 1991 Royal Rumble (to be held in Miami, FL two months later). Andre was also mentioned as a participant on television but would ultimately back out due to a leg injury. His on-air return finally came at WrestleMania VII, when he came to the aid of The Big Boss Man in his match against Mr. Perfect. Andre finally returned to action on April 26, 1991, in a six-man tag-team matchup when he teamed with the Rockers in a winning effort against Mr. Fuji and the Orient Express at a house show in Belfast, Northern Ireland. On May 10th he participated in a 17-man battle-royal at a house show in Detroit. (won by Kerry Von Erich). His last major WWF storyline following WrestleMania VII had the major heel managers (Bobby Heenan, Sensational Sherri, Slick, and Mr. Fuji) trying to recruit Andre one-by-one, only to be turned down in various humiliating ways (e.g. Heenan had his hand crushed, Sherri received a spanking, Slick got locked in the trunk of the car he was offering to Andre and Mr. Fuji got a pie in his face). Finally, Jimmy Hart appeared live on WWF Superstars to announce that he had successfully signed Andre to tag-team with Earthquake. However, when asked to confirm this by Gene Okerlund, Andre denied the claims. This led to Earthquake's attacking Andre from behind (injuring his knee). Jimmy Hart would later get revenge for the humiliation by secretly signing Tugboat and forming the Natural Disasters. This led to Andre's final major WWF appearance at SummerSlam '91, where he seconded the Bushwhackers in their match against the Disasters. Andre was on crutches at ringside, and after the Disasters won the match, they set out to attack Andre, but the Legion of Doom made their way to ringside and got in between them and the Giant, who was preparing to defend himself with one of his crutches. The Disasters left the ringside area as they were outnumbered by the Legion of Doom, the Bushwhackers and Andre, who struck both Earthquake and Typhoon (the former Tugboat) with the crutch as they left. His final WWF appearance came at a house show in Paris, France, on October 9. He was in Davey Boy Smith's corner as the Bulldog faced Earthquake. Davey Boy hit Earthquake with Andre's crutch, allowing Smith to win. His last U.S. television appearance was in a brief interview on World Championship Wrestling's (WCW) Clash of the Champions XX special that aired on TBS on 2 September 1992.

Write some highlights for the following article: What was supposed to be a straightforward cash deal to carry a child for desperate parents has turned into an international spat over who said what, and exposed the darker side of a business credited with creating happiness for many couples. At the center of the debate is Gammy, a seven-month-old Down Syndrome baby with a congenital heart condition who is currently receiving treatment for a lung infection at a private hospital in Thailand. For days, Gammy's surrogate mother, 21-year-old Thai food stall worker Pattharamon Chanbua, has been telling local and foreign press that the couple abandoned their son, taking home his healthy sister. After initially denying they knew about baby Gammy, a friend of the couple issued a statement to a local Australian newspaper saying the pair only left Gammy because they were told he was likely to die. \\"Gammy was very sick when he was born and the biological parents were told he would not survive and he had a day, at best, to live and to say goodbye,\\" the unnamed friend told the Bunbury Mail, in Western Australia, where the couple live. Fear and lies. The friend said the surrogate mother gave birth at a different hospital to the one agreed upon, which made the surrogacy agreement void. The couple was scared, she said, that Pattharamon would change her mind about the second child, and they'd have to leave Thailand with no children at all. According to the report, the friend noted that the backdrop to the surrogacy row was a military coup in the country and \\"it was very difficult to get around.\\" The takeover took place in the early hours of May 22, 2014 when Commander of the Royal Thai Army General Prayuth Chan-chua announced in a national broadcast he was now in charge. \\"This has been absolutely devastating for them, they are on the edge,\\" the friend added, referring to the days of media scrutiny and debate over their decision, months after they returned home. Pattharamon claimed the couple asked her to terminate the Down Syndrome child when she was seven months pregnant. Not true, the couple's friend said. After the babies' birth, Pattharamon claimed they bought nappies and milk for the baby girl, but \\"didn't even look at the boy.\\" Also a lie, the friend added. Whatever the details of who said what, the case has attracted attention to a largely unregulated industry subject to a confusing tangle of laws and loopholes. Surrogate 'is legal parent' In the state of Western Australia, where the couple is from, it's legal to seek surrogacy abroad. There are no checks for criminal history, and no counseling is required for couples seeking offshore surrogacy, said Jenni Millbank, an expert in Australian surrogacy law from the University of Technology in Sydney. \\"If surrogacy were taken onshore there would be counseling protocols prior to conception, as well as a welfare report after birth required before legal parentage is transferred; but these are not steps that occur with offshore surrogacy,\\" said Millbank. She said the surrogate mother is the legal parent regardless of whose egg was used. The rights of the genetic father are also \\"uncertain\\" as \\"different judges have taken varied approaches,\\" she said. Australian authorities are looking into the case, as are Thai authorities, who had already announced a crackdown on the industry amid claims rules were being flouted. Pattharamon said she agreed to be paid 300,000 baht (9,300) for carrying the couple's babies, money she needed to help care for her own two children, aged six and three. After she voiced concerns about how she was going to pay for Gammy's care, funds started flowing to an online campaign, which to date has raised more than 237,000 (US220,000). Could baby girl be returned? Pattharamon said she's prepared to take the baby girl back if the Australian couple is are \\"not ready\\" to take care of her. She said she doesn't intend to pursue legal action against the parents, though Millbank says she could apply to the Family Court of Australia to have the child returned. \\"The Family Court of Australia has jurisdiction over anyone who has an interest in the care, welfare and a development of a child so (the intending parents) could still make their case and argue for the baby to live with them,\\" Millbank said. \\"The court would examine the competitive proposals of the parties, probably appoint an independent children's lawyer and do a welfare assessment of the child's needs and then make a decision.\\" The Australian courts have only ever heard one case involving a child born via surrogacy, Millbank said. It involved a child called \\"Evelyn\\" whose birth was the result of an agreement between friends that went wrong. \\"That was in the 1980s and they ended up removing the child from the family that had been raising her and taking her to the other family,\\" Millbank said. \\"It was an altruistic arrangement where the birth mother changed her mind about seven months later. And she ultimately won. She got the child back.\\"","completion":"A baby named Gammy was born with Down Syndrome and a heart condition to a Thai surrogate mother named Pattharamon. The biological parents, a couple from Australia, brought home Gammy's twin sister but left Gammy behind. At first, the couple claimed they did not know about Gammy, but later a friend said they believed he would die. This situation has raised questions about surrogacy laws and the care of children born with disabilities. Both Australian and Thai authorities are investigating the case. There has been a lot of debate and confusion about what really happened, but many people have donated money to help Gammy receive the medical care he needs."},{"prompt":"Given the background: Making these healthy lifestyle choices can also help prevent some types of cancer.

Please share my name and email address with Halloween & Costume Association, so that I can receive updates on this campaign and others. ||||| This year trick-or-treaters will dress up and go door to door on Wednesday, October 31, but a controversial petition wants to change that plan. The Halloween & Costume Organization just launched a campaign to move Halloween to the last Saturday of October, and lots of families have already hopped on board. The trade group argues that a weekend celebration would allow for greater parental supervision and child safety by trick-or-treating during daylight hours — not to mention more time to celebrate without the stress of the work or school week. \\"We feel the change is inevitable and that in the end, the logic behind creating a safer, longer Halloween will prevail,\\" HCA Chairman Kevin Johnson said in a statement. So far the group's efforts have garnered more than 900 signatures on Change.org. The holiday's fixed date stems from its religious origins in the eighth century, when Pope Gregory III declared November 1 as a day to honor all saints. A tradition then developed to celebrate the dead on the preceding night, which later became what we know today as Halloween. Despite its religious roots, most Americans currently treat October 31 as a commercial holiday — and some parents think moving it to a Saturday would make life a lot easier for them and their kids. Let's start by breaking down the positives, shall we? The Pros It's easier for parents to celebrate with their kids versus rushing home after work. Children could trick-or-treat during daylight hours when it's potentially safer. You could spend the whole day celebrating instead of a few hours at night. Kids can still get a good night's sleep after staying out late. The Cons But before we do anything too crazy, don't forget: The U.S. has celebrated Halloween on October 31st since the mid-19th century. Halloween literally means \\"All Hallows' Eve\\" — a.k.a. the night before November 1. Half the fun of Halloween as kid is staying up late on a school night. You just can't mess with tradition! So there you have it. Fair warning though: Right now the government does not recognize Halloween as a federal holiday, so not only would Congress have to pass a law adding it to the official calendar, but they'd also have to agree on when to celebrate it. Getting any kind of consensus out of Washington right now is a lot easier said than done, but if you really love Halloween, it might be worth a shot. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The Halloween & Costume Association has launched a campaign to move Halloween from October 31st to the last Saturday of October, arguing that a weekend celebration would allow for greater parental supervision, child safety, and more time to celebrate without the stress of work or school.

Title: It's a Wonderful Life Movie plot: This movie is about a divine intervention by a guardian angel, to help a man in distress. It opens with a a fanciful depiction of angels in heaven discussing a problem that has come up. They are receiving prayers from mortals, like \\"Please, God, something's the matter with Daddy\\". George Bailey (James Stewart) is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to Earth to stop him. They select Clarence (Henry Travers), a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job. The senior angels promise that Clarence will get his wings if he succeeds. The bulk of the movie is a replaying of George's life, by the senior angels and for Clarence's benefit, so that Clarence will understand George.George Bailey was a young man, living in a small town, but with big dreams. From an early age, he wanted to get away from Bedford Falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges. The first incident that Clarence sees is that, at age 12, George saved his younger brother Harry's (Todd Karns) life in an accident while playing on an ice-covered pond. George lost the hearing in his left ear due to being in the icy water. Shortly after that, while working part-time in Mr. Gower's (H.B.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: There was a young man named Bill in England. Before leaving school, he began to look for a job as a clerk. Few companies needed new clerks due to the financial crisis at that time. It became harder and harder to find a job. Luckily, a chance camp up to him. A company wanted to employ one person. He and the other twenty people joined in the first interview. After that, three persons were allowed to enter the final test which would decide one person to be employed in the end. Bill was lucky to be among them. On the day of the second interview, Bill and the others arrived at the company on time. To their surprise, the interview was very easy. The interviewer only had a free talk with them, and then asked them to go back home waiting for the result. The next morning, Bill received a letter from the company which said he wasn't accepted. Certainly, he felt disappointed. On the evening of that day, Bill surprisingly received another letter, which said he was employed. But why was he accepted? As a matter of fact, the first letter sent to Bill was also part of the test. Every one of them got a letter which had the same meaning that morning. Only Bill replied with \\"Thank you\\" while the others said nothing. Life isn't all fun. There is always something making us unhappy. When you feel disappointed, please say \\"Thank you\\" to the person who disappoints you. That shows your great generosity and politeness to others. If you do so, you'll have more chances than others. Question: In this article, the writer mainly wants to _ . Options: A: show how hard it was to find a job during the financial crisis at that time B: share an unhappy experience with the readers C: tell about how strict it was to employ one person D: teach us the importance of great generosity and politeness to others. The answer to this question is:","completion":"D: teach us the importance of great generosity and politeness to others.

The writer uses this moment to emphasize the importance of great generosity and politeness, even in the face of disappointment. By demonstrating that Bill's politeness led to his success, the writer aims to teach the readers the significance of maintaining good manners and how it can positively impact one's life.

By Louise Boyle Kato Kaelin, the bit-part actor who became famous overnight as OJ Simpson's house-guest at the time of his ex-wife's murder, has revealed that OJ tried to persuade him to provide an alibi for that fatal night 20 years ago. On the 20th anniversary of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, Kaelin spoke to Today along with the father and sister of Mr Goldman. The pair were found brutally stabbed to death at Ms Brown Simpson's LA home on June 12, 1994. Kaelin was staying in a guest house at OJ Simpson's compound and was present at the time the murders took place. He appeared as a prosecution witness at OJ's murder trial before a rapt but unforgiving public where he was criticized for his rambling, arrogant testimony and dubbed a 'beach bum' and 'parasitic freeloader'. Nicole Brown-","completion":"Simpson's brutal murder, along with that of her friend Ron Goldman, will forever remain etched in public memory as one of the most shocking and tragic events of the 20th century. The events of that fateful night, as well as the ensuing murder trial, captivated the attention of millions and marked an indelible turning point in the lives of all those involved. Kato Kaelin's association with OJ Simpson and his presence during the time of the murders made him a key figure in the investigation and the subsequent trial. As he spoke to Today, Kaelin was open about the burden that his newfound fame placed on him and the emotional toll he suffered. Kaelin revealed that OJ Simpson had tried to convince him to provide a false alibi for the night of the murders. Despite the pressure, Kaelin decided not to comply with Simpson's request as he realized the significance of the testimony he would have to give at the trial. He was determined to tell the truth, even if it meant putting his own safety and reputation at stake. Over the years, Kato Kaelin has been criticized for his attitude in the courtroom and labeled as a 'beach bum' and 'parasitic freeloader'. However, his decision to stand up against OJ's manipulative tactics showed immense courage and dedication to seeking justice for Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. As the Today interview continued, the father and sister of Ron Goldman, Fred and Kim, expressed their gratitude to Kato Kaelin for his candid remarks and his unwavering commitment to bringing closure to their family. The Goldmans acknowledged that they would never have known the truth about what happened that horrifying night without Kaelin's willingness to share his story. Twenty years after the murders, the cloud of suspicion and controversy that surrounded OJ Simpson's trial remains as potent as ever. Yet, in the midst of this unresolved pain and tumult, Kato Kaelin stands out as a figure who chose to put truth and accountability above self-preservation and convenience. As the interview concluded, it was strikingly evident that the lives of those touched by the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman have remained forever altered. The tragedy has come to define them in different ways, shaping the paths they have chosen to take in their search for justice and closure. Kato Kaelin's unwavering dedication to fulfill his responsibilities as a witness and his refusal to provide a false alibi for OJ Simpson continue to remind the world of the darker side of celebrity and the lengths some individuals will go in order to preserve their image and public standing. And although the ending of this tragic tale is marred with pain, disillusionment, and loss, Kato Kaelin's courage and integrity hold out a glimmer of hope that, in the midst of darkness, the pursuit of truth and justice can still prevail."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Connect the HDMI-A plug into a port on the TV. Connect the other end of the cable to the device or adapter. Switch to the HDMI source on your TV. Hook up the audio separately if necessary.\\"","completion":"Title: The Comprehensive Guide to HDMI Connection on Non-HDMI Devices In today’s rapidly evolving digital world, HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) has emerged as the near-ubiquitous standard for audio and video transmission. This powerful one-cable solution has largely simplified our home and work theatres, gaming systems, and PC monitors. However, what if you have a non-HDMI device that you wish to connect to your HDMI-equipped TV or monitor? The following is a detailed guide to establishing an HDMI connection on tech gadgets that don't inherently support it. To start, you must first identify an HDMI-compatible port on your non-HDMI gadget. Often, the key lies in understanding the port options available on your specific device. For monitors, computers, or similar devices, options might include DVI (Digital Visual Interface), VGA (Video Graphics Array), or DisplayPort ports. In the case of gaming consoles or DVD players, you could discover ports such as SCART or Component Video. The goal is to identify the highest quality output port available. Typically, an HDMI-compatible port is one that can transfer both audio and video signals, although this doesn’t strictly have to be the case. Once you’ve identified a potential port, the next step is choosing the correct cable or adapter. An adapter or converter will be required to change the signal from your device into one that can be read by your HDMI TV or monitor. These are available in various forms such as DVI-to-HDMI or VGA-to-HDMI, each tailored to specific connection needs. Besides, there are even multi-adapters available that can cover a range of different port types. When purchasing a cable or adapter, it is essential to ensure that it matches the port on your device. Next, you will connect the HDMI-A plug into a port on the TV. HDMI-A is the standard plug type, identifiable by its trapezoid shape. Most HDTVs and monitors are equipped with an HDMI-A port, making it a universal solution. Always insert the plug carefully to avoid damaging the pins. The fourth step is to connect the other end of the cable or adapter to the device in question. This can range from a VGA port on a projector to a DVI port on a computer monitor. Again, ensure that the connections are secure to guarantee a clear signal. Following this, you must switch the TV or monitor to the right HDMI source. When the device is connected via HDMI, it may take a moment for the TV to detect the new input. Once the connection is established, navigate to your TV settings and select the relevant HDMI input (for instance, HDMI 1, HDMI 2, and so forth) as the source. Finally, because older technology devices or analog ones might not transmit audio over HDMI, hooking up the audio connection separately may be necessary. A typical method involves using a separate audio cable which connects the audio output of the device to the audio input of your TV or speaker system. Typically, a 3.5mm audio cable or RCA audio cable is commonly used for this purpose. To summarize, while it may seem challenging at first, establishing an HDMI connection on non-HDMI devices involves a series of straightforward steps. By identifying an HDMI-compatible port, choosing the right cable, and correctly establishing the connection, you can enjoy high-quality audio and video on your HDMI-ready TV or monitor from various devices, irrespective of their native support for HDMI. Remember, when you encounter any challenges, the user manuals or online forums related to your specific device can be crucial tools in troubleshooting any issues. However, with careful attention to each step, you'll be able to effectively connect and enjoy your non-HDMI devices to the full."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Availability: Sporting goods stores typically stock a wide range of sports equipment and accessories, including items related to ice hockey, such as pucks, sticks, and protective gear. Therefore, a person is likely to find a puck available for purchase at a sporting goods store. 2. Variety: A sporting goods store generally offers a variety of pucks in terms of brands, sizes, and materials. This allows customers to choose the ideal puck that caters to their needs, preferences, skill levels, and budgets. 3. Quality: Sporting goods stores often carry products from reputable manufacturers and brands, ensuring that customers can purchase high-quality pucks that would last longer and perform better than cheaper, lower-quality alternatives. 4. Expertise: The staff at sporting goods stores usually possess knowledge about the sports products they sell, so a human looking to purchase a hockey puck may receive useful advice on which one to buy based on their requirements. This can be especially helpful for beginners who may not be well-versed in picking the right puck. 5. Convenience: Sporting goods stores tend to be more accessible than other suggested options. While hockey rinks, arcades, ice hockey games, and locker rooms might have pucks, it may not be convenient or easy to acquire them in these locations. Additionally, these locations might not always permit individuals to take home a puck. 6. New and unused products: Buying a puck from a sporting goods store ensures that the product is brand new and hasn't been used previously. On the other hand, pucks found at a hockey rink, arcade, ice hockey game, or locker room might be used, damaged, or even unsanitary, which might not be desirable for those looking to take a puck home.

Summarize this article: Drugs and weapons charges take precedence over Los Angeles killing in move that could give Durst’s lawyers time to fight basis of his arrest on murder charges Robert Durst’s extradition to California to face first-degree murder charges will be postponed at least until next week because authorities in New Orleans, where he was arrested on Saturday, want to pursue their own lesser charges against him first. Orleans Parish magistrate Harry Cantrell on Tuesday set a bail hearing for next Monday regarding an illegal weapons charge – Durst had a revolver on him when he was detained in the lobby of a Marriott hotel – and a second count of marijuana possession. Robert Durst: police search Houston apartment in murder case Read more Those charges pale in comparison to the killing of Durst’s friend Susan Berman, who was gunned down in her home in Los Angeles two days before Christmas in 2000. Berman’s is one of three mysterious deaths that Durst, the one-time heir to a New York real estate fortune, has been close to over the past 33 years. Durst was officially charged on Monday with her murder. It was not immediately clear why New Orleans wanted to pursue its own case against Durst, but the unexpected hold-up offered an opening for Durst’s team of attorneys. They have already been on warpath over The Jinx, the documentary series that appears to have played a significant role – disputed by the LAPD – in breaking open the dormant investigation into Berman’s killing and featured a possible confession from Durst in its concluding episode, which aired on Sunday. Durst’s lead attorney, Dick DeGuerin, told reporters on the courthouse steps in New Orleans that he would take advantage of the delay in extradition proceedings to fight the basis of Durst’s arrest even before he leaves Louisiana. “My concern is that the warrant that was issued in California was issued because of a television show and not because of facts,” DeGuerin said. “We’re going to get to contest that warrant here in Louisiana because of the Louisiana authorities’ determining to file charges here.” While legal experts said it was extremely unlikely that Durst could see the charges dropped before being extradited – an extradition his lawyers have already said he will not contest – DeGuerin seemed to relish the opportunity to give his defence strategy a dress rehearsal and accuse his adversaries of letting a television programme dictate what 15 years of inconclusive police investigation could not. “His arrest,” DeGuerin said, “is not based on facts. It’s based on ratings.” The Los Angeles police department has already hit back against the notion that the arrest was timed to coincide with the airing of the documentary. Their version of events is that they have built a case against Durst based on months of renewed investigation. “We didn’t base anything we did on the HBO series,” the LAPD deputy chief Kirk Albanese told the Los Angeles Times. “The arrest was made as a result of the investigative efforts and at a time that we believe it was needed.” The producers of The Jinx have denied they had any deal with law enforcement or that they knew when Durst’s arrest was coming. Nobody has produced evidence to the contrary. Questions have been raised, however, over the timeline of events as presented in the last episode of The Jinx. In a dramatic final interview for the show, Durst was presented with an envelope he had addressed to Susan Berman which bore many similarities to an anonymous note mailed to the Beverly Hills police on the day of Berman’s murder. Durst at first acknowledged the similarity but denied being the killer. He then went to the bathroom with his microphone still switched on, and in a conversation to himself appeared to suggest the jig was up. “What a disaster,” he said. “What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.” Andrew Jarecki, the director of the documentary, has already faced questions about how long he waited before handing over the envelope and the audio recording in the bathroom to police. He acknowledged in an interview with CBS – one of his only interviews since the finale aired – that there was a delay of several months but said that was because it took that long for his team to stumble on the bathroom audio for themselves. Now there appears to be a separate problem of presentation in the documentary itself. The final episode strongly suggested the interview occurred in the autumn of 2013 and that Durst, having resisted being reinterviewed, finally consented because he needed the film-makers’ help in a legal spat with his brother. But the New York Times has reported for two days now that according to its sources the interview occurred as long as 18 months previously. This is the kind of inconsistency that, if proven correct, defence lawyers feast on. It is already doubtful whether Durst’s bathroom ramblings constitute a confession that can stand up in court – one law professor, Laurie Levenson of Loyola Law School Los Angeles, said it was not a confession but a “reckless statement”. If DeGuerin can show there are other problems with it, he may seek to undermine its reliability further. Jarecki and his producing partner, Marc Smerling, ducked the timeline question in an interview with the New York Times published on Monday and then cancelled a slew of other interviews. They put out a statement saying it was no longer appropriate to speak to the media because they could be called as witnesses if Durst goes to trial for the murder of Susan Berman. HBO, meanwhile, would not answer questions from the Guardian about when they did a deal with Jarecki and Smerling and when it was decided to do the documentary in six parts – questions that might clarify when the film-makers knew how good their material was going to be. HBO said only that “we believe the relevant information was turned over to the authorities in a timely and responsible manner”. ||||| AP Karen Mitchell of Eureka, Calif., was last seen Nov. 25, 1997. Robert Durst may be connected to her disappearance, police said. Enlarge FBI 18-year-old Kristen Modafferi disappeared after leaving work in San Francisco on June 23, 1997. Robert Durst was said to be living in the area at the time. Enlarge Two teenage girls who went missing in California 18 years ago could come back to haunt Robert Durst. Detectives searching for Karen Mitchell and Kristen Modafferi took a look at the mysterious Manhattan real estate scion back in 2003 when he was on trial in Galveston, Tex., for murdering and dismembering his neighbor. Now that Durst will soon be heading back to Los Angeles to face a charge of murdering old friend Susan Berman in 2000, the search for 16-year-old Mitchell is back on the front burner, said an author who has covered Durst for years. “Karen Mitchell's family spoke with the FBI as recently as a few months ago,” said Matt Birkbeck, who wrote \\"A Deadly Secret: The Strange Disappearance of Kathie Durst.\\" “They brought up Durst.” Kathie Durst was the cross-dressing multimillionaire’s first wife, who vanished in 1982. Humboldt County District Attorney Maggie Fleming declined to discuss Durst or the Mitchell case. “I really can't confirm or deny that Durst is a person of interest because anything said about the investigation could potentially hinder the investigation,” she said. Gerald Herbert/AP Robert Durst is escorted into Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment in Orleans Parish Criminal District Court in New Orleans on Tuesday. Modafferi’s dad said he hasn’t heard from the feds recently about his daughter, who was 18 when she vanished while visiting San Francisco. So he is reaching out to them. “The Durst news has created enough of a question mark in my mind that I'm going to follow up with the FBI,” Bob Modafferi said. “If he was in that area where Kirsten went missing, it raises a bunch of potential red flags and questions.” Mitchell, who vanished on Nov. 25, 1997, volunteered at a homeless shelter in Eureka, Calif., where Durst had been spotted, Birkbeck said. Police said that after leaving the shelter, Mitchell walked over to the Bayshore Mall and visited her aunt, Annie Casper, at her shoe store. Then Mitchell left for her aunt’s home — and has not been seen since. Durst lived in the nearby town of Trinidad at the time and visited Casper’s store — while dressed in drag — at least four times, Birkbeck said. Investigators also looked at Durst in connection with Modafferi, a college student from North Carolina who went missing on June 23, 1997, Birkbeck said. “The investigators told me that one of the suspects they were looking at had dressed in drag, he had some odd habits,” he said, referring to the Mitchell case. “After I finished the interview, I mentioned that I covered Robert Durst, who also dressed in drag. They wrote his name down and then I discovered he was living in San Francisco at the time. The police just jumped on it. They started putting pieces together.” Bob Modafferi, 66, of Charlotte, N.C. confirmed that cops went “down that road to see if there was anything to it.” “They did not indicate to us there’s anything there,” he said. “As time goes on, realistically the hope starts to dim, but it never dies out completely. There are cases you hear about that finally have a break. We will never lose faith or give up hope.” Durst’s lawyers have said they know nothing about Mitchell or Modafferi and deny he had anything to do with Berman’s murder or Kathie Durst’s disappearance. Durst was acquitted of killing neighbor Morris Black, even though he admitted chopping up his body. rblau@nydailynews.com ||||| HOUSTON (AP) — Authorities on Tuesday carried away two boxes after searching the Houston home of real estate millionaire Robert Durst after his weekend arrest in New Orleans on a murder warrant.

(Associated Press) Durst, 71, is charged with murder in a killing in California 15 years ago, and has been suspected — but never charged — in the disappearance of his first wife in New York. In 2003, he was acquitted of murder in a dismemberment death in Texas. His arrest in New Orleans came shortly before the finale of an HBO series about his links to the three killings. Seven officers spent hours Tuesday searching Durst's home in a 17-story condominium building in a posh Houston neighborhood. About 8:30 p.m. the officers, including one wearing a Los Angeles Police Department badge, carried two white cardboard document boxes to six vehicles and left. The officers declined to comment, except for one who confirmed they were done. FBI spokeswoman Shauna Dunlap confirmed that FBI agents participated in the operation at the request of the Los Angeles Police Department. Harris County district attorney's office spokesman Jeff McShan said the Los Angeles Police Department contacted his office last week. Neither Dunlap nor McShan would elaborate on what was happening inside the building and referred questions to Los Angeles police. LAPD spokesman Sgt. Barry Montgomery said the department is not commenting until Durst is in its custody. Durst is being held in Louisiana, where he faces drug and weapons charges, and it's not clear how soon he will be returned to California. \\"This is an investigation that's being handled by multi-jurisdictions,\\" Montgomery said. \\"At this juncture the only thing the LAPD is doing is waiting for the extradition. We are just waiting on him to make it into our custody.\\" Durst, 71, was charged Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the shooting of Susan Berman, his confidante and the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster, in Beverly Hills. He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime. Dick DeGuerin, Durst's longtime Houston defense attorney, said he was baffled by what investigators could be looking for in the condo building. \\"I think it's a publicity stunt. I'm not surprised by it, but I would really be surprised if they found anything of any evidentiary value,\\" he said. In the documentary \\"The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst\\" that just wrapped up, Durst mumbled about how he \\"killed them all,\\" providing a dramatic kick to the end of the series. But a law enforcement official said his arrest on the murder charge was based on words he wrote. Analysis linked a letter Durst wrote to Berman a year before her killing with one that pointed police to her body, and that was the key new evidence in the long-dormant investigation into the 2000 killing, the official not authorized to speak publicly told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing. Bob Martin, who has lived with his wife, Carol, in the Houston building for 1 ½ years, said he would occasionally say hello to Durst and discuss the real estate market with him. He described Durst as no quirkier than anyone else in the building. He added that Durst would occasionally attend the building's homeowners' association meetings and that the building staff reported Durst was courteous to them, as well. Durst waived extradition in New Orleans, but authorities there charged him with being a felon in possession of a gun and with having marijuana. Assistant District Mark Burton said investigators found more than a quarter-pound of pot and a revolver in his hotel room. DeGuerin said he wants a hearing in Louisiana as soon as possible to contest the arrest. \\"The warrant we believe is based on a television show and not on actual fact,\\" he said. \\"We want a hearing as quickly as possible so Mr. Durst can go to California and face trial as quickly as possible.\\" The judge in New Orleans scheduled another hearing for next Monday. ___ Associated Press writers Tami Abdollah and Brian Melley in Los Angeles, Janet McConnaughey in New Orleans and Emily Wagster in Jackson, Miss., contributed to this report. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Eureka Police Department Chief Andy Mills said Tuesday that he would like to talk to investigators who have dug into Durst’s past in connection with the disappearance of Karen Mitchell, who was 16 when she went missing from Eureka, California, in 1997. \\"We believe she met foul play but we do not know that for sure,\\" Mills told NBC News, adding that they would like to learn more about when Durst was in Eureka. But Mills was clear to point out that the department has not made any sort of definitive, direct link between the Mitchell case and Durst. “I caution people about reaching too far too quickly,�? he said. Durst was charged Monday in Los Angeles with the 2000 murder of his close friend Susan Berman, who investigators say may have been a witness to an earlier crime.

Durst was caught on a microphone while filming the HBO documentary \\"The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst\\" saying: \\"What the hell did I do?

Los Angeles Deputy Police Chief Kirk Albanese said the timing of the arrest had nothing to do with the HBO show and that investigators were concerned that Durst might flee the country. \\"We do police work based on the facts and evidence,\\" Albanese told the Associated Press on Monday. \\"I know there's lots of speculation about that.

Research about raising chickens: Before getting started, it's essential to gather information about different breeds, their specific requirements, and the challenges involved in raising chickens. This will help you make informed decisions throughout the process. 2. Determine your purpose: Decide why you want to raise chickens. Some people raise chickens for eggs, others for meat, and some just to keep as pets. Your purpose will dictate your choice of breed, coop size, and management practices. 3. Choose the right breed: Select a breed suitable for your purpose and local climate. Consider factors such as egg-laying frequency, temperament, hardiness, and growth rate. 4. Prepare the space: Chickens require a safe, clean, and adequately sized living environment. Design a coop and outdoor run that provide protection from predators, shelter from the elements, and enough space for the chickens to roam and roost (minimum of 10 square feet per bird). 5. Acquire supplies: Purchase or build a feeder and waterer, food storage container, bedding material, nesting boxes, and roosting bars. You'll also need chicken feed formulated for the particular age and purpose of your birds. 6. Purchase and transport chickens: Obtain your chickens from a reputable breeder, hatchery, or local farmer. Transport chicks or adult birds in a secure, well-ventilated container and practice proper biosecurity measures during the process. 7. Get the right feed: Feed your chickens an appropriate diet, consisting of a balanced poultry feed that contains necessary nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. The type of feed depends on the age and purpose of your birds. 8. Maintain cleanliness: Regularly clean the coop, replacing bedding material, and removing droppings. This helps prevent diseases, keeps odor under control, and provides a comfortable environment for your chickens. 9. Ensure health and safety: Monitor your chickens' health and provide necessary vaccinations. Familiarize yourself with common chicken ailments to quickly address any issues. 10. Gain experience and engage with the community: Consult experienced chicken keepers, join online poultry forums, or visit local poultry clubs to continually learn and seek advice.

To get the most pleasure out of your small garden, plant your favorite vegetables. Many vegetables come in dwarf sizes such as tomatoes and eggplants.","completion":"These compact varieties allow you to maximize your space while still enjoying the delicious produce you crave. It's important to carefully plan your garden layout, taking into consideration the specific requirements of each vegetable. Utilize vertical space by incorporating trellises, stakes, or cages for crops like peas, beans, and cucumbers to climb, as this not only saves space but also increases air circulation and sun exposure. Another space-saving trick is to use square foot gardening, which is a method of dividing your garden into one-foot square sections, allowing you to determine exactly how many plants can fit in a given area, without overcrowding. Planting in succession can also be extremely beneficial, as it enables you to consistently harvest fresh vegetables throughout the growing season. By timing your planting so that as one crop is harvested, another can be planted in its place, you can quickly replenish your garden and enjoy a continuous supply of your favorite vegetables. Interplanting, or combining crops with complementary growth habits, is another useful technique. For instance, planting fast-growing, shallow-rooted plants like radishes or lettuce alongside slower-growing, deeper-rooted vegetables such as carrots or tomatoes can help you optimize your limited garden space. Take advantage of containers for more flexibility if your garden space is limited or if it lacks proper soil quality. Containers offer the perfect opportunity to grow a wide range of vegetables just about anywhere – on your patio, porch, or balcony. Remember to select containers with proper drainage and ensure the container size is appropriate for the vegetable you're growing. You can even choose self-watering containers to minimize maintenance. Further, using high-quality, well-draining potting soil with the right nutrients will set your vegetables up for success. Good plant care, which includes proper watering, fertilization, and pest control, is essential to your small garden's success. Maintaining a consistent watering schedule and monitoring your plants for any signs of stress or pests can help you address issues early on, ensuring healthy growth. Regularly applying organic fertilizers or compost can provide your vegetables with the necessary nutrients for optimal growth. Additionally, practicing crop rotation – even on a small scale – can help minimize soil-borne diseases, pests, and nutrient depletion. Lastly, don't forget to keep a garden journal to track your progress, plant varieties, successes, and challenges. This valuable tool will help you continuously refine your small garden's layout, growing techniques, and plant selections, ensuring that each season becomes even more fruitful and enjoyable than the last. With careful planning, resourceful use of space, and attentive plant care, you can create a thriving vegetable garden in even the smallest of spaces, bringing you endless joy and satisfaction through the art of homegrown produce."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the final step of the following process: - A butterfly starts as an egg - The egg hatches - A larva emerges - The larva eats and grows - The larva sheds its skin - The larva enters a chrysalis - The pupa grows inside the chrysalis - The adult butterfly exits the chrysalis - The adult butterfly is now fully grown","completion":"The final step in the process of a butterfly's life cycle, after the adult butterfly exits the chrysalis and is fully grown, is the reproduction and laying of eggs to continue the species. In this final stage, adult butterflies focus on finding a mate and reproducing. Mating in butterflies usually occurs through a courtship process, which can involve visual, tactile, or chemical cues. Some butterflies engage in elaborate courtship flights to attract a mate, while others may release pheromones or use bright colors or patterns on their wings. Once a suitable partner has been identified and the courtship is successful, the butterflies will mate. Following mating, the female butterfly searches for a suitable host plant to lay her eggs. The choice of plant is crucial, as it serves as a food source for the emerging caterpillars. Female butterflies have evolved to be highly selective in choosing host plants, as some plants produce toxins that can harm the caterpillars. In some cases, the female butterfly may even taste potential host plants using sensory organs on her legs, called chemoreceptors, to ensure that the plant is suitable. Once the female butterfly finds the appropriate host plant, she will lay her eggs, typically on the underside of the leaves to provide shelter and camouflage. The number of eggs varies depending on the species, but could range from a few dozen to several hundred. The eggs are secured using a sticky substance produced by the butterfly, which hardens quickly to firmly attach the eggs to the plant. In conclusion, the final step in the process of a butterfly's life cycle is reproductive and involves finding a mate, mating, and laying eggs on a suitable host plant. This ensures the continuation of the species and starts the life cycle all over again with a new generation of butterflies going through the stages of egg, larva, pupa, and adult butterfly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Step 1: Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt into a bowl Justification: This step combines the dry ingredients that will provide the structure and leavening capabilities to the batter. Flour provides gluten which forms the structure, baking powder acts as a leavening agent, sugar provides sweetness to the batter and also softens it, and salt enhances the overall flavor of the pancakes. Step 2: Mix in milk, eggs, and melted butter Justification: This step incorporates the wet ingredients necessary for the batter's consistency, structure, and flavor. Milk adds moisture, eggs give structure and richness, and melted butter provides a tender texture and added flavor. Step 3: Mix until smooth Justification: This step ensures that the wet and dry ingredients are combined well without overmixing, which could result in a tough pancake due to the development of too much gluten. The batter should be smooth to create uniform and tender pancakes. Step 4: Heat a griddle or frying pan to medium high Justification: This step ensures the cooking surface has reached an optimal temperature for evenly browning the pancakes and allowing them to rise properly. If the griddle is too hot, the pancakes will burn before they're cooked through; if it's too cool, they won't rise or brown properly. Step 5: Pour batter onto the griddle Justification: This step distributes the batter onto the cooking surface in portions to form individual pancakes that will cook evenly. Perturbation Hypothesis: If there is more sugar available, there will be more mixture. The additional sugar would increase the volume of the mixture. This may result in sweeter and softer pancakes but could also negatively affect their structure, browning, and rise if the sugar content is increased too much. Effect of the Perturbation: Increased sugar content will have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Directly, it will affect the sweetness and texture of the batter and pancakes. Indirectly, it could impact the structure, browning, and rise of the pancakes during cooking, potentially leading to undesired results or alterations in the final appearance and texture. In either case, it will change the final outcome of the pancakes and may require adjustments to the cooking process to accommodate the additional sugar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - Basketball is a sport that is played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop in diameter and mounted at a height of to backboards at each end of the court. The game was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, who would be the first basketball coach of the Kansas Jayhawks, one of the most successful programs in the game's history. - Women's basketball is one of the few women's sports that developed in tandem with its men's counterpart. It became popular, spreading from the east coast of the United States to the west coast, in large part via women's colleges. From 1895 until 1970, the term \\"women's basketball\\" was also used to refer to netball, which evolved in parallel with modern women's basketball. - The Big Ten Conference (B1G), formerly Western Conference and Big Nine Conference, is the oldest Division I collegiate athletic conference in the United States. The conference, consisting of 14 members as of 2016, competes in the NCAA Division I; its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A, the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport. The conference includes the flagship public university in each of 11 states stretching from New Jersey to Nebraska, as well as two additional public land grant schools and a private university. - Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. - The 1948 Michigan Wolverines football team represented the University of Michigan during the 1948 college football season .

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the city that was bombed in the Bristol Blitz? ? Bristol, the largest city in South West England, has an eclectic combination of architectural styles, ranging from the medieval to 20th century brutalism and beyond. During the mid-19th century, Bristol Byzantine, an architectural style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived. Buildings from most of the architectural periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era, as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants. Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several Georgian-era squares were laid out for the enjoyment of the middle class. As the city grew, it merged with its surrounding villages, each with its own character and centre, often clustered around a parish church. The construction of the city's Floating Harbour, taking in the wharves on the River Avon and Frome, provided a focus for industrial development and the growth of the local transport infrastructure. Key elements of which include the Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed Clifton Suspension Bridge and Temple Meads terminus; the latter served from 2002 to 2009 as the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, but is now closed.The 20th century saw further expansion of the city, the growth of the University of Bristol and the arrival of the aircraft industry. During World War II, the city centre was extensively bombed in the Bristol Blitz. The redevelopment of shopping centres, office buildings, and the harbourside continues to this day. Answer:","completion":"The name of the city that was bombed in the Bristol Blitz is Bristol."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What should catfish smell like?","completion":"No, the following two questions are not the same, but they seek similar information regarding the olfactory characteristics of two different types of fish: wild salmon and catfish. Both questions essentially ask how each type of fish should smell in order to assess its freshness and quality. I will provide a detailed analysis and comparison of the smells associated with fresh wild salmon and catfish below. 1. What should wild salmon smell like? Wild salmon, when fresh, should have a mild, pleasant scent indicative of the ocean or fresh water, depending on where it came from. Some people describe the smell of fresh salmon as slightly briny, like seawater, or reminiscent of a fresh, clean, and chilly river. It should not have an overpowering or \\"fishy\\" smell, which can be an indication of spoilage or poor quality. The flesh of the salmon should also appear firm and somewhat moist to the touch. Another indicator of freshness is the presence of a slimy layer on the skin; however, this slime should be clear and not cloudy or discolored. 2. What should catfish smell like? Fresh catfish, like wild salmon, should also have a mild and subtle aroma. A properly cleaned and prepared catfish should smell a bit earthy, but not muddy or musty, as catfish are bottom-dwelling fish that often reside and feed in muddy environments. Their muscles can retain some of these flavors and smells, but careful handling and cleaning can reduce these unwanted characteristics. Fresh catfish should not have a strong or \\"fishy\\" odor, and, again, such a smell can be a sign of spoilage or poor quality. The flesh should appear firm, moist, and white, sometimes with a pinkish or iridescent hue. In summary, while the two questions are not identical, they both pertain to the freshness and quality of two different types of fish: wild salmon and catfish. Both fish should have a subtle, mild aroma that is reflective of their natural environments. Strong or \\"fishy\\" smells should raise suspicions about the freshness and quality of the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Review: The fully rounded character of the principal role of this movie, that of the cop torn up by his past and on a path of self-destruction so clear to the viewer, is unique for its time, 1950. Along with the haunting music and the well written plot, the film is a prime example of film noir at its best. Close-ups of Dana's eyes reveal the anguish within, Karl Malden excels as his boss, who brooks no nonsense but also has compassion for those under his command in the precinct. Otto Preminger made this type of movie just about his own. If there is any fault it would be with the breath taking beauty of Gene Tierney who seems oddly out of place with the hardened cop.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Fans congratulate Danniella Westbrook on ‘pregnancy’ after sharing THIS snap - but is she expecting? The actress joked about having a baby bump as she lounged in the pool DANNIELLA Westbrook admitted she was “looking very pregnant” in her recent holiday snap – after making no secret about wanting a baby with toyboy lover George Arnold. In a snap which showed the bikini-clad ex EastEnders star lounging out on an inflatable flamingo, she wrote: “So chilled out. Looking very pregnant,” followed by cheeky monkey and love heart Emoji icons. The actress showed off her tanned tummy in the sun-soaked snap as she relaxed in matching swimwear. Yet her pool antics in Portugal came second to her comment as fans flocked to respond to her cheeky suggestion she could be expecting. One was quick to celebrate and wrote: “Congratulations beautiful!!” while one simply put: “Congrats xx.” Another added: “You don’t look pregnant but if you are congrats hun, deserve it all.” Many others quizzed as to whether her words were just meant as tongue-in-cheek and uploaded the question: “Are you pregnant?” One took her comments as pure banter and added: “I think she’s probably just tormenting everyone little moo.” She later uploaded another shot showing her sliding into the water and sporting a headscarf to protect her blonde locks from the water. Yet the star of the small screen, who looked blissfully happy as she topped up her tan on the inflatable, could just as well have been channelling the mood of fellow actress Jennifer Aniston. The Friends star this week spoke out to set the record straight about “absurd” pregnancy rumours. She has insisted she is not expecting a child with husband Justin Theroux and urged fans to stop speculating about her baby status every time she has a “burger for lunch”. They came just hours before Danniella, already a mum-of-two, posted a super-cute snap of her date night with George. The Celebrity Big Brother star showed off her toned legs in a thigh-skimming denim dress which she paired with strappy black sandals and a hat. Danniella, 42, stood sandwiched next to George, 24, as they posed with a huge yacht in the background. She captioned the sweet snap: “Dinner with the one I love,” and hashtags including #mylove #mygeorge. Earlier this year, she revealed she was trying for a baby with George and would even fork out for costly IVF treatment if she struggled to conceive naturally. She told Closer magazine: “I’d love to be a mum again. I feel like this could be my happy ending. “George and I have just bought a house together and I’m excited to get married to him this year. “We’re also going to start trying for a baby, and if it doesn’t work within two months, I’ll have IVF.” She added: “The past two years have been awful but I’ve softened now and let my guard down because I’ve met George. Since I met him I’ve had a smile on my face every day and we would love to get married, so once my divorce has gone through, we’ll do that.” Meanwhile a spokesperson for Danniella denied she was pregnant. They told The Sun Online: \\"She's 100% not pregnant. She was just making fun of an unflattering photo.\\"","completion":"Actress Danniella Westbrook has recently shared a holiday snap with a caption that jokingly suggests she may be pregnant.

Article: Story highlights A pregnant woman was injured during an airstrike in Aleppo, Syria The baby in her womb was delivered by laparotomy and was found to have a shrapnel wound Surgeons removed the shrapnel, and the infant survived (CNN) In war-torn Syria, a baby girl was a victim of the country's civil war before she was even born. The newborn is named Amel, or \\"Hope,\\" because of what she has survived in her first days of life in Aleppo. She came into this world bearing a scar of war on her forehead. Her story is a tragic illustration of a human toll of a war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives and pushed millions of others to flee. As European leaders deal with an influx of migrants and refugees flowing through their borders, Amel's story provides the explanation for why the mass migration is happening. An airstrike, allegedly by government forces, on September 18 damaged several homes in a residential area of Aleppo, including the home where a woman named Amira and her children live, witnesses and doctors told CNN. Amira, who was nine months pregnant, and three of her children were injured in the attack and taken to a nearby hospital, the witnesses said.

Sri Lanka's cricket team returned home to Colombo early Wednesday, as police in Pakistan searched for at least 12 gunmen believed responsible for the attack that left seven people dead. Sri Lankan player Thilan Samaraweera is taken aboard an ambulance Wednesday in Colombo. Police in Lahore on Wednesday confirmed six police officers and a driver of a van carrying umpires were killed after earlier reports had put the death toll at eight. Six team members were wounded by glass and shrapnel, and two -- Tharanga Paranavitana and Thilan Samaraweera -- were shot in the chest and leg, respectively. Both men were being treated in Colombo and in stable condition, officials said. \\"We are very lucky that no one [sustained] any serious injuries and everyone is in good shape,\\" one player told reporters upon arriving in the capital. \\"There are a few more guys who need more time to recover. And we can hopefully put this behind us and move forward.\\" The attack happened Tuesday at about 9 a.m. (11 p.m. ET Monday), as the visiting Sri Lankan team's bus approached Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium for a match against Pakistan.

Watch Sri Lankan's foreign minister condemnation of the attack ». Teams have long stayed away from Pakistan, concerned about the security situation in a country that is battling an escalating pro-Taliban insurgency. But Sri Lanka -- a country enduring its own civil war with separatist rebels -- agreed in December to visit for a series of matches, after the Indian cricket team called off its tour following the deadly terror attacks in Mumbai in November. Indian authorities blamed those attacks on Pakistan-based militants. The Pakistan Cricket Board had said it was set to lose more than 16 million as a result of India's cancellation, but the Sri Lanka visit was to help it recoup most of the costs, officials said. The Sri Lankan offer to tour was a reciprocal gesture. Pakistan was one of two countries that agreed to tour Sri Lanka during the 1996 World Cup tournament, while other countries refused to travel there because of security concerns. With this attack, fans now worry that Pakistan won't be able to co-host the 2011 Cricket World Cup with India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Morgan said the ICC's board will be meeting in April to consider whether the Cup will include stops in Pakistan. \\"The board will have to think very carefully about the extent to which Pakistan will be used for that event,\\" Morgan said. \\"It's a very important event, but the safety and security of players, officials and supporters is very important and the board will be taking that into account.\\" Read profiles of the wounded players ». \\"This has really damaged Pakistan,\\" former Pakistani cricket player Zahir Abbas told Geo-TV. \\"Already some teams didn't want to come to Pakistan.

He is tasked with the mission to assassinate the rebel leader. In order to infiltrate the rebel movement and get within striking distance of his target, he stirs up trouble in the local bar and gets arrested for disorderly conduct. He is put in the same cell as a captured resistance commander and gains his trust in facilitating the escape. Upon finally reaching the rebel encampment he is met with distrust by the rebels. During the night he attempts to assassinate his target but does not succeed when the distrustful rebels anticipate his actions. Disgraced and tortured by his commanding officers for failing his mission, he breaks out of the interrogation chamber and escapes to the desert, later to be found by native bushmen. He soon learns about them and their culture, and after receiving a ceremonial burn scar in the form of a scorpion (hence the title), he rejoins the freedom fighters and leads an attack against the Soviet camp after a previous attack on the peaceful bushmen. Nikolai obtains an AO-63 from the armory, confronts his corrupt officers and hunts down General Vortek, who attempts to escape in a Mil-24 Hind only to be shot down after takeoff.

He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer.

The growth rate of micro-organisms, including bacteria and molds, decreases as the temperature gets colder. Consequently, the cupcakes will be better preserved at a lower temperature, such as 0° F. In the freezing environment, the water content within the food will turn into ice, making it unavailable for microbial growth. It's essential to mention that freezing doesn't completely kill all micro-organisms, but it significantly decreases their metabolic activities and growth rate, which helps in preserving the food quality. It's also important to store the cupcakes in airtight packaging or containers before placing them in the freezer to prevent freezer burn, maintain their moisture content, and reduce the risk of any cross-contamination from other items in the freezer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Cambodian Deaths Tied to Common Child Illness (PHNOM PENH, Cambodia) — A deadly form of a common childhood illness has been linked to the mysterious deaths in Cambodia that caused alarm when a cause could not immediately be determined, health officials said Monday. Lab tests have confirmed that a virulent strain of hand, foot and mouth disease known as EV-71 is to blame for some of the 59 cases reviewed, including 52 deaths, according to a joint statement from the World Health Organization and Cambodian Health Ministry. The numbers were lowered from the initial report of 62 cases. EV-71 is a virus that can result in paralysis, brain swelling and death. Most of the Cambodian cases involved children younger than 3 who experienced fever, respiratory problems that quickly progressed and sometimes neurological symptoms. Epidemiologists are still trying to piece together information about the cases by interviewing parents because some details were omitted or missing from medical charts and specimens were not taken from most children before they died, said Dr. Nima Asgari, who is leading the investigation at WHO. Of 24 samples tested, 15 came back positive for EV-71. (PHOTOS: Displaced: The Cambodian Diaspora) “As far as I’m aware, EV-71 was not identified as a virus in Cambodia before,” Asgari said, adding that based on the information now available it’s likely that the majority of patients were infected with it. “We are a bit more confident. We are hoping that we can come up with something a bit more conclusive in the next day or so,” he said. Hand, foot and mouth disease has been raging across Asia and usually causes a telltale rash. Rashes were only reported in some of the Cambodian cases, and it’s possible that steroids administered by doctors could have masked that symptom or that it wasn’t recorded, he said. The lab results also identified other diseases in some cases, including mosquito-borne dengue fever and Streptococcus suis, a germ commonly seen in pigs that sometimes infects people, often causing meningitis and hearing loss. Hand, foot and mouth disease is spread by sneezing, coughing and contact with fluid from blisters or infected feces. It is caused by a group of enteroviruses in the same family as polio. No vaccine or specific treatment exists, but illness is typically mild and most children recover quickly without problems. The virus gets its name from the symptoms it causes, including rash, mouth sores and blisters covering the hands and feet. Many infected children don’t get sick but can spread it to others. Neighboring Vietnam has been battling a surging number of hand, foot and mouth disease cases for the past few years, with EV-71 also wreaking havoc there. Last year, the disease sickened more than 110,000 people in Vietnam and killed 166, mostly children whose immune systems were not strong enough to fend off the infection. China is also experiencing an outbreak, and more than 240 people have died of the disease there this year, according to China’s health ministry. The Cambodia investigation is continuing, but the H5N1 bird flu virus, SARS and Nipah — a deadly virus usually spread by fruit bats or pigs _ have all been ruled out.

He was the second son of the first Han emperor, Han Gaozu and Empress Dowager Lü. He is generally remembered as a weak character dominated by his mother, Empress Dowager Lü, personally kind and generous but unable to escape the impact of her viciousness. He tried to protect Ruyi, Prince Yin of Zhao, his younger half-brother, from being murdered by Empress Dowager Lü, but failed. After that he indulged himself in drinking and women and died at a relatively young age. Empress Dowager Lü installed two of his sons, Liu Gong and Liu Hong (known collectively as Emperors Shao of Han), the sons of the Emperor's concubine(s) after he died without a designated heir. Emperor Hui's wife was Empress Zhang Yan, a niece of his by his sister Princess Yuan of Lu; their marriage was the result of insistence by Empress Dowager Lü and was a childless one. - Lü Zhi (241180 BC), courtesy name Exu, commonly known as Empress Lü and Empress Dowager Lü, or formally Empress Gao of Han, was the empress consort of Emperor Gaozu, the founder and first ruler of the Han Dynasty. They had two known children, Liu Ying (later Emperor Hui of Han) and Princess Yuan of Lu. Lü Zhi was the first woman to assume the title Empress of China. After Emperor Gaozu's death, she was honoured as Empress Dowager and later as Grand Empress Dowager () during the short reigns of Emperor Hui and his successors Liu Gong (Emperor Qianshao) and Liu Hong (Emperor Houshao). - Liu Ruyi ( simplified Chinese : ; traditional Chinese : ; pinyin : Li Rúyì , 208 BC -- 194 BC ) , also known as Prince Yin of Zhao ( , created 198 BC ) was the third son of Emperor Gao of Han and only son of Concubine Qi . In 200 BC , he was made Prince of Dai after Liu Xi was demoted for fleeing his Dai province from Xiongnu forces . In 198 BC , Ruyi replaced Zhang Ao as Prince of Zhao after Ao was falsely accused of conspiring rebellion . After Emperor Gao of Han fallen ill early in 195 BC , he discovered Empress Lü Zhi 's plot to kill Ruyi , and appointed Zhou Chang as prime minister for Zhao province to protect him from Lü . Emperor Gao died later the year and Emperor Hui of Han continued Prince of Zhao 's protection by halting multiple attempts from Empress Dowager Lü on Ruyi 's life .

Answer based on context: China, during the Qing Dynasty, ceded the island of Taiwan, including Penghu, to Japan \\"in perpetuity\\" at the end of the First Sino-Japanese War by signing the Treaty of Shimonoseki. In the Cairo Conference of 1943, the allied powers agreed to have Japan restore \\"all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese\\", specifically listing \\"Formosa\\" and Penghu, to the Republic of China after the defeat of Japan. According to both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, this agreement was given legal force by the Instrument of Surrender of Japan in 1945. The PRC's UN Ambassador, Wang Yingfan , has stated multiple times in the UN general committee: \\"Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory since antiquity\\" and \\"both the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Potsdam Declaration have reaffirmed in unequivocal terms China's sovereignty over Taiwan as a matter of international law.\\" The PRC rejects arguments involving the lack of a specific treaty transferring Taiwan's sovereignty to China by noting that neither PRC nor ROC was a signatory to any such treaty, making the treaties irrelevant with regard to Chinese claims. The ROC argues that the Treaty of Taipei implicitly transferred sovereignty of Taiwan to it, however the US State Dept. disagreed with such an interpretation in its 1971 Starr Memorandum What event happened first, Cairo Declaration or Potsdam Declaration?","completion":"The Cairo Declaration happened first.

Daniels and Aule find the staff confrontational; Dr. John Cawley, the lead psychiatrist, refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solando's doctor, Dr. Lester Sheehan, left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. Though they are given access to the hospital, they are told Ward C is off limits, while the lighthouse has already been searched. Whilst being interviewed, one patient secretly writes the word \\"RUN\\" in Daniels' notepad. Daniels starts to have migraine headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and experiences waking visions of his involvement in the Dachau liberation reprisals. He has disturbing dreams of his wife, Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by Andrew Laeddis, a local arsonist.

Instructions: This task is about creating an unanswerable question based on a given passage. Construct a question that looks relevant to the given context but is unanswerable. Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions: (i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage (ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer (iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question (iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Input: Passage: All Latin characters required by Pe̍h-ōe-jī can be represented using Unicode (or the corresponding ISO/IEC 10646: Universal Character Set), using precomposed or combining (diacritics) characters. Prior to June 2004, the vowel akin to but more open than o, written with a dot above right, was not encoded. The usual workaround was to use the (stand-alone; spacing) character Interpunct (U+00B7, ·) or less commonly the combining character dot above (U+0307). As these are far from ideal, since 1997 proposals have been submitted to the ISO/IEC working group in charge of ISO/IEC 10646—namely, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2—to encode a new combining character dot above right. This is now officially assigned to U+0358 (see documents N1593, N2507, N2628, N2699, and N2713). Font support is expected to follow. Output:","completion":"Part #1: Create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage. Usage: What is the percentage of documents written in Pe̍h-ōe-jī that use the combining character dot above right (U+0358) instead of interpunct (U+00B7)? This question meets the criteria because the passage does not provide any information about the percentage of documents using the different characters, thus making it unanswerable. Part #2: Create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer. Usage: Who are the key contributors to the development of the Pe̍h-ōe-jī writing system? This question is unanswerable from the given passage because there is no mention of the individuals who contributed to the development of the writing system. Part #3: Replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with another entity, number, date, and use it in the question. Usage: Prior to January 2000, was the vowel akin to but more open than o, written with a dot above right, encoded in Unicode? This question meets the criteria because it replaces the original date (June 2004) with a different date (January 2000), making the question unanswerable based on the provided passage. Part #4: Create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Usage: Did the ISO/IEC working group reject the proposals to encode a new combining character dot above right since 1997? This question meets the criteria because it inserts a negation word (\\"reject\\") in place of the correct action (accepting the proposals), making the question unanswerable from the passage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In most of the languages , people usually begin their conversations by a kind of small talk -a casual form of conversation that \\"breaks the ice\\" or fills an awkward silence between people . That is to say , small talk means the little things we talk about to start a conversation . In English-speaking countries such as Britain, people often make small talk about the weather. \\" Nice day, isn't it?\\" \\"Terrible weather , isn't it?\\" However, we still have something special about small talk. It must be about something which both people have the same opinion about. The purpose of small talk is to let both people agree on something. This makes meeting people easier and more comfortable . People usually agree about the weather, so it is a safe topic for small talk. But people often disagree about religion or politics so these are not suitable topics for small talk.

Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

A cancer is the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, and feeling tired all the time. Most colorectal cancers are due to old age and lifestyle factors with only a small number of cases due to underlying genetic disorders. Some risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red and processed meat as well as alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous. Bowel cancer may be diagnosed by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This is then followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread. Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer. Screening is recommended starting from the age of 50 to 75. During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found. If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk. Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects. Treatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely are usually not curable, with management being directed... - Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, and family history. About 510% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. In addition, there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments it may respond to. The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review stated that it is unclear if mammographic screening does more good or harm. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years old. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with... - Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over , with the range defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental illness. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be taken, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or bowel length, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2014, 600 million adults (13%) and 42 million children under the age of five were obese. Obesity is more common in women than men. Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of... - The Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation ( Meso Foundation , formerly MARF ) is a non-profit organization that funds mesothelioma research , provides services to patients , educates the public , and advocates in Washington , DC for governmental funding for mesothelioma research . The organization 's mission is to eradicate mesothelioma , a cancer caused by exposure to asbestos , as a life - ending disease . Its donors include lawyers , companies that have manufactured asbestos products and victims , along with their family and friends . To date , the foundation has funded over 8.2 million in clinical research and is the host of the annual International Symposium on Malignant Mesothelioma . - Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains. The vast majority (85%) of cases of lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 1015% of cases occur in people who have never smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance. Prevention is by avoiding risk factors including smoking and air pollution. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths. This makes it the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and second most common in women after breast cancer. The most common age at diagnosis is 70 years. Overall, 17.4% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis, while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world. Signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms which may suggest lung cancer include: - Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is cancer developing from the lining of the stomach. Early symptoms may include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea and loss of appetite. Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and blood in the stool among others. The cancer may spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, particularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen and lymph nodes. The most common cause is infection by the bacterium \\"Helicobacter pylori\\", which accounts for more than 60% of cases. Certain types of \\"H. pylori\\" have greater risks than others. Other common causes include eating pickled vegetables and smoking. About 10% of cases run in families and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited from a person's parents such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas. This type can be divided into a number of subtypes. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach. Most of the time, stomach cancer develops in stages over years. Diagnosis is usually by biopsy done during endoscopy. This is followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. Japan and South Korea, two countries that have high rates of the disease, screen for stomach cancer. A Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of cancer as does the stopping of smoking. There is tentative evidence that treating \\"H. pylori\\" decreases the future risk. If cancer is treated early, many cases can be cured. Treatments may include some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. If treated late, palliative care may be advised. Outcomes are often poor with a less than 10% 5-year survival rate globally. This is largely because most people with the condition present with advanced disease. In the United States 5-year survival is 28% while in South Korea it is over 65% partly due to... - Silic (19952013) is a French Thoroughbred racehorse who competed both in France and in the United States. His most notable win came in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Mile. - A brain tumor or intracranial neoplasm occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant or cancerous tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors that start within the brain, and secondary tumors that have spread from somewhere else, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problem with vision, vomiting, and mental changes. The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. More specific problems may include difficulty in walking, speaking, and with sensation. As the disease progresses unconsciousness may occur. The cause of most brain tumors is unknown. Uncommon risk factors include inherited neurofibromatosis, exposure to vinyl chloride, EpsteinBarr virus, and ionizing radiation. The evidence for mobile phones is not clear. The most common types of primary tumors in adults are meningiomas (usually benign), and astrocytomas such as glioblastomas. In children, the most common type is a malignant medulloblastoma. Diagnosis is usually by medical examination along with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This is then often confirmed by a biopsy. Based on the findings, the tumors are divided into different grades of severity. Treatment may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Anticonvulsant medication may be needed if seizures occur. Dexamethasone and furosemide may be used to decrease swelling around the tumor. Some tumors grow gradually, requiring only monitoring and possibly needing no further intervention. Treatments that use a person's immune system are being studied. Outcome varies considerably depending on the type of tumor and how far it has spread at diagnosis. Glioblastomas usually have poor outcomes while meningiomas usually have good outcomes. The average five-year survival rate for brain cancer in the... - Asbestos is a set of six naturally occurring silicate minerals, which all have in common their eponymous asbestiform habit: long (roughly 1:20 aspect ratio), thin fibrous crystals, with each visible fiber composed of millions of microscopic \\"fibrils\\" that can be released by abrasion and other processes. They are commonly known by their colors, as \\"blue asbestos\\", \\"brown asbestos\\", \\"white asbestos\\", and \\"green asbestos\\". - Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. In women they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back. Sometimes they develop from a mole with concerning changes including an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown. The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of skin pigment. The UV light may be from either the sun or from other sources, such as tanning devices. About 25% develop from moles. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and who have poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic defects such as xeroderma pigmentosum also increase risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy of any concerning skin lesion. Using sunscreen and avoiding UV light may prevent melanoma. Treatment is typically removal by surgery. In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby lymph nodes may be tested for spread. Most people are cured if spread has not occurred. For those in whom melanoma has spread, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may improve survival. With treatment the five-year survival rates in the United States is 98% among those with localized disease and 17% among those in whom spread has occurred. The likelihood that it will come back or spread depends how thick the melanoma is, how fast the cells are dividing, and whether or not the overlying skin has broken down. Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Globally, in 2012, it occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths. Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. There are also high rates in Northern Europe and North America, while it is less common in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Melanoma is more common in men than women. Melanoma has become more... - The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 1533 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells. - Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) which affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease. The virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common. In areas where the disease is rare, intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection. Other risk factors include working in healthcare, blood transfusions, dialysis, living with an infected person, travel in countries where the infection rate is high, and living in an institution. Tattooing and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s; however, this has become less common with improved sterility. The viruses cannot be spread by holding hands, sharing eating utensils, kissing, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding. The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. The infection has been preventable by vaccination since 1982. Vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization in the first day of life if... - Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The most common area affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding the testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly. Greater than 80% of mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos. The greater the exposure the greater the risk. As of 2013 about 125 million people have been exposed to asbestos at work. High rates of disease occur in people who mine asbestos, produce products from asbestos, work with asbestos products, live with asbestos workers, or work in buildings containing asbestos. Often it is around 40 years between exposure and the cancer starting. Washing the clothing of someone who worked with asbestos also increases the risk. Other risk factors include genetics and infection with the simian virus 40. The diagnosis may be suspected based on chest X-ray and CT scan findings, and is confirmed by either examining fluid produced by the cancer or by a tissue biopsy of the cancer. Prevention centers around reducing exposure to asbestos. Treatment often includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A procedure known as pleurodesis, which involves using substances such as talc to scar together the pleura, may be used to prevent more fluid from building up around the lungs. Chemotherapy often includes the medications cisplatin and pemetrexed. The percentage of people that survive five years following diagnosis is on average 8% in the United States. In 2013 about 50,000 people had mesothelioma and 34,000 died from the disease. Rates of mesothelioma vary in different areas of the world. Rates are higher in Australia, the United Kingdom, and lower in... - Palliative care is a multidisciplinary approach to specialized medical care for people with life-limiting illnesses. It focuses on providing people with relief from the symptoms, pain, physical stress, and mental stress of the terminal diagnosis. The goal of such therapy is to improve quality of life for both the person and their family. Evidence as of 2016 supports improvement in quality of life. - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphoma except Hodgkin's lymphomas. Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and feeling tired. Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness. Some forms are slow growing while others are fast growing. Lymphomas are types of cancer that develops from lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Risk factors include poor immune function, autoimmune diseases, \\"Helicobacter pylori\\" infection, hepatitis C, obesity, and \\"Epstein-Barr virus\\" infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies lymphomas into five major groups, including one for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Within the four groups for NHL there are over 60 specific types of lymphoma. Diagnosis is by examination of a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy. Medical imaging is done to help with cancer staging. Treatment depends on if the lymphoma is slow or fast growing and if it is in one area or many areas. Treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, stem cell transplantation, surgery, or watchful waiting. If the blood becomes overly thick due to antibodies, plasmapheresis may be used. Radiation and some chemotherapy, however, increase the risk of other cancers, heart disease or nerve problems over the subsequent decades. In 2013 about 2.96 million people had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 226,000 died. In the United States 2.1% of people are affected at some point in their life. The most common age of diagnosis is between 65 to 75 years old. The percentage of people who survive five years in the United States is 71%. - Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans. Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity and drinking alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 510% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy. Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat, and avoiding too much sunlight exposure. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. In children under 15 at... - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin. They are due to the development of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma. The first two together along with a number of less common skin cancers are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, that may be shiny with small blood vessel running over it or may present as a raised area with an ulcer. Squamous-cell cancer is more likely to spread. It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but may also form an ulcer. Melanomas are the most aggressive. Signs include a mole that has changed in size, shape, color, has irregular edges, has more than one color, is itchy or bleeds. Greater than 90% of cases are caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. This exposure increases the risk of all three main types of skin cancer. Exposure has increased partly due to a thinner ozone layer. Tanning beds are becoming another common source of ultraviolet radiation. For melanomas and basal-cell cancers exposure during childhood is particularly harmful. For squamous-cell cancers total exposure, irrespective of when it occurs, is more important. Between 20% and 30% of melanomas develop from moles. People with light skin are at higher risk as are those with poor immune function such as from medications or HIV/AIDS. Diagnosis is by biopsy. Decreasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the use of sunscreen appear to be effective methods of preventing melanoma and squamous-cell cancer. It is not clear if sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is usually curable. Treatment is generally by surgical removal but may less commonly involve radiation therapy or topical medications such as... - Ionizing radiation (ionising radiation) is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum. - Lymphoma is a group of blood cell tumors that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The name often refers to just the cancerous ones rather than all such tumors. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night. There are dozens of subtypes of lymphomas. The two main categories of lymphomas are Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL) and the non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The World Health Organization (WHO) includes two other categories as types of lymphoma: multiple myeloma and immunoproliferative diseases. About 90% of lymphomas are non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Lymphomas and leukemias are a part of the broader group of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Risk factors for Hodgkin lymphoma include infection with EpsteinBarr virus and a history of the disease in the family. Risk factors for common types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas include autoimmune diseases, HIV/AIDS, infection with human T-lymphotropic virus, immunosuppressant medications, and some pesticides. Eating large amounts of red meat and tobacco smoking may also increase the risk. Diagnosis, if enlarged lymph nodes are present, is usually by lymph node biopsy. Blood, urine, and bone marrow testing may also be useful in the diagnosis. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if and where the cancer has spread. Lymphoma most often spreads to the lungs, liver, and/or brain. Treatment may involve one or more of the following: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and surgery. In some non-Hodgkin lymphomas, an increased amount of protein produced by the lymphoma cells causes the blood to become so thick that plasmapheresis is performed to remove the protein. Watchful waiting may be appropriate for certain types. The outcome depends on the subtype with some being curable and treatment prolonging survival in most. The five-year survival rate in the United States... - Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or esophageal and gastric varices. HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its RNA. Testing is recommended in all people who are at risk. There is no vaccine against hepatitis C. Prevention includes harm reduction efforts among people who use intravenous drugs and testing donated blood. Chronic infection can be cured about 90% of the time with treatments that include the medications sofosbuvir or simeprevir. Previous to this a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin was used which had a cure rate around 50% and greater side effects. Getting access to the newer treatments however can be expensive. Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant. Hepatitis C is the leading reason for liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after transplantation. An estimated 130200 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C. In 2013 about 11 million new cases occurred. It occurs most commonly in Africa and Central and East Asia. About... - Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection appears to be involved in the development of more than 90% of cases; most people who have had HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Cervical cancer typically develops from precancerous changes over 10 to 20 years. About 90% of cervical cancer cases are squamous cell carcinomas, 10% are adenocarcinoma, and a small number are other types. Diagnosis is typically by cervical screening followed by a biopsy. Medical imaging is then done to determine whether or not the cancer has spread. HPV vaccines protect against between two and seven high-risk strains of this family of viruses and may prevent up to 90% of cervical cancers. As a risk of cancer still exists, guidelines recommend continuing regular Pap smears. Other methods of prevention include: having few or no sexual partners and the use of condoms. Cervical cancer screening using the Pap smear or acetic acid can identify precancerous changes which when treated can prevent the development of cancer. Treatment of cervical cancer may consist of some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Five year survival rates in the United States are 68%. Outcomes, however, depend very much on how early the cancer is detected. Worldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. In 2012, an estimated 528,000 cases of cervical cancer occurred, with 266,000... - Prostate cancer, also known as carcinoma of the prostate, is the development of cancer in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Most prostate cancers are slow growing; however, some grow relatively quickly. The cancer cells may spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes. It may initially cause no symptoms. In later stages it can lead to difficulty urinating, blood in the urine, or pain in the pelvis, back or when urinating. A disease known as benign prostatic hyperplasia may produce similar symptoms. Other late symptoms may include feeling tired due to low levels of red blood cells. Factors that increase the risk of prostate cancer include: older age, a family history of the disease, and race. About 99% of cases occur in those over the age of 50. Having a first-degree relative with the disease increases the risk two to threefold. In the United States it is more common in the African American population than the white American population. Other factors that may be involved include a diet high in processed meat, red meat, or milk products or low in certain vegetables. An association with gonorrhea has been found, but a reason for this relationship has not been identified. Prostate cancer is diagnosed by biopsy. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Prostate cancer screening is controversial. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection but does not decrease mortality. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening using the PSA test, due to the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, as most cancer diagnosed would remain asymptomatic. The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefits of testing do not outweigh the expected harms. While 5-reductase inhibitors appear to decrease low-grade cancer risk they do not affect high-grade cancer risk and thus are not recommended for prevention. Supplementation with vitamins or minerals does not... Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'inception' with '1999'.

Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes. These structures let them see Earths magnetic field as a visual pattern.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What three words describe Ron?, using the article: BookWars is a creative documentary which is told in an unconventional, narrative style. The film opens with the narrator (who is also the film's director) driving out West along a desert highway, relating to the audience his previous experiences as a streetside bookseller in New York City. The entire documentary – including the central events involving his experiences among the street booksellers in New York – is thus \\"told\\" as a long conversation. The narrator describes his post-graduation years in New York, and how he ended up at one point virtually penniless. Driven by a desperate need to pay the rent, he resorts to wheeling his own books out to the street to try to sell them. He reveals that he was not only successful in making a significant amount of cash on that first day, but he has also met a variety of interesting and strange characters of the streets of New York – including other street booksellers. A motley assortment of street booksellers on West 4th street, in Greenwich Village, New York City, are first introduced. Among them: \\"Slick\\" Rick Sherman, a semi-professional magician; Al Mappo, so named because he only sells maps and atlases; Emil, who says only he \\"escaped\\", though we do not know from where; and Pete Whitney: King of the booksellers, toad collector, and collage artist. BookWars next introduces another group of street booksellers who hawk their trade on nearby 6th Avenue. Mainly black and minority individuals, they ply books and magazines in parallel fashion to the nearby West 4th street booksellers, who are primarily white. The booksellers on 6th Avenue suffer greater exposure to the law, with many claiming this to be due to racial profiling. Some of the significant personalities that are introduced on 6th Avenue include: Marvin, always wearing his trademark black hat; and Ron, from Jamaica – charismatic, streetwise and outspoken., what would be the answer ?

It was almost as if David Moyes had borrowed some of the magic of the FA Cup on Sunday night at Anoeta as his Real Sociedad played at being giant-killers and took the scalp of Barcelona. On one of the greatest nights of his managerial career Moyes masterminded a 1-0 win with the side he took over last November seeing off Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar in style. He was given a helping hand by opposing coach Luis Enrique who bizarrely left Messi out of his starting line-up – perhaps the Barca coach was also paying homage to the world’s oldest club cup competition by resting his most important players. OPTIONS: - Anoeta almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - Anoeta Stadium almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - Atletico Madrid almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - Barca almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - Barcelona almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - David Moyes almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - FA Cup almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - Gerard Pique almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - Jordi Alba almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - La Liga almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - Lionel Messi almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - Luis Enrique almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - Luis Suarez almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - Messi almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - Moyes almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - Neymar almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - Real Madrid almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - Real Sociedad almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead. - Valencia almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead.","completion":"- Real Sociedad almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead.

And I marvelled more to see the two of us, both lovers of one lady and eager rivals, burying for the nonce our feuds, and with the same hope serving the same cause. We slept the night at Aird's store, and early the next morning found Ringan. A new Ringan indeed, as unlike the buccaneer I knew as he was unlike the Quaker. He was now the gentleman of Breadalbane, dressed for the part with all the care of an exquisite. He rode a noble roan, in his Spanish belt were stuck silver-hafted pistols, and a long sword swung at his side. When I presented Grey to him, he became at once the cavalier, as precise in his speech and polite in his deportment as any Whitehall courtier. They talked high and disposedly of genteel matters, and you would have thought that that red-haired pirate had lived his life among proud lords and high-heeled ladies.

African football's ruling body, the Confederation of African Football, has called for a thorough investigation into how 15 fans died at a league match in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The fatalities occurred after a stampede broke out in the closing stages of Sunday's decisive meeting between the country's biggest clubs, AS Vita Club and TP Mazembe. Reports state that trouble flared after fans of home side Vita started throwing missiles onto the pitch with their team trailing 1-0 in a game where the victor would take the title. The police responded by firing tear gas whereupon a stampede for the exit gates led to chaotic scenes of overcrowding, resulting in the deaths and injuries to over 20 others. On its website, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) said the stampede 'caused the collapse of a wall and a gate of the Tata Raphael stadium'. The match was taking place in the Congolese capital Kinshasa, at the stadium that staged the legendary 'Rumble in the Jungle' boxing bout between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in 1974. \\"I wish to reemphasize that any acts of violence have no place in football,\\" CAF President Issa Hayatou told cafonline.com. \\"They must be condemned in the strongest possible terms and I urge FECOFA (the Congolese FA) and authorities in DR Congo to thoroughly investigate this matter and ensure that measures (are) put in place to avoid a repeat of any incidents.\\" The long-serving Cameroonian also demanded that CAF be kept abreast of any proposed security measures. Kinshasa governor Andre Kimbuta has already set up a commission of inquiry to investigate the disaster. \\"On behalf of FIFA and in my own name, I offer you, and the Congolese FA, my sincerest condolences,\\" wrote FIFA President Sepp Blatter in a letter to the President of FECOFA. \\"I would be most grateful if you would pass on the deep sympathy and support of the entire international football community to the families, loved ones and clubs of the deceased and victims at this very difficult time.\\" \\"May this message soften their pain and bring them support and comfort.\\" At FIFA's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich, the flags of both DR Congo and CAF were flown at half-mast in a sign of mourning. The disaster is the worst at a Congolese football match since a game in Butembo in 2008, when 13 spectators -- many of whom were children -- died after police fired tear gas into the crowd shortly after stones had been thrown by the fans. Six years on, a similar set of circumstances has sparked a further devastating loss of life. The two teams are set to meet again on the weekend of May 24-25 in the group stages of the African Champions League. CAF is considering whether to play the match between AS Vita, crowned African champions in the 1970s, and four-time continental winners Mazembe behind closed doors. Mazembe stunned the footballing world in 2010 when becoming the first African side to reach the final of FIFA's Club World Cup, but their name may now conjure up far sadder emotions.

Unfortunately, because the zooming is rather fast, it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence, so as you correctly note, some viewers got an incorrect impression. It would have been fair for Moore to point out this possible misinterpretation on his website. However, the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons: a) Moore clearly states that \\"before he came to Flint\\", Heston gave an interview. In the excerpt from said interview, we can see that it is from March. If Moore wanted to deceive his viewers, why would he say this, and show the month the interview was published? b) Why should Moore leave the words \\"Clinton is on the Today Show\\" visible in the text, which is necessary to correctly interpret the highlighted part? I reviewed the sequence several times and it is perfectly possible to see this text without pausing. c) Both the \\"soccer mom\\" interview and the sequences showing the NRA rally make no effort to distort the fact that this rally happened months after the fact. The camera lingers on Bush/Cheney posters, and the protestor is quoted as saying that \\"we wanted to let the NRA know that we haven't forgotten about Kayla Rolland\\". You make the hysterical claim that the interview \\"may be faked\\" (on the basis that no name is shown for the interviewee), but if Moore had faked it, why the hell should he put this sentence in the protestor's mouth, which directly contradicts the conclusion that the rally happened hours after Kayla's death? Why did Moore, the masterful deveiver, not edit this sequence out? This makes no sense. Opinions may vary on how tasteless it was for Heston to hold a pro gun rally on the location of the nation's youngest school shooting months after the fact, but this sequence of \\"Bowling\\" is without doubt the most unfair to Heston. The claims of deliberate distortion don't hold up when viewing the whole scene, though -- as \\"Hanlon's Razor\\" states, one should never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence. The somewhat inept editing of the NRA press release has led some viewers to wrong conclusions, which is unfortunate, but Moore's critics have no interest in viewing the matter fairly. Had they done so, Moore himself would probably have apologized for the gaffe. In any case, at no point does Moore make a false statement, in contradiction to claims by critics that his documentary is \\"full of lies\\".

Adam Farooqui holds a sign as he stands at Zuccotti Park on Wednesday in New York. \\"We need to have a symbolic presence,\\" said Ned Merrill, 52, a blanket draped over his shoulder. He spoke as workers for Brookfield Office Properties, which owns the plaza, maneuvered around the scattered protesters with steam cleaners. The barricades that came down Tuesday were chained together and neatly stacked at the north end of the park. On Tuesday, about 300 protesters filled Zuccotti after the barricades were taken down. Police spokesman Paul Browne said the New York Police Department and Brookfield had been talking about removing the barriers last week. The decision was made to remove them Tuesday because officials felt they were no longer necessary, Browne said. Merrill said it's important for at least a few protesters to be at Zuccotti at all times. He said he's been there from midnight to about 10 a.m. most nights since Dec. 1. \\"Most people in American know that something is wrong,\\" he said. \\"Much of what is wrong is that money owns the political process.\\" Robert Segal, who is 47 and works in a wine store, also spent Tuesday night at Zuccotti. \\"The rest of the world want a place where they can come down and join Occupy Wall Street at critical moments,\\" he said. Tents and sleeping bags have been banned from Zuccotti Park since a Nov. 15 police raid evicted protesters who had been sleeping there since Sept. 17. Merrill said security guards have prevented him from sitting on a piece of plastic foam when he spends the night there. They told him it was considered bedding, he said. On Monday, civil rights groups filed a complaint with the city's buildings department saying the barricades were a violation of city zoning law.

In Sonora, Mexico, former soldier and turned-outlaw Colt Macready rescues his niece, Hailey, who was kidnapped by drug cartel leader Fernando \\"El Jefe\\" Garcia. After that, Colt retrieves a flash drive and they head home to Santa Cruz County, Arizona. Corrupt sheriff Jasper Calloway, who works for Garcia, receives a call from him orders Jasper to detain Colt and Angela's husband, Walt Reynolds, for stealing money from Garcia and he also saying that Colt killed his men. Garcia and his men embark to track Colt down. At home, when the sheriffs arrive on their residence, Colt quickly hides in the bankhouse. Jasper then detains Walt and asks Colt's sister Angela for Colt's whereabouts. Walt says out-loud that Colt is hiding in the bankhouse, but Colt escapes with the car and the sheriffs chase him. Garcia and his men eventually arrives at their residence. Upon arriving, Garcia shoots Walt in the head after he apologizes on him for what he done. Garcia then have his men, Reina and Cruz, to search Colt for the drive. Garcia's men held Angela and her daughter Hailey hostage inside their house. Meanwhile, the sheriffs catch Colt but are killed by Reina and Cruz. After the gunfight, Colt manages to kill them both. Shortly, he is intercepted by another men, Lobo and Aguillar. He manages to kill Aguillar and he asks Lobo about the content of the drive which is bank accounts before Colt kills him and races back to the residence.

Please answer the following question: If some flowers use stems to store water, then what do some flowers use to store most of their water? Answer choices: - fibrous - lipids - roots - sodium - keratin - solutes - fibers - stems A:","completion":"Some flowers use their roots to store most of their water. In many plant species, roots play a crucial role in not only the absorption of water from the surrounding soil but also in the storage of water (and nutrients) to help the plant survive during spells of drought or unfavorable conditions. Different species of plants have evolved diverse root systems to cater to their specific needs, and some plants are adapted to store more significant portions of water in their roots. While stems are the primary water storage structure in some plants (such as cacti), roots serve as the primary water storage system in many other species of flowers and plants. The roots of these plants have evolved to have specialized structures that allow them to efficiently take in and store water from the surrounding environment. Some plants have tuberous roots, which are modified, swollen underground roots, for this purpose. A well-known example of a plant with a tuberous root adapted for water storage is the dahlia. In addition, many desert plants, such as the mesquite tree, have developed deep roots to access water stored far beneath the ground surface. In contrast, other answer choices do not refer to structures that are primarily involved in water storage: - Fibrous roots refer to a root system that consists of many branches and does not include a primary taproot. While fibrous roots do absorb water, they are not specialized structures for water storage. - Lipids, sodium, keratin, and solutes are not structures within a plant but rather molecules or compounds. Lipids are fats and waxes mainly responsible for energy storage, while sodium and solutes are elements often found dissolved in a plant's internal fluids. Keratin is a protein found in hair, nails, and the outer layer of human skin, and not found in plants. - Fibers are a type of tissue found in the cell walls of plants, often in the form of lignin and cellulose, which help provide structural support. Fibers also do not function primarily in water storage. - Stems are already mentioned in the question; some flowers use stems for water storage, but the question asks for another structure involved in water storage for other flowers. In conclusion, among the given answer choices, roots are the primary structure that some flowers utilize to store most of their water, providing essential support and resources for their growth and survival during periods of water scarcity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If you're just starting out with the instrument, there's no need to spend an excessive amount of money on a violin, but like most instruments, the quality of the violin generally rises as the price goes up. Expect to spend a few hundred dollars on a decent beginner's violin. Buy full size or 4/4, if you're an adult. The violin is a small instrument, but there are specially designed smaller sizes available. These are generally only intended for younger children, so be sure the violin you're buying is full size unless you're very small. You can ask the shop for a recommendation if you aren't sure. You can also ask the shop to measure your arm length to see what size violin you need. When holding the violin in the playing position, straighten your left arm and the tops of your fingertips should be near the top the violin scroll. If your arm is way past the top, the violin is too small. Buy from a reputable seller. Music stores stake their reputations on selling solid instruments that are free of obvious flaws and damage. As a beginner, you won't be able to coax a very pleasant sound from your instrument for some time, so flaws in privately sold violins might not be apparent to you until it is far too late to complain. Only buy from a store or individual you can trust. Unless you have purchased the instrument only, your violin outfit should come with a violin with four strings, a bow, and a carrying case and most of the time a chin rest and rosin for your bow. In most cases, the person who sells you the violin will be happy to string it for you, which has the added bonus of double-checking to be sure the tuning pegs (the knobs at the scroll, or top, of the violin) are properly fit to the scroll. A hard case is important because violins are such delicate instruments. Strings come in three basic varieties: gut, which is expensive and difficult to take care of, but which offers a complex range of sound; steel, which is loud and bright but can sound scratchy, and synthetic, which is smooth, clear, and not as unpredictable as gut. Each type's name refers to the core material around which metal wire is wrapped to create the string. Most beginners should go with synthetic core strings, such as nylon core. The bow should be new, or newly re-haired. You can check this by looking at the hair of the bow (the fine, white or off-white fibers) and ensuring that the color is uniform and bright along its entire length. The hair of the bow should be a uniform width from end to end. Bows wear down over time. You can get your bow re-haired for a small fee at most music shops. Nearly all violinists use a chin rest, which is a cheap, ergonomic piece of (usually black) plastic that clamps near the base of the violin and allows it to be held securely by your chin. This is usually attached to the violin when the violin is built. Aside from that, be sure you have some rosin (coagulated sap) for your bow, a music stand, and a book of beginner lessons or songs, preferably in a format that will open flat. Some violinists, especially beginners, also purchase a shoulder rest, which is a violin-width pad that sits on your shoulder underneath the violin and makes it easier to hold. Many people start with a shoulder rest and eventually remove it after a few years. If the violin seems to dig into your shoulder when you play, consider purchasing one. Fiddlers, if they sing while performing, often hold the violin in the crook of an arm while playing, with the butt resting against their shoulder. For them, chin rests and shoulder rests are generally pointless. A tuner is a small device that clips on to the scroll or the pegs of the violin. It is useful for beginners if you are teaching yourself, as it can be used to make sure you are playing the notes correctly. But once you know how to play the notes, the tuner isn't of much use anymore except for tuning the instrument itself. Be sure to take it off before big performances though, as it looks unprofessional. Summary:","completion":"When starting out with the violin, you can expect to spend a few hundred dollars on a decent beginner's instrument.

An adorable 3-year-old girl who suffered a heart attack during a dentist visit likely died because she was given the maximum dose of sedative drugs, according to an autopsy report. Finley Puleo Boyle, of Kailua in Honolulu, Hawaii, probably died because of the sedatives and local anesthesia that were administered during her December dental procedure, Honolulu Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Christopher Happy concluded in his autopsy report. He classified the death as an accident. The girl lapsed into a coma on December 3 in the office of Dr. Lilly Geyer at Island Dentistry for Children. She died on January 3. The office has since closed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Finley Boyle, 3, died after being given sedatives during a standard dental procedure. Finley Boyle's devastated mother Ashley (right) took the little girl to the Island Dentistry for Children in Oahu, Hawaii on December 3. The autopsy report said the previously healthy girl had no signs of underlying heart problems or an allergic reaction to the array of sedatives and anesthetic she received in preparation for cavity fillings and root canals, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Friday. The medical examiner noted her teeth were in good shape: 'the oral cavity has native dentition in good repair.' Finley received five drugs, according to the report, including Demerol, hydroxyzine and chlorohydrate. She was also given laughing gas and an injection of a local anesthetic, lidocaine with epinephrine. 'Immediately following the lidocaine injection, the decedent became unresponsive and went into cardiopulmonary arrest,' Happy said in his report. The girl lapsed into a coma on December 3 in the office of Dr. Lilly Geyer (center) at Island Dentistry for Children. The girl's mother Ashley Boyle (pictured) is traumatized by her daughter's death and has filed a negligence lawsuit against the dentist. Parents Ashley and Evan Boyle filed a negligence lawsuit while their only child was in a coma. Their attorney, Rick Fried, would not comment on the autopsy report. Geyer's attorney, John Nishimoto, has called the allegations 'unproven' but declined to comment further because of the lawsuit. He didn't respond to the newspaper's requests for comment on the autopsy report Thursday. Geyer was issued a license to practice dentistry in the state in July 2005, the Star-Advertiser has previously reported. As of last December, there were no records of complaints against her or her practice on file with the Hawaii Department Of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, according to the newspaper. Ms Boyle is being represented by attorney Richard Fried who called the maximum dosages of five different drugs 'grossly excessive'. He cited the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's standards which warned that young children should be monitored every five minutes and that an extra person should be there to help in case resuscitation is needed. Immediately following the lidocaine injection, Finley Boyle became unresponsive and went into cardiopulmonary arrest. The procedure on December 3 broke both. of those rules. Instead of checking Finley's oxygen levels every five. minutes, records show she wasn't checked for 26 minutes which explains. why the brain damage was so severe. When. the girl went into cardiac arrest, a doctor from another office had to. be brought in to perform CPR - which Ms Boyle believes is the main. reason her daughter fell into a coma. Ms Boyle was left with the agonizing decision to not resuscitate her daughter, saying that although she held out hope that her daughter would recover she didn't want her to live in a vegetative state. 'Had it been initiated at the correct time, she'd be walking out of the hospital right now,' Boyle said.Finley. may not have even needed the fillings. Ms Boyle has been contacted by. others mothers who got second opinions after visiting Dr Geyer and found. out that her recommendations were 'either totally unnecessary or. somewhat unnecessary' according to Fried. Other mothers said their children had trouble walking for a few days after having work done by Dr Geyer. Ms Boyle calls the botched procedure a 'massive tragedy' that she and her family 'will have to deal with for the rest of our lives.' In January, new state rules took effect tightening oversight of dental sedation in Hawaii. Finley Puelo Boyle (pictured) is tragically missed by her mother, father, and all who knew her.

During her visit, they found out she needed some dental work like cavity fillings and root canals. To make Finley comfortable, the dentist gave her some medicine to help her relax and numb her mouth so it wouldn't hurt. But, sadly, she was given too much medicine, and it caused her heart to stop working properly. She got very sick and went into a coma, which means her body and mind were in a very deep sleep, and she couldn't wake up. After a month, little Finley passed away. Her parents were really sad and upset, because they thought the dentist should have been more careful with the medicine. So they decided to file a lawsuit, which is a way to take the dentist to court to find out who is responsible.

Scott Fitzgerald, a screenwriter who had his share of ups and downs in this land. Fitzgerald was not a successful Hollywood writer because he was not good at the career path he chose. He was an amazing novelist, but his efforts of turning them into screenplays ended in disappointment and confusion. It was because of a lack of potential for screenwriting as well as his addiction and desire to be famous. Growing up as a boy, Fitzgerald went to movies a lot. He wanted to write stories that would eventually turn into movies. The problem was: just because Fitzgerald wanted to do something didn't necessarily mean that he was good at it. He made his attempts, but most of these efforts ended in disappointment because he thought about the change from script to screen too much. His plot was too detailed and complicated; his tone was too serious or his dialogue too sentimental . Fitzgerald's quick rise to fame also led to his fall. In life, things are not meant to happen all at once, all that the same time but it did for Fitzgerald. At his best time, three of his early stories were made into short films, including The Great Gatsby and Babylon Revisited.

The player's eyes, which were initially filled with disappointment from the missed shot, now widen with disbelief as he and the two spectators behind him witness an extraordinary turn of events unfold on the basketball court. Hindered by the weight of the heavy defeat that seemed inevitable, the atmosphere in the arena changes as if a charged lightning bolt had just descended from the heavens above. With each passing second, the excitement increases, reaching a fever pitch that the audience can hardly contain. Inexplicably, the ball that had just ricocheted off the rim, spins through the air with an unusual trajectory, much like a boomerang defying gravity, and proceeds to curve its way toward the opposing team's basket. The players on both teams momentarily freeze in shock, attempting to process the incredible and bizarre scene before them. As the ball rapidly gains altitude, it's evident that every individual inside the packed stadium--from the most die-hard fan to the novice who is attending their first game--shares the same thought: Could this be a pivotal moment that reverses the tide and grants the underdog team the triumph they had all but given up on? Leaning forward in anticipation, the two men behind the player exchange awestruck glances, bewildered by the surreal display, which seemed to have plunged the game into an unprecedented dimension. Time seems to slow down as the ball, gleaming under the bright lights, draws closer and closer to the hoop that had moments earlier been in the clutches of what seemed an insurmountable lead. The tension mounts as onlookers silently pray, hoping that the sheer force of their collective will can somehow guide the ball along its unconventional and seemingly impossible path. Then, as if to defy all logic, the unthinkable happens: The ball, moving with a force and precision that defies explanation, hits the backboard at just the right angle, propelling itself through the net with a satisfying swoosh. The silence in the arena is shattered by an explosion of cheers and applause, as the players and spectators alike erupt into a frenzied celebration that seems to shake the very foundations of the building. The once despondent player who had so confidently taken the shot seconds earlier, now finds himself surrounded by a sea of congratulatory pats and shouts of elation. In that surreal moment, as joy and disbelief intertwine, it becomes abundantly clear that the missed shot that had begun the sequence, was, in fact, no accident; rather, it was a testament to the triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity, and a reminder that miracles can manifest in the most unexpected of ways. All it takes is unwavering faith and the understanding that the course of history can turn on the most fleeting of moments, as everyone who had the privilege of witnessing that unforgettable shot will undoubtedly remember for the rest of their lives."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The heroic female warrior Britomart (representing both chastity and Elizabeth I) battles through obstacles to reach the chamber in which Amoret is being held, and slays Busirane moments before he is able to kill Amoret.Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was intended by Etty to illustrate the virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart as he prepares to kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and her clothes fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she swings her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint.

Democrats Under Ethics Cloud Benefit From Distracted Public Rep. Jane Harman awaits President Obama's address to a joint session of Congress. Feb. 24, 2009 (AP) Allegations of ethics violations by a handful of Democrats in recent months reached something of a crescendo this week as two prominent members of Congress were accused of corruption. California Rep. Jane Harman denied allegations that she offered to help seek reduced charges for two pro-Israel lobbyists suspected of espionage in exchange for help from a pro-Israel donor, also suspected Israeli agent, in lobbying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to give Harman a key chairmanship. And California Sen. Dianne Feinstein denied that she devised legislation that helped her husband get a federal contract to sell foreclosed properties at compensation rates higher than the industry norms. But the latest cases, which involve Democrats, did not make the same splash that corruption allegations did a few years ago, when Republicans were on the receiving end of the finger-pointing. Some Republican analysts attribute the difference to timing. Democrats have benefited from an \\"Obama media cycle,\\" said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, who served as an aide to former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. Reporters are struggling to keep up with the Obama administration and all the crises it's grappling with, Bonjean told FOXNews.com. In addition, he said, the media and the public have become more desensitized to allegations of corruption against lawmakers after the ones against Republicans. GOP consultant Joe Gaylord, who served as an aide to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, told FOXNews.com he believes GOP values and principles played a role in garnering more attention to ethics accusations against Republican lawmakers. \\"Republicans who have generally used the ethics process become much more susceptible to the hypocrisy charges because they set a high standard for how people should behave,\\" he said. \\"Then when a Republican doesn't behave properly, it becomes a bigger story.\\" A succession of reports and scandals against congressional Republicans ranging from pay-to-play schemes to salacious affairs began more than four years ago when then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay was questioned about his overseas travel and ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who was under federal investigation. Ohio Rep. Bob Ney also got entangled in the Abramoff scandal, and ended up in jail. Another Republican, Rep. Randy \\"Duke\\" Cunningham, resigned his California seat in 2005 after pleading guilty to accepting 2.4 million in bribes and underreporting his income for 2004. In 2006, Florida Rep. Mark Foley resigned when it was learned that he had exchanged raunchy e-mails with a teenage boy who was a former congressional page. In 2007, Idaho Sen. Larry Craig was arrested and pleaded guilty to an undercover sex sting in a men's bathroom at a Minneapolis airport. All five lawmakers are gone from office now. The cumulative effect of these incidents created a perception that Republicans were ethically challenged. Even before Craig's \\"wide stance,\\" Democrats were able to seize on the allegations and regain control of Capitol Hill in 2006, in part by repeating the mantra that they would wipe away the \\"culture of corruption\\" in Congress. But in recent months, Democrats have fallen victim to similar allegations of corruption. While denying wrongdoing on Tuesday, Harman called for a federal investigation into why her conversations were being recorded and why they were leaked to the media. The Office of Congressional Ethics, created by a House resolution on March , 11, 2008, also won't take up the Harman investigation, according to Roll Call, because the OCE rules prevent it from looking at any cases that arose before its creation. Feinstein defended herself Wednesday by pointing out that her legislation to route 25 billion in taxpayer money to a government agency that reportedly awarded her husband's real estate firm a lucrative contract never was enacted into law. Another Democrat, Pennsylvania Rep. Jack Murtha, is facing a federal probe for purportedly steering defense appropriations to clients of KSA Consulting, which employed his brother Robert, and the PMA Group, founded by Paul Magliocchetti, a former senior staffer on the Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Defense. New York Rep. Charlie Rangel is being investigated by the House Ethics Committee in at least four areas, including his reported failure to properly report income taxes on a Caribbean villa in the Dominican Republic; use of four, rent-controlled apartments in Harlem; questions about an offshore firm asking Rangel for special tax exemptions; and whether Rangel improperly used House stationery to solicit donations for a school of public affairs named after him at City College of New York. Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the main difference between the current Democratic scandals and the ones that routed the Republicans is that now \\"it's not one big scandal easily understood.\\" She explained that many of ethics accusations against Republicans a few year ago were linked to Abramoff. \\"It was one issue,\\" she said. \\"Now we're looking at lots of different little issues.\\" But she warned that the allgegations against Democrats could add up to a death by a thousand cuts. \\"The Democrats have something to worry about here,\\" she said. \\"There will be a critical mass when it will look like Democrats have a huge ethical problem. And the Democrats who have not been taking the problems very seriously ignore them at their peril.\\" Bonjean when it comes to rallying voter outrage \\"timing is everything.\\" Right now, the focus of anti-tax tea partiers and others critical of Washington is on government spending, bank bailouts, legal rights for terror suspects and Bush administration-era interrogation techniques. \\"There's only so much oxygen in the room for what it is that's going to get covered and what becomes important,\\" added Gaylord. \\"And in this age, when there is a crisis a minute ... it moves the individual activities of congressmen and congresswomen, no matter how corrupt it might be, down on the scale of importance. \\"The Obama administration, with everything it is changing, is providing cover for Democratic corruption,\\" he said. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses how allegations of ethics violations involving Democratic members of Congress have not attracted as much attention as similar allegations against Republicans in the past. The author suggests that the current focus on the Obama administration and a desensitized public could be contributing factors. In recent months, multiple Democrats have faced accusations of corruption, but these cases have not generated the same level of media coverage or public outrage. Some experts warn that Democrats should not ignore these allegations, as they could lead to long-term consequences if they are perceived as having a significant ethical problem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are three steps to take when applying to colleges for the best chances at getting into the best college for you. Step l: Making A List Of Colleges To Apply To With over 6,000 colleges in the United States, the first step in applying to college is to do some research and make a college list . This process will be different for everyone.

Many limit the number because applications are accompanied by a fee. . Step2: Splitting The List Into Target, Reach and Safety Schools In general, students will want to apply to three types of schools: Target, Reach and Safety schools. It is up to you how many applications you send, but a good mix would be more target than reach, and at least one safety. You will need to take your list, and now decide which are your top picks, which are attainable for you academically, which are affordable for you only with aid, and refine your broad list into a group of schools that gives you the best chance for success.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The tourist village had two beaches: Coral beach with nice sand and deeper water was preferred by families, and Surfer beach which had shallow water was a surfer's heaven. Which beach was less suitable for surfing and windsurfing? Hint: When wind waves approach to coast area from deep water, the waves change their heights and lengths. The wave height becomes higher and the wavelength becomes shorter as the wave velocity is slowed when ocean waves approach to the shore. If the water depth is sufficiently shallow, the wave crest become steeper and the trough gets broader and shallower; finally, the ocean waves break at the shore. The motions of wave breaking are different with along to the steepness of shores and waves, and can be categorized by below three types.[11][12] Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the Coral beach with nice sand and deeper water is less suitable for surfing and windsurfing compared to Surfer beach, which has shallow water. The wave characteristics play a crucial role in determining the suitability of a beach for surfing and windsurfing. As ocean waves approach the shore, the waves change their heights and lengths due to the slowing of wave velocity. The wave height becomes higher and the wavelength becomes shorter. If the water depth is sufficiently shallow, the wave crest becomes steeper and the trough gets broader and shallower, eventually causing the ocean waves to break at the shore. The motions of wave breaking vary depending on the steepness of the shores and the waves, and can be categorized into three main types. In the case of Coral beach, the deeper water makes it less ideal for surfing and windsurfing. The deep water doesn't allow the waves to develop the necessary steepness and breaking motions that are conducive to surfing or windsurfing activities as the waves may not slow down enough or break properly near the shore. It does, however, make the beach a more desirable destination for families as they can enjoy swimming and playing in the sand without worrying about strong waves. On the other hand, Surfer beach offers shallow water, which is more suitable for surfing and windsurfing. The shallow water allows the waves to slow down and break near the shore, creating steeper crests and broader, shallower troughs that facilitate surfing and windsurfing. The wave characteristics provided by the shallow water and the breaking motions of the waves make Surfer beach the preferred location for surfers. Overall, Surfer beach is more suitable for surfing and windsurfing due to its shallow water, which results in the desirable wave characteristics necessary for these activities. In contrast, the deep water at Coral beach makes it less ideal for surfing and windsurfing but more appropriate for family-oriented activities such as swimming and beach play."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Process: - Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nose - The oxygen travels into the lungs - The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells) - The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart - All cells receive the oxygen.
