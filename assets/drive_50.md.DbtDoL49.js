Write a summary based on this article: ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkey declared a national day of mourning and began to bury its dead Sunday after twin blasts in Istanbul killed 38 people and wounded 155 others near a soccer stadium. It was the latest large-scale assault to traumatize a nation confronting an array of security threats. The bombs Saturday night targeted police officers, killing 30 of them along with seven civilians and an unidentified person, Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told reporters Sunday. He said 13 people had been arrested in connection with the \\"terrorist attack.\\" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed that Turkey would overcome terrorism while Prime Minister Binali Yildirim ordered flags to fly at half-staff Sunday across the country and at Turkey's foreign missions. \\"We have once again witnessed tonight in Istanbul the ugly face of terror, which tramples on every value and decency,\\" Erdogan said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but two officials said suspicions were focused on Kurdish militants. Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told the private news channel CNN Turk that \\"arrows point to the PKK.\\" He was referring to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has waged a decades-long insurgency. That preliminary assessment was echoed by the interior minister. The first and larger explosion took place about 7:30 p.m. Saturday after the home team Besiktas beat visitor Bursaspor 2-1 in the Turkish Super League. Erdogan said the timing of the attack aimed to maximize the loss of life. Soylu said the first explosion was caused by a passing vehicle that detonated in an area where police special forces were located at the stadium exit. A riot police bus appears to have been the target. Moment later, a person who had been stopped in nearby Macka Park committed suicide by triggering explosives, according to the minister. The civilian death toll was lower because fans had already left the newly built Vodafone Arena Stadium after the soccer match when the blasts occurred. Witnesses also heard gunfire after the explosions. Soylu said 136 people remained hospitalized Sunday after the attack, including 14 under intensive care. Forensic experts in white uniforms worked overnight, scouring the vicinity of the stadium and the vast park where the suicide bombing took place. Glass from the blown-out windows of nearby buildings littered the pavement. Authorities have determined that about 300-400 kilograms of explosives were used in the attack, Kurtulmus told CNN Turk. Vehicle and pedestrian traffic tentatively resumed Sunday in the blast area, which municipal workers rushed to clean up. At noon, to the mournful sound of trumpets, funeral services were held at Istanbul's police headquarters for some of the slain police officers with the country's top brass in attendance. Their comrades solemnly carried the coffins, which were draped in the Turkish flag, as mourners wept. This year Istanbul has witnessed a spate of attacks attributed by authorities to the Islamic State group or claimed by Kurdish militants. A state of emergency is in force following a failed July 15 coup attempt. Saturday's incident marked one of the bloodiest to hit the bustling city at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. A triple suicide-and-gun attack on the city's Ataturk Airport in June killed 44 people and wounded scores of others. Kurdish-linked militants have claimed other deadly attacks in Ankara, Istanbul and areas of the southeast. The steady stream of violence has delivered a bitter blow to Turkey's tourism sector, a mainstay of the country's economy. Soylu acknowledged the country was struggling against \\"many elements\\" trying to compromise its fight against terrorism. Turkey is a partner in the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State and its armed forces are active in neighboring Syria and Iraq. It is also facing a renewed conflict with an outlawed Kurdish movement in the southeast. Condemnations of the attack came from a range of Turkish politicians, sports leaders and clubs and U.S. and EU officials. Turkey's pro-Kurdish People Democratic Party, or HDP, issued a statement \\"strongly condemning\\" the attacks and saying it \\"felt great sadness and shared in the sorrow.\\" Turkish authorities, particularly the president, have routinely accused the party of being linked to the PKK and backing terrorism. The party, which had both of its leaders detained in terror probes and multiple elected officials arrested or removed from public service in the southeast, denies the charge. The chair of the main opposition Republican People's Party also condemned the attack. Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said Washington condemned the attack in \\"the strongest terms.\\" \\"We stand together with Turkey, our NATO Ally, against all terrorists,\\" Price said. The Besiktas sports club \\"strongly condemned\\" the attack and said a store employee and a security official were among the fatalities. Bursaspor issued a statement wishing \\"a speedy recovery to our wounded citizens.\\" Aleksander Ceferin, president of European soccer's governing body UEFA, and European Union Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn also condemned the attack. \\"Violence has no place in a democratic society,\\" Hahn wrote on Twitter. The U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul urged its citizens to avoid the area in Istanbul. Turkey's radio and television board issued a temporary coverage ban citing national security concerns. It said \\"to avoid broadcasts that can result in public fear, panic or chaos, or that will serve the aims of terrorist organizations.\\" ___ Cinar Kiper and Bulut Emiroglu in Istanbul contributed. ||||| Turkey has vowed vengeance for the victims of twin blasts outside a football stadium in Istanbul that killed 38 people, as Kurdish militants claimed responsibility. A day after the two bombs, which appeared to be a co-ordinated attack on police, an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) said it was responsible. In a statement on its website, the group, called Kurdistan Freedom Hawks, or TAK, also said two of its militants were killed. As some of the victims were laid to rest, Turkey vowed to make the perpetrators pay. \\"Sooner or later, we will have our vengeance,\\" said interior minister Suleyman Soylu, speaking at a funeral service at Istanbul police headquarters. \\"This blood will not be left on the ground, no matter what the price, what the cost.\\" President Tayyip Erdogan called the attack on Saturday night \\"the ugly face of terror\\" and vowed to fight \\"the curse of terrorism till the end\\". In the first explosion, a car bomb was blown up outside the Vodafone Arena, home to the club Besiktas, after a football match. Less than a minute later, a suicide bomber hit in an adjacent park. Image Caption: A damaged vehicle after the blast on Saturday night Thirteen people have been arrested as officials started pointing to Kurdish militants soon after the attack. Most of the victims - 30 - were police officers, seven were civilians and one was yet to be identified, officials said. More than 150 were injured, and 136 people remained in hospital, including 14 under intensive care. Authorities have determined that about 300-400kg of explosives were used in the powerful blasts. The number of civilians killed was lower than feared as fans had already left the stadium after the game when the blasts occurred. The first explosion struck in an area where police special forces were located at the stadium exit. A riot police bus appears to have been the target, said Mr Soylu. The suicide bomber triggered the explosive after being stopped by police in the nearby Macka Park. Witnesses have described scenes of panic as the explosions rocked the area and shattered windows. \\"It was like hell. The flames went all the way up to the sky,\\" said Omer Yilmaz, who works as a cleaner at the nearby Dolmabahce Mosque, directly across the road from the stadium. \\"People ducked under the tables, women began crying. Football fans drinking tea at the cafe sought shelter, it was horrible.\\" Video: Eyewitness: I heard two explosions in 30 seconds Sunday was a day of national mourning, with flags flying at half-mast across the nation and officials calling for a march against terrorism. Mr Erdogan, who cancelled a planned trip to Kazakhstan, described the blasts as a terrorist attack on police and civilians. He said the aim of the bombings, two hours after the end of a match attended by thousands of people, had been to cause maximum casualties. \\"We have once again witnessed tonight in Istanbul the ugly face of terror, which tramples on every value and decency,\\" he said. \\"Nobody should doubt that with God's will, we as a country and a nation will overcome terror, terrorist organisations.\\" Video: Running for cover as blasts hit Istanbul This year Istanbul has witnessed a spate of attacks attributed by authorities to the Islamic State group or claimed by Kurdish militants.

I have no problem with divorce since, as others have stated, everyone has their reasons, however there was one person that I dated briefly but upon hearing the reason why he divorced I opted to end the relationship. I remember, we were having brunch and were talking about our past relationships and what happened. He brought up his marriage. I had previously known his divorce but, up until this point, not the reasoning. He told me, straight out, that he had cheated. Now, cheating in itself is one thing. I try not to judge since everyone has a past and I was never always innocent myself, however his attitude about it was what was very off-putting to me. He didn’t seem remotely fazed by what he was telling me at all. There he was, spreading jelly on his toast as he told me about all the women he had cheated on his wife with. He told me about how it had started with a secretary (talk about cliches!) and then graduated to trysts in motels with girls off Tinder all with the same amount of casualness as someone describing how to make an omelette! And when he finally finished the tale of his cheating adventures I asked him if he regretted cheating on his wife with so many women, His answer? “Oh Definitely.” Oh good!

Had I divorced her sooner, I wouldn’t have to have cheated on her so much. But it is what it is and, well, I was unhappy.” I have no problems with divorced men.

Welded plastic doesn’t take long to cool down, but you can wait as long as you please. Look for the welded plastic to turn solid. If you don’t feel any heat coming off of it, you are ready to work on it. The best time to fix a weld is before it cools. A good weld looks relatively smooth and consistent. Add more of the welding rod or smooth out the melted plastic with your gun as needed. Set your welding gun aside when you’re done. Remember to put it in a safe spot, such as in a heat-resistant holster, until it cools. Smooth out the rough ridges on the weld to make it look consistent with the rest of the plastic. Apply light pressure to the weld, rubbing the sandpaper back and forth across it. Try to get the weld to look level with the area around it, but be careful to avoid scratching the plastic around it. If you’re looking for a speedier way to do this, use a sanding wheel on a rotary tool. Be careful, though, since plastic is relatively soft and easy to scratch. Switch to finer grits of sandpaper to neaten out the weld. Higher-grit sandpaper is finer and less abrasive, but it can still scratch the plastic if you’re not careful. Rub the weld down like you did with the 120-grit sandpaper until it looks consistent and feels smooth to the touch. Always start with the lower-grit sandpaper. It is coarser, so it wears away more of the plastic. Save the higher-grit sandpaper for finishing.

Options: - close - closeness - proximity - near - measured in meters The answer is \\"near\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer is \\"near\\" because the term \\"near\\" is the most appropriate and easily understood way of expressing that the oncoming cars appeared to be at a short distance from the driver. The driver, having forgotten his glasses, struggled with judging the distance accurately, causing him to perceive that the vehicles were closer than they actually were. Let's examine and compare the other options: 1. Close: While \\"close\\" is also a suitable term to describe the perceived or actual distance between the driver and the oncoming cars, \\"near\\" is a more common and straightforward choice. Both words have similar meanings, but \\"near\\" is a more concise and easily understood option for this situation. 2. Closeness: This term refers to the quality of being close, rather than the actual perceived distance between objects. It would not accurately convey the issue the driver was facing. 3. Proximity: Proximity describes the nearness in space, time, or relationship. However, in this context, the term \\"near\\" is more specific and clear, as it directly addresses the issue of the cars appearing to be at a short distance away from the driver. 4. Measured in meters: This option does not make sense in the context of the question because it does not describe a characteristic of the oncoming cars. It refers to a unit of measurement, rather than a quality of distance. In conclusion, the most appropriate answer is \\"near,\\" as it effectively and simply communicates the driver's difficulty in judging the distances of the oncoming cars due to his forgotten glasses. This term clearly conveys the fact that the driver perceived the vehicles to be at a short distance away, causing him not to pull out."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to make zucchini noodles Decide whether or not to peel the zucchini. If you want zucchini noodles that more closely resemble actual pasta, peel the zucchini before turning it into noodles. For something a little more colorful, though, keep the peel on.","completion":"Next, choose a spiralizing tool or device that suits your needs and preference. There are several options available, such as a spiralizer, julienne peeler, mandoline slicer, or even a regular vegetable peeler. Each of these tools is designed to cut the zucchini into thin, noodle-like strips or ribbons. The choice of the tool will largely depend on the desired thickness and style of the zucchini noodles. For instance, a spiralizer creates long, curly noodles, while a julienne peeler produces evenly-sized, straight noodles. Once you've selected the appropriate tool, wash and dry the zucchini thoroughly, removing any dirt or debris. If using a spiralizer, secure the zucchini on the device and start turning the handle, applying constant pressure to produce consistent noodles. If using a julienne peeler, hold the zucchini firmly and carefully run the peeler along the length of the vegetable, removing thin ribbons each time. Mandoline slicers and regular vegetable peelers can also be used in a similar fashion, making sure to adjust the blade width to achieve the desired noodle thickness. As you create zucchini noodles, you may find that some pieces will be shorter and more irregular than others. This is normal and can be expected when using vegetables with varying shapes and sizes. To obtain a more uniform appearance, simply trim or discard any uneven or excess strips that don't match the desired size and shape. After you've turned the entire zucchini into noodles, it is essential to release any excess moisture from them. If not done properly, the noodles can end up soggy and unappetizing. To prevent this, place the noodles in a colander and sprinkle them with a pinch of salt. Allow them to sit for a few minutes, as the salt will draw the water out. Afterward, gently pat the noodles dry with a paper towel or clean dishcloth to remove any additional moisture. Now that your zucchini noodles are prepared, it's time to cook them. There are several methods of cooking zucchini noodles, such as sautéing, boiling, or even microwaving. To sauté, heat a small amount of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the zucchini noodles, stirring frequently and cook for 2-3 minutes until they're slightly softened but still maintaining their shape. Avoid overcooking the noodles, as they can quickly turn mushy. Boiling the noodles is another option and only takes about 1-2 minutes. Be sure to drain them well after cooking to avoid any excess liquid. Microwaving zucchini noodles is also a quick and efficient way of cooking them. Simply place the noodles in a microwave-safe dish, cover with a microwave-safe lid or plastic wrap, and cook on high for 1-1.5 minutes. Once cooked, serve the zucchini noodles with your choice of sauce, such as marinara, pesto, or even a simple garlic and oil mixture. Top with your favorite protein source, like grilled chicken, tofu, or shrimp, and additional vegetables for a well-rounded and nutritious meal. Making zucchini noodles allows you to enjoy a low-carb, gluten-free, and healthier alternative to traditional pasta dishes, while also adding a colorful and fun twist to your culinary repertoire."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Given the question: Information: - An oxide is a chemical compound that contains at least one oxygen atom and one other element in its chemical formula. \\"Oxide\\" itself is the dianion of oxygen, an O atom. Metal oxides thus typically contain an anion of oxygen in the oxidation state of 2. Most of the Earth's crust consists of solid oxides, the result of elements being oxidized by the oxygen in air or in water. Hydrocarbon combustion affords the two principal carbon oxides: carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Even materials considered pure elements often develop an oxide coating. For example, aluminium foil develops a thin skin of AlO (called a passivation layer) that protects the foil from further corrosion. Individual elements can often form multiple oxides, each containing different amounts of the element and oxygen. In some cases these are distinguished by specifying the number of atoms as in carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and in other cases by specifying the element's oxidation number, as in iron(II) oxide and iron(III) oxide. Certain elements can form many different oxides, such those of nitrogen. - Koskullskulle is a locality situated in Gällivare Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 874 inhabitants in 2010. - Magnetite is a mineral and one of the main iron ores. With the chemical formula FeO, it is one of the oxides of iron. Magnetite is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself. It is the most magnetic of all the naturally-occurring minerals on Earth. Naturally-magnetized pieces of magnetite, called lodestone, will attract small pieces of iron, which is how ancient peoples first discovered the property of magnetism. Today it is mined as iron ore. - The polar night occurs when the night lasts for more than 24 hours. This occurs only inside the polar circles. The opposite phenomenon, the polar day, or midnight sun, occurs when the Sun stays above the horizon for more than 24 hours. \\"Night\\" is understood as the center of the Sun being below a free horizon. Since the atmosphere bends the rays of the Sun, the polar day is longer than the polar night, and the area that is affected by polar night is somewhat smaller than the area of midnight sun. The polar circle is located at a latitude between these two areas, at the latitude of approximately 66.5 degrees. In the most northern city of Sweden, Kiruna, at 67°51'N, the polar night lasts for around 28 twenty-four-hour periods, while the midnight sun lasts around 50 twenty-four-hour periods. - Hematite, also spelled as haematite, is the mineral form of iron(III) oxide (FeO), one of several iron oxides. Hematite crystallizes in the rhombohedral lattice system, and it has the same crystal structure as ilmenite and corundum. Hematite and ilmenite form a complete solid solution at temperatures above . - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Luleå (Lule Sami \\"Luleju\\") is a city on the coast of northern Sweden, and the capital of Norrbotten County, the northernmost county in Sweden. Luleå has about 75,000 inhabitants and is the seat of Luleå Municipality (with a total population of 75,921). - Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (72.4% Fe), hematite (69.9% Fe), goethite (62.9% Fe), limonite or siderite (48.2% Fe). - Luleå Municipality is a municipality in Norrbotten County in northern Sweden. Its seat is located in Luleå, which is also the county seat of Norrbotten County. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The Main Line Through Upper Norrland is a long railway line between Bräcke, Jämtland County and Boden, Norrbotten County in Sweden. For military and regional policy reasons, it was built in very sparsely populated areas, far away from the more densely populated coast. The line has several branches to settlements on the coast, the ones to Umeå and Luleå being considered part of the line itself. Today the three largest settlements along the line are Boden (pop 18800), Älvsbyn (pop 5500) and Vännäs (pop 4100). - Iore, often stylized IORE, is a class of 34 electric locomotives built by Adtranz and its successor Bombardier Transportation for the Swedish mining company LKAB's railway division Malmtrafik. The class is a variation of Adtranz's Octeon modular product platform, thus related to Bombardier's later TRAXX platform. The locomotives haul iron ore freight trains on the Iron Ore Line and Ofoten Line in Sweden and Norway, respectively. The 68-car trains are hauled by two single-ended CoCo locomotives, each with a power output of . Each operates with tractive effort and has a maximum speed of . Delivery of the first series of 18 locomotives was made from 2000 to 2004, and they replaced some of the aging Dm3 and El 15 units. In 2007, eight more vehicles (4 double units) were ordered, with production to be completed by 2011, by which time, another four double units were ordered. These units are scheduled to be delivered from 2013 to 2014. - Iron is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from ) and atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. Its abundance in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production by fusion in high-mass stars, where it is the last element to be produced with release of energy before the violent collapse of a supernova, which scatters the iron into space. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - A mineral is a naturally occurring chemical compound, usually of crystalline form and abiogenic in origin. A mineral has one specific chemical composition, whereas a rock can be an aggregate of different minerals or mineraloids. The study of minerals is called mineralogy. - Northern or North Sami (disapproved exonym Lappish or Lapp), sometimes also simply referred to as Sami, is the most widely spoken of all Sami languages. The area where Northern Sami is spoken covers the northern parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland. The number of Northern Sami speakers is estimated to be somewhere between 15,000 and 25,000. About 2,000 of these live in Finland and between 5,000 and 6,000 in Sweden. - The Sami people (also Sámi or Saami, traditionally known in English as Lapps or Laplanders) are an indigenous Finno-Ugric people inhabiting the Arctic area of Sápmi, which today encompasses parts of far northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Kola Peninsula of Russia. The Sami are the only indigenous people of Scandinavia recognized and protected under the international conventions of indigenous peoples, and are hence the northernmost indigenous people of Europe. Sami ancestral lands are not well-defined. Their traditional languages are the Sami languages and are classified as a branch of the Uralic language family. - Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag (LKAB) is a Swedish mining company. The company mines iron ore at Kiruna and at Malmberget in northern Sweden. The company was established in 1890, and has been 100% state-owned since the 1950s. The iron ore is processed to pellets and sinter fines, which are transported by Iore trains (Malmbanan) to the harbours at Narvik and Luleå and to the steelmill at Luleå (SSAB). - Svappavaara is a locality situated in Kiruna Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 417 inhabitants in 2010. It is a mining village. Mining was started around 1650. Large scale iron mining started in 1965. The mine was closed in 1983, but enrichment of iron ore from the mine at Kiruna is still going on. The mine is owned by LKAB, and there is an ongoing project to open it again for production around year 2015. - Narvik is located on the shores of the Ofotfjorden. The municipality is part of the traditional district of Ofoten of Northern Norway, inside the Arctic Circle. The municipality of Narvik borders the municipality of Ballangen to the southwest, Evenes to the northwest, Bardu, Gratangen, Lavangen and Skånland (in Troms county) to the north, and Norrbotten County (Lapland) in Sweden to the south and east. - Limonite is an iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition. The generic formula is frequently written as FeO(OH)·nHO, although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely. Limonite is one of the two principal iron ores, the other being hematite, and has been mined for the production of iron since at least 2500 BCE. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Goethite (FeO(OH)), named after the German polymath and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (17491832), an iron bearing hydroxide mineral of the diaspore group, is found in soil and other low-temperature environments. Goethite has been well known since ancient times for its use as a pigment (brown ochre). Evidence has been found of its use in paint pigment samples taken from the caves of Lascaux in France. It was first described in 1806 based on samples found in the Hollertszug Mine in Herdorf, Germany. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Kiirunavaara ( Northern Sami : Gironvárri or Kierunavaara ) is a mountain in Kiruna , Sweden that contains one of the largest and richest bodies of iron ore in the world . The presence of iron in the area was known already in the mid- 17th century , but at this early time communication lines to this northerly region were quite insufficient to permit any major exploitation . Only with the construction of a railway , the Iron Ore Line and the ports of Narvik and Luleå at the end of the 19th century did commercial mining become a realistic proposition . The Swedish mining company LKAB ( Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag ) has been mining the mountain since the beginning of the 20th century . The mining area around Kiruna and Malmberget and the iron port and steelworks at Luleå made Norrbotten County one of the first , and most prominent , regions of heavy industry in Sweden , and the wider region has remained at the forefront of mining and steel smelting and alloying technology . - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. - SSAB AB, earlier \\"Svenskt Stål AB\\" (English: Swedish Steel), is a Swedish-Finnish company, formed in 1978 and specialised in processing raw material to steel. The largest shareholders are Industrivärden and the Government of Finland. - An ore is a type of rock that contains sufficient minerals with important elements including metals that can be economically extracted from the rock. The ores are extracted from the earth through mining; they are then refined (often via smelting) to extract the valuable element, or elements. - A metal (from Greek \\"métallon\\", \\"mine, quarry, metal\\") is a material (an element, compound, or alloy) that is typically hard, opaque, shiny, and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. Metals are generally malleable that is, they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking as well as fusible (able to be fused or melted) and ductile (able to be drawn out into a thin wire). About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals, the others are nonmetals or metalloids. Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms. - Luossavaara (Northern Sami: \\"Luossavárri\\") is a mountain in Kiruna, Sweden. It is the site of a now-inactive iron ore mine formerly operated by the Swedish mining company LKAB. Today it has a ski lift and slope, as well as a hiking path called \\"Midnattsolstigen\\" (the Midnight Sun Trail). - Iron oxides are chemical compounds composed of iron and oxygen. All together, there are sixteen known iron oxides and oxyhydroxides. - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. - The Ofoten Line is a railway line in Narvik, Norway. It runs from the Port of Narvik to Riksgränsen on the NorwaySweden border, where the line continues as the Ore Line via Kiruna and Gällivare to Luleå. The Ofoten Line is single track, electrified at and has seven stations. The line only connects to the rest of the Norwegian railway network via Sweden. The main traffic is up to twelve daily freight trains operated by Malmtrafik that haul iron ore from Sweden to Narvik. In addition, CargoNet operates container trains, branded as the Arctic Rail Express (ARE), and SJ operates passenger trains, including a night train to Stockholm. The Ofoten Line is also part of the Northern East West Freight Corridor, which hauls containers from China and India to North America. - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. - The city's vicinity shares a long history with the indigenous Sami people, with evidence of at least 6000 years of settlement. The city of Kiruna was founded in 1900 and quickly became a major centre of iron ore extraction and mining industry. During World War II, large quantities of iron were transported from Kiruna by rail to the east coast, and further down to be sold to Germany. Due to Kiruna's position north of the Arctic Circle the city experiences both midnight sun and polar night throughout the year as well as a very cold climate, even by Scandinavian standards. - Siderite is a mineral composed of iron(II) carbonate (FeCO). It takes its name from the Greek word \\"sideros,\\" iron. It is a valuable iron mineral, since it is 48% iron and contains no sulfur or phosphorus. Zinc, magnesium and manganese commonly substitute for the iron resulting in the siderite-smithsonite, siderite-magnesite and siderite-rhodochrosite solid solution series. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology.

This conurbation is the second northernmost significant urban area of Sweden after Kiruna. - The midnight sun is a natural phenomenon that occurs in the summer months in places north of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle, when the sun remains visible at the local midnight. Around the summer solstice (approximately 21 June in the Northern Hemisphere and 22 December in the Southern Hemisphere) the sun is visible for the full 24 hours, given fair weather. The number of days per year with potential midnight sun increases the farther towards either pole one goes. Although approximately defined by the polar circles, in practice the midnight sun can be seen as much as 55 miles (90 km) outside the polar circle, as described below, and the exact latitudes of the farthest reaches of midnight sun depend on topography and vary slightly year-to-year. - Malmberget (\\"The Ore Mountain\\") is a locality and mining town situated in Gällivare Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 5,590 inhabitants in 2010. It is situated 5 kilometres from the municipal seat Gällivare. - The Iron Ore Line is a long railway line between Riksgränsen and Boden in Norrbotten County, Sweden. The line contains two branches, from Kiruna to Svappavaara and from Gällivare to Koskullskulle. The term is often colloquially used to also include the Ofoten Line, from Riksgränsen to Narvik in Norway, and the northernmost part of the Main Line Through Upper Norrland from Boden to Luleå. The railway from Narvik to Luleå is long. - Norrbotten County (\\"Norrbottens län\\") is the northernmost county or \\"län\\" of Sweden.

Please answer this question : At which temperature will more water be available on the cupcakes for bacterial growth? A:","completion":"At 10° F, more water will be available on the cupcakes for bacterial growth compared to 0° F. This is because, at a higher temperature (10° F), the freezing process is less efficient, which means that the water content in the cupcakes does not freeze as completely or as quickly as it would at a lower temperature (0° F). This results in more water being available for bacterial growth at 10° F as opposed to 0° F. For optimal preservation and reduction of bacterial growth, it is better to store the cupcakes at 0° F in the freezer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake has become Wales' youngest current MP, aged 24, after winning Ceredigion from the Liberal Democrats. Here are Wales' new political faces of 2017 by constituency. Labour's Anna McMorrin is the new MP for this swing seat, winning a 4,174 majority and ousting Conservative Craig Williams. She grew up near Brecon, went to university in Cardiff and lives in the city with her partner and two teenage daughters. Previously a Welsh Government adviser and a public policy consultant before the election, she describes herself as a campaigner and mum. Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake is Wales' youngest MP after taking Ceredigion from the Liberal Democrats, depriving them of their only Welsh seat. Aged 24, he was working for Plaid in the Welsh Assembly before hitting the campaign trail and is one of the youngest politicians ever elected to the House of Commons. Tonia Antoniazzi won Gower from the Conservatives for Labour, turning a Tory majority of 27 into a 3,269 majority for her party. A Llanelli schoolteacher who used to represent Wales at rugby, she says she is also a mum and a linguist. While on the campaign trail she told BBC Wales two things she could transfer from the rugby pitch to the battle for the most marginal seat in Britain were stamina and teamwork. Labour's Chris Ruane won the Vale of Clwyd back from the Conservatives, a seat he had held for 18 years before losing it in 2015.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: One way of classifying organisms that shows phylogeny is by using the clade. A clade is a group of organisms that includes an ancestor and all of its descendants. Clades are based on cladistics. This is a method of comparing traits in related species to determine ancestor-descendant relationships. Clades are represented by cladograms, like the one in Figure below . This cladogram represents the mammal and reptile clades. The reptile clade includes birds. It shows that birds evolved from reptiles. Linnaeus classified mammals, reptiles, and birds in separate classes. This masks their evolutionary relationships. Q: What is one way of classifying organisms called? A: A:","completion":"One way of classifying organisms is called \\"clade\\". The term \\"clade\\" refers to a group of organisms that comprises an ancestor and all of its descendants. The classification system using clades is founded on cladistics, a method that facilitates the comparison of traits in related species to decipher ancestor-descendant relationships. Clades are visually represented by cladograms. For instance, the cladogram mentioned in the paragraph represents the mammal and reptile clades, underscoring their evolutionary relationships. The system also reveals that the reptile clade embodies birds, indicating that birds evolved from reptiles. It's worth noting that this clade approach to classifying organisms is quite different from the Linnaeus method, which classified mammals, reptiles, and birds into separate classes, thereby obscuring their evolutionary relationships.

The mountain ranges block the moist Pacific air, holding moisture in the western valleys, and creating rain shadows to the east. Heron, in the west, receives the most precipitation, 34.70 inches (881 mm). On the eastern (leeward) side of a mountain range, the valleys are much drier; Lonepine averages 11.45 inches (291 mm), and Deer Lodge 11.00 inches (279 mm) of precipitation. The mountains themselves can receive over 100 inches (2,500 mm), for example the Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park gets 105 inches (2,700 mm). An area southwest of Belfry averaged only 6.59 inches (167 mm) over a sixteen-year period. Most of the larger cities get 30 to 50 inches or 0.76 to 1.27 metres of snow each year. Mountain ranges themselves can accumulate 300 inches or 7.62 metres of snow during a winter. Heavy snowstorms may occur any time from September through May, though most snow falls from November to March. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What is the annual precipitation?","completion":"The question regarding annual precipitation appears to be in reference to a specific region which is not specified in the task description. However, the text includes a diverse range of precipitation averages which suggest a region with varied topography and climate, likely a state or region within a larger country. For such a varied region, it's important to note that \\"average annual precipitation\\" can differ significantly based on the particular location within the region. Different factors such as geographical features, elevation, wind patterns and proximity to bodies of water can all impact the annual precipitation a specific place receives. Here are some examples of annual precipitation mentioned in the text: 1. The average annual precipitation for the wider region seems to be approximately 15 inches (380 mm). 2. Heron, on the western side, seems to receive the highest precipitation at 34.70 inches (881 mm) annually, due to moist Pacific air being trapped by the mountain ranges. 3. Comparatively, on the eastern (leeward) side, areas such as Lonepine and Deer Lodge receive less annual precipitation, averaging 11.45 inches (291 mm) and 11.00 inches (279 mm) respectively. This is due to them being in the rain shadow of the mountain ranges which blocks the moist Pacific air. 4. Areas of significant elevation, like the Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park, can receive over 100 inches (2,500 mm) - for instance, it gets 105 inches (2,700 mm) annually. 5. One area southwest of Belfry, received even less, averaging 6.59 inches (167 mm) over a period of 16 years. 6. The larger cities within this region generally receive between 30 to 50 inches or 0.76 to 1.27 metres of snow each year, which is also a form of precipitation. 7. Meanwhile, mountain ranges can accumulate massive amounts of snow, up to 300 inches or 7.62 meters during the winter season. In summary, the \\"annual precipitation\\" of this region can greatly vary from as little as 6.59 inches (167 mm) in certain locales, up to as high as 105 inches (2,700 mm) in elevated areas like the Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park. While the average for the overall region is mentioned as 15 inches (380 mm), local conditions heavily influence the actual precipitation received."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The Marches were a happy family. Poverty, hard work, and even the fact that Father March was away with the Union armies could not down the spirits of Meg, Jo, Amy, and Marmee, as the March girls called their mother. The March sisters tried to be good but had their share of faults. Pretty Meg was often displeased with the schoolchildren she taught; boyish Jo was easy to become angry; golden-haired schoolgirl Amy liked to show up; but Beth, who kept the house, was loving and gentle always. The happy days passed and darkness came when a telegram arrived for Mrs. March. \\"Your husband is very ill,\\" it said, \\"come at once.\\" The girl tried to be brave when their mother left for the front. They waited and prayed. Little Beth got scarlet fever when she was taking care of the sick neighbor. She became very ill but began to recover by the time Marmee was back. When Father came home from the front and at that joyful Christmas dinner they were once more all together. Three years later the March girls had grown into young womanhood. Meg became Mrs. Brooke, and after a few family troubles got used to her new state happily. Jo had found pleasure in her literary efforts. Amy had grown into a young lady with a talent for design and an even greater one for society. But Beth had never fully regained her health, and her family watched her with love and anxiety. Amy was asked to go and stay in Europe with a relative of the Marches. Jo went to New York and became successful in her writing and had the satisfaction of seeing her work published there. But at home the bitterest blow was yet to fall. Beth had known for some time that she couldn't live much longer to be with the family and in the spring time she died. News came from Europe that Amy and Laurie, the grandson of a wealthy neighbor, had planned to be married soon. Now Jo became ever more successful in her writing and got married to Professor Bhaer and soon afterwards founded a school for boys.

The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, however, did not immediately specify the service members' nationalities. Thursday's shooting was the third at a base or government building since news emerged that U.S. troops mistakenly burned Qurans and other religious materials early last week -- an incident that has sparked outrage, protests, and violence across Afghanistan.

Buck McKeon, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said 39 of the attacks were by members of the Afghan National Security Force and three were by contractors. \\"Though less than 1% of Afghan forces and security guards have attacked coalition forces, this is 42 attacks too many and the new process must do better,\\" he said at a congressional hearing. Most attackers were acting on their own, rather than being puppets of insurgent groups, defense officials testified. France suspended its operations in Afghanistan after four French soldiers were killed by Afghan counterparts in eastern Kapisa province in January. That shooting came after another Afghan soldier killed two French soldiers in December. \\"The French army is not in Afghanistan to be shot at by Afghan soldiers,\\" French President Nicolas Sarkozy said after the shootings. Coalition forces responding to Thursday's incident killed the two gunmen, said Capt. Justin Brockhoff, an ISAF spokesman. Sarhadi said one gunman was an Afghan National Army soldier and the other, dressed in civilian clothes, was a teacher who formerly ran literacy courses for Afghan army soldiers. Afghan civilians are sometimes used to teach Afghan soldiers English to improve their ability to work alongside ISAF. It appeared that the teacher had been planning the attack for at least a year, Sarhadi said, because officials found pictures and other documents related to the Taliban among his possessions. U.S. officials have called the Quran burning an error by troops who were inadvertently given the Qurans and other religious materials to dispose of because they were thought to contain extremist inscriptions. U.S. President Barack Obama has apologized for the burning. Still, gunmen have targeted U.S. troops in the days following the burning. A man wearing an Afghan National Army uniform killed two American soldiers at a base in eastern Nangarhar province early last week. Over the weekend, two senior U.S. officers were gunned down inside the heavily secure Afghan Interior Ministry when a junior intelligence officer turned his gun on them. The gunman, who had been fired by the ministry but recently rejoined as a driver, is still on the loose. The incident prompted the United States to pull military advisers and embedded civilians from Afghan ministries, and France announced it was temporarily withdrawing all of its public officials in Afghan institutions to ensure their safety. The unrest following the Quran burning has left at least 41 people dead, including the two deaths Thursday, and hundreds more wounded. At least nine people were killed and 12 wounded in an explosion Monday near the front gate of the ISAF base at Jalalabad airport in eastern Afghanistan. There were no NATO casualties in the bombing. The Taliban insurgency said the attack was in retaliation for the Quran burning. In northern Kunduz province over the weekend, protesters attacked a police chief's office and a U.S. military base, Afghan and U.S. authorities said. Some threw hand grenades at the base, known as Combat Outpost Fortitude, and the resulting blasts wounded seven U.S. personnel believed to be Special Forces members, they said. Demonstrations outside the United Nations office in Kunduz on Saturday left four civilians dead and prompted the U.N. mission there to say Monday that it is temporarily relocating its international staff. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday the unrest and targeting of Americans has gotten \\"out of hand\\" and needs to stop. The Obama administration feels the Afghans have not done enough to stem the violence, according to a senior U.S. official who has access to the latest intelligence and is involved in administration discussions, but declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the situation. \\"We are not going to settle for what has happened to our troops in recent days,\\" the official said. The U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan Crocker, maintained Sunday that the Afghan security forces have given their lives to control the demonstrations and protect U.S. installations. Crocker said the Afghans \\"are very much in this fight trying to protect us.\\" After the Interior Ministry shooting, Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, an ISAF spokesman, said the United States would not let the incident divide the coalition.

The sell-by date may also appear as \\"not to be sold after\\" or \\"EXP.\\" This date is, at most, 30 days from the day the eggs were packaged. Eggs that are kept refrigerated and are not broken should be good for at least 1 month beyond the sell-by date. The sell-by date appears as month/day in the United States. So eggs that must be sold by March 15th are labeled 03/15. \\"Sell-by\\" refers to the last date the eggs should be available for the public to purchase. Eggs should be pulled from the shelf after this date. It does not mean the eggs are bad or rotten after this date. The best-by date may also be labeled as \\"use by,\\" \\"use before,\\" or \\"best before.\\" The best-by label must be within 45 days of the date the eggs were packaged. Try to use these eggs within two weeks after the best-by date. \\"Best-by\\" refers to the period of time eggs are at their peak freshness, with the best texture, flavor, and binding and thickening properties. It does not mean the eggs are bad or rotten after this date. Sell-by or best-by dates are not required by federal law (some states require them, other states forbid them), but all eggs must be labeled with the date they were packaged. This date usually appears as a 3 digit code using the Julian date calendar. This means eggs packaged on January 1st would be labeled 001, eggs packaged on October 15th would be labeled 288, December 31st 365. Look for the Julian date on the end of the carton. You'll see the plant code (a letter P followed by numbers) indicated where the eggs were packaged, and beside it you should find the Julian code. The European Union also requires that eggs are marked with a pack date. Even if eggs are sold loose and not in a marked carton, the consumer should have access to that information. Once an egg has cooled in your refrigerator, it is important to keep it at the same temperature. A cool egg in a warmer environment begins to sweat, which can encourage bacteria to grow on the outside of the egg. Because the egg shell is porous, it is sometimes possible for the bacteria on the shell to pass into through and contaminate the egg. To prevent temperature fluctuations, store your eggs in the coldest part of your refrigerator, not on the door. The temperature is more likely to fluctuate on the door when it is opening and closing, which may cause your eggs to sweat. If you receive your eggs unwashed and at room temperature, they do not need to be refrigerated. Many countries, including most European countries, keep their eggs at room temperature. This is safe because eggs are laid with a protective \\"bloom\\" which naturally keeps bacteria out. Once the eggs are washed, however, they must be refrigerated. Also, in most European countries, the hens have been inoculated against Salmonella prior to laying their eggs. If you have egg-laying hens and you're wondering when they will go bad, you can refer to your country's guidelines for freshness. It's a safe bet your eggs will be good for at least two months, if not more. If you're not sure how long you've had your fresh eggs or if you think they are older than two months, learn the signs of bad and old eggs to help you decide whether or not you should use them in your cooking.

Read this and answer the question The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored, a capacity that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists. The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of Apollo. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks (interpretatio graeca), adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art. Etruscan religion was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of augury.

Write highlights for this article: A city official in the remote Brazilian Amazon village of Envira told CNN that five members of the Kulina tribe are on the run after being accused of murdering, butchering and eating a farmer in a ritual act of cannibalism. The village's chief of staff, Maronilton da Silva Clementino, said Kulina tribesmen took the life of Ocelio Alves de Carvalho, 19, last week on the outskirts of Envira, which is in the far western part of Brazil that bumps up against Peru. Portal Amazonia newspaper reported that the Indians escaped after being held for a few hours in the city's police station. No arrest warrants were issued. Brazilian law does not allow the military or civil police to enter Indian lands, Portal Amazonia reported. It is still unknown how many people took part in the alleged cannibalistic ritual, although several Indians have fled into the jungle fearing prosecution, the newspaper Diario do Amazonas reported. Clementino said the victim was herding cattle when he met with a group of Indians who invited him back to their village. \\"They knew each other and they sometimes helped one another. They invited him to their reservation three days ago and he was never seen again,\\" Clementino said. \\"The family decided to go into the reservation and that's when they saw his body quartered and his skull hanging on a tree. It was very tragic for the family,\\" he said. The news of the incident came from the Indians themselves, who apparently bragged about eating the man's organs, Clementino said. Members of the tribe told residents of Envira -- where 190 Kulina families brush shoulders with non-tribal Brazilians -- that they held a cannibalistic ritual in which they cooked the victim's organs, Clementino said. He said Kulina Indians began surrounding the police station where the suspects were briefly interrogated. Villagers told authorities they are incensed by the lack of response from FUNAI, Brazil's National Indian Foundation. \\"The family is very frustrated with the law here, which protects the Indians and doesn't help protect us,\\" he said. \\"They start drinking and local farmers here are afraid who could be next.\\" Clementino said groups Indians -- often outnumbering police -- pose a security threat to locals. He said the man's family are upset that authorities did not arrive until three days later. But a FUNAI official told the newspaper Voz do Acre that access to Envira is very difficult, requiring long boat or helicopter rides. According to FUNAI, about 2,500 Kulina live in Brazil's Acre state, which borders with Peru, where 450 Kulina live. This remote jungle corridor is known for its isolated tribes. The Kulina are classified as an \\"isolated\\" tribe but some have contact with the non-indian population. The Kulina are also known for their complex language. FUNAI studies show that Kulina women speak a completely different language from the men. According to FUNAI, there are 460,000 Indians in Brazil and 1,300 indian languages. There are 55 groups considered to live in isolation. Highlights:","completion":"1. Five members of the Kulina tribe in the Brazilian Amazon are accused of a ritual act of cannibalism. 2.

He noticed that human societies had changed dramatically after the invention of agriculture. But I can use this background: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. What is an answer for this question: Did era A have higher or lower death rate than era B? Answer:","completion":"Era B had a higher death rate than era A. After the invention of agriculture, human societies experienced a shift in their way of living. The increased and more reliable food supply contributed to higher birth rates, as there were more resources to support larger families. However, this also led to the development of settled life in villages and cities, causing crowded living conditions. These conditions facilitated the spread of diseases and the higher concentration of people led to increased exposure to illnesses from domestic animals. As a result, the death rate in era B was higher than in era A, where humans lived in smaller groups as hunter-gatherers with fewer opportunities for disease transmission."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This essential first step sets the stage for the entire hibernation process, as animals must be aware of and prepared for the upcoming harsh weather conditions in order to survive through them. Instinctively, animals recognize the signs of the changing seasons, such as dwindling food supplies, shorter days, and dropping temperatures. As animals notice these cues, they make the necessary adjustments to their behavior and lifestyle, thus initiating the process that leads to hibernation. The anticipation of the seasonal change triggers a series of events within the animal's body. Hormonal and metabolic changes take place, driving the animal to engage in specific behaviors to prepare for the upcoming period of hibernation. These behaviors include: 1. Searching and consuming larger amounts of food to acquire and store energy reserves, primarily in the form of fat, which will sustain the animal during its hibernation. This process is what eventually causes the animal to gain weight. 2. The seasonal change to colder, harsher weather conditions serves as a signal for animals to find a suitable location to hibernate. This could be a cave, a burrow, or a hollow tree, depending on the species. The selected location typically provides safety from predators and insulation from the extreme temperatures outside. 3. As the animal settles into the hibernation site, it begins to enter a state of deep sleep, or torpor. During this time, the animal's metabolic processes slow down dramatically. The heart rate, breathing rate, and body temperature also decrease significantly. 4. While in hibernation, the animal starts drawing upon its fat reserves to maintain its reduced energy needs. Due to the slowed metabolic processes, the animal loses weight more gradually than it would during periods of normal activity. 5. The ability to survive long periods without eating or drinking is another adaptation that allows animals to endure the harsh conditions of winter without causing significant harm to themselves. This unique ability enables animals to conserve the resources they have stored in their bodies and emerge from hibernation healthy and ready for activity once the more favorable conditions of spring arrive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Most people tend to use irons to remove creases from their clothing and bed linen. But one enterprising artist chose to mimic his artistic heroes by doing quite the opposite - using his trusty domestic tool to purposefully crease a white sheet. The technique helped the artist create replicas of masterpieces by classic Dutch painters van Gogh, Rembrandt and Vermeer. Scroll down for video.

The works have all been skilfully recreated to be used in an advert for electrical company Philips in Russia. One of Vincent van Gogh’s most renowned works, Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear and Pipe, is one of the piece's interpreted by the artist using his iron. Known for his distinctive self-portraits, this particular piece captures van Gogh after he famously cut off part of his own ear - although historians have debated whether he was maimed by somebody else. Completed in 1889, the year before his death, the painting shows van Gogh smoking a pipe and wearing a hat. It is currently part of a private collection. Modern art: Rembrandt's classic Self-Portrait with beret and Turned-Up Collar, right, and the version created for Phillips, left. Girl With a Pearl Earring is widely regarded as Johannes Vermeer's best work. It is usually housed in the Mauritshuis gallery, based in The Hague, although the famous painting is currently part of the gallery's touring collection in Japan. A novel of the same name was written by author Tracy Chevalier in 1999 based on the fictional character. A film adaption of the book was released in 2003, starring Scarlett Johansson. The last painting reworked by the artist was Rembrandt’s Self-Portrait with Beret and Turned-Up Collar. The self-portrait has been housed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC since 1937, having been painted by the artist in 1659.

It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi.","completion":"Based on the information provided, Chris is the friend who studied more about fungus-eating ants. Bill knows everything about most ants except Leafcutter ants, while Chris has dedicated years of his life to studying Leafcutter ants extensively and exclusively. Leafcutter ants are an excellent example of ants that feed on fungus, as they have evolved specialized ways of obtaining nutrition through an intricate symbiotic relationship with a particular fungus species that grows within their colonies. This unique relationship makes Leafcutter ants highly reliant on the fungus for their nutrition, which is why Chris's knowledge of these ants is particularly relevant when discussing fungus-eating ants. The ants of this group collect leaves which are later processed and cut into tiny pieces by different worker ants according to their size. These pieces of leaves are then placed in their fungal gardens, where they serve as the substrate for the growth of the specific fungus species that the ants depend on for food. The ants feed on gongylidia, which are structures produced by the fungus, and through this process, the ants show remarkable sensitivity in recognizing the reaction of the fungus to different plant materials, potentially detecting chemical signals from the fungus. In addition, Leafcutter ants showcase another fascinating aspect of symbiosis, as they host symbiotic bacteria on their exterior surfaces that produce antibiotics. These antibiotics are crucial for the health of the fungal gardens, as they eliminate harmful bacteria that could otherwise threaten the fungus' survival. By specializing in the study of Leafcutter ants, Chris has delved deep into the world of fungus-eating ants and their unique relationship with their mutualistic fungi, as well as the role of symbiotic bacteria in this fascinating ecosystem. As a result, Chris is the friend who has studied more about fungus-eating ants compared to Bill."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Cameras were used Friday to seach a well on property in Chetopa, Kansas, formerly owned by a convicted murderer in hopes of finding the remains of Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman or a trace of anything that would help investigators solve the 16-year-old mystery. “The only thing we saw was a old bucket,” said Gary Stansell, an investigator for the district attorney’s office for Craig, Mayes and Rogers counties. Stansell said he continues to get leads on the case. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation classifies the girls’ 1999 disappearance as an ongoing investigation. The three-hour search of the well was initiated after Lorene Bible, Lauria’s mother, received a private message on a social networking site. “The person said come to the old Charlie Krider house and look in the well,” Bible said. Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman disappeared after the teens celebrated Ashley’s 16th birthday with a sleepover at the Freeman family home. In the early morning hours of Dec. 30, 1999, the Freemans’ mobile home in Welch went up in flames, and the charred remains of Ashley’s parents, Danny and Kathy Freeman, were found inside. Both had sustained gunshot wounds that shattered their skulls, according to autopsy reports. The well, covered with a concrete slab, is around 10 miles north of the Freeman property on an empty lot about a block from the main thoroughfare in Chetopa. “There are still people scared of whoever did this,” Lorene Bible said. “The fear for them is still there.” The Chetopa land once was owned by Charles Christian Krider, 54. It was sold after Krider was convicted of second-degree murder in the 2004 death of Judith Schrum, who was strangled before her body was dumped in a Cherokee County creek, according to court documents. Krider is serving a 14-year sentence, and his earliest possible release date is April 13, 2017, records show. He was reported to be a close friend and co-worker of Danny Freeman and had several head of cattle on the Freeman farm, Stansell said. “We’re waiting on the next person who can tell to go look here or you need to go look here,” Lorene Bible said. “I need information that will lead to something good.” Bible said she receives about two or three tips a month that are serious. “The law enforcement has been wonderful — whether in Oklahoma or across the state line in Kansas,” she said. “I’ll go on and see what’s next.” ||||| Fifteen years ago Tuesday, Danny and Kathy Freeman were shot and killed and their mobile home set on fire. Their 16-year-old daughter, Ashley, and her best friend, Lauria Bible, were having a sleepover to celebrate Ashley’s birthday. The teens bodies were not discovered in the charred remains of the mobile home. Working on the premise that intruders kidnapped and possibly killed the teens, law officers began a frustrating, seemingly endless search that spanned the United States, Canada and Mexico. Today, law enforcement officers rattle off their names as one word. Lauria and Ashley. Their story has been profiled locally, statewide and nationally — and yet it remains unsolved. Jay and Lorene Bible, Lauria’s parents, are holding a memorial service Tuesday in Vinita, in hopes that publicity might help stir up memories in the case. “I still believe Lauria is alive,” Lorene Bible said. The Bibles want all the involved law enforcement agencies — the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, the Craig County sheriff’s office, the Craig County district attorney’s office and the FBI — to sit down with them and release all the information and leads they have and work together to solve the case. Surviving members of the Freeman family had Ashley declared legally dead in 2010, according to court records. Meanwhile, investigators say that new leads have surfaced in the past months. Once such item involves two people, presumably men that got into an argument with Danny Freeman two weeks before the shooting deaths, said Gary Stansill, an investigator for the district attorney in Craig, Mayes and Rogers counties. “We learned that Danny told friends that two people came to the Freeman’s residence and there was a heated verbal exchange with one of the men,” Stansill said. Freeman knew one of the men and the other he knew by reputation, the investigator said. “We are not saying they are suspects,” Stansill said. “We just want to talk with them. If they have nothing to do with the missing girls or the killings, that’s OK — we just want to talk with them.” Stansill said he doesn’t know what the meeting was about. “That’s one of the questions we have,” he said. Danny Freeman reportedly had a hand in marijuana sales, family and friends have said in the past. “He (Freeman) did tell friends he had to run the men off and if they came back on his property he would run them off with a gun,” Stansill said. OSBI spokeswoman Jessica Brown said the case is not closed as far as her agency is concerned. Brown said the agency recently received a tip, “and we will run it out to see if it has validity.” Brown said the state agency has investigated “hundreds” of leads and tips over the past 15 years. “Just because it is an old case doesn’t mean it can’t be solved,” Brown said. “We have solved 20- and 30-year-old cases in the past.” Solving the case depends on getting the right lead, she said. “Relationships can change between suspects,” Brown said. What happened? The Freeman’s property is located just outside of the Welch city limits and at that time was identifiable by the mailbox that sat on top of an iron-chain stand. A half-mile dirt driveway was marked with a rock entrance that led to the family home, which was slightly visible at night due to the few pole lights in the area. According to an autopsy report, a shotgun blast sheared off the bottom portion of Danny Freeman’s face and Kathy Freeman was shot in the back of the head and was found by investigators lying face down on the couple’s waterbed. Danny Freeman’s remains were found the next day near the waterbed by the Bibles, who were searching through the ashes. Danny Freeman’s extensive arrowhead collection was never found in the ruble. Lauria Bible’s car was still parked in front of the Freeman mobile home with the keys in the ignition. The teen’s purse, which contained money, was found in the charred remains of the mobile home. OSBI investigators also found a small arsenal of weapons as they searched through the debris of the house. Person of interest Jeremy Jones, 41, a convicted killer and rapist who once lived in Miami, OK, was a person of interest in the Freemans’ deaths. “I believe he knows something about the case,” Lorene Bible said. Arrest records show Jones was arrested on complaints of public drunkenness and possession of drug paraphernalia at 4 a.m. Dec. 30, 1999, roughly 18 miles from the Freeman’s farm. Jones confessed to killing the couple and setting their mobile home on fire over a drug debt and taking the teenagers to Galena, Kan., where he said he shot them and threw their bodies into an abandoned mine. A search of the area in June 2005 turned up nothing, and Jones recanted his confession. He has not been charged in the case. He is now on Alabama’s death row for the murder and rape of a woman from Turnerville, Ala. ||||| By Tiffany Alaniz Quick Facts: Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman disappeared in 1999 Her mother, Lorena, wants anyone who has called tips over 16 years to re-file tips New Facebook page set up to get tips to find Lauria Bible Citing changes in staffing, a mother wants help to strengthen a missing person’s investigation.

Question: \\"What was worshipped in Comte's proposed religion?\\" Context: \\"Eliot and her circle, who included her companion George Henry Lewes (the biographer of Goethe) and the abolitionist and social theorist Harriet Martineau, were much influenced by the positivism of Auguste Comte, whom Martineau had translated. Comte had proposed an atheistic culte founded on human principles – a secular Religion of Humanity (which worshiped the dead, since most humans who have ever lived are dead), complete with holidays and liturgy, modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism. Although Comte's English followers, like Eliot and Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity. Comte's austere vision of the universe, his injunction to \\"vivre pour altrui\\" (\\"live for others\\", from which comes the word \\"altruism\\"), and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and Matthew Arnold to Thomas Hardy.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"In Comte's proposed religion, the Religion of Humanity, the main focus of worship was humanity itself, particularly the dead, as most humans who have ever lived are dead.

Leeuwenhoek developed an interest in microscopy and ground his own lenses to make simple microscopes. Leeuwenhoek was so good at making lenses that his simple microscopes were able to magnify much more clearly than the compound microscopes of his day. His microscope's increased ability to magnify over 200x is comparable to a modern compound light microscope.

As Catholic cardinals meet to select a new pope in Vatican City, President Barack Obama said in an interview that an American pope would rule just as effectively as a pope from another country. ”It seems to me that an American pope would preside just as effectively as a Polish pope or an Italian pope or a Guatemalan pope,” Obama told ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos in an interview recorded Tuesday and portions of which aired Wednesday on “Good Morning America.” Text Size - + reset But would an American pope take orders from him? “I don’t know if you’ve checked lately, but the Conference of Catholic Bishops here in the United States don’t seem to be takin’ orders from me,” Obama said with a laugh.

And that is that we treat everybody as children of God and that we love them the way Jesus Christ taught us to love ’em.” ||||| Cardinal Roger Mahony of the U.S. gestures as he arrives for a meeting at the Synod Hall at the Vatican on March 8, 2013. LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, its former leader Cardinal Roger Mahony and an ex-priest have agreed to pay a total of nearly 10 million to settle four child sex abuse cases brought against them, lawyers for the victims said on Tuesday. Mahony, who retired in 2011 as head of the largest U.S. archdiocese and is now in Rome taking part in choosing a new pope, was accused of helping a confessed pedophile priest evade law enforcement by sending him out of state to a Church-run treatment center, then placing the priest back in the Los Angeles ministry. The defrocked priest named in all four cases is Michael Baker, who ultimately was convicted in 2007 and sent to prison on 12 criminal counts of felony oral copulation with a minor involving two boys who reached a previous settlement with the Church. The latest agreement came four weeks before civil suits brought by two men, now in their 20s, who claimed they were molested as 12-year-olds in the late 1990s, were scheduled to go to trial, plaintiff's attorney Vince Finaldi said. The two other newly settled cases are less recent. One dates to the late 1970s, before Mahony was archbishop, and the other to 1986, not long after he assumed the post, Finaldi said. As part of the settlement, approved by a Los Angeles judge earlier this month, none of the parties admitted wrongdoing. Finaldi said the settlement, together with the recent release of internal Church records documenting the role of Mahony and others in covering up child sexual abuse by the clergy, comes \\"as close to an admission of guilt as you're going to get from the archdiocese.\\" A lawyer for the archdiocese, Michael Hennigan, confirmed a settlement in the amount of 9.99 million was reached. He added that the archdiocese \\"has always taken the position that we were responsible for the conduct of Michael Baker.\\" Mahony has \\"admitted that he made serious mistakes in putting Michael Baker back in the ministry,\\" Hennigan said, but he denied that archdiocese officials were involved in a coverup. Clergy were not legally required under California law to report suspected child abuse to authorities until 1997. Prior to that, Hennigan said, the policy of the archdiocese was to urge families of victims to go to law enforcement on their own. 'NO REASONABLE EXCUSE' Finaldi, however, disputed the notion that Mahony should be absolved of any obligation to alert authorities. \\"You have a priest who is confessing that he sexually molested two kids, and you don't pick up the phone and call police? There's no reasonable excuse for not doing that,\\" he said. Scandals over sex abuse in the U.S. Catholic Church, which erupted in 1992 with a series of molestation cases uncovered in Boston, have cost the Church billions of dollars in settlements and driven prominent dioceses into bankruptcy. The Los Angeles Archdiocese, which serves 4 million Catholics, reached a 660 million civil settlement in 2007 with more than 500 victims of child molestation, marking the biggest such agreement of its kind in the nation. Mahony at that time called the abuse \\"a terrible sin and crime.\\" The archdiocese has reached a handful of settlements in other cases since then, but the one announced on Tuesday was by far the biggest, Finaldi added. In a rare Church rebuke of a cardinal, Mahony was censured in late January by his successor, Archbishop Jose Gomez, and stripped of all public and administrative duties, as punishment for his role in the sex abuse scandal. The censure followed the public release of over 12,000 pages of confidential files unsealed as part of previous civil suits, revealing how numerous known or suspected pedophiles in the clergy were shielded from law enforcement scrutiny by Mahony and other Church officials. But Mahony retained his title as cardinal and his right to take part in the Vatican conclave that selects a new pontiff to replace retired Pope Benedict XVI, an authority he chose to exercise. The resignation of one of Mahony's former top advisers, Thomas Curry, from his post as bishop of Santa Barbara was announced by the archdiocese in conjunction with the censure. The Church personnel files released earlier this year revealed that in addition to sending abusive priests to a Church-run pedophile treatment center in New Mexico, Mahony and Curry sought to keep priests from later revealing their misconduct to private therapists who would have been obligated to report molestation to police. In one such memo about Baker's return to Los Angeles, Curry wrote to Mahony suggesting Baker avoid any mention of \\"his past problem\\" to a therapist after release from the Church treatment program, to which Mahony responded with the handwritten note: \\"Sounds good -- please proceed!!\\" Baker confessed his molestation of two boys to Mahony in 1986, early in Mahony's tenure as archbishop. After six months in treatment, he was placed back in the ministry in the Los Angeles area, supposedly in a job precluding any contact with children, Finaldi said. But according to Finaldi, Baker was assigned to a residence attached to a church that also operated a school.

Black smoke again billowed from the chimney... (Associated Press) In the second day of the conclave, thick black smoke billowed from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel, prompting sighs of disappointment from the thousands of people gathered in a rain-soaked and chilly St. Peter's Square. \\"I'm not happy to see black smoke. We all want white,\\" said the Rev. ThankGod Okoroafor, a Nigerian priest studying theology at Holy Cross University in Rome. \\"But maybe it means that the cardinals need to take time, not to make a mistake in the choice.\\" Cardinals voted twice Wednesday morning in the Vatican's famed frescoed Sistine Chapel following an inaugural vote Tuesday to elect a successor to Benedict XVI, who stunned the Catholic world last month by becoming the first pope in 600 years to resign. The cardinals broke for lunch at the Vatican hotel and planned another two rounds of voting Wednesday afternoon. The drama _ with stage sets by Michelangelo and an outcome that is anyone's guess _ is playing out against the backdrop of the church's need both for a manager who can clean up a corrupt Vatican bureaucracy and a pastor who can revive Catholicism in a time of growing secularism. The difficulty in finding both attributes in one man, some analysts say, means that the world should brace for a long conclave _ or at least one longer than the four ballots it took to elect Benedict in 2005. \\"We have not had a conclave over five days since 1831,\\" noted the Rev. Thomas Reese, author of \\"Inside the Vatican,\\" a bible of sorts for understanding the Vatican bureaucracy. \\"So if they are in there over five days, we know they are in trouble; they are having a hard time forming consensus around a particular person.\\" The names mentioned most often as \\"papabile\\" _ a cardinal who has the stuff of a pope _ include Cardinal Angelo Scola, the archbishop of Milan, an intellect in the vein of Benedict but with a more outgoing personality, and Cardinal Marc Ouellet, the Canadian head of the Vatican's important bishops' office who is also scholarly but reserved like Benedict. Brazilian Cardinal Odilo Scherer is liked by the Vatican bureaucracy but not by all of his countrymen. And Cardinal Peter Erdo of Hungary has the backing of European cardinals who have twice elected him as head of the European bishops' conference. On the more pastoral side is Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston, the favorite of the Italian press, and Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the back-slapping, outgoing archbishop of New York who has admitted himself that his Italian is pretty bad _ a drawback for a job that is conducted almost exclusively in the language. Thousands of people braved a chilly rain on Wednesday morning to watch the 6-foot- (2-meter-) high copper chimney on the chapel roof for the smoke signals telling them whether the cardinals had settled on a choice. Nuns recited the rosary, while children splashed in puddles. After the smoke poured out, the crowds began to dissipate, though a few hangers-on appeared ready to wait out the afternoon balloting. \\"The more we wait, the better chance we have of having a surprise,\\" said Ludovic de Vernejouls, a 21-year-old Parisian studying architecture in Rome. Unlike the confusion that reigned during the 2005 conclave, the smoke this time around has been clearly black _ thanks to special smoke flares akin to those used in soccer matches or protests that were lit in the chapel ovens to make the burned ballots black. The cardinals spent the night sequestered in the Vatican's Santa Marta hotel, an impersonal modern hotel on the edge of the Vatican gardens. They have no access to television, newspapers, cellphones or computers, and the hotel staff has taken an oath of secrecy to not reveal anything they see or hear. The actual vote takes place in far more evocative surroundings: the Sistine Chapel frescoed by Michelangelo in the 16th century with scenes of \\"Creation\\" and \\"The Last Judgment.\\" ___ Follow Nicole Winfield at www.twitter.com/nwinfield ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"President Barack Obama expressed in an interview that an American pope would be just as effective as a pope from another country, emphasizing that the central message of the gospel, treating everyone as children of God, should be maintained and sustained.

Home Is Where the Green Card Is I ENTERED the green card lottery in the fall of 2010. It was a surprisingly simple form, composed mostly of questions on contact information, but a box that read “Country Claimed” gave me pause. Most applicants write in wherever they were born, but for me it was a bit more complicated; I could not, in good faith, claim any country as my own. I was born in Canada on July 19, 1986. My Iranian-born parents (of Armenian and Russian extraction) were living in Geneva at the time, but Switzerland grants citizenship only to the children of naturalized citizens. My parents, who both worked for the United Nations, didn’t know if they would live there long enough to meet the residency requirements. I was destined to inherit an Iranian passport, and they knew all too well the lifetime of travel and work restrictions that would entail. So they came up with a third-country solution. My mother would fly to Vancouver, British Columbia, wearing an oversize raincoat just weeks before her due date. She would give birth at a local hospital, stay with her brother, who lived there, until my paperwork was processed, and return to Geneva with a Canadian baby in tow. It worked so well that she repeated the process four years later with my brother. My mother was finally naturalized when I was 8, so I was able to become a Swiss citizen after all. But my papers were, once again, misleading. Growing up, I spoke four languages at home — Armenian with my father, Russian with my mother and English and French with baby sitters — and attended international schools in which no one cared where you were from unless it was during the World Cup. I lived in Switzerland, but for all intents and purposes, I grew up on international soil. When I went to college in New York, I was invited to Armenian events on the basis of my last name and Iranian ones on account of my first name, and I didn’t think too much about where I came from. I was busy making friends and falling in love with the city. I spent summers working here, and it was the first place I’d ever lived that felt like home to me. Having spent my entire (albeit short) adult life here, I couldn’t imagine leaving. So when I graduated, I found myself in need of a work visa. There are several types of visas under which foreigners can work here, from seasonal farm work programs to O visas for “extraordinary aliens” — Nobel Prize winners, celebrities and occasionally writers. For someone like me, just starting out in a career, this one was a long shot. The most common visa among college graduates is the H1-B. But the application process takes months, and the employer is required to shell out thousands of dollars in legal fees to pay for sponsorship. The foreigner’s legal status in the country also depends on maintaining his or her employment. When I graduated, right before the Great Recession, no one was sponsoring. I asked a lawyer if there was anything I could do to stay. He took my 100 consultation fee and asked if I had a boyfriend I could marry. I left. But I had no idea where to go. I felt like a foreigner in Geneva, and most of my friends had left. I’d spent no time in Canada. I had nothing in Iran. I tried out Russia for size, but lasted barely six weeks (life advice: don’t go to Russia if you’re depressed). Eventually, I found a job at an international organization in Paris and spent the year Skyping with my New York friends, listening to WNYC reruns on my laptop and applying to graduate schools back in the United States. Had I not had the good fortune and the funds to go back to school, I don’t know where in the world I’d be. In 2010, I was able to return to New York for a master’s program in journalism, and I spent that year working harder than I ever had before. I would have to make up for my nationality with labor and talent, a school counselor told me. When I interviewed for jobs, I felt like a leper.

Glen Grunwald, Former Knicks G.M., Is Not Gloating (but He Could) HAMILTON, Ontario — In Glen Grunwald’s new office at McMaster University’s athletic center, his walls are adorned with a colorful abstract of a fruit vendor, on loan from the university’s art museum, and a framed newspaper clipping about the university’s football team. In spite of Grunwald’s 22-year career as an N.B.A. executive with the Denver Nuggets, the Toronto Raptors and, most recently, the Knicks, the room is remarkably bereft of basketball souvenirs and memorabilia. It is as if the office was decorated for a man not all that interested in the past. The lone memento from that period, a blue banner commemorating the Knicks’ 2012-13 Atlantic Division title, remains rolled up on the floor. “What do you do with it?” Grunwald, the former Knicks general manager, wondered during a recent interview. “I don’t think it’s appropriate for here.” Grunwald, 56, took over in August as athletic director at this midsize university in an unglamorous steel town of roughly half a million people 40 miles west of Toronto. By then, it had been nearly a year since the Knicks had unexpectedly pushed him out of his job despite two straight winning seasons, in 2011-12 and 2012-13, and a run to Game 6 of the 2013 Eastern Conference semifinals. With the Knicks now in the midst of a disastrous season that could turn out to be the worst in their history, Grunwald’s two years at the helm look more impressive by the day. With him as general manager, the Knicks went 90-58, including a division-winning 54-28 mark in 2012-13. It was the first time in 13 years that the Knicks had won as many as 50 games in a season. Not only that, it was Grunwald who had the hunch to scoop up Jeremy Lin, an undrafted N.B.A. castoff, leading to New York’s brief, but beloved, era of Linsanity. And he had the sound judgment to acquire Tyson Chandler, who became a pillar, for the most part, in his three seasons with the Knicks. The acquisition of J. R. Smith was also a coup for Grunwald and the Knicks — at least until last season. True, his 2013 trade for Toronto’s Andrea Bargnani was a dud from the start. Still, no general manager connects on every trade, and Grunwald, known for his expertise with the salary cap and an approach that was all facts and no flash, did well enough to look back with satisfaction. Nothing, it should be emphasized, has gotten better since he left. Only worse. Which is not to say that he gloated when asked about the Knicks, of whom he spoke carefully. “I follow the Knicks; I follow the Raptors,” he said at one point. “Obviously, it’s easier to be a Raptors fan these days than it is a Knicks fan.” Grunwald had a somewhat distinctive pedigree for an N.B.A. executive. He never played beyond college — he was a teammate of Isiah Thomas’s at Indiana — and he is a lawyer, with a degree from Northwestern. He began his N.B.A. career in 1990 as vice president and general counsel of the Nuggets, and then joined the Raptors as a front-office executive in 1994, working under Thomas, who by then was an old friend. When Thomas departed in 1997, Grunwald replaced him as the Raptors’ general manager and stayed until 2004. Two years later, Thomas recruited him to come to New York and help in his wobbly efforts to turn around the Knicks. The turnaround never took place, but when Thomas was pushed aside in 2008, replaced by Donnie Walsh, Grunwald remained as vice president for basketball operations. And in June 2011, when Walsh stepped down, Grunwald, as he had in Toronto, stepped up. First, he was named the interim general manager, and later the permanent one. He did not have Thomas’s glamour, nor Walsh’s long-established reputation, but in the unpredictable, sometimes volatile, world of the Knicks, he achieved more success than either Thomas or Walsh. “He was perfectly groomed,” said Walsh, who is now back in Indiana, again helping to run the Pacers. With the Knicks, he said, Grunwald was his right-hand man, “the guy making the calls to other teams, seeing what interests there were in trades.” “He’s smart, tactful, a real win-win negotiator,” said Dallas Mavericks General Manager Donnie Nelson, who executed the deal with Grunwald that shipped Chandler to New York in 2011. “He knows the business cold.” What Grunwald did not see coming, however, was the decision by James L. Dolan, the Knicks’ owner, to dump him on the eve of the team’s 2013 training camp, replacing him with a former club executive, Steve Mills. The Knicks never stated a reason for the move, although some attributed it to Dolan’s belief that Mills would be a more polished, and perhaps stylish, person to lead the team’s pursuit of free agents. To Grunwald, the whole thing remains hard to fathom. “I thought I’d done a really good job in New York and I thought I had helped improve the culture,” he said. “Jim just didn’t think I was the guy.” Looking back, and still speaking carefully, Grunwald said he felt he had a “good working relationship” with Dolan, who has often been accused of being a meddling owner. “I thought we had honest discussions,” Grunwald added. “No, we didn’t agree on everything.” As the Knicks stumbled in their first season under Mills, their good vibes from the season before all gone, Grunwald combed the basketball wilderness, meeting, he said, with three Western Conference teams — Oklahoma City, San Antonio and Dallas — to talk about front-office positions. He interviewed unsuccessfully for the athletic director’s post at Stony Brook University. Mills did not even make it through a full season as Grunwald’s successor, pushed aside by Dolan’s hiring of Phil Jackson in March. Three months after that shake-up, Grunwald got a call from a headhunter leading McMaster’s search, asking if he could recommend replacements for the departing athletic director. The Chicago-born Grunwald, who became a Canadian citizen 15 years ago, was familiar with the university from his time in Toronto. So he threw his name into the hat. Despite the comedown from the Garden to a university where he steers a budget of roughly 12 million, Grunwald declines to view the change in job assignments as some sort of fall from grace. Running a university athletics department, he said, had been something that had intrigued him since his playing days at Indiana, with whom he won a national championship in 1981. “The opportunity to give back, to thank the people that helped me through my student-athlete days and to help this generation of student-athletes is really what excited me about it,” he said. He oversees a student-athlete body of 700, as well as the second-ranked football program in Canadian university sports and highly regarded teams in men’s and women’s basketball. And he is learning the rules of rugby as quickly as he can because McMaster’s women reached the national finals last month. Grunwald acknowledged that one of McMaster’s concerns during the hiring process was whether he would decamp if a more prestigious offer came about, particularly from the N.B.A. While he has no fixed contract with the university, he insisted he was not pining for a return to professional basketball. But he is not closed to the possibility, and he grew pensive when asked about those who view his current job as evidence he is no longer cut out for the N.B.A. “I think my record speaks for itself,” he said in a rare moment of self-promotion. “People tell me I have a good reputation, but whether that’s just people being nice to me, or in fact it’s true, I don’t know.” What he does know, of course, is that the Knicks won 54 games two seasons ago and are unlikely to win half that many this time around.

The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators. This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley, which could house more than 70,000 spectators.

Title: Blood and Black Lace Movie plot: At a chic 'haute couture' fashion house in Rome, model Isabella (Francesca Ungaro) is brutally murdered one night during a raging thunderstorm by a mysterious figure dressed in black, wearing a mask. The body is discovered locked in a storage locker by the owner: the recently widowed Countess Christina Como (Eva Bartok), which is managed by Massimo Morlacchi (Cameron Mitchell). Inspector Silvestri (Thomas Reiner), an arrogant police detective, arrives to take charge of the murder investigation. Silvestri soon discovers that the fashion house is a hotbed to drugs, corruption, and blackmail. The suspects include Massimo, the wealthy Ricardo Morellin (Frnaco Ressel), who was having an affair with Isabella, the dress designer Cesar Lazzarini (Louis Pigot), and Isabella's boyfriend Frank (Dante Di Paolo) an antique shop owner who sold cocaine to some of the models on a daily basis, as well as the handyman Marco (Massimo Righi).The following evening during a fashion show, when it is discovered that Isabella kept a diary which detailed most of the indiscretions, everyone is thrown into a quandary.

Question: Why are specific seasons for bow hunting established?

Step 1: Identify the main question. \\"Why are specific seasons for bow hunting established?\\" Step 2: Understand the context and possible reasons. There may be several reasons for establishing specific seasons for bow hunting, such as conservation efforts, population control, maintaining ecological balance, and ensuring hunter safety. Step 3: Analyze the provided statement. \\"Regulations for big-game hunting often specify a minimum caliber or muzzle energy for firearms.\\" This statement is about firearms regulations, not bow hunting seasons. While it's true that hunting regulations often specify requirements for certain types of hunting, this statement does not directly answer the question about why specific seasons for bow hunting are established. Step 4: Refute the provided statement. The given statement does not adequately answer the main question. By focusing exclusively on firearm regulations, it does not address the fundamental reasons behind establishing specific bow hunting seasons. Step 5: Provide a justified explanation. Specific seasons for bow hunting are established for several reasons, including: 1. Wildlife conservation: Different species breed and rear their young at various times of the year. Limiting hunting to specific seasons helps protect populations during their vulnerable life stages, ensuring population stability and promoting healthy ecosystems. 2. Population control: Bow hunting seasons can be timed to prevent overpopulation in certain areas. For example, allowing hunting only after the breeding season reduces the number of animals without affecting the yearly reproduction cycle. 3. Ecological balance: Maintaining specific hunting seasons helps preserve the balance within ecosystems by managing species populations and avoiding detrimental effects on other plants and animals. 4. Hunter safety: Bow hunting requires different skills and techniques than firearm hunting. Establishing specific seasons for bow hunting reduces the risk of accidents and ensures that hunters can enjoy a safer experience.

Does it follow that \\"Only the white horses were hunted at first. \\"?","completion":"Based on the given information, it's not possible to definitively determine if \\"Only the white horses were hunted at first.\\" However, I can provide additional context and possible implications of the statement within the wider discussion of horse hunting on the Texas plains. Firstly, it is important to understand the broader context of horse hunting during the period, as it may provide some clues about the preference for white horses. Historically, during the 19th century, the Texas plains were home to a diverse range of wild horses that were the descendants of domesticated horses brought to the Americas by Spanish explorers. These horses, commonly known as Mustangs, were highly sought after for their endurance, speed, and agility. As a result, horse hunting and capturing wild horses for various purposes became a significant part of the settlers' and native tribes' way of life in the area. If it's true that \\"Only the white horses were hunted at first,\\" this could imply that the hunters could have had specific reasons for singling out white horses in their initial hunts. Some possible explanations for this preference could include: 1. Rarity and Symbolism: White horses are relatively less common compared to other colors. As a result, their rarity might have made them more desirable to catch and own. Additionally, many cultures attach symbolic meaning to white horses, often regarding them as a sign of purity, power, or nobility. This cultural significance could also have been a motivating factor behind hunting primarily white horses. 2. Visibility and Ease of Tracking: Given the vast expanses of the Texas plains, visibility and recognition of wild horses from a distance would have been of utmost importance to hunters. White horses, due to their prominent color, would have stood out in contrast to the more common, darker-colored horses, making them easier to track and spot from afar. However, it is crucial to remember that these are just speculations, and the provided information does not necessarily confirm that \\"Only the white horses were hunted at first.\\" To reach a more accurate conclusion, more context and details about Anse's stories and the specific circumstances surrounding the horse hunting practices on the Texas plains would be necessary."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Earths magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms. It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations.

Taking up a weapon, the distraught young Abe tells his mother that he loves her before beheading her. He then joins others in his community in containing a local zombie outbreak.In August 1863, when an adult Abraham Lincoln (Bill Oberst Jr.) has become President of a fracturing United States, he is apprised of rumors concerning a prominent Confederate stronghold. He is told that a regiment of 30 men had gone to Confederate Fort Pulaski to seize it from the Confederates and only one man returned barely alive. When questioning the survivor, Lincoln discovers the soldier has an illness that seems to bring corpses back to life. He then personally leads a team of the newly established Secret Service to accompany him in investigating the fort in the Deep South.They get to the fort and are attacked by Confederate survivers led by the one-armed General Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson (Don McGraw) (who did not die at the battle of Chancelorville but just lost his right arm) as well as by several of the infected people.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the band John's suggested could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future? In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the type of whale that can weigh up to 190 metric tons? is inside the article: Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of \\"smell\\", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that..., can you guess it ?

Iwasaki's careful respect for the Long Beach program and its lawyers earned him the political capital he needed to complete his takeover in a matter of weeks. \\"The Long Beach program had strong support in the community so in a situation like that, one has to recognize that it's not like a takeover where I have all the answers and I know best,\\" Iwasaki said. \\"The people in the community who are working there have the contacts and the knowledge that will allow service to continue.\\" Things have gone less smoothly across town. There, Dudovitz, a longtime poverty lawyer and executive director of the San Fernando Valley's 36-year-old legal aid program, continues to struggle with his hostile takeover of the neighboring San Gabriel-Pomona Valleys service area one year after it was accomplished. On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. \\"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. \\"There are very few people who come out as the heroes.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? (CNN) -- Playing cards with images of Hitler. Toy fuhrers. And a lamp and church tapestry with swastikas emblazoned across the front. No, it's not a neo-Nazi convention. Rather, it is a groundbreaking exhibit that opened Friday in the German capital and is intended to show Adolf Hitler's relationship with the German people. Germany has produced exhibits on the Holocaust and Nazism before but never since World War II has one focused solely on the man who taught an entire nation to hate. \\"Hitler and the Germans\\" is not about the fascist dictator's memorabilia, not about the man himself, said curator Hans-Ulrech Thamer. It's not about textbook history or scholarly writings. Thamer hopes viewers -- many of whom are sure to be","completion":"shocked and disturbed by the contents -- will come away from the exhibit with a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics between Hitler and the German population during his rise to power and reign. By displaying these controversial artifacts and symbols, the exhibit aims to explore how Hitler was able to manipulate and control the people, and how a nation collectively fell under his spell. It serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of totalitarianism and the consequences of blind obedience to a single leader. Visitors to the \\"Hitler and the Germans\\" exhibit can expect to be confronted with challenging questions about how a society was so easily swayed by one man and his extreme ideologies. Through examining Hitler's influence on popular culture, everyday objects, and national sentiment, the curator hopes to prompt reflection and discussion on how these factors allowed for the widespread acceptance of hateful beliefs and ultimately, the atrocities committed during the Holocaust. The exhibit serves as a cautionary tale, urging individuals to remain vigilant in recognizing and standing up against hateful ideologies, no matter where they appear."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1949, the Territory and the Territory of Papua were established in an administrative union by the name of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. That administrative union was renamed as Papua New Guinea in 1971. Notwithstanding that it was part of an administrative union, the Territory of New Guinea at all times retained a distinct legal status and identity until the advent of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea. - Rabaul is a township in East New Britain province, on the island of New Britain, in the country of Papua New Guinea. New Britain is an island about 60 kilometres to the east of the island of New Guinea. Rabaul was the provincial capital and most important settlement in the province until it was destroyed in 1994 by falling ash of a volcanic eruption. - New Britain, is the largest island in the Bismarck Archipelago (named after Otto von Bismarck) of Papua New Guinea. It is separated from the island of New Guinea by the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits and from New Ireland by St. George's Channel. The main towns of New Britain are Rabaul/Kokopo and Kimbe. The island is roughly the size of Taiwan. While the island was part of German New Guinea, it was named Neupommern (\\"New Pomerania\\"). - Kimbe is the capital of the province of West New Britain in Papua New Guinea. It is a port town on the great Kimbe Bay which boasts more than 60 percent of the coral species of the entire Indo-Pacific. The bustling town of Kimbe is the third largest port in Papua New Guinea and is the fastest growing city in the South Pacific. Accommodation in Kimbe is readily available in many high-class resorts and hotels, as well as many budget guesthouses and motels dribbled along the province. The town of Kimbe is served by Hoskins Airport. - Vitiaz Strait is a strait between New Britain and the Huon Peninsula, northern New Guinea. - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack. - German New Guinea was the first part of the German colonial empire. It was a protectorate from 1884 until 1914 when it fell to Australian forces following the outbreak of the First World War. It consisted of the northeastern part of New Guinea and several nearby island groups. The mainland part of German New Guinea and the nearby islands of the Bismarck Archipelago and the North Solomon Islands are now part of Papua New Guinea. The Micronesian islands of German New Guinea are now governed as the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, the Northern Mariana Islands and Palau. - Operation Cartwheel (19431944) was a major military strategy for the Allies in the Pacific theater of World War II. Cartwheel was a twin-axis of advance operation, aimed at militarily neutralizing the major Japanese base at Rabaul. The operation was directed by the Supreme Allied Commander in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA)General Douglas MacArthurwhose forces advanced along the northeast coast of New Guinea and occupied nearby islands. Allied forces from the Pacific Ocean Areas commandunder Admiral Chester W. Nimitzadvanced through the Solomon Islands toward Bougainville. The Allied forces involved were from Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the US and various Pacific Islands. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - Cape Gloucester (also known as Tuluvu) is a headland on the northern side of the far west of the island of New Britain, Papua New Guinea. During World War II, the Japanese captured New Britain, and had driven most of Cape Gloucester's native population out to construct two airfields. During the New Britain Campaign, American forces had decided to capture Cape Gloucester for its two airfields, to assist planned attacks on the garrison on Rabaul, an important area in New Britain. It became the site of the Battle of Cape Gloucester, part of Operation Cartwheel, in 1943. After long fighting through rain, and Japanese, the United States 1st Marine Division had it declared secured. After the war, the headland was given back to the natives. - Papua New Guinea (PNG Hiri Motu: \\"Papua Niu Gini\\"), officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, is an Oceanian country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia, a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia.

Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - Otto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg (1 April 1815 30 July 1898), known as Otto von Bismarck, was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890. In the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that unified the German states, significantly and deliberately excluding Austria, into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership. With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who \\"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers.\\" - The Bismarck Archipelago is a group of islands off the northeastern coast of New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean and is part of the Islands Region of Papua New Guinea. Its area is about 50,000 square km. - Kokopo is the capital of East New Britain in Papua New Guinea. The capital was moved from Rabaul in 1994 when the volcanoes Tavurvur and Vulcan erupted. As a result, the population of the town increased more than sixfold from 3,150 in 1990 to 20,262 in 2000. - Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbors include China (officially the People's Republic of China, abbreviated as PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy. - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region. - The Territory of Papua comprised the southeastern quarter of the island of New Guinea from 1883 to 1975. In 1883, the Government of Queensland annexed this territory for the British Empire. The United Kingdom Government refused to ratify the annexation but in 1884 a Protectorate was proclaimed over the territory, then called \\"British New Guinea\\". There is a certain ambiguity about the exact date on which the entire territory was annexed by the British. The Papua Act 1905 recites that this happened \\"on or about\\" 4 September 1888. On 18 March 1902, the Territory was placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia. Resolutions of acceptance were passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, who accepted the territory under the name of Papua.

Place of worship - The phrase \\"place of worship\\" acts as the central subject of the sentence and it is the focus of the statement. It refers to a location, typically a building or a designated area, intended for the purpose of religious practices such as praying, meditating, or participating in religious ceremonies. Examples of places of worship include churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues. The importance of this phrase is that it immediately sets the context and subject matter – that we are discussing a location intended for religious purposes. 2. Surrounded - \\"Surrounded\\" is the main verb of the sentence and describes a specific relationship between the place of worship and the park mentioned later in the sentence. In this context, it means that the place of worship is enclosed or encircled by the park on all sides. By using \\"surrounded,\\" the sentence is able to paint a very specific and vivid image of the relationship between the two main elements of the sentence. 3. Beautiful - \\"Beautiful\\" is an adjective that adds a descriptive quality to the park mentioned in the phrase \\"beautiful park.\\" By describing the park as beautiful, the sentence conveys the aesthetic appeal and pleasant nature of the park.

I will try to solve the given instance step by step. Step 1: Understand the question. In this case, we have a series of Persian numbers: ۲۹ ۱۳ ۸ ۵. We need to find the missing number, denoted by \\"و؟و\\". Step 2: Identify the pattern in the series. The most apparent pattern seems to be a decreasing series. Let's subtract the first two numbers to determine the difference: ۲۹ - ۱۳ = ۱۶ Step 3: Subtract the second and third numbers to make sure the pattern holds: ۱۳ - ۸ = ۵ Step 4: We notice that the difference in the two subtractions (۱۶ and ۵) is ۱۱. Let's apply this decrease to the next subtraction: ۵ - ۱۱ = -۶ Step 5: The missing number should be ۵ - ۵ (the difference between ۱۳ and ۸) which is 0, but since we've got a negative number (-۶) in our calculation and there's no 0 among the options, it is possible, we have an error in identifying the pattern or the pattern is not straightforward. Step 6: Review the problem and try to identify another pattern. The numbers look like this in the Latin numeral system: 29 و؟و 13 8 5 Notice that the initial pattern could also be derived by switching the Persian digits in the numbers, like this: 2 -> 1 (2 to 1) 9 -> 3 (from 9 to 3 which is 6 subtracts) Another way to think about this pattern is the decrease of the digit subtracts: 2-1=1, 9-3=6, 1-6=5, now we can apply pattern to 8 Step 7: Apply the new pattern to the remaining number ۸ - ۵ = ۳ Step 8: Find the option with the calculated number.

Increase your intake of dietary potassium. Talk to your doctor about adding supplements to your diet.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: The Path to a Healthier Lifestyle: Adopting a Balanced and Nutritional Diet Introduction The importance of maintaining a healthy diet cannot be overstated. It is well understood that a proper diet can work wonders for our mental and physical well-being. A healthy diet not only helps in preventing and controlling various health issues but also enables us to lead an active and fulfilling lifestyle. In this article, we will explore the key components of a balanced and nutritional diet, including foods that are high in fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and potassium. Alongside, we underscore the significance of consulting a doctor before incorporating supplements into your dietary routine. A Moderate, Lean Diet: The Foundation of a Healthy Lifestyle A balanced diet typically consists of an appropriate mix of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals to meet our body's daily requirements. When we talk about a moderate, lean diet, we refer to the consumption of nutrient-dense foods that are low in fat and sugar. Implementing such a diet involves the following steps: 1. Limiting the intake of foods high in sugar and fat: High sugar and fatty food items can lead to weight gain, increase cholesterol levels, and even contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as heart ailments and diabetes. It is crucial to substitute these items with healthier alternatives, including whole grain products, lean protein sources, and fresh fruits and vegetables. 2. Increasing fiber intake: A fiber-rich diet helps regulate digestion, lowers cholesterol levels, and reduces the risk of developing colorectal cancer. Foods containing high fiber levels include whole grain bread and pasta, beans, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. Aim to consume around 25 to 38 grams of fiber per day, depending on your age and gender. 3. Incorporating omega-3 fatty acids: Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for healthy brain function and reducing inflammation in the body. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids include fatty fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel, and sardines), walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds. 4. Enhancing dietary potassium: Potassium is an essential mineral that helps maintain proper functioning of cells, nerves, and muscles. Additionally, it contributes to lowering blood pressure. Foods abundant in potassium include leafy green vegetables, bananas, potatoes, and yogurt. 5. Discussing supplements with your doctor: As the saying goes, there's no one-size-fits-all when it comes to dietary requirements, and this applies to supplementation too. It's essential to talk to your physician about what vitamins and minerals are necessary to complement your diet and whether you require specific supplements to help you reach optimal health. Conclusion Embarking on the journey to a healthier lifestyle may seem daunting, but by making small, sustainable changes to your diet, you can achieve significant benefits in your overall well-being. By focusing on a moderate, lean diet and incorporating nutrient-dense, wholesome foods, one can improve physical health, increase energy levels, and promote mental clarity. Remember, consulting with a healthcare professional is crucial when considering supplements, as individual needs may vary. Embrace the path to a healthier and more balanced lifestyle with these dietary changes, and celebrate the transformative, long-lasting effects on your well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Decide on the location for two different stations: one for your tent and one for your cooking station. Keep a safe distance between your cooking station and your tent, just to lower the chances of wildlife poking around your tent. Set up your tent according to the instructions once you’ve decided where you’d like to place it, and lay out your sleeping pads, bags, blankets, and pillows. If you’ve never set up a tent before, it might be a good idea to take a stab at it before your trip. Most tents come with detailed instructions and aren’t very difficult to erect, so just be patient and it’ll get done in no time! Get your cooking area set up about 200 feet (61 m) away from your tent. Check your location’s rules to see if you need to set up a bear box or bag to hold your food. Keep all food containers closed when you’re not using them, and dispose of trash as soon as you can. If you’re backpacking, put all trash into a resealable bag so its scent doesn’t travel far. Plan on wearing different clothes when you cook, especially if you’ll be grilling meat. Wear a jacket or top that you can leave with your food instead of taking it back to the tent. A greasy, smoky shirt that smells like hamburger might be a temptation to prowling creatures. Once you’ve put up your tent, take a walk around the campsite to figure out how far away the amenities are. If you’re backpacking, it’s really important to establish where you’ll go to the bathroom, how to get to water, and where the firewood is before the sun sets. Once nighttime comes and you’re using a flashlight to get around, you’ll be glad to know the general direction you need to go. For men and boys, peeing on the trees can be a fun and convenient part of any camping trip - especially at night, when facilities are a long distance away, or if there is a limited supply of facilities for defecation and/or female campers. The only restrictions are that you use common sense when you do this and always go at least 200 feet away from a water source. in a safe and appropriate spot when you’re ready for it. If you’re at a campsite, there may be a specific place where you need to make your fires, like a fire pit. If you’re out in the woods, create your own fire pit that is at least 8 feet (2.4 m) away from dead grass and other vegetation. Dig down into the dirt 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) and create a mound of dirt around the hole to act as a wall. You can also put rocks around the dirt area to enclose it and keep the fire in place. Every fire needs tinder, kindling, and firewood. Tinder is something small, like pieces of cardboard, lint, or wood shavings. Kindling is made up of small twigs and branches. Firewood can be whole or split logs, and it always needs to be dry. Once you have your campsite set up, take a moment to say “hi” to anyone who is camping near you. You might make some new friends, and it’s helpful to be familiar with who is nearby in case either of you needs help at some point. It can be exhausting just setting up camp, so take a load off, have a snack, and rest for a little while before moving on to your first activity. If you’re camping with pets, take them around the campsite and let them smell everything. There are lots of new scents and it’ll help them calm down if they can explore a little.","completion":"To have an enjoyable and safe camping experience, it is crucial to set up your campsite properly while there's still daylight available. First, choose two different locations for your tent and cooking station, maintaining a safe distance between them to reduce the likelihood of wildlife coming near your sleeping area. When setting up the tent, follow the provided instructions and ensure you have your sleeping essentials such as pads, bags, blankets, and pillows. It is advisable to practice setting up your tent prior to your trip if you are inexperienced. Your cooking area should ideally be set up about 200 feet (61 m) away from the tent. Comply with the campsite's rules, store food securely in a bear box or bag if necessary, and dispose of trash promptly. When preparing meals, consider wearing different clothing that you will not be taking back to the tent, as this may attract animals due to the scent. Familiarize yourself with the campsite’s amenities, such as bathroom facilities, water sources, and firewood; this will be beneficial once darkness falls. When it comes to using the washroom outdoors, remember to use common sense and maintain a distance of at least 200 feet from water sources. For creating a fire, follow the campsite-specific guidelines or, if in the woods, establish your fire pit at a safe distance from vegetation. Prepare essential fire components such as tinder, kindling, and dry firewood. Once your campsite is set up, take the time to greet nearby campers, which can create a sense of camaraderie and help establish support networks in case of emergencies. After setting up your camp, take a break to relax and recharge before commencing other camping activities. In case you are camping with pets, let them explore the area and familiarize themselves with the new surroundings to feel more at ease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. and the situation: Michael and his brother Brandon grew up in the same house together.

It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ...

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: How are the aliens powering their powerful equipment? Using stolen grid power. Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"The Gridbreakers\\" Genre: Sci-Fi, Action & Adventure Plot: In a not-so-distant future, Earth's environment is critically deteriorating due to climate change and overuse of fossil fuels. Humanity desperately seeks out new renewable energy sources in order to preserve our planet. Responding to an urgent call for help, top scientists across the globe collaborate to bring the entire Earth's power system onto a single, unified energy grid which they believe will offer a sustainable and efficient energy source. Unbeknownst to mankind, an advanced alien species, known as the Xylarions, have been monitoring Earth for centuries, and they are facing an energy crisis of their own. Their once-powerful energy reactors on their home planet, Xylaria, have begun failing rapidly, putting their entire civilization at risk. In desperate need of new energy sources to power their advanced technology and stabilize their planet, the Xylarions plan a covert mission to infiltrate Earth. Upon learning of the new unified energy grid, the aliens realize it presents them with the perfect opportunity to siphon energy for their dying planet. Implanted into human bodies, they blend into society and strategically position themselves as engineers, technicians, and operators within key power facilities connected to the unified grid. Utilizing advanced alien technology, they begin to discreetly divert a portion of Earth's power away from the grid and onto hidden reservoirs which transmit the energy back to their home planet. As Earth's energy consumption mysteriously increases and blackouts become more frequent, the scientific community grows increasingly alarmed. Fearing the grid could collapse completely, they assign an elite team of investigators, led by the brilliant yet eccentric Dr. Eve Ramirez, to uncover the cause of these mysterious power drains. As Dr. Ramirez and her team delve into the case, they inadvertently stumble upon evidence of extraterrestrial involvement. Racing against time, they must come to terms with the shocking reality of alien infiltration and uncover the full extent of the Xylarions' power-stealing operation. As the unified grid approaches its breaking point, drastic measures are called for: a tense alliance between humans and a sympathetic group of Xylarion defectors arises. These defectors, who believe in coexistence, propose a solution: introducing Earth to abundant, sustainable energy technologies that can power both Earth and Xylaria, eliminating both civilizations' energy crises. With Earth's society and the entire alien civilization hanging in the balance, Dr. Ramirez and the unexpected Xylarion allies must confront the sinister alien operatives on Earth, bring their power-stealing operation to a halt, and introduce the advanced technology to power the unified grid sustainably—for the greater good of both races and planets alike. In a thrilling climax, both humans and Xylarions come together to overcome their differences and work as one, ultimately uniting their worlds and securing a promising future for both species. The journey they embark upon will not only save their planets but also foster an era of unprecedented intergalactic cooperation and technological innovation, turning a potential catastrophe into an opportunity for revolutionary advancements that bridge the cosmos."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Process: - A larva is born - The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - The caterpillar becomes a pupa - After some time the cocoon hatches - And a butterfly is born. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose plenty of food to eat happens, how will it affect more cocoons hatch. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The process you've described is the life cycle of a butterfly, which includes the following stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis/cocoon), and adult (butterfly). Perturbation Hypothesis: If there is plenty of food available for the caterpillar, will it affect the number of cocoons that hatch? Yes, the availability of food does have a direct effect on the life cycle of a butterfly. When there is an ample food supply for caterpillars, it can impact their survival rate and the number of cocoons formed in several ways: 1. Increased survival rate: Caterpillars rely on leaves and other plant matter as their main food source. If there is plenty of food available, a larger number of caterpillars can survive to the next stage of their life cycle. This leads to a higher number of cocoons being formed. 2. Faster growth: With a sufficient food supply, caterpillars grow more rapidly, as they spend most of their larval stage consuming food to meet their energy needs and fuel their development. This quicker growth potentially increases the number of caterpillars that successfully reach the pupal stage and form cocoons. 3. Larger size and better health: A well-fed caterpillar has a better chance of reaching its full size and optimal health. This plays a vital role in ensuring a successful transition from the larval stage to the pupal stage, resulting in more cocoons being formed. 4. Higher reproduction rates: Butterflies with access to plentiful food resources during their larval stages are more likely to be robust and healthy as adults. This can lead to higher mating success rates and increased egg-laying, which results in a larger number of larvae in the next generation and, eventually, more cocoons. In conclusion, the availability of food has a direct impact on the life cycle of a butterfly. If caterpillars have plenty of food to eat, the butterfly population will generally be healthier, grow faster, and have higher rates of survival and reproduction. This chain of events leads to an increased number of cocoons being formed and a more successful completion of the butterfly life cycle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: A mill engine from Stott Park Bobbin Mill , Cumbria, England Question: how does a steam engine work Answer:","completion":"No, the given answer is not a correct answer to the question \\"How does a steam engine work?\\" A proper answer to the question would be as follows: Step 1: The fuel (usually coal) is burned in a furnace, which heats water in a boiler, turning it into steam. Step 2: The steam builds up pressure inside the boiler, which is then transferred to a steam chamber, allowing it to escape through a control valve. Step 3: The high-pressure steam enters a cylinder containing a piston. The pressure pushes the piston to one end of the cylinder, converting the potential energy of the steam into mechanical energy via the movement of the piston. Step 4: The piston is connected to a beam or rod, which in turn is connected to a wheel. As the piston moves, it rotates the wheel, creating motion. Step 5: The spent steam exits the cylinder through an exhaust valve and is usually sent to a condenser to be cooled back into water, which can then be reheated by the boiler to create more steam. This makes the process more efficient and conserves water. Step 6: The mechanical energy produced by the steam engine is then used to power machinery, vehicles, or other mechanical devices, such as those used for pumping water, driving trains, or powering industrial equipment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There is little point being constantly negative about yourself or your chances in love. This is a bad habit and it deserves to be broken.","completion":"To break the cycle of negativity, begin by identifying the thought patterns that contribute to your feelings of depression and self-doubt in your love life. Take note of these thoughts whenever they arise and challenge them with rational counterarguments. For example, if you find yourself thinking, \\"I'll never find love,\\" remind yourself that there are billions of people in the world, and countless opportunities for meaningful connections. It's important to recognize that there is no concrete timeline for love, and it can happen at any moment in your life. Next, focus on building your self-esteem and self-worth. Engage in activities that make you feel accomplished and proud, such as practicing a hobby, learning a new skill, or setting personal goals. Surround yourself with positive and supportive people who encourage and uplift you, rather than bring you down with their own insecurities or negative outlooks. Additionally, practice mindfulness and self-compassion. Be present in the moment and acknowledge your emotions without becoming overwhelmed by them or judging yourself too harshly. Remember that it's okay to feel disappointment or pain when love doesn't work out the way you had hoped—these emotions are natural and valid. What matters most is that you learn from these experiences, grow as an individual, and treat yourself with the kindness you deserve. Another step you can take is to change your perspective on love and relationships. Recognize that happiness and fulfillment can be found in various aspects of your life, not solely in romantic relationships. Embrace being single and use this time to focus on self-improvement, personal interests, and strengthening friendships. By doing this, you'll cultivate a sense of happiness and contentment that doesn't depend on having a partner. If you find yourself ruminating on past relationships or unsuccessful attempts at finding love, remind yourself that each experience was a lesson in disguise. It's important to learn from your past experiences and use them to better understand what you're seeking in a partner—both what works for you and what doesn't—and to continue refining your approach to love. Lastly, consider seeking professional help if your feelings of depression about love persist or worsen. A licensed therapist or counselor can provide valuable insights, help you develop healthy coping mechanisms, and guide you on your journey to overcoming depression related to love. By committing yourself to changing your thought patterns, investing in your personal growth, and learning to appreciate the love you already have in your life, you can overcome feelings of depression about love and move forward with newfound hope, optimism, and resilience. Remember that you are worthy of love, and it's only a matter of time before the right person comes along to share in the love you have to offer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Jane Fryer. Hermione Norris admits that if she had the money she would go to an American plastic surgeon and get 'the lot' Hermione Norris is looking down at her chest in faux disgust. 'I want my boobs done,' she says, cupping them. 'But I just want them lifted a bit, not implants, and I don't think they do that. And I'd have my thighs tightened because all the muscle and skin tone's gone. 'And I'd have the cellulite shlooshed out of my tummy. And I'd have that wattle thing done, under my neck. 'Oh yes, and hair implants – maybe a hair transplant. If I had the money, I'd go to the best plastic surgeon in America and have the lot. I look all right in my clothes, but underneath I'm a melted candle. You wouldn't want to go there...' It's fair to say that Hermione isn't quite as I'd expected. She looks just like the cool, composed, very middle-class Karen Marsden from Cold Feet, or Spooks' tough Ros Myers, or even DCI Carol Jordan from Wire In The Blood – all sleek, beautifully fitting clothes, discreet jewellery and immaculate skin. But actually she's warm, funny, surprisingly open and brilliantly messy. 'Do you want to see the inside of my bag?' she says, grabbing an enormous soft leather tote. 'Look! There's sand, sweets, salt sachets, pens, drinks, packets of crisps, Lego, plasters. I like to be prepared and I know most things I need for all eventualities are there.' Which is all very interesting, but we're actually here to talk about The Crimson Field – a new BBC1 drama series set in a field hospital in France in the First World War, but filmed in the Cotswolds. Hermione, who's long been fascinated by the war and in her 20s made pilgrimages to the French battlefields, plays stern but compassionate Matron Grace Carter. 'It was very emotional. That level of loss – what must it have done to those poor men? To be a good nurse you'd have to have a level of detachment. I'd just want to take them home with me. My mother's a nurse, but I couldn't do it.' The cast of Cold Feet- back row, from left, John Thomson, James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale. Front row- Hermione, Robert Bathurst, Fay Ripley. Her mother sounds more capable than most, single-handedly raising four children after her husband walked out when Hermione was just four. 'I don't know why he left – but I would imagine there was someone else involved, knowing my dad. There were four of us under six. It was really hard for my mum.' And her dad – what was he like? 'Great fun, naughty, charismatic, twinkly... trouble. He made me laugh. I saw him every Sunday. He was good at gifts and going out for nice meals but not the sort of man you should marry.' He died when Hermione was 21. 'It had a profound impact. It was really, really difficult. It was like the removal of a limb.' So Hermione immersed herself in work. 'Suddenly I was at Colchester Theatre, sharing a dressing room with a woman who drank gin out of the bottle and went on and on about her cats.' 'If I had the money, I'd go to the best. plastic surgeon in America and have the lot. I look all right in my. clothes, but underneath I'm a melted candle. You wouldn't want to go. there...' For years she alternated between theatre and anything that paid the bills – walking around shopping centres in a moose outfit and selling double glazing. Until, in 1997, she was cast in Cold Feet, the cult ITV drama co-starring James Nesbitt, John Thomson, Fay Ripley, Robert Bathurst and Helen Baxendale. The show ran for five series and served as a launch pad for its stars, who at one stage were reputed to be being paid £70,000 each an episode. (She looks a bit blank when I mention the money today, as well she might after saying last month she now shops at Asda because British TV pays such meagre wages.) Much has been made of the differences between the cast over the years – so did they get on at all? 'We were a very eclectic group,' is her careful answer. 'A really different bunch of people. But it worked.' Are any of them still friends? 'I'm. godmother to John Thomson's little girl. And I worked with Robert. recently. And Jimmy's been away in New Zealand doing The Hobbit... With. Jimmy you always knew. I remember a helicopter arriving on set to pick. him up, and John saying, \\"Oh look, there's Jimmy's career taking off,\\" as the rest of us got into a minibus.' Which brings us neatly back to hair transplants and, in passing, Jimmy Nesbitt's very natural-looking new thatch. Hermione as Ros and Richard Armitage as Lucas North in Spooks. 'Jimmy's is amazing. You've got to have the cash to do it really, really well. I'm so pleased for him. As an actor it makes a difference to your castability as well.' So what about Botox? 'I would...' And has she? 'I'm not telling you! If you have surgery, don't speak about it. But I'm not against it, obviously.' It's ironic that while she played the wife with children in Cold Feet, Hermione was the last of the cast to settle down. For years, she found herself attracted to charming but unsuitable men – not unlike her father. Then in 2002, at the age of 35, she met Simon Wheeler, a writer and TV producer, when she was filming Wire In The Blood with Robson Green. They married the same year and now have a son, Wilf, nine, and daughter, Hero, six. 'I just thought, \\"Oh **** it's you!\\" It was very straightforward. He's kind, bright, my best friend.' At 40, he's also seven years younger than her. Is she conscious of the age gap? 'I'm sure as I get older I will be. I need that work done!' The family live in Dorset and, between filming commitments, spend their time watching mostly American DVD box sets. 'I'd absolutely love to be in an American drama, but I couldn't go over there and peddle my wares,' she says. 'I'd want them to come to me and just offer me an amazing part. I'd never have to work again and I'd be able to get my plastic surgery done then. I reckon I'd need about a quarter of a million.' Hermione is brilliant. She may have a tendency to play dauntingly capable women but she's great company. And you never know, one day, if Hollywood does finally come calling she might end up looking rather different. 'I'd see you in a few months and my boobs would be up here and I'd look amazing!' Let's just hope she leaves the hair transplants to James Nesbitt. The Crimson Field starts tomorrow at 9pm on BBC1.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, these two questions are closely related and inquire about similar information - setting up a new cell tower on a piece of land in India and the process of renting the land to host a mobile tower. I will provide a detailed answer addressing both aspects. Setting up a new cell tower on a piece of land and renting land to host a mobile tower in India involve a series of steps, which include regulatory compliance, obtaining necessary permissions, and working with telecom operators or infrastructure providers. The process can be divided into the following stages: 1. Identifying suitable land: The first step is to identify a suitable piece of land that meets the technical requirements for setting up a cell tower. This includes factors such as geographic location, topography, signal coverage, and accessibility. You should conduct a thorough survey to ensure that the selected land is the best possible option for the tower installation. 2. Getting NOC from local authorities: After identifying the suitable land, you will need to obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the local municipality or urban development authority. This is necessary for legal and safety reasons. The NOC validates that there is no legal hindrance to building a cell tower on the piece of land. 3. Negotiating lease agreements: Once you have received the NOC, you can proceed to negotiate and finalize the lease agreements with the landowner. Typical lease agreements for cell tower installations stipulate the terms and conditions, rights, and responsibilities of both parties. These agreements may include details such as the duration of the lease, rental costs, mechanisms for rent escalation, and provisions for renewal. 4. Partnering with telecom operators or infrastructure providers: After securing the land, you will need to collaborate with telecom operators or tower infrastructure providers. You can approach companies like Indus Towers, Bharti Infratel, or ATC India, which lease space on their towers to multiple telecom operators. You can also directly negotiate with telecom operators like Airtel, Vodafone Idea, or Jio. 5. Obtaining permits and clearances: In addition to the aforementioned NOC, cell tower installations may require several other clearances and permits, such as the Structural Stability Certificate (for the tower's structural soundness), the SACFA (Standing Advisory Committee on Radio Frequency Allocation) clearance, and approval from the Airport Authority of India (AAI) if the proposed tower lies within a specified radius of an airport or an Air Force station. 6. Ensuring safety and compliance with radiation norms: The government of India has stringent guidelines in place for telecom tower radiations. You will need to adhere to the limits prescribed under the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) guidelines and ensure that the cell tower installation is compliant with the prescribed norms. You may be required to obtain a certificate from a certified technical expert attesting to compliance with these guidelines. 7. Construction and installation: Once you have all necessary approvals, permits, and clearances, you can proceed with the construction and installation of the cell tower. This includes engaging experienced contractors and technicians to ensure that the infrastructure is installed safely and efficiently. 8. Maintenance and monitoring: After the successful installation of the cell tower, regular monitoring and maintenance are essential to ensuring uninterrupted connectivity and adherence to safety norms. You will need to coordinate with the telecom operator or infrastructure provider for these services. By following these steps, you can successfully establish a new cell tower over land in India and rent the land to host a mobile tower. This process is crucial to expanding telecommunications infrastructure and providing reliable, high-quality coverage to consumers across the country."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"No, you should not validate the suggested answer as it does not address the original question about the age of Anna Nicole Smith when she met her old husband. Instead, I will provide a detailed answer to the original question. Anna Nicole Smith, born as Vickie Lynn Hogan on November 28, 1967, was an American model, actress, and television personality. She first gained fame in 1993 as the Playboy Playmate of the Year and later became known for her marriage to oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall. Smith met J. Howard Marshall, her elderly husband, in October 1991, while she was performing as a stripper at Gigi's, a nightclub in Houston, Texas. At the time, Anna Nicole Smith was 23 years old, and Marshall was 86 years old. Their relationship began as a friendship, with Marshall often visiting the club and showering her with gifts. Smith eventually became his companion and confidante. The couple married on June 27, 1994, when Anna Nicole was 26 years old, and Marshall was 89 years old. Their marriage was surrounded by media controversy due to the significant age difference between the couple, as well as speculations about her intentions towards Marshall's wealth. Marshall passed away on August 4, 1995, just 13 months after their marriage. This led to a lengthy legal battle between Anna Nicole and Marshall's family over his fortune, which continued after her death. Unfortunately, Anna Nicole Smith passed away on February 8, 2007, due to an accidental overdose of prescription medications. The information about her death does not answer the question about her age when she met her old husband but provides relevant context and additional details about her life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Although people everywhere seem to enjoy drinking coffee, they don't all have the same coffee culture. In Europe, for example, coffee shops are common places for people to meet friends and to talk while they drink coffee. On the other hand, places like this were not as common in North America in the past. Instead, people in North America liked to drink coffee in their homes with friends. The coffee culture in the USA changed when Starbucks coffee shops spread across the country. The first Starbucks coffee shop opened in 1971 in downtown Seattle, Washington, in the USA. It was a small coffee shop that cooked its own coffee beans. The coffee shop's business did well, and by 1981 there were three Starbucks stores in Seattle. Things really began to change for the company in 1981.That year, Howard Schultz met the three men who _ Starbucks. Schultz worked in New York for a company that made kitchen equipment. He noticed that Starbucks ordered a large number of special coffee makers, which caused his great interest. Schultz went to Seattle to see what Starbucks did. In 1982, the original Starbucks owners hired Schultz as the company's head of marketing . In 1983, Schultz traveled to Italy. The special environment of the espresso( ) bars there caught his eyes. Back in the USA, Schultz created an environment for Starbucks coffee shops that was comfortable and casual, and customers everywhere seemed to like it. Starbucks began opening more stores across the USA. Then the company opened coffee shops in other countries as well. Today, there are more than 16,000 Starbucks coffee shops all over the world. However, that does not mean Starbucks has not had problems. In fact, many Starbucks stores have closed over the past few years. On the one hand, this is because there were too many coffee shops competing for business in one small area. On the other hand, stores in some countries closed because the coffee culture there did not match with the \\"feel the same everywhere\\" environment offered by Starbucks. Question: Why did so many Starbucks close in small areas? Options: A: The coffee in these places was too expensive. B: The style of the coffee stores seems the same. C: People like to drink coffee at home with friends. D: There were too many coffee shops in one place. A:","completion":"The correct answer is D: There were too many coffee shops in one place. The article mentions that many Starbucks stores have closed over the past few years because there were too many coffee shops competing for business in one small area. This means that the market was saturated with coffee shops which led to stiff competition and likely affected the sales and profitability of individual Starbucks stores, thus leading to their closure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Eddie James \\"Son\\" House, Jr. (March 21, 1902 - October 19, 1988) was an American delta blues singer and guitarist, noted for his highly emotional style of singing and slide guitar playing. After years of hostility to secular music, as a preacher and for a few years also as a church pastor, he turned to blues performance at the age of 25. He quickly developed a unique style by applying the rhythmic drive, vocal power and emotional intensity of his preaching to the newly learned idiom. In a short career interrupted by a spell in Parchman Farm penitentiary, he developed to the point that Charley Patton, the foremost blues artist of the Mississippi Delta region, invited him to share engagements and to accompany him to a 1930 recording session for Paramount Records. House was born in the hamlet of Lyon, north of Clarksdale, Mississippi, the second of three brothers, and lived in the rural Mississippi Delta until his parents separated, when he was about seven or eight years old. His father, Eddie House, Sr., was a musician, playing the tuba in a band with his brothers and sometimes playing the guitar. He was a church member but also a drinker; he left the church for a time, on account of his drinking, but then gave up alcohol and became a Baptist deacon. Young Eddie House adopted the family commitment to religion and churchgoing. He also absorbed the family love of music but confined himself to singing, showing no interest in the family instrumental band, and hostile to the blues on religious grounds. When House's parents separated, his mother took him to Tallulah, Louisiana, across the Mississippi River from Vicksburg, Mississippi. When he was in his early teens, they moved to Algiers, New Orleans. Recalling these years, he would later speak of his hatred of blues and his passion for churchgoing (he described himself as \\"churchy\\" and \\"churchified\\"). At fifteen, probably while living in Algiers, he began preaching sermons. At the age of nineteen, while living in the Delta, he married Carrie Martin, an older woman from New Orleans. This was a significant step for House; he married in church and against family opposition. The couple moved to her hometown of Centerville, Louisiana, to help run her father's farm. After a couple of years, feeling used and disillusioned, House recalled, \\"I left her hanging on the gatepost, with her father tellin' me to come back so we could plow some more.\\" Around the same time, probably 1922, House's mother died. In later years, he was still angry about his marriage and said of Carrie, \\"She wasn't nothin' but one of them New Orleans whores\\". House's resentment of farming extended to the many menial jobs he took as a young adult. He moved frequently, on one occasion taking off to East Saint Louis to work in a steel plant. The one job he enjoyed was on a Louisiana horse ranch, which later he celebrated by wearing a cowboy hat in his performances. He found an escape from manual labor when, following a conversion experience (\\"getting religion\\") in his early twenties, he was accepted as a paid pastor, first in the Baptist Church and then in the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church. However, he fell into habits which conflicted with his calling--drinking like his father and probably also womanizing. This led him after several years of conflict to leave the church, ceasing his full-time commitment, although he continued to preach sermons from time to time. Did you learn anything interesting about him?","completion":"Yes, I learned about Eddie James \\"Son\\" House, Jr., who was a famous American Delta blues singer and guitarist. He was known for his emotional style of singing and playing the guitar. Even though he grew up in a religious family and became a preacher himself, he later switched to blues music at the age of 25. Son House played with Charley Patton, a great blues musician, and even recorded songs together. He had a complicated life, with struggles in his personal relationships and his feelings towards religion and blues music. Son House was also known for wearing a cowboy hat during his performances because he once enjoyed working on a horse ranch in Louisiana."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If Google is having trouble stirring up people's passions for tech then why should anyone pay attention to some small semiconductor firm? But PortalPlayer, which filed for its IPO on Aug. 4, bears watching over the next few months. Here's why. PortalPlayer gets most of its business from a Taiwanese company called Inventec. And Inventec is the company that makes this little device that you may have heard -- it's called the iPod. Now do I have your attention? PortalPlayer's processors are the brains and guts of Apple Computer's (AAPL) uber-popular music player. So in a sense, PortalPlayer is like the Intel (INTC) of the iPod. What's more, the company's newest chip, the PP5020, is the first to feature photo-processing capabilities, in addition to audio. That could enable PortalPlayer to expand from the digital music device market into other hot areas of consumer electronics such as camera phones. The PP5020 chips could possibly be used in some sort of camera or video version of the iPod as well, which has been the subject of a fair amount of speculation in tech circles. Apple was unavailable for comment about these rumors. Of course, PortalPlayer, once it starts trading (probably in the fall), has a long list of risks. For one thing, the company is tiny. PortalPlayer reported revenues of just 21 million in 2003. However, sales are ramping up quickly, and through the first six months of 2004, it already has topped last year's total. The company is not profitable either, certainly a red flag for skittish tech investors. The company lost 8 million last year and another 3.3 million in the first half of 2004. But it is worth noting that losses have narrowed during the past few years. PortalPlayer lost 25.3 million in 2001 and 22.5 million in 2002. Also it's not as if PortalPlayer is assured of market dominance just because of its relationship with Apple. PortalPlayer lists chip giants Intel and Texas Instruments (TXN) as competitors.

But who is the PR guru working quietly behind the scenes to help push Pope Francis forward and leading the Church out of one of its darkest spells following a slew of recent scandals? Mr","completion":"Greg Burke, an American public relations expert, has been instrumental in helping Pope Francis reshape the Catholic Church's image. As a PR guru, he has worked tirelessly to rebuild trust and improve the Church's reputation, especially in the wake of numerous scandals that had tarnished its image. As the senior communications adviser to the Vatican under Pope Francis, Burke's role has been to advise the Pope and the Vatican on media strategy and messaging. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1959, Burke is a member of the conservative Catholic group Opus Dei. He has been a journalist for more than three decades, with experience at various prestigious media outlets, including Time magazine, Fox News, and The National Catholic Register. His journalistic background and expertise in media have provided him with a unique skill set to navigate the challenges of the modern media landscape and handle sensitive issues related to the Church. Burke’s approach to communication has been heavily focused on transparency and direct interactions with the public. Under his guidance, Pope Francis has engaged in numerous public gestures that humanize him and make him more relatable to the masses, such as taking selfies with pilgrims, washing the feet of prisoners, and embracing children with disabilities during papal audiences. These acts have broad appeal and capture the essence of Pope Francis' desire for a more humble, compassionate, and inclusive Church. As a result, the Pope has become a popular figure around the globe and people from different faiths feel a renewed connection to the Catholic Church. Moreover, Burke stresses the importance of social media in reaching out to the younger generation. Pope Francis has an active presence on platforms such as Twitter and Instagram, with millions of followers. These social media accounts allow the Pope to share messages of hope, peace, and love while also addressing pressing global issues, thus significantly broadening his reach and impact on people's lives. Another critical aspect of Burke's strategy has been to address the Church's internal issues both openly and proactively. This involves acknowledging the mistakes of the past, such as the clergy abuse scandal, and implementing meaningful changes to prevent such incidents from occurring again. The Pope, under Burke's guidance, has shown an unwavering commitment towards transparency and healing, promoting measures like the establishment of a special commission to protect minors and the removal of high-ranking officials involved in cover-ups. Despite all the challenges that the Catholic Church has faced in the past, the rise of Pope Francis has been a breath of fresh air to many believers, and much credit goes to the Church's quiet PR guru, Greg Burke. Through his expert handling of media and communication, he has managed to help the Pope and the Church rise above recent controversies, regain public trust, and ultimately bring millions back into the fold. The 'Francis Effect' has breathed new life into Catholicism, with increased congregations and renewed faith around the world, all thanks to the work of Mr. Burke and his dedication to the Church's mission and image."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Charle's parents A:","completion":"Title: The Unraveling Legacy Genre: Drama, Mystery, Family Plot Outline: Eliza's life has been full of mysteries, as she has always wondered who her biological parents were. Found as an infant on the doorstep of Charles' family home, she was taken in by Charles' kind-hearted parents - Edward and Margaret. These two loving souls raised Eliza as their own daughter, providing her with a warm, nurturing home full of love, support, and a deep sense of belonging. Unbeknownst to Eliza, Charles, their biological son, has always been curious about his sister's obscured past. The movie begins with Eliza and Charles as young adults, navigating life, love, and dreams. Eliza is a talented artist and runs a successful gallery with her best friend, while Charles is a budding journalist who is haunted by the unsolved mystery surrounding his sister's past. When Edward becomes severely ill, Margaret finally reveals the secret she kept for all these years. Through her emotional confession, we learn that a mysterious letter was found with the infant Eliza, indicating that her biological parents belonged to a prominent, wealthy family with a dark secret they wanted to protect. With Edward's encouragement, Margaret had buried the letter in the hope that Eliza would be given a clean slate and a stable upbringing, unencumbered by the darkness that cloaked her origins. Charles, inspired by the revelation and driven by a desire to unravel the truth for his sister, embarks on a journey to find the answers that have eluded them for so long. As Charles digs deeper, he encounters a series of clues, testimonies, and old acquaintances that reveal a complex web of relationships and lies surrounding Eliza's origins. His determination takes him through forgotten towns, abandoned mansions, and ancient graveyards, unveiling a story full of melancholy, betrayal, heartache, and unexpected alliances. Meanwhile, Eliza, who is kept in the dark about her brother's mission, continues her art career, finding love, while grappling with a gnawing sense of incompleteness that lingers in her heart. The climax of the story occurs when Charles eventually uncovers a shocking family connection that shakes the very foundation of Eliza's identity. As the truth surfaces, he hesitates and reflects on the consequences of revealing this newfound knowledge to his sister. Edward, on his deathbed, imparts a parting piece of wisdom to Charles, reminding him that the bonds formed by love matter more than bloodlines and that the life Eliza had built, surrounded by her loving family and friends, held more value than any plot twist from her past. In the end, Charles decides to let the past lie, ultimately choosing to protect Eliza's human connections and her love-filled existence over the pursuit of her uncertain heritage. The siblings come together at Edward's funeral, holding each other tightly, as Eliza clings to hope amidst the unanswered questions. The sealed letter, now in Charles' possession, is never opened, symbolizing that one's true family is not always defined by blood but by the bonds of unconditional love.

University Although the initial focus of the humanist scholars in the university was the discovery, exposition and insertion of ancient texts and languages into the university, and the ideas of those texts into society generally, their influence was ultimately quite progressive. The emergence of classical texts brought new ideas and led to a more creative university climate (as the notable list of scholars above attests to). A focus on knowledge coming from self, from the human, has a direct implication for new forms of scholarship and instruction, and was the foundation for what is commonly known as the humanities. This disposition toward knowledge manifested in not simply the translation and propagation of ancient texts, but also their adaptation and expansion. For instance, Vesalius was imperative for advocating the use of Galen, but he also invigorated this text with experimentation, disagreements and further research. The propagation of these texts, especially within the universities, was greatly aided by the emergence of the printing press and the beginning of the use of the vernacular, which allowed for the printing of relatively large texts at reasonable prices. Q: A concentration on the study of the self resulted in what field of study?","completion":"A concentration on the study of the self and the focus on knowledge coming from humans resulted in the field of study known as the humanities.

Select the topic that this about: MANNHEIM, Germany - A military judge hearing evidence about the alleged abuse of prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison pressed the U.S. government Monday to speed up its investigation, warning that delays could derail the case against at least one of the accused soldiers...","completion":"The topic of discussion here is the alleged abuse of prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison and the subsequent investigation and legal proceedings involving accused American soldiers. In this context, the military judge has urged the U.S. government to expedite the investigation process to ensure that the case against the accused soldiers proceeds without any hindrances. The location mentioned, Mannheim, Germany, likely refers to the venue of the military court hearing. Abu Ghraib prison, located near Baghdad, Iraq, became infamous in 2004 when images of U.S. military personnel abusing and torturing Iraqi prisoners were made public. These horrifying images and reports of gross human rights violations sparked international outrage and raised questions about the treatment of prisoners during the Iraq War, which was led by the United States and its allies. The prison scandal brought to light a dark chapter in the U.S. military's conduct in Iraq and led to a series of investigations, legal proceedings, and reforms. The military judge's plea for expediting the investigation highlights the urgency and importance of bringing the individuals involved in the alleged abuse to justice. A slow or inefficient investigation process could result in the loss of vital evidence or the weakening of the case against the accused soldiers. Furthermore, delays in the legal process can lead to further negative ramifications, such as loss of public trust in the military and the government's ability to enforce justice and ensure accountability. This is particularly crucial as the United States and other nations involved in the Iraq War have repeatedly emphasized their commitment to upholding human rights and the rule of law. Investigating the allegations of abuse at Abu Ghraib and holding accountable those responsible sends a strong message about the values the U.S. military and its government stand for. Furthermore, it helps to rebuild the image and credibility of the United States in the international community, particularly in the eyes of the Iraqi people, who suffered from grave human rights violations during the conflict. Efficient and transparent investigations and legal proceedings can also serve as a deterrent to future acts of abuse and misconduct by armed forces, not only in the United States but also in other nations. As the onus of upholding human rights and the rule of law falls upon every nation, ensuring that justice is served in cases of prisoner abuse is crucial for maintaining international standards of justice and human rights protection. In conclusion, the topic discussed in this excerpt revolves around the alleged prisoner abuse at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison and the necessity for a swift investigation and legal proceedings against the accused American soldiers. The military judge's request for expedition highlights the relevance of timely justice, the importance of enforcing accountability, and the need for upholding human rights and the rule of law in the domain of armed conflict."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Hers - A CHILD HAS HER FIRST BRUSH WITH 'CRIME' - NYTimes.com ICOMMITTED my first white-collar crime in second grade. Like many white-collar criminals, I persist in believing that I acted for an honorable cause and that the lessons crime taught me were not necessarily the ones society would have me learn. Things began innocently enough. A priest bearing a stack of magazines and some charts came to every classroom in the school. ''Mission magazines,'' he explained. In their pulp pages nurse-nuns battled fierce bacteria in steaming jungles and brave priests struggled to persuade cannibals to look for new sources of protein. This was edge-of-the-seat stuff in our far-north Michigan town, which was so small and isolated that coins never showed up until the year after the dates on their faces. The charts that came with the magazines were for fund raising. They had thermometers printed on them, like the United Way thermometers that sprout every year on courthouse lawns. At the top was a goal of 5, and the thermometer's ''degrees'' were marked in nickels. ''Pagan babies,'' the priest told us. Each 5 would buy one pagan baby. The money would feed the baby and, more important, would guarantee that the baby would be baptized and thereby rescued from spending eternity in limbo. Because our second grade was such a special class, the priest said, he brought two thermometers. He could tell we were sacrificing and persevering enough to save two pagan babies. He suggested we make a contest of it; the boys could race the girls to 5. The impropriety of buying babies never occurred to me, nor did I grasp the ethnocentric hauteur of a concept like ''pagan'' babies. I just wanted to help. I was unnerved by the magazine pictures of children swollen with hunger - I who never felt like cleaning my plate. The boys-against-girls contest appealed to my sense of urgency in the matter. And, I admit, to my basest competitive instincts. My first thought was that the girls slightly outnumbered the boys. If we worked fast we could win. But when the priest asked who would make the first contribution, I began to see what we were up against. Pockets, for one thing. Little boys have four pockets in their pants and two in their shirts, and one thing they carry in them is money. (None of the girls would have purses until spring, when we made our first communion and needed them for regulation religious equipment like rosaries.) Not one girl had money. Mrs. Davey, our teacher, colored the first red degrees on the boys' thermometer. Undaunted, I went home for lunch and told my mother about the pagan babies. She said I could take a nickel. I supposed that every girl was home doing the same and our thermometer would soar past the boys'. For lunch we'd had egg-salad sandwiches -one of the few things I liked - and it pleased me to think the pagan babies would soon be having egg salad, too. I ran back to school and forced my nickel upon Mrs. Davey. She announced that everyone who had brought money for pagan babies should go stand by the thermometers. To my amazement almost no one went. It was a big class, a postwar bumper crop of 60, but there were only five of us at the thermometers. Didn't the rest of them care? Didn't they know that the bloated stomachs and inside-out navels in those horrible photographs belonged to real children? Worst of all, only one other girl gave money. From the back of the room the thermometers burned into me all afternoon: 48 cents boys, 10 cents girls. During recess I did some lobbying. The pagan babies would die without our money for food, I pointed out, and because they hadn't been baptized they couldn't go to heaven. It would be our fault. But nobody believed it. Africa and Asia seemed unimaginably far away, starvation even farther. At home I told my mother what had happened and asked if I could take a dollar. She said another nickel. When I accused her of being just one more person who didn't care about pagan babies, she said the fund raising was a class project and the whole class should chip in. Contributions dribbled in for the next few days. Finally, after Mrs. Davey plugged the enterprise, the girls went into action. One day we even took the lead - 3.42 girls, 3.39 boys. Here was the glorious proof of what I'd known all along: girls could beat boys. Then Robert stepped forward with 50 cents. This was the greatest philanthropy we'd seen, and someone asked where he'd gotten the money. His paper route, he said. My pride blew away like a dead leaf in a cold wind.After school I told my mother I needed a paper route. She said paper boys were like altar boys -they were always boys. It wasn't fair, she agreed, but she doubted that we could change the world before the pagan baby campaign ended. If only my father were home. He wouldn't let me be beaten by Robert's paper route. But he worked on a ship on the Great Lakes and would be away for days. Besides, it seemed demeaning to ask for money now that I knew Robert earned his. Imagine having money to spend however you wanted, with no need to account to anyone! I racked my brain to think how I might acquire the same freedom, but because the pagan babies needed help fast, all my thoughts came back to a single possibility: crime. Stealing was a sin, of course, but how could it be wrong to steal for pagan babies? That night while my mother gave my little sister a bath I took 40 cents from her wallet. To avoid suspicion at school, I gave half in the morning, half in the afternoon. Mrs. Davey didn't ask any questions. The most interesting thing about crime was that it was so easy. Over the weekend everybody seemed to forget about pagan babies, and in the days that followed contributions tapered off to almost nothing. I kept bringing nickels, quietly, in the hope that Robert wouldn't notice that the girls were catching up. But he did. He loved playing the last tycoon, waiting until everyone else had given money, then fishing in his pockets and counting out just what was needed to put the boys ahead. I stole only once more for the pagan babies. I gave it up not out of guilt or fear but because I sensed that Robert would always come up with more than I could steal. And once I understood the impossibility of winning, I wanted to lose as invisibly as possible. I didn't want Robert to have the faintest idea the contest mattered to me. After the boys won, I tuned out. I don't know how long it took the girls to finish buying their pagan baby. I was preoccupied with dreams of the day when I would be big enough to rake leaves or babysit so I would never again know the humiliations suffered by women of dependent means.

Question: suppose A volcano is inactive happens, how will it affect less crystals are formed. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"B: less When a volcano becomes inactive, it means that there is no eruption taking place, and hence, no new magma is rising to the surface of the Earth. The process of crystal formation is directly related to the cooling and solidification of magma. Therefore, if a volcano is inactive and not producing fresh magma, there will be fewer opportunities for magma to cool on or near the Earth's surface, and ultimately form crystals. To provide a more comprehensive understanding, let's look at the crystal formation process that occurs when a volcano is active: 1. Magma generation: Magma is generated by the partial melting of the Earth's mantle or crust, primarily due to changes in temperature, pressure, or the introduction of water. In the case of an active volcano, magma is continuously being produced, creating a constant source of fresh material for crystal formation. 2. Magma ascent: When magma is generated deep within the Earth, buoyancy forces and tectonic processes drive it to rise toward the surface. As it ascends, the magma may encounter regions of lower pressure that can cause it to further expand, increasing the likelihood of a volcanic eruption. 3. Eruption and magma cooling: If an eruption occurs, the magma is expelled from the Earth's surface or near-surface conduits, forming a lava flow or pyroclastic material. Regardless of the specific eruptive style, the magma is suddenly exposed to much cooler atmospheric conditions, triggering the cooling and solidification process. 4. Crystal formation: As the magma cools and solidifies, the particles within it move closer together, and the mineral components begin to crystallize according to their particular melting points. The resulting crystals grow in size as cooling continues, incorporating various elements that were present in the magma. Different minerals and crystal forms can emerge, depending on the magma's composition and cooling rate. Now, let's consider the situation where a volcano becomes inactive. In this case, the generation of fresh magma stops, so there is no new material to be cooled and crystallized on or near the Earth's surface. Consequently, fewer crystals will form overall. Moreover, any pre-existing crystals and volcanic rocks on the surface of the Earth will gradually be weathered and eroded, which will decrease the local abundance of crystalline material even further. So, in conclusion, an inactive volcano will indeed result in fewer crystals being formed due to the lack of fresh magma and subsequent cooling that would otherwise facilitate crystal growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So, we have the equation: 536959 = 18428*x - 1728*x - 1582404 + 499463 First, let's combine the terms with 'x' in them. We have 18428*x and -1728*x. Add them together like this: 18428*x - 1728*x = 16600*x So now, our equation looks like: 536959 = 16600*x - 1582404 + 499463 Next, let's combine the numbers without 'x'. We need to add 536959 and 499463, and then subtract 1582404: 536959 + 499463 - 1582404 = -543982 Our new equation is: -543982 = 16600*x Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we will divide -543982 by 16600: -543982 ÷ 16600 = -32.77 So, x = -32.77 And there we go! The answer is x = -32.77.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. On September 18, date of the Scottish referendum, something infinitely less seismic is happening that is nonetheless of quiet importance to the parish of British tennis. As Scottish residents cast their votes, the draw for next year's Davis Cup World Group will take place and, for the domestic game and its key player Andy Murray, those two things could be very much interlinked. In response to a question about the Rio Olympics Murray said last week that, in the event of the Yes vote, he 'assumed' he would be playing for Scotland, but a deeper look into the matter shows it may be less straightforward than anyone – including Murray himself – might think. Team GB: Murray has an impressive Davis Cup record for Great Britain, winning 19 of his 21 singles matches. In fact, such are the uncertainties that tennis and other sports are trying to grapple with, that one many eventual scenarios if separation happens could even be that he continues to play for GB in the Davis Cup while turning out for Scotland in Rio. Such is the confusion associated with the increasingly likely outcome of a Yes vote that, in tennis, it has become the subject that nobody wants to talk about. Murray's endorsement may be the glittering prize for either side of the independence argument but, understandably in some ways, he continues to tiptoe around it as the implications are considerable for the reigning Sports Personality of the Year. It is not just him anxious to avoid discussion. Lawn Tennis Association Chief Executive Michael Downey is another to have stayed determinedly uncommitted on the issue. Tennis Scotland are desperate to remain neutral, despite it being massively important to the future of the game north of the border. Broader governing body The International Tennis Federation restricts itself to setting out procedural elements in the event of a Yes vote. Option? Davis Cup captain Leon Smith (right) might not be able to pick Andy Murray for his side in the future. Part of the reason is that there would be no meaningful precedent if Scotland breaks away. According to one official, the only comparable scenario is the recent secession of South Sudan from Sudan (the former Yugoslavia is not an equivalent as, unlike GB, it ceased to exist). While Sudan does have a national tennis association, and competed in the Davis Cup up to 2001, war-torn South Sudan has got infinitely more important things to consider than setting up sporting administrations in the new country. In the UK tennis, a completely integrated sport with no meaningful history of Scotland competing separately, is an interesting study of the difficulties and fears affecting sports north of the border with the possibility of independence, especially those that supply Olympic teams. Scotland is affiliated to the LTA in the same way that, say, Yorkshire or Lancashire are, and Tennis Scotland receives a basic grant of £800,000 annually from the centre plus support for athletes and facilities. The Independence white paper is thin on detail about how and when this kind of money would be replaced. In the seductive Socialist utopia promised by the SNP, in which public spending will go up while things like corporation tax goes down, there are assurances that funding levels for world class sport will survive a schism with the south. Big question: LTA Chief Executive Michael Downey must formulate a plan to find the next Andy Murray. David Marshall, Chief Executive of Tennis Scotland, is among those reluctant to be drawn about the myriad implications, but admitted 'The honest position just now is that there will be a lot of negotiations and decisions in the event of a Yes vote that are impossible to predict, and sport is unlikely to be at the top of the pile. 'There are a lot of unknowns which make it impossible to have a clear idea of what is going to happen. It seems a waste of money to get legal advice about what could be when there are so many unknowns in the situation. It will be different for each sport.' One possible outcome that has been discussed among various Olympic sport is that what may emerge for some is a compromise along the lines of what happens for some sports in Ireland, which have remained united even though Eire is a separate sovereign nation. Gold: The Scot represented Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics, winning a Gold and Silver medal. Some governing bodies are extremely sceptical about whether legal and constitutional issues could be solved in time to allow a separate Scotland to compete at Rio 2016, something that would affect the ex Wimbledon champion among others. Sir Craig Reedie, vice-president of the IOC, is the latest to point this out. A tennis team is logistically far easier to organise than, say, rowing or sailing. Yet an idea of how complex Olympic entry could be in the case of tennis comes with the dry-as-dust response of a spokesperson for the ITF (which runs the sport at the Olympics) to inquiries about how an independent Scotland would proceed after a theoretical split from the LTA. Here goes: 'In order to take part in any ITF team competition a nation has to be a 'Class B' member. A National Tennis Association may apply for membership of the ITF in accordance with the ITF Constitution. In order to apply for membership a National Association must first be a member of the Regional Tennis Association (a low profile body called Tennis Europe in Scotland's case) and in the case of Class B members, a member of the National Olympic Committee or a member state of the United Nations. All memberships must be approved at the ITF Annual General Meeting.' Doubles triumph: Murray teamed up with Laura Robson to win Silver in the mixed doubles at London 2012. To summarise, that suggests a tricky number of hurdles would need to be cleared in a short period for Olympic participation, at a time when sport would hardly be at the top of a new Scottish government's in-tray with so many more important matters to be sorted out. It is also ITF policy that a player can represent who he or she wants providing they have the requisite passport from that nation – and who gets to hold which passport will be among the thorniest issues to sort out in the event of a Yes vote. You can see why highly focussed athletes do not want to get involved in this kind of minutiae, and also why potential Olympians north of the border might be concerned, given all the possible outcomes and funding implications. It is also easy to understand why Murray, his family and the likes of close friend Sir Chris Hoy are very keen not to become embroiled in a campaign getting more heated and unpleasant the nearer polling day comes. They are part of what might be termed the fearful undeclared. If they were to come out on the No side they will be subject to the vicious attacks of the 'Cybernats' and other pro-independence supporters. If they were to express a view in favour of a Yes vote it would open them up to charges of being anti-English, and doubtless unsettle commercial sponsors as well. This is a particularly sensitive time for the former Wimbledon champion in that regard, as his main apparel contract with adidas is due for renewal on January 1. Negotiations are ongoing with them and others who might wish to sign him with its worth likely to be in the region of £3 million per year, give or take performance clauses. Breakthrough: The Scot's straight sets win over Roger Federer handed Murray the 2012 Olympic Gold medal. The Wimbledon champion has reason to be particularly cautious, given the hysterical reaction to some harmless joshing with his friend Tim Henman about supporting football teams eight years ago that is still held against him by some to this day. The day after his triumph as SW19 last year, when he would have been feeling indestructible, Murray declared that he would have to say something on independence. He has subsequently thought better of it, given the highly emotive reactions the subject draws, but anyone who knows him will be sure that he will have a view, given his intellectual curiosity and fondness for a debate about most things. The nearest he has come to publicly expressing a view was in March last year, when he said in an interview with the Times magazine: 'I don't think you should judge the thing on emotion, but on what is best economically for Scotland. You don't want to come to a snap decision and then see the country go tits up. 'I am proud to be Scottish, but I am also proud to be British. I don't think there is any contradiction in that.' Passionate: David Cameron and Alex Salmond celebrate Andy Murray winning Wimbledon in 2013. More recently he has pointed out that his view has little relevance because, as a longstanding resident of Surrey, he does not have a vote. But there have been hints of his thinking, such as criticising Alex Salmond for unfurling a Saltire in Wimbledon's Royal Box last year. In the past expressed his admiration for staunch 'No' supporter Gordon Brown, and does not give the impression of being a great enthusiast for independence. His private and professional connections make a nonsense of any suggestions that he is in some way anti-English, and he has never shied from wrapping himself in the Union Jack or made a secret of his pride in representing Great Britain. Patriotic: Murray returned to his hometwon Dunblane after his successes at the London 2012 Olympics. It was notable that after London 2012 he declined to appear at the parade of Scottish Olympians in Glasgow but made his own personal visit to his hometown of Dunblane. Yet it should be stressed that none of the country's first tennis family have publicly made their views clear, including brother Jamie and mother Judy. In the case of the latter, who is Captain of Great Britain's Fed Cup team, a few clues can be gleaned from her highly active Twitter feed. She used to follow the SNP account, although stopped doing that prior to getting the GB job. Last week she retweeted a picture of her holding a Saltire-patterned fan that was accompanied by a (lighthearted) suggestion that she was a fan of independence. Like everything else connected with this very complex issue, it will all most likely become clearer after September 18, although perhaps not for some considerable time, possibly not for years.

Apache Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Riders of the Apache\\" Genre: Action-Adventure Plot Summary: When a legendary Native American artifact is stolen from the Apache tribe, a small group of unlikely heroes unite to recover it and unravel the truth behind a series of mysterious events. To track down a dangerous enemy hiding in the vast Arizona desert, they must rely on their courage, resourcefulness, and the unexpected help from a seemingly ordinary jeep. Story: In the small town of Spirit Falls, Arizona, the Apache people's sacred and heavily-guarded artifact, the Thunderbird Eye, gets stolen under the cover of night. The whole community is shocked, and the tribal elders scramble to figure out who the thief might be. To protect their cultural heritage, the Apache community decides to form a group to search for the artifact. Their team comprises Alex, a spirited tribal member; Jessica, a daring archaeologist; and Jake, a former law enforcement officer. As they embark on their quest, the trio finds a mysterious jeep abandoned near the edge of the town. The vehicle is without a driver and has no apparent owner, but it seems to be guiding the team to their next destination. Uncertain at first, the group decides to trust the jeep, eventually calling it Apache. As the adventure ensues, Apache demonstrates excellent off-road capabilities, helping the group overcome various obstacles like dangerous terrain, extreme weather, and unexpected ambushes by the culprits. The allies discover that the theft of the Thunderbird Eye is the work of a merciless criminal organization that seeks ancient artifacts to harness their supernatural powers. With Apache's help, the team finally locates the enemy's hideout in a remote canyon. In the climactic battle, the group faces off against the criminal leader, a notorious artifact collector named Silas. The Apache tribe, alerted by the bravery of Alex's team, arrives just in time to support them in this battle. During the confrontation, it is revealed that the spirit of a legendary Apache warrior who once protected the artifact infuses the jeep. The warrior's spirit, now channeled through Apache, aids the team in incapacitating Silas and his henchmen, helping them to successfully recover the Thunderbird Eye. In the end, the town celebrates the return of the precious artifact, and the unlikely heroes are hailed as the saviors of their community. Apache, the enchanted jeep, returns to its regular form but will always have a special connection with its riders. \\"Riders of the Apache\\" is a thrilling action-adventure tale that showcases the loyalty and determination of a diverse group of individuals and a supernatural entity working together in the face of adversity. It's a story that highlights the importance of cultural preservation while exploring the mystical bond between people and the spirit world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

America's third biggest carrier is being slammed online for violently dragging a passenger - a 69-year-old Asian man, believed to be a doctor - off an overbooked flight. This comes just weeks after the company, whose slogan is \\"Fly the Friendly Skies\\", was ridiculed for refusing to allow two teenage girls to board a flight because they were wearing leggings. Chief executive Oscar Munoz added more fuel to the fire with his response, which didn't mention the use of force. \\"This is an upsetting event to all of us here at United. I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers,\\" he said in a statement. But Mr Munoz also sent an email to employees calling the passenger, who was pictured with a bloodied face, \\"disruptive and belligerent\\". The Twitterverse quickly responded. United, which made 2.3bn (Â£1.85bn) in profit last year, isn't alone in the PR disasters club. Delta Airlines has cancelled thousands of flights since Wednesday because of severe weather. It's not the first time. Delta chief executive Ed Bastian was forced to apologise after thousands of flights were delayed and cancelled due to a computer bug and power failure last August. In February, Sikh-American actor Waris Ahluwalia was barred from boarding an Aeromexico flight because he refused to remove his turban during a security check. The airline later apologised. And Southwest Airlines flew into a PR storm in 2010 after US filmmaker Kevin Smith was kicked off a flight after being told he was too big to fly. He ended his boycott of the airline six years later. So how could United have handled the situation better? John Bailey is a specialist in crisis communications and has handled public relations for many of the aviation industry's biggest players, including Malaysia Airlines following the disappearance of MH370. \\"Any airline which allows its employees the discretion to take this kind of heavy-handed action against a paying customer is asking for trouble,\\" he says. \\"Every other passenger on that aircraft was a potential citizen journalist. What's astonishing is that United responded so poorly to an absolutely predictable reputational risk. \\"But businesses generally are struggling to adapt to the new communications landscape. Research suggests that it takes companies an average of 21 hours to issue meaningful external communications in a crisis situation, leaving them open to 'trial by Twitter'.\\" Wes Finley, a US marketer working at Facebook, said the United video went viral so quickly because \\"everyone could relate to the frustration the doctor felt at being involuntarily booted\\". \\"Last week's widespread cancellations by Delta also left a lot of people with a hostile attitude to airline travel,\\" he adds. Joseph Barratt, chief executive of Mutant Communications, says the incident was handled \\"incredibly poorly at almost every level\\". \\"From the brutality of the man's removal, to the CEO's response, which contradicted itself and was essentially a non-apology - it's truly difficult to see what United Airlines' communications strategy is hoping to achieve, or whether they have one at all. \\"It is also a reminder for brands that issuing a timely statement that acknowledges the error and shows remorse, while staying consistent both internally and externally is essential. \\"Assuming that an internal letter to employees in a company as large as United Airlines will stay private was a big mistake. Their casual disregard for their customers does seem to stress an opportunity for other brands to step into the market.\\" Ironically, United's CEO Oscar Munoz was named PR communicator of the year by a trade publication last month. PR Week called him \\"a smart, dedicated, and excellent leader who understands the value of communications\\". The award was made before the overbooking and leggings incidents. One would assume he is unlikely to win any more such accolades anytime soon. United's Facebook page apology has drawn thousands of angry comments, including calls for the passenger to sue. US authorities are also looking into the matter, with the Department of Transportation saying it \\"remains committed to protecting the rights of consumers\\". But will all the online outrage about United's behaviour and response, which has led to a hashtag of #boycottUnited, actually damage the airline's bottom line? Well, its reputation has undeniably taken a severe blow. The story has gone viral around the world, including on Chinese social media site Weibo. But pundits say it is hard to put a monetary value on reputational damage. Look at Samsung, for example. The tech giant has just reported a stellar profit forecast despite facing corruption allegations and the embarrassment of exploding phones. Aviation analysts also believe demand for its flights are likely to be unaffected by the incident. The markets seem to be less sure though. United Continental shares dropped 4% on Tuesday.

He had to produce a report for the coming annual meeting. This year he is thinking about a report with some lifestyle suggestions for middle adulthood population. To make it easier to understand the needs of middle adulthood population he would compare it with a group who are in their twenties. He labeled the first group as group A; and the latter group as group B. But I can use this background: Middle adulthood lasts from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. During this stage of life, many people raise a family and strive to attain career goals. They start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start declining. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during this stage of life. These diseases are also the chief causes of death in middle adulthood. What is an answer for this question: Would group B have faster or slower reaction time than group A? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question \\"Would group B have faster or slower reaction time than group A?\\", first let's understand the characteristics of each group: Group A: Middle adulthood population (mid-30s to mid-60s) - Raise family and attain career goals - Show physical signs of aging (wrinkles, gray hair) - Decline in vision, strength, and reaction time - Increased risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer Group B: Population in their twenties - Not mentioned explicitly in the background, but generally considered a younger, more physically fit population than middle adulthood Based on the information given, we can conclude that Group B (population in their twenties) would likely have a faster reaction time compared to Group A (middle adulthood population). This is because Group A experiences a decline in reaction time as one of the characteristics of aging, while there's no indication that Group B undergoes significant decline in reaction time during this stage of their lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: If you go to Finland, you'll be surprised to find how \\"foolish\\" the Finnish people are. Take the taxi drivers for example. Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry. The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge. With so many loopholes in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take \\"pretty advantages\\". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. As the Finns always act on good faith and always show an attitude of \\"which is which\\" and \\"what is what\\" in everything they do, so to live in such a society has turned everyone into a real \\"gentleman\\". In a society of such high moral practice, what need is there for people to take precautions against others? Question: What's FALSE according to the passage? - No one takes advantages although there are many loopholes. - All the taxi-passengers come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business. - Not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. - Finland is heaven for immoral people because they can always take advantages freely.","completion":"Finland is heaven for immoral people because they can always take advantages freely."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: A reality competition series based on the movie “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” in which Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie starred, is in the works. 3 Ball Entertainment and New Regency, which produced the original 2005 movie, are teaming to develop and produce a reality game-competition version of the feature film. Fittingly, in the vein of secret assassins, details are highly confidential, but the show will feature married couples that compete in a high-octane, high-stakes game that offers a twist on the TV competition format, producers say. The box office hit, which brought in nearly 500 million worldwide, revolved around a married couple (Pitt and Jolie) who discover they are both assassins hired by competing agencies to kill each other. Todd A. Nelson and Brant Pinvidic will serve as exec producers on the series for 3 Ball Entertainment. ||||| There's something about a good game show that just reels us in. Although, we admit, sometimes the guest makes it more than the host. As game shows rose to popularity in the '70s and '80s, a lot of the good ideas for them got taken. And then came the really \\"out there\\" ideas (although in America, we have yet to match the weirdness of the Japanese game show where the guests chew the furniture to see if it's chocolate). If you've never heard of the ones of this list, bless your heart, because you were spared serious awkwardness. 1. Yahtzee Yahtzee is a pretty fun dice game on its own, worth enjoying over a pizza and a few beers. Is it fun to watch people roll dice on a national television show? No. No, it isn't. 2. My Dad is Better Than Your Dad Here was a game where you could win by teaming up with your dad to compete against other father/son teams. The idea wasn't awful, but watching the execution really hurt. 3. Scrabble Scrabble is great when you're playing it. Watching other people play it kind of sucks. Not even Chuck Woolery could save this one. 4. Identity Penn Jilette of Penn and Teller fame took the helm in this game show, which challenged contestants to match 12 strangers to their identities. The capacity for stereotyping was like a giant landmine, which is why we'd guess it only lasted one season. 5. Twenty One Twenty-One, hosted by Maury Povich, was based off the original quiz show of the same name in the 1950s. The show only lasted one season, which left Povich more time for lie detector tests and paternity tests for his talk show. 6. Naked Jungle This UK game show challenged couples to roam through the jungle performing an assault course naked. We don't think further explanation of why this was a bad idea is required. 7. Shafted Another gem from the UK, Shafted was canceled in 2001 after only four episodes. Apparently host Robert Kilroy-Silk's tagline \\"Their fate will be in each other's hands as they decide whether to share or to shaft\\" didn't sit well with people. 8. Show Me The Money William Shatner, go-go dancers and breaks for \\"Sexy Party\\" time. What could go wrong? ||||| Summary:","completion":"A reality competition series based on the 2005 blockbuster film “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, is in development.

Lettie's Aunt Hortense, fearing that Barton is a fortune hunter, tells Lettie she is not the heiress she thought she was and that she has been living off her aunt's charity. With no fortune to hunt, Barton informs Lettie that an artist cannot be burdened with the responsibility of a wife.

Tinariwen was founded by Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, who at age four witnessed the execution of his father (a Tuareg rebel) during a 1963 uprising in Mali. As a child he saw a western film in which a cowboy played a guitar. Ag Alhabib built his own guitar out of a tin can, a stick and bicycle brake wire. He started to play old Tuareg and modern Arabic pop tunes. Ag Alhabib first lived in Algeria in refugee camps near Bordj Badji Mokhtar and in the deserts around the southern city of Tamanrasset, where he received a guitar from a local Arab man. Later, he resided with other Tuareg exiles in Libya and Algeria. In the late 1970s, Ag Alhabib joined with other musicians in the Tuareg rebel community, exploring the radical chaabi protest music of Moroccan groups like Nass El Ghiwane and Jil Jilala; Algerian pop rai; and western rock and pop artists like Elvis Presley, Led Zeppelin, Carlos Santana, Dire Straits, Jimi Hendrix, Boney M, and Bob Marley. Ag Alhabib formed a group with Alhassane Ag Touhami and brothers Inteyeden Ag Ablil and Liya Ag Ablil in Tamanrasset, Algeria to play at parties and weddings. Ag Alhabib acquired his first real acoustic guitar in 1979. While the group had no official name, people began to call them Kel Tinariwen, which in the Tamashek language translates as \\"The People of the Deserts\\" or \\"The Desert Boys.\\" In 1980, Libyan ruler Muammar al-Gaddafi put out a decree inviting all young Tuareg men who were living illegally in Libya to receive full military training. Gaddafi dreamed of forming a Saharan regiment, made up of the best young Tuareg fighters, to further his territorial ambitions in Chad, Niger, and elsewhere. Ag Alhabib and his bandmates answered the call and received nine months of training. They answered a similar call in 1985, this time by leaders of the Tuareg rebel movement in Libya, and met fellow musicians Keddou Ag Ossade, Mohammed Ag Itlale (aka \\"Japonais\\"), Sweiloum, Abouhadid, and Abdallah Ag Alhousseyni. All sang and played guitar in various permutations. The musicians joined together in a collective (now known as Tinariwen) in order to create songs about the issues facing the Tuareg people, built a makeshift studio, and vowed to record music for free for anyone who supplied a blank cassette tape. The resulting homemade cassettes were traded widely throughout the Sahara region. In 1989, the collective left Libya and moved to Ag Alhabib's home country of Mali, where he returned to his home village of Tessalit for the first time in 26 years. In 1990 the Tuareg people of Mali revolted against the government, with some members of Tinariwen participating as rebel fighters. After a peace agreement known as the Tamanrasset Accords was reached in January 1991, the musicians left the military and devoted themselves to music full-time. In 1992 some of the members of Tinariwen went to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire to record a cassette at JBZ studios. They played occasional gigs for far-flung Tuareg communities throughout the Sahara region, gaining word-of-mouth popularity among the Tuareg people.","completion":"This text is primarily about the Grammy Award-winning group of Tuareg musicians, Tinariwen.

Every country has its own variations of harness racing: Please remove spaces between words.","completion":"Harness racing, as a popular horse racing discipline, has found a significant following around the world and, as a result, different countries have developed their unique variations of the sport. Here is a detailed and long answer describing the variations of harness racing in different countries. 1. United States: The sport of harness racing originated in the United States and is known for its Standardbred horses. Two forms of pacing races are widespread in the US - trotting and pacing. Trotting is a gait where diagonally opposite legs move in tandem, while pacing is a gait where lateral legs move together. The races typically take place on mile-long oval racetracks, and the feature of starting gates is common. The events are often categorized by the horses' ages, sex, and career earnings. 2. Canada: As a close neighbor to the United States, the Canadian harness racing scene is quite similar. Standardbred horses dominate the races, and both trotting and pacing are popular. Canada is home to numerous prestigious harness racing events, such as the North America Cup, the Maple Leaf Trot, and the Canadian Pacing Derby. Like their American counterparts, Canadian races also use starting gates and take place at oval racetracks. 3. France: Known as 'trotting' in France, harness racing is referred to as \\"course de trot\\" and predominantly features trotting races. French trotters are the primary breed, and races are divided into two categories - mounted and driven. In mounted races, jockeys ride on the horse's back, and in driven races, they sit on sulky carts. French racetracks are unique in that they often feature both right-handed and left-handed tracks that range from 1,000 to 4,000 meters in length. Also, handicapped starts based on the horses' earnings are common in France. The most prestigious race in France is the Prix d'Amerique, held annually since 1920. 4. Italy: In Italy, harness racing primarily focuses on trotters, with Italian-bred trotters dominating the sport. Trotting races can either be driven or monté (ridden). Flat and hilly racetracks are used, and many tracks have mixed surfaces (dirt and grass). Races in Italy are typically longer, ranging from 1,600 to 3,000 meters in length. Popular contests include the Gran Premio Orsi Mangelli, Gran Premio Lotteria, and Gran Premio Mipaaft. 5. Scandinavia: This region is known for its excellent cold-blooded trotters. Harness racing in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland sees significant interest from participants and spectators. Races are exclusively trotting and driven, with no pacing or monté races. The tracks are mostly left-handed oval tracks ranging from 800 to 1,000 meters. Major Scandinavian events include the Elitloppet in Sweden, the Copenhagen Cup in Denmark, and the Finnish Trotting Derby in Finland. 6. Australia and New Zealand: Harness racing in these countries heavily features pacing with Standardbred horses. Races are conducted on circular and oval tracks, with both left and right-handed tracks in use. The New Zealand Cup and the Miracle Mile in Australia are among the most popular races in the region. The New Zealand \\"dual-gaited\\" horse - a horse capable of both trotting and pacing during races - is unique to this corner of the world and adds an interesting twist to the sport. In conclusion, while there are distinct differences in harness racing traditions across the world, the sport's core principles and exciting nature captivate fans and participants alike. From the pacing and trotting variations of North America to the exclusively trotting races of Europe and Scandinavia, the breed variations and cultural differences contribute to the sport's enduring appeal and worldwide popularity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Since social interaction is necessary in order to succeed, it's important to learn how to cope with shyness and social anxiety. Consider working with a friend or a family member of close age to develop your social skills. It may not replace new social exchanges, but it's good practice. Autistic teens and other disabilities/mental illnesses such as ADHD, or social anxiety disorder, may have notable difficulty with social interaction. If you're an autistic teen, try learning how to develop better social skills, read other people's body language, and understand figurative language and sarcasm—it's important to learn how to interact in a neurotypical world. If you have ADHD or related disorder, you can learn to not interrupt others, dominate the conversation, focus on the other person or task at hand, etc. towards those you don't know well. Every day, you'll likely see people you don't know, whether it be in school or out in public. It may seem funny to make fun of those that you don't know, but it's rude, and word will get back to them eventually.

If somebody you don't know has a clumsy moment that makes others laugh at them, such as dropping their books everywhere, don't laugh, and instead help them pick them up if you have the time. It's a nice thing to do, and they will likely appreciate it, even though they may not show it. . You don't need to be at the top of the social food chain and know everybody at school, but you should at least try to have a few loyal friends throughout your teenage years. Friendships are a good place to build your social skills, and building stable relationships with others can help you determine what you want in friendships and romantic relationships you may pursue. And most importantly of all, life is simply easier and brighter with friends. Make sure your friends make you feel good about yourself and don't get you in trouble—you want to enjoy your teen years, not spend them miserable because of your \\"friends\\"! Find friends who make you feel good and inspire you to be your best. Hang out with friends you really like, and worry less about maintaining relationships with people who don't improve your life. Friends come and go, and you may have different types and numbers of friends. That's okay. How many friends you have isn't important; it's the quality of the friends you do have that matters, as cliché as that sounds! If you struggle to find friends, try looking in areas where people are similar to you. Are you LGBT, for example? See if there's a teen LGBT group in your city, or if your school has a GSA that you could join. If you prefer writing over socializing, see if you can find writer's groups. If you're autistic, try seeking out other autistic people to befriend. Try going on social media if you can't find friends face-to-face. However, be very careful with this. Online friendships develop much differently than face-to-face friendships, and many people online are not who they say they are—you never know what goes on behind the screen. Sometimes it may not be even an actual human you are talking to. Exercise caution when making friends online, and never agree to meet up with somebody in private. Avoid giving out personal information to people you meet online unless you are sure that they can be trusted. It is best to meet people in real life first before meeting them on the internet. Some—but not all—teens are interested in romantic relationships, and may want to find a partner. If you get into a relationship, take it slowly and communicate with your partner well. This leads to the healthiest relationships in the long run. You don't need to be tethered to your partner, either. Make sure the relationship allows the both of you to have your own friends and interests. You don't need to rush into anything before you're ready. If your relationship ends, it's not the end of the world. You may be tempted to swear off of dating forever, especially if you were badly hurt, but keep an open mind. People grow and change. A relationship that would have worked six months ago may turn out to be extremely destructive now. And remember, few couples stay together during or after high school, whether it's because of long distance or other factors. Be wary of abusive relationships. If you feel like you have to constantly walk on eggshells around your partner to try and avoid them getting angry at you or hitting you, or if you can't talk to anybody else without your partner accusing you of cheating, these are huge red flags that the relationship is unhealthy and that you need to get out of it! The same applies for toxic friendships. Family members—especially parents—probably worry about you during your teenage years. Many teenagers become sullen, withdrawn, and stop valuing family as much as they used to. Try to avoid this. Family is one of the most important connections in your life—it's the building blocks for all relationships you develop, whether they're friendships, romantic relationships, or a family that you choose to have later on in life. And plus, you see them every day—why not make it nice to spend time with them? You don't have to be best friends with everyone in your family, but be kind to them and spend time with them once in a while; play a video game with your sister, help your brother with his writing, offer to go on a walk with your mom, or play a board game with your dad. Don't just stay in your room all day and only see your family at meals. Improve your relationship with your siblings. It's fine to argue and bicker with siblings here and there, but remember that your sibling relationship is usually one of the longest in your life. Siblings can be great allies, mentors, and friends, not just now, but also when you're old and grey. Watch out for abusive family members. Your family can be some of the closest friends you have, but they can also negatively impact your life. If your parents constantly make you feel down, they may be emotionally abusing you. If your brother constantly hits you, that's a sign of physical abuse. Usually, talking things out with a close friend or confronting your abuser can lessen the hurt, but know when to report child abuse. Keep close to your extended family, such as your cousins, too; make an effort to spend time with them when you can. You probably don't see your extended family often, so take advantage of the time you do have to hang out with them! Summary:","completion":"This article talks about the importance of social skills for teens, suggesting ways to practice and improve them, build friendships and healthy relationships, and the value of staying close to family members while also being cautious of abusive relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These rabbits went about their daily tasks with boundless energy and enthusiasm, always seeking new adventures and ways to improve their simple lives within the majestic forest glade. They were proud woodland dwellers, with generations of tales woven into the roots and branches of their burrow. One warm spring morning, as the sun began to break through the leaves, Chief Bunny, the oldest and wisest rabbit, called upon his fellow rabbits to embark on an ambitious project: the refurbishment of their burrow. This monumental task was to be a way to further the legacy of the rabbit folk and ensure that their young could prosper in the lap of a comfortable and secure home. And so, the diligent rabbits began their labor. They dug and foraged, stocked and storied, all the while allowing their claws to carve a new chapter into the watery depths of their forest homeland. Days became weeks, blending into a symphony of hard work, sweat, and unyielding toil. One afternoon, while diligently working on a new section of their burrow, the grey-furred rabbit named Whisper stumbled upon something that caught the glint of sunlight. It was a piece of glass, encrusted with dirt and age, yet still retaining its radiant beauty. Whisper called upon her comrades, who gathered around the magnificent find, each straining to comprehend its significance. For this was no simple, mundane piece of glass: it was a rare, medieval stained glass window, adorned with intricate designs that whispered of the earth's secret history. How had such a relic come to be buried in the living heart of the forest, one may ask. No one could fathom just how the hands of time had entrusted these rabbits with such a treasure. Curiosity piqued and hearts aflutter, the rabbit community set out on a quest to learn more about the mysterious glass window. They sought out the wise elders, whose memories were ingrained in the ancient tapestry of the forest, patiently listening to stories and legends that unraveled the past. Their quest led them to uncover that many centuries ago, a grand monastery had thrived deep within the forest. The monks of this medieval haven had sought solace, silence, and a spiritual connection with nature. The monastery was renowned for its gifted artisans who crafted the most exquisite works of art, including beautiful stained glass windows that bejeweled the monastery walls. Alas, the tides of time and the relentless advance of civilization eventually left this spiritual abode in its wake. The majestic monastery crumbled into ruin, the remnants of its finely-crafted glass entombed in the earth's bosom. But the universe had bestowed upon these rabbits a chance: through their industrious refurbishing efforts, they unearthed a key to the long-lost secrets of the forest. The innocent survivors of the flourishing medieval world were none other than the very guardians of the forest: the rabbits themselves. In embracing the history of their ancestors, they became the living legacy of a glorious past. And so, the rabbits pledged to pay homage to the whispers of their homeland. They lovingly incorporated the glass window into their now refurbished burrow, weaving the story of their mystical forest into the fabric of their lives. Thus began a new chapter in the tale of the rabbits who unearthed a rare medieval glass window, teaching their young about the wisdom of the past, while also looking forward to a present that spoke of strength, perseverance, and a hopeful future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While making love in the woods they are discovered by three young local guys with rifles and a jar of self-made alcohol, which they force-sell to them. They seem to be the bad guys but as we will see, they're not. They also meet a middle-aged, rather conservatively dressed woman with a little wooden cart on a forest trail, who sends them on the Timber Falls trail, claiming that would be the most rewarding of all. She also asks them if they are married, which they are not (remember this for later). Next person they meet is a park ranger, who reassures them of the beauty of the Timber Falls trail. This happens shortly after Sheryl forces Mike to get rid of their handgun. He throws the bullets in a little creek.They arrive at a beautiful lake where they set up their tent and make love in the night. Somebody is watching them from outside the tent. The next morning Sheryl takes a swim in the lake and is abducted by a strange looking figure. Mike awakes and can only find Sheryl's necklace in the water. After meeting two of the three guys again and having a fight with them suspecting them of taking Sheryl, Mike gets caught in a bear trap and passes out.He awakes in a farmhouse and is taken care of by the woman they met earlier, called Ida. He gets suspicious after a while and asks her to call park service, which she declines. Soon the real scheme becomes clear: It is all a trap set up by Ida and the park ranger Clyde, who are in fact a couple who live there, desperately trying to get a child, but all their attempts so far have failed because the fetuses die in the womb. They want a (married!) couple so the husband can get his wife pregnant in their basement dungeon and, after nine months, they hopefully have their baby (the young couple would instantly get killed afterwards, of course).

Plot title: The Three Musketeers Movie plot: In Venice, the Three Musketeers Athos (Matthew Macfadyen), Porthos (Ray Stevenson) and Aramis (Luke Evans), with the help of Athos' lover, Milady de Winter (Milla Jovovich), steal airship blueprints made by Leonardo da Vinci. However, they are betrayed by Milady, who gives the blueprints to the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). Upon returning to France, the Musketeers are forced to disband by Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) for their failure.One year later, the young D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) leaves Gascony for Paris in hopes of becoming a Musketeer, like his father once was, only to learn that they no longer exist. D'Artagnan ends up challenging Captain Rochefort (Mads Mikkelsen), the leader of Richelieu's guard, to a duel after being offended by him, but Rochefort merely shoots him while he's distracted. In an attempt to get revenge, D'Artagnan offends Athos, Porthos and Aramis for petty reasons, and schedules duels with each of them, at the same day and at the same place, but in different times, not knowing who they are.Before they can duel, however, D'Artagnan and the Musketeers are attacked by the guards for breaking the law by having a public duel. They fight the soldiers off, at which point D'Artagnan discovers their true identities, but end up being captured and brought before the young King Louis XIII (Freddie Fox) and his wife, Queen Anne (Juno Temple). Richelieu attempts to convince them to execute the four prisoners, but they are too impressed, and congratulate them instead, much to Richelieu's anger.Later, Richelieu meets with Milady, who is actually working for him. He orders her to plant false love letters among Queen Anne's possessions and steal Queen Anne's diamond necklace and hide it in the Tower of London with the objective of framing Queen Anne of having an affair with the Duke of Buckingham, who is in France on behalf of the King of England, and who has built a fully armed airship using the designs stolen from the Musketeers.

The petition that Derrick started isn't signed by Kevin.","completion":"The petition that Derrick started isn't signed by Kevin. The reason for this remains unclear. Derrick, a known activist within their community, commonly starts initiatives like this to combat social issues. His proactive measures have often drawn both support and criticism. Despite many in the community passionately partaking in his pleas, Kevin, a well-respected figure within the neighborhood, has conspicuously abstained from signing Derrick’s petitions. There could be multiple reasons for Kevin's non-participation. He may disagree with the objectives of the petition, feel detached or indifferent about the issue, or perhaps he simply overlooked the chance to sign it. Starting with the first potential reason: Kevin and Derrick, though both prominent figures in the community, did not always see eye to eye on every issue. They had distinct perspectives and occasionally diverging interests that led to frequent, intense debates during community meetings. So, it isn’t a big surprise that Kevin might disagree with the objectives of the petition Derrick started. Another scenario that could explain Kevin's nonparticipation could be indifference. Despite being an active member of the community, not every single issue piqued Kevin's interest. His engagements were primarily focused around education and children's welfare. Therefore, if Derrick's petition was about an issue that Kevin didn't feel as passionate about, he might have disregarded it. Lastly, it’s also possible that Kevin may have simply missed the opportunity to sign the petition. With an array of responsibilities and commitments, the petition might have slipped off his radar unintentionally. To bring some clarity to the situation, a conversation with Kevin might be the best way to understand his reasons. It’s crucial to remember that, despite the difference of opinion or lack of interest, everyone within the community maintains the freedom to choose what to support and what not to support. In writing this, I tried to build upon the existing text by exploring possible reasons why Kevin hasn't signed the petition, thereby creating some tension and intrigue in the story. The intention was to provide nuanced characterization of the two main subjects (Derrick and Kevin) by revealing their differences in perspectives and interests. This portrays them as multifaceted beings with differing priorities, viewpoints, affiliations, and commitments. I ended on a note encouraging respect for diverse viewpoints and freedom of choice, to promote a sense of community.

In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War. Moon and Kim will hold direct talks in the Peace House conference hall, both in the morning and the afternoon, but the North Korean delegation will...

The paragraph provides a brief introduction to the Volkswagen Golf Mk5, including its development, platform, and unveiling, but it does not mention any sales figures. To determine whether the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 has reached record sales, we would need to compare its sales data with the sales data of its predecessors and competitors in the compact car segment. This information is not available in the given paragraph, so we cannot draw any conclusions about the sales performance of the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 at this point. In order to support the statement that the \\"Typ 1K has reached record sales,\\" it's important to provide additional data such as: 1. The total number of Volkswagen Golf Mk5 vehicles sold: This would provide a basis for comparison with other generations of the Volkswagen Golf and the compact car market in general. 2. The time period during which the sales record was achieved: Comparing sales figures over the same time periods ensures a fair assessment of the vehicle's success. 3. Market segment performance: Assessing the Golf Mk5 sales data in the context of the compact car market can provide information on whether the vehicle has been more successful than its direct competitors. 4. Sales data of previous Volkswagen Golf generations: Comparing the sales figures of the Golf Mk5 with its predecessors (Mk1, Mk2, Mk3, and Mk4) can help determine if the Mk5 generation was more successful in terms of sales. 5. Any awards, accolades, or other recognition received by the Volkswagen Golf Mk5: These may reinforce the idea that the Golf Mk5 was a successful vehicle.

Here is an article: University of Illinois student Ryan Tompkins bought a discounted bus fare for 50 cents to visit a friend at Illinois State University in November 2011. More than a year later, a FedEx envelope arrived at his parents' Edgebrook home. The bus company, Suburban Express, was demanding that Tompkins pay 138.35 — a fine, he would learn, for using a bus ticket on the wrong date. Tompkins had two options: He could pay up — a 100 convenience charge and 8 representing the full fare amount, plus 30.35 in collection costs — or dispute the matter in small claims court and risk accruing an additional 200 in fees, the letter said. \\"We typically prevail in our small claims cases,\\" the company warned. \\"Govern your actions accordingly.\\" Tompkins refused to pay the bill, which he considered an unfair charge. \\"If I used the ticket for the wrong date, when I was getting on the bus, why didn't they just tell me it was for the wrong date?\\" he said in an interview. \\"It was more than a year ago at this point, so I don't even remember what happened.\\" The company, whose bus and Illini Shuttle service ferry students between college campuses and the Chicago area, ultimately sued Tompkins, making him one of at least 124 customers to be sued by the company for small claims in the past six months, according to court records. Other students were sued after boarding the wrong bus or getting a refund for an unused ticket. The company said in court documents that the customers had violated the terms and conditions of their tickets, to which passengers must agree before buying a ticket. Those terms, which had been listed on the company's website, included a 100 charge if customers used an invalid, altered or duplicate ticket, and a 500 charge if they engaged in \\"disruptive behavior.\\" The company filed the lawsuits in Ford County, about a half-hour drive from Champaign and more than an hour from Bloomington, a location it specified in the terms and conditions as the \\"agreed venue for any legal action.\\" But this week, outrage over the lawsuits prompted the company to revise those terms and conditions. On Tuesday the company filed paperwork to drop all of its lawsuits in Ford County, court Clerk Kim Evans said. \\"We recognized that this legal approach of trying to uphold our agreement with customers carries with it a negative perception that we do not intend,\\" bus company owner Dennis Toeppen said in an email, saying the company is revising its policies. New terms and conditions posted to the company's website Monday no longer specify Ford County as the venue for disputes and does not mention fines for invalid tickets or causing disturbances. The company's motions to dismiss its pending cases against students came one day after Ford County Judge Steve Pacey ordered a venue change for a case against a student who lives in Lake County. Suburban Express has an office in Champaign and a post office box in Lisle, according to Toeppen. \\"The inconvenience of the parties traveling ... (to Ford County) ... for a 68.75 claim is obvious,\\" Pacey wrote. Mounting frustration with Suburban Express erupted recently when Jeremy Leval, a graduate student at the U. of I., complained on Facebook about what he alleged was rude treatment by a bus driver. The post went viral and led to a report by The Daily Illini, the student newspaper, about the company's lawsuits against students. Days later, the company sued Leval for 500 in \\"liquidated damages.\\" That suit, and the suit against Tompkins, were among 71 cases that the company filed against students on a single day last month, according to court records. The timing — there's about a month to go before students head out of town for summer break — and out-of-the-way location of the courthouse left students \\"in an uproar,\\" Evans said. \\"Mothers were calling, fathers were calling, very upset,\\" she said. Toeppen said those lawsuits were filed all at one time because his company had taken the winter break to process a backlog of collection files. He said his company filed suit against students because he believed they were intentionally using the wrong tickets to board buses, which hurt his business. For example, students who wanted to ride a sold-out bus would buy a ticket for a different date or time but board the sold-out bus instead, he said.

Yun studied forest soils, while Jian studied grassland soil. They were both very surprised with they findings. But I can use this background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

This supposed discovery gave a new impulse to Menasseh 's Messianic hopes . Menasseh wrote a book about this narrative , The Hope of Israel . In it Menasseh argued , and tried to give learned support to the theory that the native inhabitants of America at the time of the European discovery were actually descendants of the ( lost ) Ten Tribes of Israel . The book was originally written in Hebrew ( Mikveh Israel ) or in Latin ( Spes Israelis ) around 1648 , but its publication in English in 1650 in London caused great controversy and polemics in England . - Ecuador, officially the Republic of Ecuador (which literally translates as \\"Republic of the Equator\\"), is a representative democratic republic in northwestern South America, bordered by Colombia on the north, Peru on the east and south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west.

Q: If I tell you that Plants are part of the ecosystem. , and ask you the question \\"what are parts of the ecosystem?\\", is the correct answer \\"wetland\\"? Select from: a. Yes. b. No. A:","completion":"b. No. An ecosystem comprises various biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components that interact with one another. While plants are an important part of an ecosystem, merely saying that \\"plants are part of the ecosystem\\" does not provide a complete answer to the question \\"what are parts of the ecosystem?\\" Wetlands, on the other hand, are a type of ecosystem themselves, characterized by the presence of standing water, hydric soils, and unique plant and animal communities. Since you asked about the parts of an ecosystem, a more detailed answer would include other biotic and abiotic components. Some key components of an ecosystem include: 1. Producers: These are organisms, such as plants, algae, and some bacteria, that convert sunlight or/and inorganic molecules into usable energy through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. They form the base of the food chain or food web in an ecosystem. 2. Consumers: These are organisms that get their energy by consuming other organisms. Consumers can be herbivores, which eat plants (e.g., deer, rabbits); carnivores, which eat other animals (e.g., wolves, lions); omnivores, which eat both plants and animals (e.g., bears, humans); and detritivores, which consume decaying organic matter (e.g., earthworms, some insects). 3. Decomposers: These are organisms, such as fungi and bacteria, that break down dead organic matter and recycle nutrients back into the ecosystem. 4. Abiotic components: These include non-living components of an ecosystem, such as sunlight, temperature, water, soil, and various minerals and nutrients. Abiotic factors help shape the structure and composition of an ecosystem and determine the types of organisms that can survive within it. In summary, while wetlands are a type of ecosystem, they are not the correct answer to the question about the parts of an ecosystem. Instead, a comprehensive answer would mention various biotic and abiotic components that contribute to the functioning of an ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, answer the following question. What does the author seem to most probably believe about the availability of seasonal produce? pick from the following. (i). that seasonal produce is in limited supply; (ii). most likely that people can find places that sell seasonal produce where they live; (iii). not enough information; (iv). that seasonal produce is most likely available only at farmers markets; Answer:","completion":"(ii). most likely that people can find places that sell seasonal produce where they live;"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which region had fewer plants with an ability to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss? Austria had two distinct climactic regions. The eastern region was exposed to a wet climate and had thriving vegetation, while the western region was exposed to drought. Hint: One interesting thing that has been found in plants that are consistently exposed to drought, is their ability to form a sort of \\"memory\\". In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased. Answer:","completion":"The western region had fewer plants with an ability to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss.

As we climbed the steps of development, we somehow left behind common sense and logical thinking -- we forgot that we have stopped thinking ahead of time. If you are hungry, what do you do? Get a piece of your favorite meal and stay quiet. Just like your stomach, even your mind is hungry.

To protect his clients' intellectual property and himself, Jennings, with the aid of his friend Shorty (Giamatti), undertakes a memory wipe to remove knowledge of his engineering. Jennings is approached by his old college roommate, James Rethrick (Eckhart), the CEO of the successful Seattle technology company Allcom. Rethrick proposes a lengthy three-year reverse engineering job to Jennings, requiring him to live on Allcom's secured campus until its conclusion but rewarding him handsomely with company stock. Jennings agrees and, after arranging for his long-term absence, arrives at Allcom, turns in his personal possessions, and is given a brief tour of the facility where he meets and flirts with botanist Dr. Rachel Porter (Thurman). He is injected with a long-term memory marker for the post-job memory wipe. Three years later (June 2007), at the conclusion of the memory wipe, Jennings is sitting in Rethrick's office, being thanked for a successful job. On returning home, Jennings finds that, although his Allcom shares would have been worth around 92 million, he had signed them away near the end of his tenure. Furthermore, he finds that his personal possessions have been replaced with an envelope containing a random assortment of everyday items. Soon after, the FBI captures him; and Agent Dodge (Morton) interrogates him on charges related to the death of physicist William Dekker.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Consumers cut credit card use for second month WASHINGTON – Americans cut back on their credit card use in July for the second straight month as many remain cautious in the face of high unemployment and slow growth. Total consumer borrowing dipped 3.3 billion in July from June to a seasonally adjusted 2.705 trillion, the Federal Reserve said Monday. The drop in credit card debt offset a small rise in a measure of auto and student loans. The Fed also said Americans have borrowed much more than previously estimated after it revised consumer borrowing data back to December 2010. June's figure was increased to 2.708 trillion, or 130 billion higher than initially thought. It's also well above pre-recession levels. Consumer debt declined even though Americans boosted their spending in July by the most in five months, according to government data released last week. The job market has weakened substantially from the start of the year, which is keeping downward pressure on spending. In August, employers added just 96,000 jobs, down from 141,000 in July and well below the average 226,000 jobs a month in the January-March quarter. Consumers have been using credit cards much less since the 2008 credit crisis. Four years ago, Americans had 1.03 trillion in credit card debt, an all-time high. In July, it was 850.7 billion — or 17% lower. During that same time, student loan debt has increased dramatically. The category that includes auto and student loans, along with other loans for items such as boats, has jumped to 1.85 trillion from 1.56 trillion in July 2008. Much of that increase in student loans is a result of high unemployment, which has led many Americans to seek better education and skills in a more competitive labor market. The weak job market is putting more pressure on the Federal Reserve to provide more help to the anemic economy. Fed officials will meet Wednesday and Thursday. Economists expect the central bank to announce another round of bond buying to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates. The economy is growing too slowly to boost business and consumer confidence and spur sustained gains in spending and hiring. Overall economic growth slowed to an annual rate of just 1.7% in the April-June quarter, and analysts don't expect much of a pickup for the rest of the year. Overall, Americans have been steadily paring debt since the financial crisis. Household debt, including mortgages and home equity lines of credit, has declined for 16 straight quarters to 12.9 trillion in March, according to a separate Fed survey on consumer finances. That's down from 13.8 trillion in March 2008. Some of that debt has been removed by defaults, such as foreclosures. But Americans are also repairing their finances by paying down debts. The Fed's monthly consumer credit report covers auto loans, student loans and credit cards. Unlike the quarterly Fed report, it excludes mortgages, home equity loans and other loans tied to real estate.","completion":"In July, American consumers reduced their credit card usage for the second consecutive month due to ongoing concerns about high unemployment rates and slow economic growth. According to the Federal Reserve, total consumer borrowing decreased by 3.3 billion, reaching a seasonally adjusted 2.705 trillion. This decline in credit card debt was counterbalanced by a slight increase in auto and student loans. The Federal Reserve also revealed that Americans have borrowed significantly more than initially estimated since December 2010, with June's figure being raised by 130 billion to 2.708 trillion. This is above pre-recession levels. Despite the decreased consumer debt, spending in July increased at its fastest rate in five months. However, the job market has weakened considerably, with only 96,000 jobs added in August, down from 141,000 in July. Credit card usage has been declining since the 2008 financial crisis, with a 17% decrease in outstanding debt over the last four years. In contrast, student loan debt has risen dramatically, as high unemployment rates have driven Americans to invest in their education to compete in the labor market. This weak job market is placing more pressure on the Federal Reserve to provide further assistance to the struggling economy. Experts predict that the central bank will announce another round of bond buying to reduce long-term interest rates. The slow-growing economy is hurting consumer and business confidence, leading to limited spending and hiring. The annual growth rate for the second quarter was a mere 1.7%, and analysts do not expect significant improvements for the remainder of the year. Overall, Americans have been steadily reducing their debt since the financial crisis. Household debt has declined for 16 consecutive quarters, reaching 12.9 trillion in March, down from 13.8 trillion in March 2008. Some of this reduction is due to foreclosures and defaults, but Americans are also consciously working to pay down their debts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Select from the following. a). no; b). yes;","completion":"b). yes; Both questions are essentially asking for the same information. They are paraphrases of each other, as they both inquire about the most reliable full-size American pickup truck available. To answer the question briefly, it would be difficult to make a definitive statement, as reliability tends to vary across different models and years. However, by analyzing various studies and reviews, one can often gain a better understanding of the general reliability trends among the full-size American pickup truck market. Now, to provide a more detailed and long answer to the question: In order to determine which full-size American pickup truck is the most reliable, we must first define our parameters. In this case, we will consider trucks from the three major American automakers: Ford, General Motors (Chevrolet/GMC), and RAM (formerly a Dodge brand). We will also evaluate them based on surveys, studies, and expert reviews for long-term reliability and dependability. 1. Ford F-Series The Ford F-Series, particularly the F-150 model, has been America's best-selling pickup truck for decades. Known for their solid construction and dependable performance, F-Series trucks have earned a reputation for being reliable workhorses. In recent years, Ford has added numerous technology and safety features, further enhancing their appeal. J.D. Power's 2020 Vehicle Dependability Study ranked the Ford F-150 as the most reliable truck in the Large Light Duty Pickup segment. 2. Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Chevrolet and GMC, both subsidiaries of General Motors, often share platforms for their pickup trucks, such as the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. Both models are generally known for their durability and longevity, although some model years have faced reliability issues. In J.D. Power's 2020 Vehicle Dependability Study, the Chevrolet Silverado ranked second, behind the Ford F-150, in the Large Light Duty Pickup segment. 3. RAM 1500 The RAM 1500 has experienced a significant improvement in recent years, with a complete overhaul of its design and engineering. While previously lagging behind Ford and Chevrolet in many areas, including quality, the latest generation of RAM trucks has garnered impressive reviews from experts and owners alike. The RAM 1500 earned top honors in J.D. Power's 2020 Initial Quality Study, ranking first in the Large Light Duty Pickup segment. However, long-term reliability remains to be seen as these models have not been on the market for an extensive period. In conclusion, it is challenging to declare a clear winner in the most reliable full-size American pickup truck category, as each manufacturer has models with varying levels of reliability. That said, the Ford F-150 generally earns high marks for dependability, with the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra not far behind. The RAM 1500 has shown significant promise in recent years, but its long-term reliability has yet to be firmly established.

Is the premise \\"Two men are looking at each other.\\" true if \\"Two men can't see each other.\\"?","completion":"The premises \\"Two men are looking at each other.\\" and \\"Two men can't see each other.\\" are mutually contradictory, so it is not accurate to claim that both of these statements exist simultaneously within a single context. To analyze this situation better, let's scrutinize each of the premises. The first premise states that \\"Two men are looking at each other.\\" This implies that the two men are facing each other, being an adequate distance apart so that they can establish eye contact, and clearly perceive one another. This statement's validity would depend on whether the men have unobstructed vision of each other, are not blind or experiencing vision impairment, and are actively focusing on each other's appearance. On the other hand, the second premise claims that \\"Two men can't see each other.\\" This negates the assertion of the first premise, as it conveys the inability of the men to visually perceive one another. Several reasons could contribute to the truth of this premise: 1. Physical obstacles: An object or barrier could be obstructing the men's line of sight, preventing them from visually acknowledging each other. 2. Distance: The two men may be positioned too far apart, rendering their visual perception of one another impossible or extremely challenging. For instance, if they are standing at opposite ends of a large field or in separate rooms or buildings. 3. Vision impairment: One or both men may experience visual impairments, such as blindness or low vision, rendering them unable to see anything, including each other. 4. Environmental factors: Poor lighting conditions, fog, or heavy precipitation might be hampering their ability to see each other. Given these explanations, it is essential to recognize that both premises cannot be accurate within the same context. If the two men are indeed looking at each other, they must be able to perceive one another visually; conversely, if they cannot see each other, they cannot be said to be looking at one another. Therefore, the question of whether the statement “Two men are looking at each other.” is true when given the premise “Two men can't see each other.” is resolved by acknowledging the contradiction between the two statements. Consequently, the first premise is false if the second premise is true, and vice versa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why did the driver immediately admit to being at fault ?","completion":"Based on the passage provided, the driver immediately admitted to being at fault for several reasons. While we cannot fully understand the driver's thought process without more context, we can infer the following reasons: 1. Awareness of their mistake: The driver likely realized that they had committed an error by turning left in front of the cyclist. They might have failed to check for oncoming bicycles in the bike lane or did not pay sufficient attention while entering the intersection. This awareness of having made a mistake prompted the driver to accept responsibility for the accident. 2. Clear violation of traffic rules: The cyclist mentions that they were crossing the intersection on a green light, which means they had the right-of-way. By turning left in front of the cyclist who was following the traffic rules, the driver was aware that they had committed a violation, which made it clear that they were at fault in the accident. 3. Genuine remorse: The driver's immediate admission of fault might also result from genuine remorse for putting the cyclist in harm's way. They may have felt terrible about causing the accident and wished to take responsibility and make amends as soon as possible. It can also signify that the driver was aware of the potential consequences of their actions. 4. Desire to resolve the situation: The driver could have been motivated to accept their fault and cooperate with the cyclist to resolve the issue without delay. By admitting their mistake, the driver helped establish clear facts about the incident, allowing the insurance company to assess and compensate appropriately for any damages. 5. Consciousness about road safety: The driver's quick admission of fault may also indicate that they understand the importance of road safety and the duties of motorists in sharing the road responsibly with cyclists and pedestrians. This sense of responsibility could have influenced the driver's reaction and their genuine remorse. In conclusion, the driver's immediate admission of fault can be attributed to a combination of factors, such as realizing their mistake, being aware of the traffic rules and the rights of cyclists, genuine remorse for causing harm, a desire to resolve the situation promptly, and a conscientious mindset towards road safety. These factors together led the driver to accept responsibility for the accident immediately."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a powerful psychoactive substance that impacts the human body and brain by altering perceptions, emotions, and various physiological processes. Initially synthesized by Albert Hofmann in 1938, LSD has been used for its psychedelic effects, with the substance being both revered and feared for its potent influence on human consciousness. The impact of LSD on the human body can be analyzed in various ways, which we will delve into below. 1. Effect on the brain: LSD functions primarily by interacting with serotonin receptors in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter responsible for regulating mood, appetite, sleep, and cognition, among other functions. LSD has a high affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor subtype, which is mainly distributed in the cortex, and plays a significant role in modulating sensory perception, cognitive processes, and mood states. When LSD binds to the 5-HT2A receptors, it triggers a cascade of events resulting in the activation of various signaling pathways and the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate. This excitatory neurotransmission is believed to underlie the heightened sensory awareness and altered perception experienced during an LSD trip. Additionally, LSD has been shown to increase the functional connectivity between brain regions that do not typically communicate with each other, leading to the synthesis of new neural pathways and the dissolution of the typical boundaries of self and reality. 2. Effect on the cardiovascular system: LSD can cause an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. The stimulation of the 5-HT2A receptors, along with other serotonin and adrenergic receptors, induces a release of stress hormones like norepinephrine, leading to vasoconstriction and, subsequently, elevated blood pressure and heart rate. While these physiological changes are typically well-tolerated by healthy individuals, they may pose risks for individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. 3. Effect on body temperature: LSD has the potential to raise body temperature due to its influence on the serotonin system. Serotonin plays a critical role in regulating body temperature, and excessive activation of the 5-HT2A receptors may lead to an imbalance in the body’s thermoregulatory mechanisms. This can result in hyperthermia, which, in extreme cases, can be life-threatening. 4. Effect on the muscular system: Users of LSD often report experiencing muscle tension, tremors, and increased reflexes during their trips. The exact mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood but are believed to involve the stimulation of serotonin, dopamine, and adrenergic receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems. 5. Effect on the gastrointestinal system: LSD can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal disturbances. These effects are likely mediated by the drug's interaction with serotonin receptors in the gut, specifically the 5-HT3 receptors, which are known to play a role in regulating gut motility and the vomiting reflex. 6. Psychological impact: As a powerful hallucinogen, LSD can induce a wide range of psychological effects, including altered perceptions, emotional changes, synesthesia, and, in some cases, ego dissolution. These experiences can range from euphoric to terrifying, depending on the individual's mental state and environment. While many users find the experience to be valuable for its potential for self-insight and spiritual growth, others may have difficulty integrating the intense experience and may develop persistent psychological issues such as anxiety, depersonalization, or hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD). In conclusion, LSD impacts the human body in various ways by interacting with serotonin, dopamine, and adrenergic receptors. Its profound effects on the brain induce perceptual, cognitive, and emotional alterations, while its impact on the cardiovascular, muscular, gastrointestinal, and thermoregulatory systems highlights the drug's capacity to influence a variety of physiological processes. The psychological impact of LSD can be both therapeutic and challenging, and the drug's influence on human consciousness continues to be a subject of fascination and scientific inquiry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Jim is designing a new car and playing around with different materials. If he were to decrease the weight of the vehicle, what would happen to the fuel efficiency of that vehicle? It would increase or decrease? Text: Lighter, more streamlined vehicles need less energy. Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided text, it can be inferred that if Jim were to decrease the weight of the vehicle, the fuel efficiency of that vehicle would increase. The text states that lighter and more streamlined vehicles require less energy, which implies a positive correlation between reduced weight and better fuel efficiency. Decreasing the weight of a vehicle contributes to increased fuel efficiency because lighter vehicles require less energy to accelerate and maintain motion. This, in turn, results in lower fuel consumption as the engine doesn't have to work as hard to overcome inertia and resistive forces, such as rolling resistance and air drag. Consequently, less fuel is needed to power the engine, leading to an increase in fuel efficiency and improved overall performance. Furthermore, by utilizing different materials in the design process, such as lightweight metals and advanced composites, Jim could potentially enhance not only fuel efficiency but also other aspects of the vehicle's performance. For example, lighter materials can lead to better handling, faster acceleration, and shorter braking distances, which would benefit the overall driving experience for the end user. In conclusion, based on information from the text, decreasing the weight of the vehicle would increase its fuel efficiency. Exploring and incorporating lightweight materials into the car's design could thus result in valuable benefits both for the environment and for the overall performance and attractiveness of the vehicle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But ask him now he feels about that decision, and you get a tepid response. \\"I'm not sure,\\" Poskin said. Like many farmers in the Midwest, Poskin is concerned about getting caught in the middle of a trade war, as Trump ramps up economic pressure on China. Those fears were heightened after Trump announced plans Thursday to impose tariffs on as much as 60 billion worth of Chinese imports. \\"I'm fearful they will retaliate on those tariffs,\\" Poskin said. \\"Soybean exports, wheat, poultry, chicken, beef — [there are] any number of products that we export to their country that they could retaliate with.\\" The announcement has unnerved many in Trump's base of supporters in U.S. agriculture. The trade tensions have also rattled global markets, which until recently had performed strongly. Trump's tariff decision was meant to punish Chinese companies that benefit from unfair access to U.S. technology. U.S. businesses have long bristled at Beijing's requirement that they transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition of entering the Chinese market. U.S. businesses have also had their technology stolen through cyberattacks. \\"We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on,\\" Trump said during the signing ceremony Thursday. Some U.S. companies in China cheered the move and suggested that concerns about a trade war were overblown. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, dismissed the \\"hair on fire\\" concern that Trump's proposed moves would hurt the global economy. \\"That the U.S. is willing to risk these disruptions indicates how serious the U.S. administration finds China's forced technology transfer, cybertheft and discriminatory industrial policies,\\" he said in a statement to VOA.

I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him. I took my daughter to the Zoo and Sea World but she was so young then and it was so long ago I can’t recall much except standing on line to see the pandas and just collapsing on a open type tour after trying to carry her and a collapsible stroller and diaper bag all around.

Oscar-winning actress Joan Fontaine died Sunday, her longtime friend Noel Beutel said Monday. She was 96. Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said.

Answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

His first recording was as a violist in \\"Plus blanche que la blanche hermine\\" from Les Huguenots by Meyerbeer in 1903 for Pathé with the tenor Albert Vaguet. It is possible that Monteux played in the Colonne Orchestra's 20 early cylinders recorded around 1906–07. His recording debut as a conductor was the first of his five recordings of The Rite of Spring, issued in 1929. The first of these, with the OSP, is judged by Canarina to be indifferently played; recordings by Monteux of music by Ravel and Berlioz made in 1930 and 1931, Canarina believes, were more impressive. Stravinsky, who also recorded The Rite in 1929, was furious that Monteux had made a rival recording; he made vitriolic comments privately, and for some time his relations with Monteux remained cool.Monteux's final studio recordings were with the London Symphony Orchestra in works by Ravel at the end of February 1964. In the course of his career he recorded works by more than fifty composers. In Monteux's lifetime it was rare for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would much have preferred it, he said, \\"if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions\\". Some live performances of Monteux conducting the Metropolitan Opera, and among others the San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings, and some have been issued on compact disc. It has been argued that these reveal even more than his studio recordings \\"a conductor at once passionate, disciplined, and tasteful; one who was sometimes more vibrant than the Monteux captured in the studio, and yet, like that studio conductor, a cultivated musician possessing an extraordinary ear for balance, a keen sense of style and a sure grasp of shape and line.\\"Many of Monteux's recordings have remained in the catalogues for decades, notably his RCA Victor recordings with the Boston Symphony and Chicago Symphony orchestras;... answer the following question: What is the name of the person that made recorded works by more than fifty composers?

Summarize: Sundowns were making their debut in this tournament having qualified for Japan after winning the African Champions League for the first time in their history in September. But the South Africans' hopes of progressing were dashed by two second half goals from Yasushi Endo (pictured) and Mu Kanazaki. In the first half, Sundowns dominated and were at the heart of the action with their Zimbabwean star Khama Billiat coming close. But Kashima, who beat Auckland City 2-1 in the tournament's opening match on Thursday, were gifted their opening goal by Sundowns' Ugandan goalkeeper Denis Onyango in the 63rd minute. Latching onto a knock-down from Shoma Doi, Endo scuffed his left-foot shot which somehow squeezed under Onyango, bobbling out of his grasp and over the line, almost in slow motion. Substitute Kanazaki killed the game off by smashing home from close range with two minutes left after more sloppy defending from the African champions. Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane was left to rue his side's wasted opportunities. \\"We played against a good team, they had their chances and took them, we didn't take ours,\\" Mosimane said after the match. The South Africans will now play South Korea's Jeonbuk Hyundai in the fifth-place play-off match on Wednesday. Kashima, fresh from clinching their eighth J-League crown last weekend, will face Atletico Nacional of Colombia in the competition's first semi-final on Wednesday.

Conditions on Io are difficult: gravity is 1/6 that of Earth's with no breathable atmosphere, spacesuits are cumbersome, and miners carry their own air supply. Shifts are long, but significant bonuses are paid. The outpost's general manager, Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), boasts that productivity has broken all previous records since he took over. O'Niel's wife Carol (Kika Markham) feels she cannot raise their son Paul on Io, fleeing with the child to the Jupiter space station to await a shuttle back to Earth. Later, a miner named Tarlow (John Ratzenberger) suffers an attack of stimulant psychosis: he sees spiders and rips open his spacesuit, resulting in his death by explosive decompression. Cane, another miner, enters an elevator without his spacesuit during another psychotic episode, and likewise dies from decompression. With the reluctant assistance of Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), O'Niel investigates the deaths. Another incident involves a worker, Sagan, who takes a prostitute hostage and threatens to kill her with a knife. O'Niel attempts to calm the man while Montone (James B. Sikking), his sergeant, sneaks in via the air duct and kills Sagan with a shotgun.

O'Niel uncovers a drug distribution ring run by a corrupt Sheppard and sanctioned by Montone. Using surveillance cameras, O'Niel finds and captures one of Sheppard's dealers, Nicholas Spota. However, before Spota can be questioned, he is murdered. Montone is then found garroted. O'Niel finds the latest shipment of drugs in a meat locker that was shipped from the space station, but is...

Q: In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision. Holdings represent the governing legal rule when the law is applied to a particular set of facts. There are five answer choices for each citing text. The correct answer is the holding statement that corresponds to the citing text. The four incorrect answers are other holding statements. You should find the correct option. There is a <HOLDING> token in the position of the citing text prompt where the holding statement was extracted. the automatic stay exists to give debtors the time necessary to develop a successful reorganization plan. See Shugrue v. Air Line Pilots Ass’n, Int’l (In re Ionosphere Clubs, Inc.), 922 F.2d 984, 989 (2d Cir.1990), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 50,116 L.Ed.2d 28 (1991); Fortier v. Dona Anna Plaza Partners, 747 F.2d 1324, 1330 (10th Cir.1984). Once the bankruptcy proceeding is dismissed, neither the goal of a successful reorganization nor the debtor’s right to the automatic stay continues to exist. Accordingly, it no longer serves any purpose to determine whether the bankruptcy court properly lifted the automatic stay; the appeal has become moot. See Armel Laminates, Inc. v. Lomas & Nettleton Co. (In re Income Property Builders, Inc.), 699 F.2d 963, 964 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>); cf. Omoto v. Ruggera (In re Omoto), 85 B.R.

The prompt states that the appeal has become moot after the bankruptcy proceeding is dismissed, and the goal of a successful reorganization or the debtor's right to the automatic stay no longer exists. From the holding statements, (A) holding that an appeal challenging a bankruptcy court order lifting the automatic stay became moot when the underlying bankruptcy case was dismissed, accurately reflects the context provided in the prompt and is the correct option."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His experience and expertise in skateboarding becomes apparent as he builds up speed and starts performing a series of tricks and jumps that leave the onlookers mesmerized. Kicking off with an ollie, he soars into the air, momentarily suspended in the frosty atmosphere before landing back onto the ice with a satisfying crunch. He then transitions seamlessly into a kickflip, expertly flipping the skateboard beneath his feet before it rejoins his soles, much to the delight of the growing audience. Not satisfied with just these tricks, the man decides to challenge himself further by attempting a few high-flying maneuvers. He approaches a nearby ramp, determined to conquer it, and propels himself upwards. As he reaches the peak, he quickly twists his body and skateboard into a full 360-degree spin, causing the crowd to gasp in amazement. Now fully immersed in his icy escapades, the man launches into a series of daring flips and jumps. His body twists gracefully through the air as he maintains a strong connection with his skateboard, ensuring a precise and clean landing after every trick.

Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. In 1968, the first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple attracted large audiences, though they were often derided by critics. During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \\"metalheads\\" or \\"headbangers\\". During the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as Mötley Crüe and Poison. Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre. These include groove metal (with bands such as Pantera, Sepultura, and Lamb of God) and nu metal (with bands such as Korn, Slipknot, and Linkin Park), the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop.

The","completion":"The sentence could end in a variety of ways depending on the specific context or story you want to convey. Here is a detailed and long ending for the given sentence: Amy bought a used dryer from the thrift store. The moment she saw it, she knew this was the perfect addition to her growing collection of vintage appliances. It was a charming avocado-green model from the 1970s, which matched her washing machine and refrigerator. As a staunch environmentalist and someone who appreciated the quality and style of older appliances, Amy subscribed to the notion of \\"reduce, reuse, recycle.\\" She took joy in finding these bargains and putting them to good use, instead of seeing them end up in a landfill or wasting resources on manufacturing new appliances. Once she got the dryer home, she called her friend, Dave, a knowledgeable handyman and fellow vintage appliance enthusiast, to help install it. Dave, always eager to lend a hand and share his expertise, came right over. Together, they carefully examined the dryer to ensure that it was in good working condition. Dave inspected its electrical components, the thermostat, and the heating element. He also checked the drum and its accompanying belt, looking for signs of wear and damage. To Amy’s delight, the dryer was in surprisingly excellent condition, considering its age. Next, they unplugged her old dryer and removed it from the designated space. Since Amy was an advocate of repurposing items, she decided to give her old dryer to a neighbor in need. With the old dryer out of the way, Dave and Amy proceeded to install the new-to-her thrift store find. To install the dryer, they first leveled the unit on the laundry room floor, making sure it rested solidly on all its feet to prevent vibrations and noise during operation. They then connected the dryer’s exhaust duct to the vent that extended outside, ensuring all connections were secure and free of leaks. Once the vent was connected, they attached the power cord and connected it to the 240-volt outlet that was specifically designed for dryers. Finally, after ensuring that all safety precautions had been followed, they cautiously plugged in the dryer and turned it on for a trial run. The avocado-green dryer hummed to life, and Amy couldn't help but smile with satisfaction as warm air filled the drum and the familiar scent of freshly dried laundry began to permeate the air. To celebrate their successful installation, Amy and Dave sat down for a cup of coffee in her cozy kitchen, which was adorned with vintage décor. They chatted about their shared appreciation for older appliances, their reliability, and the charm they add to a living space. It was moments like these that Amy cherished, as they demonstrated the power of sustainability and community through her love for vintage appliances. In conclusion, Amy buying a used dryer from the thrift store not only turned out to be a fantastic bargain, but it also allowed her to contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle and strengthen her connection with her handyman friend, creating a heartwarming story driven by shared passions and environmental consciousness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(2). cuts a large piece of wood, with two axes blows the wood. (3). puts a blade on the wood and move it into a straightener. (4). takes a piece of the wood he cut and throws it into a pile. Step 1: Analyze the continuity of each option. Option 1 shows a logical progression, with the man continuing to cut wood. Option 2 seems odd as it's unclear why two axes would be needed, but it is still related to cutting wood. Option 3 introduces a new action (straightening the wood) that hasn't been mentioned before, making it less relevant. Option 4 shows a logical progression in which the man has completed cutting and is disposing of the cut wood. Step 2: Evaluate the relevance of each option. Options 1, 2, and 4 are all relevant, as they directly relate to the wood-cutting activity mentioned earlier. Option 3 is less relevant because it introduces a new, unrelated action. Step 3: Choose the most likely ending based on analysis. Based on the analysis, the most likely ending seems to be: (4). takes a piece of the wood he cut and throws it into a pile.

He was on the heavy side. 2. It brought out his better side. Step 1: Understanding the context of each sentence 1. In the first sentence, \\"He was on the heavy side\\" means that the person's weight is more than average or slightly heavier. 2.

Four A:","completion":"Title: Four Lives in Peril Step 1: Introduction of Characters Introduce Glenn Griffin, a charming but ruthless escaped convict, and his two fellow escapees, Hank and Tommy, both equally menacing but with distinct personalities. They are trying to evade the police after a recent prison break. Step 2: Hostage Situation Setup Glenn, Hank, and Tommy decide to hide out at a seemingly ordinary suburban household. The house belongs to the Miller family: John, a stern and protective father; Laura, a loving and resourceful mother; Emily, an adventurous and intelligent teenager; and Billy, their resourceful and tech-savvy youngest son. Step 3: Tension and Conflict Build-Up Glenn and his men hold the Miller family hostage, demanding their cooperation in exchange for the family's safety. Tensions rise as both the family and their captors become more desperate to avoid the police. Glenn has clear goals for his escape and needs the family to ensure its success, while the Millers struggle to survive and find a way to alert the police without endangering their lives. Step 4: Personal Connections and Internal Struggles As the hours turn into days, lingering fears and insecurities surface. Glenn starts to develop feelings for Laura, which Hank and Tommy confront him about. John tries to maintain control over the situation, while Emily and Billy secretly work on an escape plan together while bonding with their captors. Step 5: The Turning Point Emily and Billy manage to send a coded message for help using their tech knowledge, but not without arousing suspicion from the convicts. As the police close in, Glenn and his men become increasingly paranoid, and the Millers' lives are put in more danger. Step 6: The Climactic Standoff Just when all hope seems lost, the police arrive, surrounding the house and leaving Glenn, Hank, and Tommy with limited options. Conflicted over his feelings for Laura and his partnership with the other convicts, Glenn faces the decision of surrendering or forging a violent path to escape. Step 7: The Resolution Glenn decides to turn against his fellow escapees, ensuring the safety of the family he has come to care for. As the police eventually arrest all the convicts, the Miller family emerges from the hostage situation both shaken and grateful for their survival. The family's bond is strengthened in the aftermath, having faced their fears together. Step 8: Reflecting on the Story Four Lives in Peril serves as a thrilling tale of desperation, love, and the undeniable strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity. Despite the inevitable consequences of their actions, each character reveals their multifaceted nature, reminding us that even in the darkest of situations, human connections can prevail."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which month of the year was wetter, September 2018 or September 2019? Hint: When the subtropical ridge in the Northwest Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia.[18] The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States. Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20] A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, September 2018 was wetter than September 2019.

This area has become one of Tucson's iconic neighborhoods. In 1891, the Fort was abandoned and much of the interior was stripped of their useful components and it quickly fell into ruin. In 1900, three of the officer buildings were purchased for use as a sanitarium. The sanitarium was then sold to Harvey Adkins in 1928. The Bolsius family Pete, Nan and Charles Bolsius purchased and renovated surviving adobe buildings of the Fort – transforming them into spectacular artistic southwestern architectural examples. Their woodwork, plaster treatment and sense of proportion drew on their Dutch heritage and New Mexican experience. Other artists and academics throughout the middle of the 20th century, including: Win Ellis, Jack Maul, Madame Cheruy, Giorgio Belloli, Charels Bode, Veronica Hughart, Edward and Rosamond Spicer, Hazel Larson Archer and Ruth Brown, renovated adobes, built homes and lived in the area. The artist colony attracted writers and poets including beat generation Alan Harrington and Jack Kerouac whose visit is documented in his iconic book On the Road.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is true when the first sentence is true, let's examine both sentences step-by-step: Sentence 1: \\"Let's find some place where we can see whether it's impossible now for you to magic up a decent meal.\\" This sentence implies that we are searching for a location to test whether or not it is impossible for a decent meal to be created using magic. This may also imply that there may have been a time when conjuring a decent meal was possible, and we are checking the current situation. Sentence 2: \\"Let's find a place where you can conjure up some chicken.\\" This sentence suggests that we are looking for a location where a magical ability can be used to create or prepare chicken as a meal. Now, let's consider the relationship between these sentences: If we assume the first sentence is true, we are actively seeking a location to determine the feasibility of magically creating meals. If it turns out that it is indeed impossible for me to magic up a decent meal, then the second sentence can not be true, as I would not be able to conjure up some chicken. However, if we find that it is still possible for me to create a meal using magic during our search, then the second sentence would be true, as we could find a location where I can conjure up some chicken using magic. In conclusion, the truth of the second sentence being true depends on the outcome of the search and the current capability of using magic to create a meal.

Answer:","completion":"The title \\"The Ferryman (film)\\" belongs to the category of \\"film.\\" The Ferryman is a feature-length motion picture that falls within this category since it is a form of visual storytelling produced for entertainment purposes. Films are a significant component of the entertainment industry, and they are created through collaborative efforts of various professionals, such as directors, writers, actors, cinematographers, and sound designers. In this context, \\"The Ferryman\\" represents a narrative work that has been adapted into a visual medium to engage audiences and convey a particular story. It is important to distinguish films from other categories, such as companies, educational institutions, artists, athletes, office holders, means of transportation, buildings, natural places, villages, animals, plants, albums, or written works. Each of these categories serves its specific purpose or function, often independent of the entertainment industry.

Here's the step-by-step process: 1. The speaker says, \\"I don't believe in command and control out of Washington, D.C.\\" This statement suggests that the speaker has opinions about the role of the federal government, but it doesn't necessarily indicate that they work for the federal government. 2. The statement \\"I believe Washington ought to set standards\\" implies the speaker might have knowledge or interest in policymaking. While this may suggest a connection to the federal government, it is not definitive evidence. 3. The speaker's emphasis on collaboration at local levels could show that they are more aligned with local or state governments or organizations, rather than directly working for the federal government. 4. Lastly, the speaker's need to correct someone else's statement could imply they have a stake in the conversation and may hold a position where accuracy matters. This might point to some sort of professional background, but it does not clearly indicate a federal government job.

With the growth of the Internet and the ease of publishing content, more and more creative minds are coming online to share videos, music, software, products, services, opinions, and more. While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. Now, I have a new situation: Two friends liked studying about the Earth's atmosphere. Vick studied more about the troposphere, while Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect.

For this method, we'll start with a fully-assembled tank, minus the fish, just like in the method above. However, this time, we won't add the fish until the entire cycle is completed. Instead, we'll add biological waste manually as we monitor the water level and wait for the cycle to complete. This method requires a lot of patience, as it requires you to wait for the organic material you add to your tank to decay and start producing toxic waste products. However, it's often considered a more \\"humane\\" option as it doesn't expose fish to ammonia and nitrites like the method above does. To begin, drop just a few flakes of fish food into your tank — about as much as you'd use to feed your fish will do. Now, simply wait. Over the next few days, the flakes will begin to decay and release waste products (including ammonia) into the water. Use a test kit (or bring a water sample to your local pet store) to test your water for ammonia levels. You want to have a level of at least three parts per million (ppm). If you don't have enough ammonia in your water, add more flakes and wait for them to decay before testing again. Continue to test your water every other day for ammonia levels. As beneficial bacteria begins to grow in your aquarium, it will start to consume the ammonia, reducing the ammonia levels. Replenish them by adding fish flakes whenever the ammonia level falls below three ppm. As the bacteria start consuming ammonia, they'll begin to produce nitrites, the intermediate type of chemical in the nitrate cycle (which is less toxic than ammonia but still harmful to fish). Start testing for nitrites after a week or so — again, you can use a commercial test kit or take water samples to a pet shop to do this. Once you detect nitrites, you'll know the cycle has started. At this point, you'll continue adding ammonia as you have before. As you feed the bacteria in the tank ammonia, the nitrite levels will continue to rise. Eventually, however, enough beneficial bacteria will grow to convert the nitrites into nitrates, the final type of chemical in the nitrate cycle (and one that isn't harmful to fish.) When this happens, you'll know the cycle is nearing completion. You can detect this final phase of the cycle by either testing for nitrites (in which case you're looking for a sudden drop), nitrates (in which case you're looking for a sudden spike from a base level of zero), or both. After about six to eight weeks, the ammonia and nitrite levels should decrease to a level that's so low you can no longer detect them, while nitrate levels should plateau. At this point, it's safe to add your fish. However, as in the method above, you'll want to add your fish gradually. Don't add more than a few small fish at a time and wait at least a week or two before introducing your next batch of fish. Consider cleaning the substrate with a siphon hose before adding fish, particularly if you had to add a lot of food. Decaying food or plant matter can become a ticking time bomb. If it gets trapped in the gravel, the ammonia won't enter the water, but if something upsets it, it could release a fair amount of ammonia rather quickly. Summary:","completion":"In simple words, to start a fish tank without using fish, we need to follow these steps: 1. Set up your tank with everything except the fish. 2. Add a little bit of fish food to the tank; it will break down and create waste. 3. Test the water for ammonia levels, which should be at least three parts per million (ppm). 4. Keep adding fish food and test the water every other day to maintain ammonia levels. 5. After a week, start checking for nitrite levels, which show the cycle has started. 6. Keep adding ammonia, and soon, the bacteria will change nitrites into nitrates (safe for fish). 7. After six to eight weeks, ammonia and nitrite levels should be low, and it's safe to add fish. 8.

Bosons make up one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions. The name boson was coined by Paul Dirac to commemorate the contribution of the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose in developing, with Einstein, BoseEinstein statisticswhich theorizes the characteristics of elementary particles. Examples of bosons include fundamental particles such as photons, gluons, and W and Z bosons (the four force-carrying gauge bosons of the Standard Model), the recently discovered Higgs boson, and the hypothetical graviton of quantum gravity; composite particles (e.g. mesons and stable nuclei of even mass number such as deuterium (with one proton and one neutron, mass number = 2), helium-4, or lead-208); and some quasiparticles (e.g. Cooper pairs, plasmons, and phonons). - A quark (or ) is an elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei. Due to a phenomenon known as \\"color confinement\\", quarks are never directly observed or found in isolation; they can be found only within hadrons, such as baryons (of which protons and neutrons are examples) and mesons. For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of the hadrons themselves. - Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or \\"gravitate\\" toward) one another, including planets, stars and galaxies. Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy, including light, also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars and the stars to group together into galaxies so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects. - Particle physics (also high energy physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute \\"matter\\" (particles with mass) and \\"radiation\\" (massless particles). Although the word \\"particle\\" can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. protons, gas particles, or even household dust), \\"particle physics\\" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary to explain them. By our current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest \\"known\\" particle, the Higgs boson, or even to the oldest known force field, gravity. - In particle physics , a hadron i / hædrn / ( Greek : , hadrós , \`\` stout , thick '' ) is a composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong force ( in a similar way as molecules are held together by the electromagnetic force ) . Hadrons are categorized into two families : baryons , made of three quarks , and mesons , made of one quark and one antiquark . Protons and neutrons are examples of baryons ; pions are an example of a meson . Hadrons containing more than three valence quarks ( exotic hadrons ) have been discovered in recent years . A tetraquark state ( an exotic meson ) , named the Z ( 4430 ) , was discovered in 2007 by the Belle Collaboration and confirmed as a resonance in 2014 by the LHCb collaboration . Two pentaquark states ( exotic baryons ) , named P + - In particle physics, mesons (or ) are hadronic subatomic particles composed of one quark and one antiquark, bound together by the strong interaction. Because mesons are composed of quark sub-particles, they have a physical size, with a diameter of roughly one fermi, which is about the size of a proton or neutron. All mesons are unstable, with the longest-lived lasting for only a few hundredths of a microsecond. Charged mesons decay (sometimes through mediating particles) to form electrons and neutrinos. Uncharged mesons may decay to photons. Both of these decays imply that color is no longer a property of the byproducts. What is the relationship between 'hadron' and 'gravity'? A:","completion":"The relationship between hadrons and gravity lies in the fact that hadrons, being particles with mass, are subject to gravitational forces. Hadrons, as composite particles made up of quarks, are building blocks of atomic nuclei and thus contribute to the mass of larger structures like atoms and molecules. Gravity, being a natural force that attracts all objects with mass, influences the behavior and interactions of these hadronic particles. However, it is important to note that within the realm of particle physics, gravity has a relatively weak effect compared to other fundamental forces such as the strong nuclear force or the electromagnetic force. Researchers are looking for ways to integrate gravity into the framework of quantum mechanics which currently does not fully explain gravitational interactions, and one of the theories under investigation is quantum gravity. In summary, the relationship between hadrons and gravity is that hadrons are subject to gravitational forces due to their mass, but the study and understanding of that relationship remains an open and challenging area in physics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

So, most people have probably met that person that acts all suicidal and then uses that against you. For example, you’re talking to someone like that and you’re having some sort of argument and the moment they realize they aren’t winning they send you pictures of their bloodied wrists and say “This is your fault”. Well, that person was my friend for a long time. Every time I would try to leave her to go to sleep she would threaten to do “something bad” and I knew what she meant, and me, first meeting her when I was around 9 or 10, and I was still extremely naive. So most of the time, I ended up staying awake til 3 AM on school nights and I would get only a few hours of sleep, and she’d be happy because her life wasn’t worsened at all. But I think the thing that made me the most miserable, was the fact that it never got better. No matter how much I talked to her, or how sympathetic I tried to be, or how much I tried to convince her to be happier, it never got better. She still acted super depressed, but like it was a joke. All of these things combined to make me completely miserable because it seemed like it was all for nothing. But I just let it happen, because she was the only person I had and she was really my only “friend” at that point, and all the way up to seventh grade.

Options are: (a). yes (b). no","completion":"(b). No Although the statement provided is related to the quantized model of the atom, it is not the complete answer to the question of who introduced the first quantized model of the atom. The first quantized (or quantum) model of the atom was introduced by Danish physicist Niels Bohr in 1913. Bohr's model was a major advancement in the understanding of atomic structure and played a significant role in the development of quantum mechanics. While it is true that Bohr's model involved the quantization of energy levels, the provided statement only focuses on a specific aspect of the model. In his quantum model, Niels Bohr proposed that electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed paths, or orbits, with specific, quantized energy levels. This means that electrons could only exist in these orbits and could not exist between them. To move between these orbits, electrons must gain or lose specific, quantized amounts of energy in the form of photons. Bohr's model was primarily aimed at explaining the behavior of the hydrogen atom and its ability to emit and absorb light in discrete wavelengths, as observed in spectral lines. Indeed, Bohr did make explicit reference to Max Planck's work on quantized energy levels and applied the same concept to the atomic model. Planck's work on black-body radiation is foundational to quantum mechanics as it showed that energy was not continuous, but rather discrete and quantized in the form of packets called quanta. In summary, Niels Bohr introduced the first quantized model of the atom in 1913, and his model included the idea of quantized energy levels for electrons based on Max Planck's work. The provided statement only describes a portion of this model and does not fully answer the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Mary Watts died in 1938, and was buried alongside George Frederic Watts near the Watts Mortuary Chapel, which she had herself designed and built in Compton in 1901. Following her death, and with both George and Mary Watts increasingly out of fashion, the memorial was abandoned half-finished, with only 52 of the intended 120 spaces filled. In the years following Mary Watts's death there were occasional proposals to add new names to complete the memorial, but the Watts Gallery was hostile to the plans, considering the monument in its unfinished state to be a symbol of the Watts's values and beliefs, and that its status as a historic record of its time is what makes it of value in the present day.The nave of Christ Church Greyfriars was destroyed by bombing on 29 December 1940. By then the decline in the population of the City of London had reduced the congregation to less than 80, and the parishes of St Leonard, Foster Lane and Christ Church Greyfriars were merged with nearby St Sepulchre-without-Newgate. Although parts of the ruins were cleared during a widening of King Edward Street after the Second World War, the remains of the nave of Christ Church Greyfriars became a public memorial in 1989; the tower is now office space.St Botolph's Aldersgate remains open as a functioning church. Unusually for an English church, because of its location in a now mainly commercial area with few local residents, services are held on Tuesdays instead of the more traditional Sundays.

Brian was very creative and brave.","completion":"Once upon a time in a small town named Breezyville, there was a young boy named Brian. Brian was known throughout the town, not only for his wild, curly hair but also for his boundless imagination and incredible courage. Every day before school, Brian would create new gadgets and gizmos to share with his friends. He transformed the mundane daily routine of walking to school into an exciting adventure, each day filled with wonder and awe. One early morning, as autumn leaves danced around him, Brian had a sudden burst of inspiration. He decided he was going to build a flying machine. He hoped his invention would allow him and his friends to traverse the skies and explore new heights together. In his backyard, Brian began to gather items to construct his flying contraption: bicycle wheels, wood scraps, and an old laundry basket. He toiled away, carefully following the blueprint conjured by his young mind, and night after night, he worked tirelessly. As the days passed, whispers of Brian's project slowly spread around the small town. Breezyville buzzed with curiosity, and people spoke with a mix of excitement and disbelief about the young boy's ambition. But Brian was undeterred by the murmurs and continued steadfastly with his creation. With the townspeople's skepticism beginning to seep into their consciousness, Brian's loyal group of friends felt their confidence falter. Yet, Brian's unwavering resolve motivated them all to believe in his dream. Finally, after weeks of meticulous work, the day arrived when Brian's flying machine stood tall and proud in his backyard, complete with wings made of sturdy fabric, an engine made of old lawnmower parts, and a steering wheel fashioned from a bicycle handle. The townspeople of Breezyville gathered to witness this extraordinary event. Doubts filled the air like dense fog, but Brian, feeling the weight of the moment, climbed into the machine with a sense of determination he had never felt before. His friends cheered him on, their confidence in him renewed. Brian started the engine, and the flying machine shuddered to life. With a smile on his face and a glint of exhilaration in his eyes, Brian raised the machine off the ground and soared into the sky. As the crowd gasped and stared in awe, Brian navigated his flying contraption through the clouds, navigating the vast expanse above the town. His friends could not help but cheer louder, tears of joy streaming down their faces. It was then that they realized they had underestimated their curly-haired friend – for Brian was very creative and brave."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Do those questions have the same meaning? Select from the following. I. no. II. yes.","completion":"Covalent bonds and ionic bonds are two different types of chemical bonds that can occur between atoms. 1. Covalent bonds are formed when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. To understand the process step-by-step, let's take a look at the following: Step 1: Two atoms come close to one another, usually nonmetals with similar electronegativities. Step 2: The atoms attract each other's valence (outer shell) electrons. Step 3: The atoms achieve a more stable electron configuration by sharing one or more pairs of electrons. Step 4: The shared electrons form a cloud of electron density between the nuclei, holding the atoms together in a covalently bonded molecule. 2. Ionic bonds are formed when one or more electrons are transferred from one atom to another. Let's break down the process: Step 1: A metal atom with one or few valence electrons comes close to a nonmetal atom with a nearly full valence shell. Step 2: The metal atom loses electrons, becoming a positive ion (cation), while the nonmetal atom gains electrons, becoming a negative ion (anion). Step 3: The oppositely charged ions attract each other, forming an ionic bond in a compound known as an ionic solid or salt. Now, addressing the question about whether the two original questions have the same meaning, we can select the answer: I. no. The two questions deal with distinct types of chemical bonds – covalent and ionic – and describe different processes to form compounds. Hence, the questions do not have the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Imagine a ball bouncing off a surface. Light can do the same thing. That is, assuming the surface is shiny. So how do you know where light will go after it strikes a shiny surface? It depends on how the light initially strikes the shiny object. Light does not always go straight toward a surface. Therefore, not all light bounces straight back. Sometimes, light can hit a surface at an angle. The angle at which it strikes the surface tells us how it will bounce off. While light is different to a ball, they react in a similar manner. Many sports rely on knowledge of reflection. Pool players know a lot about reflection. They take great care when they strike the pool ball. They need it to go to a certain place. They know the angle it will hit the side of the pool table.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Students working on their thesis for graduate school decide that they will write about the differences between two identical plants, but they will infect one of the plants with a fungus. This fungus will create a mycorrhizal association between one of the plants and the fungus. After caring for the plants, the students have grown fond of them and given them names. They have named one of them Audrey and the other Baudrey. They flip a coin to decide which plant will be infected with the fungus, and fate has decided that Audrey will have the fungus grow on it. Baudrey will be left to grow naturally. and a hint : A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. Please answer this question : Which plant's roots will have more surface area? Answer:","completion":"In this situation, we have two plants, Audrey and Baudrey. Audrey will be infected with a fungus that creates a mycorrhizal association, whereas Baudrey will grow naturally without the fungus. To determine which plant's roots will have more surface area, we need to consider the effects of the mycorrhizal association. Step 1: Understand the mycorrhizal association From the hint given, a mycorrhizal association is a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and the roots of a plant. The fungus colonizes the plant roots, providing increased surface area for the roots and, in turn, improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. Step 2: Analyze the impact on root surface area With the mycorrhizal association present in Audrey's roots, Audrey gains the advantage of a larger root surface area due to the presence of the fungus. Baudrey, on the other hand, grows naturally without the fungus, and therefore its root surface area remains unchanged. Step 3: Compare Audrey's and Baudrey's root surface area Considering that the mycorrhizal association increases the plant's root surface area and Audrey is the plant with this association, Audrey's roots will have more surface area compared to Baudrey."},{"prompt":"Given the question: \\"Sparganothis richersi\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Article:","completion":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Dealing with Seasonal Allergies: Tips and Tricks for Clearing Your Sinuses Introduction As the seasons change and the blossoming flowers fill the air with pollen, millions of people around the world find themselves struggling with seasonal allergies. These allergies can range from mildly annoying to severely debilitating, affecting a person's quality of life. In an attempt to help, we have compiled a comprehensive guide on how to combat seasonal allergies, and take control of your sinus health. 1. Rinse Out Your Nose A simple yet effective method for alleviating allergy symptoms is to regularly rinse your nose. By using a nasal irrigation solution, such as a saline solution, you can flush out the build-up of allergens and excess mucus from your nasal passages. This method not only provides relief from congestion but also reduces inflammation in your sinuses. To use a nasal rinse, you can opt for various methods such as a neti pot, a squeeze bottle, or a bulb syringe. While preparing the saline solution, ensure you only use distilled or previously boiled water. After use, always clean your equipment to prevent any bacterial growth. 2. Take Nonprescription Antihistamines Antihistamines are medications that fundamentally counter the effects of histamine, a substance produced by the body during an allergic reaction. By blocking histamine, antihistamines help to alleviate the symptoms of allergies such as sneezing, runny nose, and itching. Several over-the-counter antihistamines are available, including Loratadine (Claritin), Cetirizine (Zyrtec), and Fexofenadine (Allegra). When purchasing antihistamine medication, make sure to read the labels and choose the correct dosage. Consult your doctor if you are pregnant, nursing or have other existing medical conditions before using antihistamines. 3. Try Taking a Decongestant If your seasonal allergies are causing moderate to severe congestion, you might benefit from taking a decongestant. Decongestants work by narrowing blood vessels in your nasal passages, thereby reducing swelling and congestion. However, they may provide only short-term relief, so it is not recommended to use them for prolonged periods. Common over-the-counter decongestants include pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) and phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine). Like with antihistamines, be sure to choose the correct dosage and consult a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing medical conditions. 4. Talk With Your Doctor If your seasonal allergy symptoms persist despite trying the above methods, or if you are experiencing severe symptoms, make sure to consult your healthcare provider. They can assess your condition and recommend further treatments. In some cases, your doctor might prescribe a prescription-strength medication or combination therapy to provide relief. 5. Consider an Allergy Shot Allergy shots (immunotherapy) are another potential solution for individuals who suffer from severe or chronic seasonal allergies. This treatment involves injecting small amounts of allergens into the patient's body to help the immune system build tolerance gradually. Over time, this process can result in decreased sensitivity to allergens, leading to a reduction in allergy symptoms. Before opting for allergy shots, it is essential to consult your doctor to ensure this treatment is suitable for your specific situation. Immunotherapy may involve numerous injections over several years, depending on the severity of the allergies and the frequency of treatments recommended. Conclusion Seasonal allergies can be a challenging, uncomfortable experience, but with the help of the strategies outlined in this article, you can alleviate your symptoms and enjoy the changing beauty of the seasons. Remember to consult your healthcare provider before trying new medications or treatments, and most importantly, listen to your body and take care of your health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If he drives both for an hour on the freeway, which will have gone the smaller distance? (A) truck (B) car. What is the most sensical answer between \\"Truck\\" and \\"Car\\"? Answer:","completion":"The most sensical answer between \\"Truck\\" and \\"Car\\" would be (A) truck. In the given short story, it is mentioned that Mike's truck is slower than his car. To determine which vehicle will have gone the smaller distance when both are driven for an hour on the freeway, we need to consider the speed of each vehicle. This is because the distance covered by a vehicle in motion is directly proportional to its speed and time taken. We know that: - Mike's truck is slower than his car. - Both are driven for an hour on the freeway. From this information, we can deduce the following: When two vehicles travel for an equal amount of time, the one with a slower speed will cover less distance compared to the faster vehicle. As Mike's truck is slower than his car, it will take the truck a longer amount of time to cover the same distance that the car can cover in a shorter time. Therefore, when both vehicles are driven for an hour on the freeway, Mike's truck will have gone a smaller distance compared to his car. So, the most sensical answer is (A) truck, as it is the slower vehicle and will have traveled less distance in the given time frame."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

For most rock bands, the pursuit of wisdom's a low priority compared to fame, fortune and fornication. Such a band was Strange Fruit.\\" Thus begins the opening dialog of Hughie, (Billy Connolly) as he launches into a brief history of the British band: in the late 1970's Strange Fruit, consisting of guitarist Brian Lovell (Bruce Robinson), his brother and lead singer Keith, keyboard player Tony Costello (Stephen Rea), bassist Les Wickes (Jimmy Nail) and drummer Beano Baggot (Timothy Spall) were HUGE. When Keith died of a drug overdose, he was replaced on vocals by Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Watched over by road-dog Hughie and Girl Friday Karen (Juliet Aubrey), they soldiered on until the disastrous appearance at the open-air Wisbech (U.K.) Rock Festival, when lightning struck the stage during their opening number. The already-contentious band members decided it was a sign and immediately broke up forever (all this in the first five minutes of the film). Forever, that is, until in the present (OK, 1998) Tony is spotted on Ibeza (he now stocks condoms in the restrooms at the resorts there) by the son of the Wisbech promoter, who wants to put together a 20th anniversary reunion concert with all the original acts. Tony seeks out Karen, now a divorced mother who coordinates conferences for a major hotel, suggesting a possible reunion. She is ambivalent, as is Les (now a successful roofer with a family) and Ray (a struggling solo artist with a demanding second wife -- Swedish -- and a mansion he can't afford). Beano, working in a floral nursery and hounded by the Inland Revenue (the U.K.'s IRS) is the only immediately enthusiastic bandmate. They arrange a meeting, where Karen informs them that she's tracked Brian and found his music royalties are being distributed per a bequest in his will, provoking Beano to compassionately ask if that means \\"the silly sod's dead?\\" The band again soldiers on.

One day after a mass shooting killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reiterated his support for a plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. At a campaign rally in New Hampshire Monday, Trump promised his supporters that, if elected, he would use the executive powers to \\"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\\" Although the suspected Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, was an American citizen, Trump suggested immigrants from the Middle East can come to the U.S. and radicalize people who are already here, or work to convince them online. \\"The media talks about homegrown terrorism,\\" Trump said. \\"But Islamic radicalism ... and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or don't like it.\\" Refugees and immigrants from conflict ridden Middle Eastern countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya could \\"be a better, bigger more horrible version than the legendary Trojan horse ever was,\\" Trump said. But a recent Brookings Institution survey found Americans are far more welcoming of refugees than the billionaire candidate. Of those surveyed, 59 percent support accepting refugees, while 41 percent oppose it. Those views are split right down party lines, with just 38 percent of Republicans supporting taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared to 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. The Obama administration has set a goal of admitting as many as 10,000 Syrian refugees to the United States by the fall.Respondents of the surveys also were sharply divided on whether they would be willing to accept refugees from Syria in particular, with 61 percent of Republicans saying the U.S. should not accept Syrian refugees, compared to 27 percent of Democrats.

Venture capitalists curb investment in third quarter Venture capitalists curtailed their investments in the third quarter, suggesting the financiers who bankrolled the dot-com boom are taking a more sober approach to the revived interest in high-tech startups. Which topic is this article about? Choices: (a). World; (b). Sports; (c). Business; (d). Science/Tech;","completion":"This article is about topic (c). Business. The article highlights the current trend of venture capitalists scaling back their investments in the third quarter. Venture capitalists are vital components in the business world as they provide financial backing for new and innovative startups that may have difficulty obtaining traditional financing. This reduction in investment suggests that venture capitalists are exercising more caution and restraint, perhaps to avoid the consequences and pitfalls that occurred during the dot-com boom. During the dot-com boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was a significant increase in investment in internet-based companies. Venture capitalists played a crucial role in funding these high-tech startups, hoping to capitalize on the rapid growth of the burgeoning internet industry. Unfortunately, this excessive investment led to the eventual burst of the dot-com bubble, causing many companies to fail and billions of dollars to be lost, resulting in a widespread impact on the business world and economy. In response to these past errors, venture capitalists are now taking a more sober approach to investing in high-tech startups, considering the risks and potential downsides more closely. This cautious attitude may also be influenced by the current economic climate and various global factors that can directly affect businesses and their growth prospects. By choosing to implement a more conservative investment strategy, venture capitalists protect themselves, their investors, and the businesses they back from potential risks and financial losses. This shift in risk tolerance and behavior supports long-term growth, stability, and sustainability in the business world, specifically concerning the high-tech startup industry. In conclusion, the article addresses a critical aspect of the business sector - venture capital investments and their impact on high-tech startups. It emphasizes the importance of responsible and cautious investment decisions made by venture capitalists to ensure a more stable and sustainable business environment in the future. As such, this article falls under the business category (c)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Hypothesis: A young man is in his bed sleeping. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the given premise. The premise and the hypothesis describe two different situations, and there is no direct relationship between the two to establish a definite conclusion about the hypothesis being true if the premise is true. Let's analyze each part separately for a better understanding: 1. Premise: A youth standing next to a metal fence with a black shirt on and a cigarette in their mouth. In the premise, we are given a scenario where a youth is standing near a metal fence while wearing a black shirt and holding a cigarette in their mouth. This scenario implies that the youth is awake and engaged in an activity at the particular moment described. We can understand the situation, location, and attire of the youth. 2. Hypothesis: A young man is in his bed sleeping. The hypothesis portrays a different scenario altogether. Here, a young man is depicted to be in bed and sleeping. This suggests that it's a completely separate time and perhaps a different location, as the young man is mentioned to be asleep, contrary to the premise that showed the youth being awake. To conclude, we cannot determine if the hypothesis is true or false based on the premise provided. The two situations are unrelated and independent of each other, with no evidence or connection to support a conclusion that the hypothesis's authenticity relies on the premise being accurate.

While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer. You will be given a summary of a story. You need to create a question that can be answered from the story. You can create a question about characters, events, facts and beliefs, etc. Your question should be specific, try not to use pronouns instead of full names. As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning. An elderly woman tells her granddaughter a bedtime story of where snow comes from, by telling her the story of a young man named Edward who has scissors for hands. As the creation of an old Inventor, Edward was a human-like boy who was in the penultimate stage of work. The Inventor homeschooled Edward, but suffered a fatal heart attack and died just as he was about to fasten hands on Edward. Local Avon saleswoman Peg Boggs visits the decrepit Gothic mansion on the hill where Edward lives. She finds Edward alone at first startled, but, upon realizing he means well and is virtually harmless, takes him to her home. Edward becomes friends with Peg's young son Kevin and her husband Bill. He later falls in love with the Boggs' beautiful teenage daughter Kim, despite her initial fear of him. Peg's neighbors are impressed by Edward's adept hedge-trimming and hair-cutting skills, though an eccentric religious fanatic named Esmeralda and Kim's overbearing boyfriend Jim are fearful and contemptuous of him. Joyce, an ageing, unfaithful housewife in the Boggs' neighborhood, has become fascinated with Edward and suggests that Edward open a hair-cutting salon with her. While examining a proposed site, she attempts to seduce him in the back room, causing Edward to leave in a panic, and Joyce rumoring of him trying to rape her. Wanting money for a van, Jim takes advantage of Edward's ability to pick locks to break into his parents' house to steal from his wealthy but bullying father. The burglar alarm sounds and everyone except Edward flees after he is trapped by the automatic locks triggered by the alarm, despite Kim's insistence that they return for him, as the police have him arrested. He is released when a psychological examination reveals that his isolation allowed him to live without a sense of reality and common sense. Upon questioning by Peg, Edward takes full blame for the robbery, and is scrutinized for his behavior, believed to have committed the robbery as earlier he was denied a bank loan for his hair salon. During Christmas, Edward is cast out by almost everyone except the Boggs family. When Edward returns home, he reveals that he knew it was Jim's house and that he did it because she asked him to, much to Kim's shock. While the family is setting up Christmas decorations, Edward creates a large angel ice sculpture (modelled on Kim). The shavings create an effect of falling snow, which Kim dances under. Jim arrives and calls out to Edward, startling him, resulting in Edward accidentally cutting Kim's hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming her and attacks him which causes Kim who is finally fed up with Jim's jealousy towards Edward to break up with him. Edward runs away, wandering the neighborhood in a rage, ruining one of his earlier hedge works, pokes a hole in the tire on someone's car, and trims a bush in Esmeralda's front yard into the shape of the devil. However, when a shaggy puppy comes near, Edward calms down, smiles at the dog and give it a trim. While Peg and Bill search for Edward, he returns and finds Kim alone in the Boggs' house. She asks Edward to hold her, but he is afraid that he will hurt her again she pulls his arms around her and they embrace. Jim returns to the Boggs' house in a drunken rage to confront Kim, forcing his friend to drive his van while inebriated. Kevin is almost run over, but Edward pushes him out of the way, cutting Kevin's arms and face, causing witnesses to think he is attacking him. Jim then attacks him furiously and Edward cuts Jim's right arm. When the police arrive, Edward flees to the mansion as the neighbors pursue. Kim runs to the mansion, reuniting with Edward. Jim follows her and attacks them with a handgun, beating Edward severely, who refuses to fight until Jim strikes Kim across the face when she intervenes. Edward stabs Jim in the stomach and pushes him to fall out of a window to his death. Kim confesses her love for Edward and they share a kiss before saying goodbye. Kim tells the townspeople that Edward and Jim fought each other to death and tells them that the roof caved in on Edward, showing them a discarded scissor-hand from the Inventor's lab. The neighbors return home with Joyce feeling guilty for framing Edward and causing the neighbors to hate him. The elderly woman finishes telling her granddaughter the story, revealing that she is Kim and saying that she never saw Edward again. She chose not to visit him because decades have passed and she wanted him to remember her the way she was in her youth. She believes that Edward is still alive, immortal because he is artificial, and because of the winter \\"snow\\" that Edward creates by carving ice sculptures that scatter shavings over the neighborhood, and remind her of dancing in the snow long ago.","completion":"What specific skills of Edward impress Peg's neighbors, and what business idea does Joyce propose to Edward based on these skills?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: When did the scientist's blood vessels dilate less, during experiment A, or during B? Hint: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the building that Viscount Grey de Wilton laid the first stone for?, using the article: Radcliffe Tower is all that remains of an early 15th-century stone-built manor house. The structure is a Grade I listed building and protected as a Scheduled Monument. The construction of a nearby tithe barn is not documented, but it was probably built between 1600 and 1720. It was used for storage of the local tithes (a tenth of a farm's produce). Along with Radcliffe Tower, the Parish Church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building. The town also has two Grade II* listed buildings; Dearden Fold Farmhouse, completed during the 16th century, and Radcliffe Cenotaph, built in 1922 to commemorate the First World War. Outwood Viaduct, and Radcliffe's most visible landmark, St Thomas' Church, are Grade II listed buildings. St Thomas' took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by Viscount Grey de Wilton (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was consecrated in 1864 by the first Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee. Construction of the tower began in 1870 and the building was completed in 1871. The building cost £7,273, (£670 thousand today) and the tower cost £1,800 (£160 thousand today). The first vicar was the Reverend Robert Fletcher. Radcliffe's first public ornament was a drinking fountain located at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road. It was presented to the town by a Mrs Noah Rostron in memory of her husband, and erected in August 1896. The fountain no longer exists at this location. Built in 1911 the town hall was on the junction of Water Street and Spring Lane. For many years after the town lost its urban district status, the building was unoccupied.

Step 2: Provide examples of mockery in literature a) In Jonathan Swift's \\"Gulliver's Travels,\\" the author mocks the political and social systems of his time by describing ridiculous and absurd societies in various fictional lands, such as Lilliput and Brobdingnag. b) In George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm,\\" the author uses satire and irony to mock the events leading up to the Russian Revolution and the early years of the Soviet Union. c) In Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the character of Mr. Bennet frequently uses sarcasm and wit to ridicule the foolish behavior and attitudes of his wife and some of his daughters. 2. What are diction examples in literature? Step 1: Define diction in literature Diction refers to an author's choice of words and the style of expression in a literary work. Step 2: Provide examples of diction in literature a) In William Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet,\\" the formal and poetic diction serves to heighten the sense of tragedy and emotion in the play, as demonstrated in Hamlet's famous soliloquy: \\"To be, or not to be, that is the question.\\" b) In J.D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" the informal, colloquial diction reflects the voice of the teenage protagonist, Holden Caulfield, as he narrates his experiences and thoughts: \\"If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like…\\" c) In Cormac McCarthy's \\"The Road,\\" the simple and minimalist diction reflects the bleak, desolate nature of a post-apocalyptic world: \\"The world shrinking down about a raw core of parsible entities. The names of things slowly following those things into oblivion. Colors. The names of birds.\\" As for determining if these questions are the same: - Question 1 asks for examples of mockery (satire, humor, and ridicule) in literature. - Question 2 asks for examples of diction (choices of words and styles of expression) in literature.

Let's break down the various components of the statement and analyze why the sentiment tilts towards the negative side despite having some positive elements. 1. \\"even if it is generally amusing from time to time\\": This part of the phrase has a positive tone, as it acknowledges that there are moments when the content or scenes in the action comedy titled \\"i spy\\" can be considered amusing. The occurrence of amusement in the movie suggests that it has moments that can be enjoyed by the audience. 2. \\"i spy has all the same problems\\": Here, the sentiment becomes negative, as the phrase points out that the movie shares the same problems as its counterparts in the genre. This observation indicates that the movie might fail to stand out or offer something unique and novel. 3. \\"the majority of action comedies have\\": This part further strengthens the negative sentiment. It emphasizes that the movie does not deviate from the common problems most action comedies face. It implies that \\"i spy\\" does not effectively break free from the usual pitfalls, tropes, and formulaic approaches of the genre. This statement can lead to the perception that \\"i spy\\" is a mediocre or unremarkable movie. In conclusion, the given phrase carries a mixed sentiment, having both positive and negative qualities. However, the negative elements take precedence, as they address the overall experience of watching the movie and how it compares to others in the genre.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Who should have taken charge of making sure segregation didn't happen?\\" is in \\"On August 18, 1970, the NAACP filed suit against Michigan state officials, including Governor William Milliken, charging de facto public school segregation. The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence. In a narrow decision, the Court found that schools were a subject of local control and that suburbs could not be forced to solve problems in the city's school district.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Who should have taken charge of making sure segregation didn't happen?\\" in the context provided can be found within the Milliken v. Bradley case decision and its proceedings. In this case, multiple levels of government were held accountable for segregation in schools. The District Court held all levels of government - local, state, and federal - responsible for the segregation, implying that all these institutions should have taken charge in ensuring that segregation didn't happen in the first place. The Sixth Circuit Court also agreed, to some extent, stating that it was the state's responsibility to integrate schools across the segregated metropolitan area. This decision suggests that the state government should have taken the lead role in addressing and preventing school segregation. Furthermore, the NAACP, which filed the lawsuit, argued that both the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies that maintained racial segregation in public schools. Therefore, it could also be inferred that local governments and policymakers should have taken charge in preventing segregation from happening. In summary, the answer to the question is that multiple levels of government, including local, state, and federal, should have taken charge of making sure segregation didn't happen according to the court rulings and arguments made in the Milliken v. Bradley case."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The average American kid consumes more than 20 teaspoons of sugar per day, and adults eat 50% more sugar today than they did in the 1970s. We all know that too much sugar isn't good for you. But did we know it could be dangerous? A team of researchers at the University of Utah used mice to conduct a study on the negative effects of sugar. They found it could have serious effects on people's health. Sugar is found not only in sweets and candies, but also in many household items like pasta and crackers. During the 58-week-long study, mice were fed a diet containing 25% more sugar. This percentage equals a healthy human diet along with three cans of soda daily. The team found that these mice were twice as likely to die as mice fed a similar diet without the sugar. Though the mice did not show signs of obesity or high blood pressure, male mice were 26% less territorial and produced 25% fewer offspring than the other mice. Scientists often use mice for research because they have a similar genetic structure to humans. \\"Since most substances that are dangerous in mice are also dangerous in people, it's likely that those physical problems that cause those mice to have increased deaths also work in people,\\" says study author James Ruff of the University of Utah. Findings from this study reveal negative effects that are not as noticeable as weight gain or heart problems. Sugar can contribute to long-term changes in the body that can change development and even shorten lives. Cutting sugar out of the American diet altogether may be difficult. But making the effort to control our nation's sugar desire will provide for a truly sweeter future.

The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli.

The presence of these carbonate complexes at alkaline pH also presents challenges in precipitating uranium as phosphate, making it difficult to effectively remove or immobilize uranium in the environment.

To provide more context, John Franklin Enders of Children's Medical Center Boston initially developed the measles vaccine in 1962. Enders, often known as the \\"Father of Modern Vaccines,\\" was an American virologist who specialized in research on polio and measles. His initial research and development of the measles vaccine laid the foundation for further advancements in virology and disease prevention. Maurice Hilleman, a renowned American microbiologist, played a crucial role in refining the measles vaccine and, subsequently, also developed vaccines for Rubella and mumps at Merck. Hilleman's efforts helped save numerous lives by significantly reducing the prevalence of these diseases. Hilleman is often credited with developing more human vaccines than any other scientist, as he created over 40 vaccines throughout his career, many of which are still in use today. To sum up, the sentence in question not only answers the query \\"Who helped refine the measles vaccine?\\" but also provides valuable information on the development timeline of vaccines for measles, Rubella, and mumps. Moreover, it highlights the contributions of influential scientists, such as John Franklin Enders and Maurice Hilleman, who made significant progress in the field of vaccines, ultimately benefiting public health around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Recall for big-selling Honda Jazz The recall affects only Mk1 Jazz models It is contacting all 171,372 UK owners of 2002-2008 Jazz models so that electric window master switches can be checked. According to an official Honda statement, \\"The master window switch in the driver's door can malfunction when exposed to large amounts of liquid ingress, for example if the window is left open frequently or for long periods during heavy rain. \\"Water and other fluids can cause the circuit board of the window switch to malfunction and prevent opening or closing of the window. In rare cases, the circuit board can overheat causing melting, smoke or, potentially, fire.\\" Although there have been no reported fires in the UK, such an incident is alleged to have led to the death of a two-year-old girl in South Africa last year. As a precaution, all cars recalled in the UK will be fitted with a waterproof skirt to prevent further water entry. Worldwide, Honda is recalling almost 650,000 Jazz models. Previously, Toyota had announced a global recall that will cost the company an estimated £1.25bn this financial quarter. It has identified 180,865 UK cars that are potentially affected by a sticking accelerator pedal and is contacting owners through the Driver Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), asking them to book cars in for a 30-minute repair. The problem affects eight UK models – the iQ, Aygo, Yaris, Auris, Corolla, Avensis and Verso – but more than eight million cars could be affected worldwide. Last year five million Toyotas were recalled in America, because unsecured floor mats had caused throttles to jam. It is alleged that the fault caused up to 18 deaths, although the company denies this. The matter came to head earlier this week when US transport secretary Ray LaHood warned Toyota owners not to drive their cars, but he has since withdrawn that statement. Should an accelerator pedal stick, drivers are advised to put their car into neutral and pull off the road as soon as it is safe to do so.

Fast food is also very popular---30% of all adults have a burger every three months, but 46% have fish and chips! Sports British people don't do a lot of sport. Only 17% of people go swimming every week. 9% go cycling and 8% play golf. Only 6% people play football (but 32% go to watch it). Cinema and TV Films are very popular in Britain, and about 60% of people between 15 and 24 go to the cinema every month. At home, men watch TV for about three hours every day--half an hour more than women. Holidays British people love going on holidays.

Answer the following question: Information: - Jean-Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert (16 November 1717 29 October 1783) was a French mathematician, mechanician, physicist, philosopher, and music theorist. Until 1759 he was also co-editor with Denis Diderot of the \\"Encyclopédie\\". D'Alembert's formula for obtaining solutions to the wave equation is named after him. The wave equation is sometimes referred to as d'Alembert's equation. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Jean - Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert ( / dælmbr / ; French : ( batist l dalb ) ; 17 November 1717 -- 29 October 1783 ) was a French mathematician , mechanician , physicist , philosopher , and music theorist . Until 1759 he was also co-editor with Denis Diderot of the Encyclopédie . D'Alembert 's formula for obtaining solutions to the wave equation is named after him . The wave equation is sometimes referred to as d'Alembert 's equation . - Pythagoras of Samos ( or simply ; in Ionian Greek) was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and the putative founder of the movement called Pythagoreanism. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos. - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC). - Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers (\\"Encyclopaedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts\\") was a general encyclopedia published in France between 1751 and 1772, with later supplements, revised editions, and translations. It had many writers, known as the \\"Encyclopédistes\\". It was edited by Denis Diderot and, until 1759, co-edited by Jean le Rond d'Alembert. - Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz). - The Encyclopédistes were members of the Société des gens de lettres, a French writer's society, who contributed to the development of the \\"Encyclopédie\\" from June 1751 to December 1765 under editors Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. The composition of the 17 volumes of text and 11 volumes of plates of the \\"Encyclopédie\\" was the work of over 150 authors belonging, in large part, to the intellectual group known as the philosophes. They promoted the advancement of science and secular thought and supported tolerance, rationality, and open-mindedness of the Enlightenment. - The wave equation is an important second-order linear partial differential equation for the description of wavesas they occur in physicssuch as sound waves, light waves and water waves. It arises in fields like acoustics, electromagnetics, and fluid dynamics. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Denis Diderot (5 October 171331 July 1784) was a French philosopher, art critic, and writer. He was a prominent figure during the Enlightenment and is best known for serving as co-founder, chief editor, and contributor to the \\"Encyclopédie\\" along with Jean le Rond d'Alembert. - In physics, sound is a vibration that propagates as a typically audible mechanical wave of pressure and displacement, through a transmission medium such as air or water. In physiology and psychology, sound is the \\"reception\\" of such waves and their \\"perception\\" by the brain. Humans can hear sound waves with frequencies between about 20 Hz and 20 kHz. Sound above 20 kHz is ultrasound and below 20 Hz is infrasound. Other animals have different hearing ranges. - The 6th century BC started the first day of 600 BC and ended the last day of 501 BC.

In the short movie review provided, the critic uses phrases such as \\"very good viewing alternative,\\" which implies that they believe the movie to be a worthwhile option for viewers to watch. This positive assessment demonstrates that the critic appreciates the film's quality and considers it a strong contender among other viewing choices. Furthermore, the word \\"very\\" in \\"very good\\" serves to intensify the positive sentiment expressed by the critic, as it indicates a high degree of approval. The term \\"alternative\\" might suggest that the movie might not be the viewer's first choice or might belong to a different genre than what they typically watch, yet the critic still affirms that it is worth considering. It is essential to understand the broader context in which this short review is written. Movie critics typically analyze various aspects of a film, including the plot, character development, cinematography, direction, and overall viewing experience. When the critic says the movie is a \\"very good viewing alternative,\\" they may potentially imply that despite a few flaws or limitations, the film is still a successful and valuable contribution to the movie industry. Positive reviews are crucial for a movie's success, as they can help build interest and excitement among potential viewers. By expressing their positive assessment, the critic is effectively encouraging others to give the movie a chance and form their own opinions.

Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater.

First, let's look at the problem: 14046 * w - 5124 = 13802 * w. 2. Now, we want to find what \\"w\\" is. To do that, let's move all the terms with \\"w\\" to one side of the equation. 3.

It is not obvious from viewing this film (so I recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it) but this presentation on the realities of Islam, and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non-Muslims is lacking objectiveness, and also completely fails to factor in the human condition. It is one thing to document that the Koran says many things about how a devout Muslim is required to interact with non-Muslims, but any realist is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of Islam, will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system. There is reason to call much about the presenters into question, such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism; don't swallow it all, hook, line, and sinker, without some thinking of your own. One specific, for instance, is researching the person Walid Shoebat; who claims to be a former Muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in Bethlehem. There are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these assertions. I am not nor have I ever been a Muslim. I have never read the Koran.

Question: Article: \\"Congratulations, Mr. Jones, it's a girl.\\" Fatherhood is going to have a different meaning and bring forth a different answer from every man who hears these words. Some feel proud when they receive the news, while others worry, wondering whether they will be good fathers. Although there are some men who like children and may have had considerable experience with them, others do not particularly care for children and spend little time with them. Many fathers and mothers have been planning and looking forward to children for some time. For other couples, pregnancy was an accident that both husband and wife have accepted willingly or unwillingly. Whatever the reaction to the birth of a child, it is obvious that the change from the role of husband to that of father is a difficult task. Yet, unfortunately, few attempts have been made to educate fathers in this re-socialization process. Although many good books have been written about American mothers, only recently have some books discussed the role of a father. It is argued by some writers that the transition to the father's role, although difficult, is not nearly as great as the transition the wife must make to the mother's role. The mother's role seems to require a complete transformation of daily routine and adaptation to a new life, on the other hand, the father's role is less demanding and immediate. However, even though we have mentioned the fact that growing numbers of women are working outside the home, the father is still thought by many as the breadwinner in the household. Question: Some writers argue that with respect to the change of roles, fathers, compared with mothers, _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"have an easier job to do\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"have an easier job to do\\". The article provides the viewpoint of some writers who argue that the transition to the role of a father, compared to the role of a mother, is not as demanding or transformative. Immediately after childbirth, mothers are typically assumed to have a complete life adjustment that involves a transformative change in daily routine, adapting to a new life with their babies which involves feeding, changing, tending to needs round the clock, and many more day-to-day responsibilities. On the other hand, the father's role may be perceived as less demanding and immediate, as the responsibility of the father traditionally implies providing for the family, which is not necessarily a drastic change from their pre-fatherhood routine. This doesn't necessarily mean that the role of a father is easy or simple; it has its own challenges and difficulties. Fathers also have to adjust to new responsibilities and psychological changes with the arrival of the new family member, contribute to the active parenting needs, and provide emotional support to the mother who has undergone a significant physical and emotional event. It is important to note that these are stereotypical roles and modern societies increasingly recognize and encourage equal parenting. However, taking the argument presented by the writers in context, it can be said that from a traditional standpoint and in terms of immediate change to day-to-day routine, the fathers, as compared to mothers, might \\"have an easier job to do\\". It's also important to note that this viewpoint might not hold true for every individual father or couple, as experiences and feelings towards parenthood can vary significantly on a case-by-case basis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Mark has just graduated high school and is going to visit his grandpa, Tom, over the summer for a couple days. Since Tom is retired, he often has plenty of time to go fishing, and he even has a small cabin by the lake. The two men are planning to spend several days at the cabin cooking, fishing, chopping firewood to make fires and just general outdoor activities. Is Tom's chance of getting sick while at the cabin higher or lower than Mark's? Hint: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. A:","completion":"Based on the hint provided, the question must be analyzed by taking into consideration various factors such as age, immune system efficiency, and general health condition of both Mark and Tom. Tom, being a retiree, is likely to be in his late 60s or beyond, and as mentioned, the old age typically begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. During this stage, a person's stamina, strength, reflex time, senses, and the number of brain cells generally decrease. Moreover, the immune system, which plays a crucial role in protecting the body against illnesses and infections, becomes less efficient in older individuals. This reduced effectiveness of the immune system increases the risk of serious diseases such as cancer, pneumonia, and other age-related illnesses, like Alzheimer's. On the other hand, Mark has just graduated high school, which means he is most likely around the age of 18, placing him within the category of young adults. At this age, the immune system is generally more efficient compared to an older individual. Also, young adults usually possess better strength, stamina, and reflexes. Additionally, young people generally have fewer chronic illnesses and health complications compared to the elderly. Given the information, it is important to note that the risk of getting sick can be influenced by several factors other than age, including lifestyle habits, fitness level, or an individual's health condition. However, considering the general decline in immune system efficiency and the age-related factors that affect Tom, the likelihood of him getting sick while at the cabin is higher compared to Mark. In conclusion, based on the factors discussed, Tom's chance of getting sick while at the cabin is likely to be higher than Mark's due to the age-related impacts on the immune system and the overall decline of physical and physiological functions in old age. However, this evaluation does not take into account their individual health conditions, habits, or fitness levels, which could also play a role in their susceptibility to illness. It is essential to consider these personalized factors when assessing the health risks of individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Also, brushing in a downward motion at the end helps to smooth out facial hairs, ensuring that the make-up sits evenly on the skin's surface.

Expanding the translation, here is a more detailed answer: Tästä huolimatta, tuohon perustuen, minulla ei ole mitään hyvää syytä boikotoida avajaisseremoniaa tai itse olympialaisia. On tärkeää ottaa huomioon, että olympialaiset ovat kansainvälinen tapahtuma, joka edistää urheilijoiden ja valtioiden välistä kumppanuutta, yhteistyötä ja kilpailua. Tämä tapahtuma tarjoaa mahdollisuuden urheilijoille eri puolilta maailmaa kisata toisiaan vastaan ja edustaa samalla omia maitaan. Olympialaisten tarkoituksena on edistää rauhaa, ystävyyttä ja urheilun kautta saatavaa ymmärrystä eri kulttuurien välillä. Tällaisen boikotin toteuttaminen voisi johtaa vain kielteisiin seurauksiin ja vähentää urheilun positiivisia vaikutuksia kansainvälisessä yhteisössä. Sen sijaan, että boikotoisimme kisoja, meidän tulisi keskittyä kannustamaan urheilijoita ja maiden välistä yhteistyötä erilaisten kulttuurien välisen ymmärryksen edistämiseksi. Vaikka on totta, että jotkut saattavat olla eri mieltä isäntämaan politiikasta tai järjestelyistä, olympialaiset tarjoavat ainutlaatuisen tilaisuuden tuoda ihmiset yhteen ja ylittää poliittiset ja kulttuuriset erot. Tämän vuoksi meidän ei pidä keskittyä vain negatiivisiin näkökohtiin, vaan myös mahdollisuuteen, jonka nämä kisat tarjoavat yhdessä urheilemiseen ja maailmanlaajuisen yhteisön ymmärryksen lisäämiseen. Niin ikään on tärkeää muistaa, että urheilijat ovat valmistautuneet vuosikausia tähän hetkeen, ja heille tämä on elämänsä tilaisuus menestyä ja edustaa maataan. Heidän saavutuksiaan ja ponnistelujaan tulee arvostaa ja tukea, eikä heidän tilaisuuttaan menestyä tai kilpailla muiden urheilijoiden kanssa pidä riistää heiltä poliittisten erimielisyyksien tai muiden syiden vuoksi. Lopuksi totean vielä, että vaikka tietyt kysymykset saattavat aiheuttaa huolta ja epäilyksiä, meidän ei tulisi tarkastella seremonioiden tai olympialaisten boikotoimista ainoastaan ratkaisuna ongelmiin. Sen sijaan meidän tulisi pyrkiä avoimeen vuoropuheluun ja kansainvälisen yhteistyön lisäämiseen, jotta voimme yhdessä edetä parempaan ymmärrykseen ja kunnioitukseen eri maiden välillä."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"Depression affecting intelligence: Depression can have a significant impact on cognitive functioning, which may manifest as a perceived reduction in intelligence. While depression does not directly alter one's raw intellectual capacity, it can lead to cognitive impairments that make it difficult to think clearly, remember information, concentrate, and solve problems. This is known as 'cognitive fog,' which is a common experience for people suffering from depression. Several factors may contribute to this relationship between depression and cognitive functioning. These include biochemical changes in the brain, chronic stress, and sleep disturbances that are often associated with depression. Neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine play a significant role in both mood regulation and cognitive functioning, and imbalances in these chemicals may lead to the symptoms of depression as well as cognitive impairments. Depression can also indirectly impact intelligence by affecting one's motivation, energy levels, and the ability to engage in mentally demanding tasks. People with depression may find it more challenging to apply themselves to projects and tasks that require high levels of cognitive functioning. As a result, their performance may suffer, which could lead to a perceived decrease in intelligence. Moreover, studies have shown a bidirectional relationship between depression and cognitive decline, meaning that not only can depression contribute to cognitive impairments, but also cognitive decline may increase the risk of developing depression. Opium and the Emperor during the Qing Dynasty: During the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), opium was viewed as a severe social and political issue. The emperor and the imperial government were quite aware of the dangers that opium posed to society, and various measures were taken to curb the trafficking and consumption of this drug. At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, opium was primarily used for medicinal purposes. It was not until the 18th and 19th centuries that the consumption of opium for recreational purposes became more widespread in China. The British East India Company played a significant role in the rise of opium consumption, as it sought to sell opium grown in British-controlled India to China to balance the trade between the two countries. Recognizing the detrimental effects of opium on the Chinese population, the emperor and the Qing government implemented several policies to ban and suppress its use. In 1729, Emperor Yongzheng officially banned the sale and smoking of opium for recreational purposes. However, the opium trade continued to thrive due to weak enforcement and increasing demand. In the 19th century, during the reign of Emperor Daoguang, efforts to counteract opium trade culminated in a series of events known as the First Opium War (1839-1842) and the Second Opium War (1856-1860). These conflicts resulted from China's attempts to ban the importation of opium, leading to military confrontations with foreign powers, mainly Britain. Despite the Qing Dynasty's efforts to eradicate the opium trade, these wars ultimately forced China to accept the legal importation of opium and led to a series of humiliating treaties that undermined China's sovereignty. Similarity between the two questions: The two questions address completely different topics and are not the same. The first question pertains to the relationship between depression and intelligence, focusing on psychological and neurobiological factors. The second question discusses the emperor's stance on opium during the Qing Dynasty, delving into historical accounts and the impacts of opium on society and politics. These two questions explore different dimensions and areas of knowledge, demonstrating no direct similarity between them."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert. Natural Levees A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks. A levee is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the waters edge. What question would one ask from this paragraph?","completion":"One potential question to ask from this paragraph could be: \\"How do natural levees form along the banks of a river during a flood, and how do they contribute to the development of floodplains with rich soils?\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The metallic bonding model explains the physical properties of metals. Metals conduct electricity and heat very well because of their free-flowing electrons. As electrons enter one end of a piece of metal, an equal number of electrons flow outward from the other end. When light is shone on to the surface of a metal, its electrons absorb small amounts of energy and become excited into one of its many empty orbitals. The electrons immediately fall back down to lower energy levels and emit light. This process is responsible for the high luster of metals. Q: Why does metal conduct heat and electricity so well? A: Answer:","completion":"Metal conducts heat and electricity so well due to the presence of free-flowing electrons in its metallic bonding structure. These electrons, also known as conduction electrons, move freely throughout the metal lattice, allowing for easy transfer of energy in the form of heat or electric current. As electrons enter one end of a piece of metal, an equal number of electrons flow outward from the other end, ensuring efficient transfer of energy across the material. This free movement of electrons plays a crucial role in the high conductivity of metals for both heat and electricity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: On a street in Paris, during the Middle Ages, a Gypsy named Clopin performs puppet shows for children. Before starting his next show, he draws attention to the bells ringing in the nearby Cathedral of Notre Dame. He offers to tell the tale of the mysterious bell-ringer--who he is, and how he came to the cathedral:Twenty years ago, on a cold winter night, four Gypsies sneaked into Paris on a hired riverboat; the Gypsies were persecuted in Paris (and possibly all over France), so the only way to enter the city without being arrested was to sneak in. These particular Gypsies consisted of two men, one woman, and her child (it is implied that one of the men was the husband and father to the last two mentioned). Upon landing, however, the group was ambushed and arrested.The man leading the arrest was Judge Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice. He is the primary instigator of the persecution and oppression against the Gypsies in Paris, claiming that their ways will corrupt the other citizens. He arrested the men, but when he ordered his troops to take the bundle in the woman's arms (mistakenly assuming them to be stolen goods), she ran. Though he was on horseback, she outmaneuvered him by using shortcuts too small for his horse. She made it to the doors of the Cathedral of Notre Dame to claim sanctuary, but because it was nighttime the doors were locked. Before they could be opened, Frollo caught up with her. He wrested the bundle from her grasp, kicking her while doing so; she fell back and hit her head on the stone steps, which killed her.The baby started to cry. When Frollo pulled back the cloth surrounding him, he gasped in horror, proclaiming the baby to be a monster (the baby is never shown). He nearly dropped the infant down a well, but he was stopped by the Archdeacon of the cathedral, who condemned his killing of the woman and his attempt to kill the baby.

Punjab is situated in the northern part of India and shares its borders with Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Rajasthan, as well as the Pakistani province of Punjab. The state has a rich cultural, historical, and agricultural significance in India. Punjab is known as the \\"land of five rivers\\" as it is irrigated by five major rivers: the Beas, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Jhelum. With a total area of 50,362 square kilometers, it is the 20th largest Indian state by area and has an estimated population of around 30 million people. The Malwa region occupies the central and southern parts of the state and is the largest region among the three areas. Malwa is known for its fertile soil and abundant agricultural production. The region is home to cities such as Ludhiana, Bathinda, Patiala, and Sangrur. Ludhiana is one of the industrial hubs of Punjab and famous for its hosiery and textile industries. Patiala is well-known for its rich Punjabi culture and tradition, including the Patiala Salwar and Patiala Peg. The Majha region is located in the central part of Punjab, between the rivers Beas and Ravi. This region has significant historical importance due to its proximity to the Harappa and Mohenjo-daro civilizations. The region includes cities like Amritsar, Gurdaspur, and Tarn Taran. Amritsar is home to the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine for Sikhs, and Jallianwala Bagh, a historic site commemorating the massacre of peaceful protesters by British forces in 1919. The Doaba region lies between the rivers Beas and Sutlej, and derives its name from the Punjabi words \\"Do,\\" meaning two, and \\"Ab,\\" meaning water or river, referring to the region between these two rivers. This region is well-known for its NRI (Non-Resident Indian) population, and for its major contributions to the Green Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s. Important cities in the Doaba region include Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala, and Nawanshahr. Each of these three regions has distinct dialects, customs, traditions, and cuisine.

They have known for a long time that the color of a room or the color of the light in it can affect our feelings and emotions. Many prisons and hospitals have at least one room that is painted pink. Officials have found that light and color can produce physical changes in our bodies. Professor Falfan worked with a group of 9 disabled children at school in Albert. Two of the children were blind. The other seven had normal sight. The scientists changed the color of the school room, then looked for changes in blood pressure, heart beat and breathing rate. The effects of color changes were the same for the blind children as for those with normal sight. Their blood pressure dropped from about 120 to 100. Similar changes were reported in heart-beat and the breathing. The children also were calmer and less excited. Then the colors of the room were returned to orange and white. Blood pressure, heart-beat and breathing rate went up and the children became excited again. Professor Falfan said different colors produce different levels of light energy. He said the differences seem to affect chemicals in the brain that carry messages from nerve to nerve and from nerve to muscle. After reading the passage we can conclude that _ .

Answer a question about this article: France: The torch relay leg in Paris, held on April 7, began on the first level of the Eiffel Tower and finished at the Stade Charléty. The relay was initially supposed to cover 28 km, but it was shortened at the demand of Chinese officials following widespread protests by pro-Tibet and human rights activists, who repeatedly attempted to disrupt, hinder or halt the procession. A scheduled ceremony at the town hall was cancelled at the request of the Chinese authorities, and, also at the request of Chinese authorities, the torch finished the relay by bus instead of being carried by athletes. Paris City officials had announced plans to greet the Olympic flame with peaceful protest when the torch was to reach the French capital. The city government attached a banner reading \\"Paris defends human rights throughout the world\\" to the City Hall, in an attempt to promote values \\"of all humanity and of human rights.\\" Members from Reporters Without Borders turned out in large numbers to protest. An estimated 3,000 French police protected the Olympic torch relay as it departed from the Eiffel Tower and criss-crossed Paris amid threat of protests. Widespread pro-Tibet protests, including an attempt by more than one demonstrator to extinguish the flame with water or fire extinguishers, prompted relay authorities to put out the flame five times (according to the police authorities in Paris) and load the torch onto a bus, at the demand of Chinese officials. This was later denied by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, despite video footage broadcast by French television network France 2 which showed Chinese flame attendants extinguishing the torch. Backup flames are with the relay at all times to relight the torch. French judoka and torchbearer David Douillet expressed his annoyance at the Chinese flame attendants who extinguished the torch which he was about to hand over to Teddy Riner: \\"I understand they're afraid of everything, but this is just annoying.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I was lucky enough to get three acne skincare packs from Aphelia Cosmetology for guest reviewers with acne to trial for me. I think that this is important because the treatment of acne is such a personalised journey that it is good to hear about the results of the skincare from a variety of people. In the third review of this series, Nalini from The Made Up Maiden has reviewed this acne set for me. Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck. Here is Nalini's review: I've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless. In my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit. As a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin. I would classify my skin as combination, the t-zone gets a little oily towards midday, while the rest of my skin is pretty much classified as 'normal'. I received the following items. Question: Why did Nalini think that her acne would fade once she left her teens? Answer:","completion":"Nalini thought that her acne would fade once she left her teens because it is a common belief that acne is predominantly a teenage issue, often linked to hormonal changes during adolescence.

Choose your answer from: - Use clothespins or paperclips - Use a needle and thread.","completion":"To accomplish the goal of keeping a bag of chips closed without bag clips, let's compare the two options step-by-step and justify each step: Option 1 - Use clothespins or paperclips: 1. Availability: Clothespins and paperclips are more commonly found in households and offices than needle and thread, making them more accessible. 2. Ease of use: Clothespins and paperclips can be easily clipped onto the folded or rolled edge of the chip bag, effectively sealing it. 3. Reusability: Both clothespins and paperclips can be reused multiple times on different bags or for other purposes. 4. Time and effort: Using clothespins or paperclips is a quick and easy process that requires minimal time and effort. Option 2 - Use a needle and thread: 1. Availability: Needle and thread may not be readily available in all households, and using it for closing a chip bag can be seen as a less practical option. 2. Ease of use: Using a needle and thread involves threading the needle, puncturing the bag, and sewing it closed. This may leave tiny holes in the bag and has a higher chance of spilling the chips. 3. Reusability: While needle and thread can be reused, the process of opening and closing the bag each time can be tedious. 4. Time and effort: Using a needle and thread requires more time and effort than simply clipping something onto the bag. Based on this comparison, it makes more sense to accomplish the goal of keeping a bag of chips closed without bag clips by using clothespins or paperclips. They are more accessible, easier to use, reusable, and require less time and effort than using a needle and thread."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Who attacks a classmate with a wrench? Answer the above question based on the context below: On August 22, 2010 in rural Ohio, serial killer Edward Scarka is shot to death during a police raid of his farmhouse. At the time of Edward's death, married couple Sarah and John give birth to their son, Miles, in Pennsylvania. Miles shows extreme wisdom and intelligence from quite a young age, and begins speaking fluently before he is even a toddler. When Miles turns eight in 2018, Sarah and John begin noticing behavioral changes in him. One night he plays a prank on his babysitter Zoe, seriously injuring her, but claims no memory of the incident. Days later at school, he attacks a classmate with a wrench he obtains from the janitor's closet. Sarah brings Miles to psychologist Elaine Strasser, and also turns over a tape recording of Miles talking apparent gibberish in his sleep. Elaine gives the tape to a colleague, Arthur Jacobson, an expert on rebirth and reincarnation. Arthur reveals that the gibberish Miles spoke on the tape is in fact Hungarian, and that the words translate to \\"I'll cut your eyes out and watch you die, whore.\\" Unwilling to believe Arthur's assertion that an unsettled spirit is vying for control of Miles's body, Sarah dismisses him. Later at home, the family's dog goes missing, and John becomes infuriated when he finds that Miles has been recording the couple's bedroom with a baby monitor. John leaves to stay with his brother, leaving Sarah alone with Miles in the house. Miles awakens her in the middle of the night, and she finds a swarm of flies in the house. In the basement, Sarah discovers the family's dismembered dog. Miles apologizes, and explains that someone is invading his dreams every night, and that he has to \\"make room.\\" A:","completion":"Miles, the son of Sarah and John, is the one who attacks a classmate with a wrench in the given context.

How would you accomplish this goal? Pick your answer from: [+] Spread orange peels on top of soil.. [+] Spread orange peels inside soil..","completion":"The correct approach would be to spread orange peels on top of the soil. Here are the steps and justifications for them: Step 1: Collect orange peels You need to have enough orange peels to be efficient. The reason why we use orange peels is that snails don't like citrus fruits that much. Also, orange peel contains a substance named Limonene which repels insects and snails. This is why it's a good natural repellent. Step 2: Spread orange peels on top of the soil You spread them on top of the soil rather than incorporate them into the soil for multiple reasons. First, it's much easier to spread them on top. Also, it ensures that the peels and their scent act as a barrier, deterring the snails from coming to the plants. If the peels were inside the soil, their repellent effect wouldn't be as effective since snails crawl on top of the soil. By following these steps, you create a situation where snails are less likely to invade and damage your garden, and it's a safe and environment-friendly way to protect your plants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Select from the following. a). be on time to work b). miss her shift at work c). still have a broken bike Casey thought she would be late to work when her chain broke but Kendall got Casey's bike fixed. Given the context: What will happen to Casey? Answer:","completion":"In this situation, Casey initially faced the possibility of being late to work due to a broken chain on her bike. This could have led to various consequences, such as a reprimand from her manager, a potential warning, or even a negative impact on her performance evaluation, depending on the severity of her tardiness and her company's policies. However, due to Kendall's timely intervention and assistance in fixing Casey's bike, Casey now has a reliable mode of transportation to get to work. This means that Casey's likelihood of being late to work has significantly decreased, which helps her avoid the potential negative outcomes mentioned earlier. Given the current context, what will happen to Casey is that she will most likely be able to reach her workplace on time. This is because Kendall's help in fixing her bike has eliminated the obstacle that could have made her late. Being on time to work (Option A) will have several advantages for Casey. Firstly, it will demonstrate her commitment, punctuality, and discipline, which are essential qualities in the workplace. These traits contribute to a positive work environment and promote productivity and efficiency. Moreover, being punctual can enhance her professional image and reputation, which could lead to career growth opportunities. Additionally, by being on time, Casey can maintain a healthy work-life balance. This is because punctuality allows her to complete her tasks within the designated timeframe, thus preventing work from spilling over into her personal life. As a result, Casey will have more time to pursue her personal interests and maintain a healthy social life, which is crucial for her overall well-being. In summary, with the help of Kendall in fixing her bike, Casey will likely be able to be on time for work, thus maintaining a positive work ethic and opening up opportunities for her professional growth.

Questions: What could be used to write with a steel pen? Options: - warehouse - arm - hand - desk drawer - veterinary office A:","completion":"The most suitable option in line with common sense for writing with a steel pen would be the \\"hand.\\" The hand is the part of the human body primarily responsible for holding and manipulating objects such as writing instruments, including a steel pen. By gripping the pen with their fingers, a person can effectively engage in the act of writing on paper or other suitable surfaces. The fine motor skills and coordinated movements of the hand enable an individual to create precise strokes with the pen, resulting in well-formed letters, numbers, and other characters. In contrast, the other given options do not relate to writing with a steel pen in a practical or common-sense manner: - Warehouse: A warehouse is a large storage facility, typically for goods and merchandise. It is not directly related to writing with a steel pen and, thus, is not an appropriate choice. - Arm: Although the arm is involved in the physical act of writing, it alone is not sufficient for holding and manipulating a steel pen effectively. The hand, as mentioned above, is the body part designed for grasping and controlling writing utensils. - Desk drawer: A desk drawer is a storage compartment in a desk or similar furniture. While it might store writing instruments like a steel pen, it does not have the capability to grip or use the pen for writing. - Veterinary office: A veterinary office is a place where professional veterinarians provide medical care to animals. While people working in a veterinary office might use a steel pen to write prescriptions, records, or other documents, the location itself does not represent the act of writing with a steel pen and is irrelevant to the provided question. In summary, out of all the options provided, using a \\"hand\\" to write with a steel pen is by far the most logical and common-sense choice. It encompasses the human body's primary function for holding and operating writing tools, such as a steel pen, and allows for the creation of written content in a precise and controlled manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode. Question: suppose there is a great deal of underground activity happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: Less A significant amount of underground activity can influence the frequency and size of volcanic eruptions, particularly smaller eruptions. To better understand this relationship, we must examine the processes and factors involved in volcanic eruptions and how underground activity could affect them. Volcanic eruptions occur due to the movement of molten rock, known as magma, beneath the Earth's surface. Magma forms when high temperatures and pressure cause the melting of rocks in the deep Earth. As magma rises towards the Earth's surface, the pressure within the magma decreases, allowing dissolved gases to expand and generate pressure. When this pressure becomes too much for the Earth's surface to handle, it can cause a volcanic eruption. Now, when there is an increase in underground activity, such as tectonic plate movements or fluctuations in the magma chamber, it can impact the frequency and size of eruptions. This is partly because the underground activity could cause changes in the pressure and available pathways for magma to rise to the surface. Here's how increased underground activity can lead to fewer or smaller eruptions: 1. Redistribution of magma: The increased underground activity may cause the magma to redistribute within the magma chamber or even between multiple chambers beneath the Earth's surface. This can lower the pressure at any single point, leading to fewer or smaller eruptions. 2. Release of pressure: The increased underground activity can create pathways for gases or magma to escape, which reduces the pressure beneath the Earth's surface. This can lead to smaller eruptions or even prevent eruptions from occurring entirely, as the decrease in pressure reduces the likelihood of an explosive event. 3. Changes in the composition of magma: Increased underground activity can lead to changes in the composition of the magma, which affects its viscosity and the ease with which it can rise to the surface. If the resulting magma becomes more viscous, it might have a more difficult time reaching the surface, leading to smaller eruptions or even no eruption. 4. Seismic activity: An increase in underground activity, such as earthquakes or shifting tectonic plates, could temporarily seal off pathways through which magma rises to the surface. This may delay eruptions and reduce their intensity or prevent them altogether. In summary, an increase in underground activity can lead to less or smaller volcanic eruptions due to changes in the pressure, pathways, and composition of the magma, as well as the seismic activity that could affect the Earth's crust. It's essential to note that the exact relationship between underground activity and volcanic eruptions is complex, and the outcomes can vary depending on numerous factors, such as the type of volcano, the duration and intensity of underground activity, and the geological history of the area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on my knowledge of historical figures and their discoveries, Archimedes is the Greek genius who is known to have shouted \\"Eureka\\" in the bathtub. He made this exclamation upon discovering the principle of buoyancy, also known as the Archimedes' Principle, which states that an object submerged in a fluid experiences an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.

Write the answer: What is one of the fictional languages spoken by the Elves in the fantasy works of J R R Tolkien?","completion":"One of the fictional languages spoken by the Elves in the fantasy works of J. R. R. Tolkien is Sindarin. Sindarin is a complex and beautiful elvish language that Tolkien created as part of his legendarium, the fictional universe that encompasses the literary works of \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" and \\"The Silmarillion.\\" As an accomplished philologist, J. R. R. Tolkien had a deep love for languages and their creation, and Sindarin is widely considered one of his most artistically constructed languages. Sindarin is a member of the Elvish language family, which includes several other fictional languages like Quenya, Telerin, and Nandorin. Sindarin is primarily spoken by the Grey Elves (or Sindar) who remained in the western lands of Middle-earth rather than traveling across the sea to the Undying Lands. The language itself is inspired by Welsh, a Celtic language, and shares similar phonological and grammatical features. Phonologically, Sindarin is characterized by its unique consonant mutations, which are similar to those found in the Celtic languages. Consonant mutation involves the alteration of a consonant at the beginning of a word depending on the grammatical context. There are three primary types of mutations in Sindarin: soft mutation, nasal mutation, and stop mutation. Vowels in Sindarin are also influenced by a system called vowel affection, which can cause a change in the quality or length of a vowel, often based on historical sound changes. Sindarin grammar is quite complex, featuring a rich system of noun declensions and verb conjugations. Nouns in Sindarin have ten distinct cases: nominative, genitive, possessive, dative, locative, instrumental, allative, ablative, respectant, and a special vocative case, which is used when addressing someone directly. There are also four numbers (singular, plural, dual, and partitive plural) and three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). Verbs in Sindarin are organized into five main classes, each with its own set of conjugations. The five classes are basic verbs (A-stem), derived verbs (I-stem), N-stem or nasal infix verbs, causative verbs, and verbs with a final -ya (called Ya-stem verbs). Sindarin verbs also express tense and aspect, using prefixes, infixes, and suffixes to indicate the past, future, perfect, and progressive forms. The vocabulary of Sindarin is vast, with many compound words and derivations created using an intricate system of roots, prefixes, and suffixes. This allows for the construction of meaningful and poetic expressions that fit well within the context of Tolkien's literary works. For example, the Sindarin word for \\"elf\\" is \\"edhel,\\" which is derived from the primitive root \\"ȝED,\\" meaning \\"first.\\" Similarly, the word for \\"star\\" is \\"elen,\\" which comes from the root \\"EL\\" meaning \\"lofty\\" or \\"noble.\\" Overall, Sindarin is a rich and fascinating language that showcases J. R. R. Tolkien's extraordinary skill as a linguist and world-builder. While Sindarin may be a fictional language, it has been admired by fans of Tolkien's work and students of linguistics alike, resulting in numerous language courses, resources, and even translations. The development of Sindarin and other elvish languages is a testament to the depth and intricacy of the world Tolkien created, adding a sense of realism and immersive quality to his timeless fantasy works."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Title: Unwatchable Review: I'm sorry. I've walked out of two movies my whole life, this being the second. (I don't remember what the first one was, it was that forgetable). Ignore all you've heard about this movie being emotional and stylish. It was neither. There was absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters, and Julianne Moore, whom I normally like, just 'acted' her way through the part. It had no sense of reality within the time period, and I found it unwatchable. I gave it more than an hour to improve, but in the end, had to leave.

Estonian public universities have significantly more autonomy than applied higher education institutions.

This European place applies even if the team is relegated or is not in the English top flight. In the past, if the FA Cup winning team also qualified for the following season's Champions League or Europa League through their league position, then the losing FA Cup finalist was given the Europa League place instead. FA Cup winners enter the Europa League at the group stage. Losing finalists, if they entered the Europa League, began earlier, at the play-off or third qualifying round stage. From the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League season, however, UEFA will not allow the runners-up to qualify for the Europa League through the competition. Now answer this question: what about the FA Cup winner?","completion":"The FA Cup winner qualifies directly for the following season's UEFA Europa League, a premier European football competition. The UEFA Europa League was formerly known as the UEFA Cup; up until 1998, the winning team entered the Cup Winners' Cup instead. Interestingly, the English team that wins the FA Cup is awarded a place in the Europa League regardless of their league standing or even if they are relegated from the English top flight. Historically, if the team who won the FA Cup had already qualified for the Champions League or the Europa League via their league position in the same season, the opportunity to participate in the Europa League was bequeathed to the losing team in the FA Cup final. This allowed the losing finalist a chance at European competition. Moreover, the FA Cup winners don't just get a position in the Europa League, they are parachuted directly into the group stages of the tournament. Losing finalists, if they were given the opportunity to participate in the Europa League, would typically start their campaign slightly earlier at the play-off or third qualifying round stage. However, it's important to note that this practice changed from the 2015–2016 UEFA Europa League season. The governing body, UEFA, made a decision that the runners-up would no longer qualify for the Europa League through the competition. This practice aimed to ensure that the place in the Europa League is primarily reserved for the FA Cup champions, emphasizing the significance and prestige of winning England's oldest and most famous cup competition. Consequently, the reward of European participation underlines the importance of the FA Cup in the football calendar and provides an additional incentive for teams competing in the tournament."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

That seems to be Gammera in a nutshell, a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon. I'm not a fan of Japanese monster films, but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film DVD sci-fi collection put out by Mill Creek/Treeline Films. It's a great value at about twenty five bucks, so at fifty cents per movie, it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offerings. Gammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast, and he's not happy. Like Godzilla, he takes it out on Tokyo, setting the United Nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet. They arrive at 'Plan Z', the hope of the world, and wouldn't you know it, there's a scene where a huge shed is shown that's called the 'Z Plan' building; that was a nice touch. By the mid 1960's, this country still wasn't quite politically correct. One of the American military scenes at the Alaskan Air Defense Sector has General Arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee. I guess there weren't any privates around. Good old Gammera was quite the sight though, walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged. That's why it surprised me how Plan Z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship, whisking him off to Mars to save the world. High fives all around for the American and Russian team that made the save, now let's get back to the Cold War. Like Godzilla, Gammera spawned at least a good dozen films, but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying, flaming turtles. Especially since that DVD pack I mentioned earlier has \\"Attack of the Monsters\\" with a featured guest appearance by the Big G.

Background: Oleg Aleksandrovich Prudius (Russian: Oleg Aleksandrovich Prudius; Ukrainian: Oleg Oleksandrovich Prudius, Oleh Oleksandrovych Prudius; born April 27, 1979) better known by his ring name Vladimir Kozlov, is a Ukrainian-American producer and retired professional wrestler. He is best known for his time in WWE, where he won the WWE Tag Team Championship once with Santino Marella. He is trained in freestyle wrestling, rugby, football, sambo, kickboxing, judo, jujutsu, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts. Prudius has also worked as a stage and screen actor, notably having a small role in Spike Lee's 25th Hour., and a walk-on role in the second season of the HBO series The Wire. Context: On April 13, 2009, Kozlov was drafted to the ECW brand as part of the 2009 WWE draft, as ECW's only pick of the night. Shortly after the draft, his character was tweaked to further highlight the training he received within the Russian military. He won his first match on the brand when he easily defeated a local competitor. On the June 30 episode of ECW on Syfy, he teamed with William Regal to defeat Christian and Tommy Dreamer. His first defeat in singles competition on ECW came on the July 9 episode of ECW, where he lost a #1 contenders match to Christian for Tommy Dreamer's ECW Championship at Night of Champions. On July 21, Kozlov began an angle with Ezekiel Jackson in which, week after week, after one of them had easily defeated a local competitor, the other would come out and execute their finishing move on the fallen opponent in a game of one-upmanship. On the August 18 episode of ECW, Jackson was set to team with ECW Champion Christian against the team of Kozlov and number-one contender William Regal. Jackson turned on Christian, forming an alliance with Regal and Kozlov. Kozlov and Jackson aided Regal in his feud with Christian over the ECW Championship, but Regal was unable to capture the title. On the December 15 episode of ECW, Kozlov came out with Regal to face Jackson in an ECW Homecoming battle royal qualifying match. During the match, Regal turned on Kozlov by pulling his feet while at ringside, which ultimately cost him the match. After the match, Kozlov attempted to attack Regal, but Jackson jumped him from behind and both proceeded to attack Kozlov. This split Kozlov from the Ruthless Roundtable, making him a face character. Question: Did he have any other winning matches? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Vladimir Kozlov had other winning matches throughout his career. As a professional wrestler, Kozlov competed in numerous matches and achieved victories both in singles and tag team competition. Although specific matches and results are not mentioned in the provided context, it is evident from his career history and the fact that he won the WWE Tag Team Championship with Santino Marella, that Kozlov had multiple winning matches."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Intense fighting between the military and Islamist militants in northern Nigeria is reported to have killed at least 185 people, however the army has disputed this figure.","completion":"Title: Intense Clashes in Northern Nigeria Raise Concerns: Disputed Death Toll Surpasses 185 Lives Introduction Intense fighting between the military and Islamist militants in northern Nigeria has led to the tragic loss of at least 185 people, marking one of the most violent incidents in the region in recent memory. Though the Nigerian army disputes this death toll, the scale of the devastation is alarming and warrants further investigation. In this article, we delve into the events that led to the conflict and explore the region's history with respect to insurgency and the military's response, touching upon the possible implications for national security and stability. Background: Northern Nigeria and the Struggle with Insurgency Northern Nigeria has long been plagued by instability and violence, with various militant groups finding steady recruitment grounds among the region's disenfranchised population. Indeed, poverty levels and unemployment rates are significantly higher in the region compared to the rest of Nigeria. Consequently, religious extremist groups such as Boko Haram and the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) have been able to gain a stronghold in the area, stoking conflict in the push for an Islamic state. Nigeria's military has been fighting a long, difficult battle against these insurgents, with numerous reports of casualties on both sides. Despite ongoing efforts from the army and international aid, the situation has persisted and, in some cases, intensified. Recent Intense Fighting: Encounter with Islamist Militants The recent bout of intense fighting between the military and Islamist militants in northern Nigeria has left a disputed number of casualties in its wake. Although official reports from the Nigerian army are yet to be confirmed, local sources and security experts estimate that at least 185 people have been killed. The conflict, which erupted over a series of days, pitted Nigerian forces against extremist militants in a rural locality. The militants' use of sophisticated weaponry and guerilla tactics has prompted concerns that they might be growing in strength and reach. Meanwhile, the Nigerian army's response has been criticized for inadequacy in terms of strategy, intelligence, and equipment. The stakes for Nigeria's military are high as it fends off multiple insurgency threats while grappling with limited resources. In this context, the large-scale casualties and losses inflicted by the recent skirmishes come as a huge blow to forces already stretched thin. Potential Consequences The ongoing violence in northern Nigeria poses grave risks for the nation's stability and security. The recent skirmishes are yet another indication that Nigeria is facing a daunting challenge as it tries to contain extremist elements and secure a more peaceful future for its inhabitants. The mounting death toll, regardless of the exact figure, underscores the importance of developing robust solutions to the problem. Moreover, it is critical to understand how this volatile situation extends beyond Nigerian borders. As Islamist militants continue to forge connections with similar groups in the region and across Africa, their influence and threat potential multiply. Accordingly, the international community must consider the risk of spillover effects and regional destabilization. Conclusion The recent violence between the Nigerian military and Islamist militants in the northern region is disastrous not only for the loss of at least 185 lives but also for the potential implications of this ongoing conflict. Failure to effectively combat and dismantle these extremist groups could have far-reaching consequences, not only for Nigeria but also for the entire region. Therefore, the Nigerian government and the international community must work in unison to devise comprehensive, long-term strategies to address the root causes of this crisis and enhance security for millions of affected people across the region."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona.

Article: Speakers of different languages not only describe the world differently but think about it differently too, according to a new study. Researchers used a cartoon cat Sylvester to study how language was reflected in the gestures people made. Dr. Sotaro Kita of the University of Bristol's Department of Experimental Psychology , showed the cartoon to a group of native English, Japanese and Turkish speakers and then watched their gestures as they described the actions they had seen. He found speakers of the three different languages used different gestures to describe the same event, which appeared to reflect the way the structure of their languages expressed that event. For example, when describing a scene where the cat swings on a rope, the English speakers used gestures showing an arc trajectory and the Japanese and Turkish speakers tended to use straight gestures showing the motion but not the arc. Dr. Kita suggests this is because Japanese and Turkish have no proper verb to express the English meaning \\"to swing\\". While English speakers use the arc gesture as their language can readily express the change of location and the arc-shaped trajectory, Japanese and Turkish speakers cannot as easily express the idea of movement with an arc trajectory so they use the straight gesture. Dr. Kita said, \\"My research suggests that speakers of different languages cause different spatial images of the same event in a way that matches the expressive possibilities of their own languages. In other words, language influences spatial thinking at the moment of speaking.\\" Question: 70.What is mainly discussed in the text? Options: A: Differences between languages.

Movie title: Black Snake Moan Movie plot: The film centers on two main characters: Lazarus Redd (Samuel L. Jackson), a deeply religious farmer and former blues guitarist, and Rae Doole (Christina Ricci), a young sex addict. Lazarus' wife and his brother were having an affair, which has left him bitter and angry. Rae's boyfriend Ronnie Morgan (Justin Timberlake) leaves for deployment with the 196th Field Artillery Brigade, Tennessee National Guard, and in his absence, she indulges in bouts of promiscuity and drug use. During one of Rae's binges, Ronnie's friend Gill Morton (Michael Raymond-James) tries to take advantage of her. She laughs at his advances, comparing him unfavorably with another man, and he severely beats her. Believing she's dead, Gill dumps Rae and leaves her for dead in only a shirt and panties by the side of the road and drives away. Lazarus discovers Rae unconscious in the road the next morning and brings her home to nurse her back to health. Lazarus goes to see Tehronne (David Banner) - the man who Lazarus thought had beaten her - and learns of her promiscuity. Over the course of several days, Rae, delirious with fever, occasionally wakes up and tries to flee from Lazarus. He chains her to the radiator to keep her from running away. After Rae regains her wits, Lazarus announces that it is his spiritual duty to heal her of her sinful ways and refuses to release her until he does so. Rae makes several attempts to escape, and even briefly has sex with a teenage boy who helps out on Lazarus' farm. She eventually comes to tolerate her position. Lazarus buys her a conservative dress to wear, plays the guitar for her, and feeds her home-cooked meals. Lazarus' pastor and close friend, R.L.

Her college friends Sudha Mathur (Sabeeha) and Sunil (Javed Jaffrey) try to help her sort through her visions but to little avail. Devi is relieved after she talks to her sister and finds that she is alive. However, just some time later, Rama is murdered in the same way as Devi had pictured. The murderer hides Rama's body in a mansion's wall. Rama is reported missing. Devi firmly believes Rama is dead. Five years later, Devi moves to her uncle (Ajit Vachani)'s home where she eventually meets and is courted by millionaire businessman Ram Kumar (Jackie Shroff). Sunil, who was secretly in love with Devi, is deeply disappointed. Devi and Ram marry and enter his family mansion, which he has re-earned after a legal battle. Little known to anybody, this is the same mansion where Rama was buried. When Devi starts having the visions again, Rama's skeleton is not the only thing that will come tumbling out. Devi sees a wall in the mansion being torn down. Devi tears down the wall, only to find a skeleton tumbling out of it. Devi knows whose skeleton it is: it's Rama's, since she had a necklace similar to Devi's. Also, the dead woman's skeleton is roughly same height as that of Rama. The Inspector (Shivaji Satam) quickly points out that since the mansion was closed when Rama disappeared, anyone could have hidden a dead body in there and nobody would know the truth. However, he doubts that the dead woman is Rama: Several such necklaces are available. Devi now gets another vision of another woman getting murdered.

From its disjointed story structure to its underdeveloped characters, this movie leaves the audience feeling unsatisfied with a lot more to desire. The film starts off with an interesting premise that quickly disintegrates into a meandering and confusing plot. The fast pacing of the movie doesn't give the viewer enough time to invest emotionally in the characters or grasp the intricacies of the storyline. It becomes evident that \\"Dissonance\\" bites off more than it can chew, presenting a complex web of subplots that don't seem to connect or complement each other in any coherent manner. The cinematography, while at times visually captivating, falls short by relying on gimmicky and overused techniques that distract from the story. The film's saving grace, its stellar cast, is utterly wasted on poorly written characters with little depth, development, or motivation. The actors' talents are not given the opportunity to shine, with the script failing to provide nuanced or emotional dialogue that could have given life to these otherwise uninspired characters. Moreover, \\"Dissonance\\" contains tonal inconsistencies that only add to the movie's flaws. Some scenes dive abruptly into heavy-handed political commentary, while others attempt a lighthearted, comedic touch - a jarring inconsistency which leaves the viewer bewildered. This lack of tonal cohesion also highlights the film's inability to seamlessly blend various narrative elements together. Ultimately, \\"Dissonance\\" ends on a disappointingly predictable note, offering no fresh insights or unique ideas to warrant attention or praise.

Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....","completion":"The last name of the person who is believed to have spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries is Lochner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - bloody marks - open sores - different - schizophrenia - anxiety The rationale to choose \\"open sores\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"Picking at one's skin often results in open sores. This is due to the physical damage that the individual inflicts on their skin, usually repeatedly, during the picking process. There are several reasons why the other options are not the best answer: 1. Bloody marks: While it is possible that picking at the skin can result in bloody marks, this is not always the case. Moreover, the primary outcome of picking at the skin would be open sores, which may or may not be bloody. Therefore, choosing \\"bloody marks\\" as an answer would only cover a part of the potential outcomes and would not be as accurate as \\"open sores.\\" 2. Different: This choice is vague and does not directly relate to the consequences of picking at one's skin. It would be an inaccurate and unclear choice for the best answer. 3. Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. While it is possible for individuals with schizophrenia to engage in skin-picking behavior, the act of picking at one's skin does not directly result in the development of schizophrenia. Moreover, not all skin pickers suffer from this mental disorder. Therefore, choosing \\"schizophrenia\\" as the answer would be misleading and incorrect. 4. Anxiety: Although anxiety can be a contributing factor to skin-picking behavior, it is essential to differentiate between the cause and the consequence of skin picking. Anxiety may lead to skin picking, but it is not the direct outcome of the behavior itself. The act of repeatedly picking at one's skin will most likely result in open sores, which is why it should be chosen as the best answer. In conclusion, the most accurate answer when considering the direct outcome of picking at one's skin would be \\"open sores.\\" This choice encompasses the primary physical consequence that individuals experience after engaging in skin-picking behavior. While other options may be indirectly related to the act of picking at the skin, they are not the main result and thus are not as accurate as the answer \\"open sores.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Cooking food is something we have done since the first caveman threw a mammoth steak on the fire. While it is true that cooking does cause chemical changes in food and a loss of some nutrients, it is a clear case of being alert and not alarmed. Every time we cook food, there is some degree of nutrient loss. Exposing food to heat, oxygen or light alters the nutrients found in food. It is not all bad news though because cooking food also has its advantages. Cooking food can increase its digestibility, meaning you will get more nutrients out of it. And even though there may be less of some nutrients from cooking, it is swings and roundabouts as the availability of certain phytonutrients increases. And of course, let’s not forget that heating food kills some of the nasty microbes that can cause food poisoning. The principle behind a raw food diet is that cooking food destroys the natural enzymes and nutrients that would otherwise give us optimal health and control body weight. A raw food diet is almost entirely plant-based and includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, vegetable oils and juices in their natural uncooked state. Now on the pro side for a raw food diet, it means if you are currently eating a lot of processed food, then switching to raw food will be a clear nutritional win. So that gets a big tick. Unquestionably, there are many benefits to eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods are high in nutrients and fibre and low in kilojoules. But is raw superior to cooked? A review of 28 research studies found eaters of both cooked and raw vegetables had a lower risk of cancer compared to people who did not eat many vegetables in the first place. Where the science gets murky is the claim that raw food is better because cooking destroys the enzymes found in plants. It is 100 percent correct that cooking will do this. But so too does digestion. Few enzymes survive their trip through the hydrochloric acid spa bath in the stomach. And those plant enzymes are essential only to the plants. The...

Schemes covering pensions, child care, ultra-low emission cars and cycling to work will not be affected. Arrangements set in place before April 2017 will be protected until April 2018.

In its consultation document, it gives the example of a 24-month mobile phone contract worth £1,000.

Wave motion: Imagine when you drop a stone in a pond, and you see ripples moving away from where the stone splashed. Those ripples are an example of wave motion.

Sentence 2: In 1971 , a main campus was completed in 33 MacDonnell Road for the new school . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","completion":"No, the two sentences do not convey exactly the same information, although they share a number of similarities. Both sentences refer to the year 1971 and the completion of a campus at the same address 33 MacDonnell Road. However, they have different implications regarding the type and purpose of the school for which the campus was built. The first sentence states that the new campus was completed for a primary school. The term \\"primary school\\" refers specifically to a school that caters to children in the early stages of formal education, typically between the ages of 5 to 11, or grades 1 through 6. Thus, this sentence tells us that in 1971, a campus was constructed at 33 MacDonnell Road aimed to house a primary school. On the other hand, the second sentence mentions that a main campus was completed at the same address for a 'new school'. Unlike the first sentence, it does not specify the level of the school (e.g., primary, secondary, etc.), and only labels it as 'new'. The term 'main campus' also suggests that the school could possibly have additional buildings or campuses elsewhere, with the one on 33 MacDonnell Road serving as the main or central facility. This is something we do not get from the first sentence. Also, the first sentence mentions explicitly it's for a \\"primary school\\", suggesting that the campus might be designed to cater to the needs of younger children. The second sentence simply says it is a \\"new school\\" without specifying the type or level of the institution. This could potentially refer to any type of educational institution, not necessarily a primary school. In summary, although both sentences provide similar information about the completion of a campus in 1971 on 33 MacDonnell Road, the specific details regarding the purpose and the type of school for which the campus was intended differs in each sentence, making the information they convey not entirely identical."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Organisms that live in freshwater environments often possess a contractile vacuole that prevents cells from taking in too much water through what process? Choices: - electrolysis - glycolysis - hemostasis - osmosis A: A:","completion":"Organisms that live in freshwater environments often possess a contractile vacuole that prevents cells from taking in too much water through the process of osmosis. Osmosis is a selective physical process that occurs in living cells and involves the spontaneous movement of solvent particles (typically water) across a semipermeable membrane from a region of lower solute concentration to a region of higher solute concentration. This movement equalizes the concentration of solutes (such as salts, sugars, and other molecules) on both sides of the membrane and helps maintain appropriate cellular conditions. Freshwater organisms, such as protozoa, algae, and some invertebrates, live in environments with significantly lower solute concentrations than their internal cellular environment. As a result, they face a continuous influx of water into their cells through the process of osmosis. The excess water uptake, if left unchecked, could cause cells to swell and eventually burst, leading to the death of the organism. To counteract this, freshwater organisms have evolved specialized organelles called contractile vacuoles. A contractile vacuole is a membrane-bound organelle that collects excess water from the cell and periodically expels it out of the cell, thus maintaining osmotic homeostasis and preventing the cell from taking in too much water. This process works as follows: 1. Excess water enters the contractile vacuole through channels created by special proteins embedded in the cell membrane, specifically aquaporins, which facilitate the transport of water molecules across the membrane. 2. The contractile vacuole gradually fills with water, along with waste materials that the cell wants to excrete. 3. When the vacuole is full, its surrounding membrane fuses with the cell membrane and contracts, expelling the water and waste products out of the cell and into the surrounding environment. 4. The vacuole then reforms, and the cycle begins anew. It is important to note that this process of osmoregulation is energy-driven, as the cells require energy in the form of ATP to power the contractile vacuole's activity and maintain cellular osmotic balance. To summarize, freshwater organisms possess contractile vacuoles to prevent their cells from taking in too much water through the process of osmosis. This specialized organelle plays a crucial role in osmoregulation, which allows these organisms to survive and thrive in their particular environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Alexisonfire (pronounced \\"Alexis on fire\\") is a five-piece Canadian post-hardcore band that formed in St. Catharines, Ontario in 2001. The band consists of George Pettit (unclean vocals), Dallas Green (clean vocals, rhythm guitar, piano), Wade MacNeil (lead guitar, vocals), Chris Steele (bass guitar), and Jordan Hastings (drums, percussion). They describe their music as \\"the sound of two Catholic high-school girls in mid-knife-fight\\" (a reference to their song \\"A Dagger Through the Heart of St. Angeles\\", also the inspiration for their debut album cover art). Dallas Green informed the rest of the band of his intention to leave Alexisonfire in 2010. Green agreed not to announce his departure until the rest of the band decided on their future plans. On February 14, 2011, on their official Twitter page, Alexisonfire announced they had been writing new music for their fifth studio album, describing it as \\"so heavy it's going to make Dog's Blood look like a ska record\\". However, on August 5, 2011, Alexisonfire announced their intent to break up. In the statement, George Pettit cited Dallas Green's departure from the band to focus solely on City and Colour, Wade MacNeil's departure to join another band, later revealed to be as the new vocalist for Gallows, and other personal issues among the remaining members as reasons for breaking up. Pettit also described the break up as not being \\"amicable\\". Alexisonfire had planned on celebrating their tenth anniversary with one last headlining Canadian tour and \\"a series of releases\\", although Green had initially expressed reluctance to take part in any further shows with the band at the time. For Record Store Day 2012, Alexisonfire and Dine Alone re-issued Math Sheet Demos, which featured demo recordings of songs prepared in the pre-production of their self-titled debut album. In July 2012, Green stated he had been in contact with other ex-Alexisonfire members, and that he and MacNeil had been \\"starting to talk about doing some final [Alexisonfire] shows, because when we did play our last show nobody knew it was our last show.\\" In December 2012-15 months after the band's breakup announcement--Alexisonfire embarked on their international, farewell tour with stops in Canada, UK, Australia and Brazil, originally announced to be a nine-date tour.

I can use this background: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.

Sergeant Ames is still a buck sergeant who hates Dodo because he advanced to outrank Ames within Dodo's first 24 hours in the army. Dodo's former comrade in arms Charlie Cobb is also a buck sergeant. As both Cobb and Ames are the best marksman in the regiment but constantly boast of their prowess, Colonel Barkley seeks to find an expert who can outshoot them. Though possessing a photographic memory that enabled him to advance from private to senior non-commissioned officer in less than 24 hours, Dodo has one weakness: though his book knowledge enables him to give lectures on weapons disassembly and ballistics, he is gun shy and an incompetent marksman. After nearly shooting several of his fellow soldiers on the pistol range, with the actual target being the safest place to hide, Dodo is ordered to go into the woods to practice. There his missed shots impress the picnicking colonel and his daughter Betty when Dodo accidentally shoots a hawk through the eye whilst in flight and after the colonel catches a fish who breaks the line and is in the process of rolling back into the water, an accidental discharge from Dodo's pistol shoots the fish through his eye. Eager to deflate the boasting Ames and Cobb, the colonel bets a month's pay that Dodo can outshoot Ames and Cobb.

He takes aim at Archer, waits until he gets a clean shot, and fires. The bullet hits Archer in the back, and he and his son fall off the horse, leaving a noticeable bloodstain on the horse's mane. Three balloons are seen drifting away into the sky.Moments later, Archer is shown lying on his stomach, in pain, the bullet having gone cleanly through his body as bystanders rush over to him. Though bleeding, he sees Michael lying a few feet away, dead, the bullet having struck him in the head. Tears stinging his eyes, Archer crawls over and holds his dead son's body while Castor looks up from the scope of his rifle, stunned to see that he has just killed a child. The carousel horse Archer was riding on spins round and round and quickly fades out.Six Years Later:Archer is the field agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office and has been relentlessly pursuing Castor ever since the assassination attempt.

The country observed a day of mourning on Sunday after its worst air disaster. Russian Air Transport Agency head Aleksandr Neradko has said the airliner disintegrated at high altitude. But Victor Sorochenko, the head of Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee, said it was too early to conclude what caused the Airbus A321 to crash. He told reporters debris had been found across a 20sq km-wide area of Sinai. So far 163 bodies have been found. The plane came down early on Saturday, shortly after leaving the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for the Russian city of St Petersburg. Jihadists allied to so-called Islamic State (IS) in Sinai, where such groups are active, made a claim on social media that they had brought down flight KGL9268. But Egyptian Prime Minister Sharif Ismail said experts had confirmed that a plane could not be downed at 9,450m (31,000ft), the altitude the Airbus 321 was flying at, by weapons the militants are known to possess. Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has also urged caution, saying the investigation into the cause was a \\"complicated matter\\" that could take months. Russian Transport Minister Maksim Sokolov said no evidence had been seen that indicated the plane was targeted, and IS has not produced pictures or video footage to substantiate its claim. Analysis by BBC Monitoring found that a video purporting to show the downing of a plane did not appear to be an official IS clip, and was not shared on official IS channels. A number of major airlines - Emirates, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa, and Qatar Airways - have decided not to fly over the Sinai Peninsula until more information is available. Two smaller carriers, flydubai and Air Arabia, also said they would re-route flights, while Etihad Airways said it would avoid only \\"certain areas of airspace\\" over Sinai. Germany's transport ministry has told German airlines not to follow the same route taken by the Russian plane. British Airways said it regularly assessed the safety of its routes. BA said it would not confirm flight routes, but that it \\"would never fly a route unless it was safe to do so\\". Russian and French investigators have joined the Egyptian-led investigation, along with experts from Airbus, which is headquartered in France. Egyptian officials said some bodies had been recovered within a radius of 5km on Saturday, but that of a three-year-old girl was found 8km from the scene. The plane's flight recorders have been found and sent for analysis. Russia's transport regulator said on Sunday it would check all the airline's A321 planes, but Kogalymavia said this would not affect their operations. Egypt's civil aviation minister Hossam Kamal said there had been no sign of any problems on board the flight, contradicting earlier reports that the pilot had asked to make an emergency landing. An Egyptian ground service official who carried out a pre-flight inspection of the plane said the aircraft appeared to be in good shape \\"We are all shocked. It was a good plane. Everything checked out in 35 minutes,\\" the official told AP. However, the widow of the plane's co-pilot told Russian TV her husband had complained about the aircraft's technical condition. The plane was carrying 217 passengers, including 25 children, Russian transport authorities said. There were seven crew members on board. Most of the passengers were Russian, but at least three were Ukrainian and one Belarusian.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: Almost four decades after meeting in high school, these two formerly single friends have tied the knot after promising each other they would if they weren’t married to other people when they were 50. Kimberley Dean and Ron Palmer met as students at Saint Agnes School in Minnesota almost 37 years ago. The friendship between Dean, the then-freshman, and Palmer, a senior, soon blossomed into a relationship. Yet, the two eventually went their separate ways once the school year came to a close. “We dated most of my senior year, and we broke up but remained friends,” Palmer, 54, tells PEOPLE. “I wanted to go sow my oats, so to speak, and I was honest with her. I decided to go have my fun, and I thought girls were a dime a dozen. But I never developed as good as a relationship with anyone else as I had with her.” A few years after they graduated, they married other people — Palmer’s marriage lasted seven years, and Kimberly’s marriage blessed her with two children, Kayla and Konner, before she got a divorce in 1998. But the two former lovebirds kept in contact throughout the years. Kimberley Dean and Ron Palmer Kimberley Dean RELATED: Community Helps Couple Get Their Dream Wedding After Cancer Journey: ‘She Stuck by Me,’ Says Groom “We’re very comfortable around each other,” Dean, 51, says. “We do the complete the sentences and laugh at each other’s stupid jokes kind of thing. We’re kind of like a yin and a yang.” Palmer says Dean was always someone he could turn to, even while he was dating other women when they were just friends. “I’d either get a letter or a phone call every once in awhile. When I was dating other girls and having issues, I would call her and she would help me through those times,” Palmer remembers. “It was a super good friendship, and it went back and forth like that for a long time.” The two say they never went more than six months without talking to each other, and during one of their many conversations when they were in their 30s, the two made a pact: if they weren’t married again by the time they were both over the age of 50, they would marry each other. The two figured it was just a light-hearted joke that would never come true, that is, until 2016, when Dean brought it up again, 37 years after they first dated. “It was like a lightbulb went off,” Dean recalls. “And I told him, ‘Do you remember this stupid pact we made?’ ” Kimberley Dean and Ron Palmer Kimberley Dean RELATED: Bride with Stage 4 Cancer Lives to See Wedding Day After Doctors Urged Her to Move Up Ceremony Palmer did remember, and the pact they made so long ago was about to make a real impact on both of their lives. “She asked if we should try it again,” Palmer says. “I told her, you know, we’re risking a real incredible friendship, because if it doesn’t work this time, I don’t know how we could still remain friends.” Though he was apprehensive, it didn’t take long for him to come around. “I did hesitate when she asked me, but I could see we still had feelings for each other,” Palmer says. “And it’s been fantastic ever since.” On New Year’s Eve 2017, Palmer proposed, and the couple married on June 1, completing the promise they made to each other so long ago. “It started out as just a complete random joke and never in a million years did we both think we would have ended up in the same place at the right time,” Dean says. “Because I mean, we’ve been in different relationships, and now here we are!” The newlyweds want others to remember that when they break up with someone, they don’t have to become enemies — stay friends when you can, because you never know what awaits in the future.

So don’t give up.” When asked if anything felt different now that they are married, Dean says things are similar, except with one special difference. “It’s pretty much the same,” she says. “Only happier!” ||||| MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — We have seen this story before in the movies: Two friends agree if they are still single someday, they will tie the knot. “It’s more of a comedy [laughs]!” said Kimberley Dean of St. Paul. For Dean and Ron Palmer, this is not a movie — it is real life. “It honestly started as a joke,” Dean said. Their story actually begins 37 years ago, when Dean and Palmer met at Saint Agnes School. They soon started dating. “She loves everybody and everything,” Palmer said. “There’s not a jealous bone in her body, there’s not a prejudice bone in her body.” But like many young loves, it fizzled out. They both went on to marry other people, but they stayed friends throughout the years — through marriages, children and divorce. Eventually, they made a pact. “I said, ‘OK, you know what? If you’re not married and I’m not married, we’ll just get married,’” Dean said. The deadline was at age 50, and they are both just over 50 now, but they are staying true to their word. Palmer proposed on New Year’s Eve, and they’re getting married on Friday. “We love each other,” Dean said. “We’ve always known that, I think, we were meant to be together,” Dean said. They say you should marry your best friend. Dean and Palmer have close to four decades under their belt, and a lifetime to go. ||||| Video (02:54) : Kimberley Dean and Ron Palmer are making it official this Friday. The duo said what started as a joke has turned into a match many had long seen coming. If Kimberley Dean and Ron Palmer’s 37-year romance sounds like a TV show, that’s because it was one. “How I Met Your Mother,” to be exact, in which two characters agreed to marry if both were single at 40. Their Friday wedding fulfills a similar pact they made a few years back, according to Kimberley: “Ron was talking about all his benefits through work and not having anyone to give them to. Just jokingly, I said, ‘The last one who turns 50, which would be me, if I’m not married and you’re not married, we’re just going to marry each other.’ He said, ‘Done!’ — never imagining any of this would happen.” Well, it’s happening. Kimberley, 51, and Ron, 54, will marry in Como Park’s Japanese Garden — not Ron’s first choice of location, which he jokes would be the zoo, where Casey, the famed gorilla, could witness. It could be argued that Casey (who now resides at the Louisville Zoo) would be an appropriate guest because maybe he could address the 400-pound gorilla in the room: Can a marriage that began with a jokey pact work? “Oh, absolutely,” says Kimberley. “I have no second, third or fourth doubts in my head. Now that we’re getting so close, details like needing to call the florist lady, I am stressed about those things. But marrying him? I’m not stressed at all. I’ve been divorced since 1998, so I go in with my eyes completely wide open.” Kim Dean and Ron Palmer, at a spot on the second floor of St. Agnes School where Kim used to wait to catch a glimpse of Ron coming down the stairs from the high school classrooms upstairs. (Plus an old photo of the couple.) The key element to Kimberley and Ron’s relationship is that they’ve been friends for 37 years. They met at St. Agnes School, where she was an eighth-grader and he was a junior. “I would watch him come down the stairs when the high school kids were changing classes and we would wave at each other,” says Kimberley, who works in the Roseville Community School District’s youth enrichment program. “We ended up taking a picture together and, by fall of the following school year, when I was a freshman and he was a senior, we were dating.” Like many a high school romance, this one didn’t last. “I wanted to go sow my oats, so to speak. So we went our separate ways,” says Ron, a safety coordinator for Xcel Energy. “By the time I felt like maybe we should give it a try again, she had met somebody else and got married and then I went off and got married.” Three decades of not-quite-right timing ensued. Ron’s marriage only lasted seven years. Kimberley’s was longer — and gave her daughter and maid of honor Kayla and son Konner, who will give her away — but she, too, divorced. A second stab at dating didn’t feel right, but they continued to keep in touch. “I don’t think six months ever went by in all this time that we weren’t in contact,” says Ron. “She helped me a lot. After my marriage and with me having numerous girlfriends over the years, I would always call Kim when I had something to complain about: ‘Why do women do this?’ She was my go-to person.” “He would still call my mom after all those years, wishing her a happy Mother’s Day,” says Kimberley. “He would call if he had girl trouble. I would call him to take a dead hamster out of my son’s cage because I didn’t want to touch it.” According to Kimberley, the “pair of goofballs” had an unbreakable bond, one which is expressed in “their” song, REO Speedwagon’s “Keep on Loving You.” “Over the years, I would get a call that said, ‘Turn on KS95’ and there it would be or I would hear the song come on and text her and, if she didn’t answer, I’d leave the radio playing it on her phone,” says Ron. REO could practically have been talking about them in the lyrics to that hair band classic: “When I said that I loved you, I meant that I loved you forever.” “I think we both knew, even in high school, that we were supposed to be together,” says Kimberley. Ron agrees: “I truly did love her back when we were kids. I’ve always loved her. She’s such an awesome friend.” ‘It can happen’ Friendship started to look like something else when they went to Roseville’s Taste of Rosefest the summer of 2016. Afterward, their conversations became more frequent. Soon, Ron invited Kimberley to his hunting cabin in Finlayson, Minn. That’s where Kimberley popped the question. Well, a question. Ron Palmer held a note that’d he’d written to Kim Dean - and that she kept - when they were teenagers at St. Agnes School. “I don’t remember exactly what I said but it was along the lines of: ‘What do you think if we try this again?’ ” Kimberley recalls. “There was a lot of hesitation on his part. He told me later he worried that, if a relationship didn’t work, we would lose one of the very best friends we ever had.” “That was a big risk,” agrees Ron. “But we decided to try.” This time, it took. Ron iced the deal last New Year’s Eve Up North, when he suggested they investigate frozen Gooseberry Falls. Worried about falling or freezing to death in the below-zero temperatures, Kimberley took one look at the ice and headed for the warmth of their car. But, when she turned back, Ron was on one (very frigid) knee, holding a tiny blue Tiffany’s box. Long story short: She said “yes.” To the surprise of no one. “It felt like it was supposed to happen, like it was meant to be,” says Kayla Dean. “I would say there’s no better match in the world for either of them.” Put Kayla firmly in the knew-it-all-along camp. “Out of everyone my mom has ever been with — even thinking about my dad, who we don’t have a relationship with — I would say Ronnie has filled that father role for Konner and me,” says Kayla, who thinks there’s a lesson in her mom’s romance. “People who are meant to be together will always find each other. It may take 37 years, but it can happen.” Kim Dean and Ron Palmer, at a spot on the second floor of St. Agnes School where Kim used to wait to catch a glimpse of Ron coming down the stairs from the high school classrooms upstairs. The benefit of time Ron and Kimberley agree they may have needed all of those years to become a marriage-ready couple. “When she got married, I thought, ‘Ah, she’s gone,’ but, as a young man in my 20s, I thought women were all over the place and I could get along with any of them. I thought that was the norm,” says Ron. “As it turns out, and as I have learned, it is not. I never got along with anyone else as well as I got along with her.” “The only thing that sucks is that we’re in our 50s. How much time do we have left?” asks Kimberley, who adds that “we had to go through all those relationships — the good, the bad, the ugly, the complete heartbreak — to get to where we are right now. We’ve even talked about, if we had gotten married all those years ago when we were younger, would we still be together?” Maybe not. Marriage expert William Doherty says statistics on young marriages are not promising. “Knowing each other better, as they do now, is generally better, but [this situation] is so unusual. They do know more of what they’re getting than lots of people who get married do,” says Doherty, professor of family social science at the University of Minnesota. “I’m not predicting bad things but many people who have lived together get married and say that not much is going to change, that it’s just a piece of paper. But that’s not how it works. When people get married, things really change.” Kimberley and Ron have gotten a taste of that change since he moved into her Como Park home about a month ago. There’s been a learning curve — she’s maybe a little neater than he is — but both say it’s going great. In fact, living together has helped remind Ron what it was like to fall in love with Kimberley all those years ago. “When we were kids, we would walk down the Midway at the State Fair and the fireworks would go off,” says Ron. “If we were together, we would always stop and watch.” Anyone who has seen an old movie knows what it means when they cut from kisses to fireworks: passion. So it’s appropriate that those State Fair fireworks still lit up the sky during the decades when Kimberley or Ron weren’t together. And that this summer, 37 years after they met, the two will watch them as husband and wife for the very first time. ||||| Get Stuff We Love Subscribe to our newsletter. A deal is a deal.

But they quickly forgot about the deal as time passed. They remained in each other's lives, never going more than six months without talking to each other. Palmer sometimes watched Dean's children or took them camping. He also came to the rescue when Dean needed someone to retrieve a dead pet hamster from her son's cage. \\"That's the kind of friendship we have. 'If you need something, I’m there for you.'

Palmer proposed a year later on New Year’s Eve. On June 1, the couple got married in a garden ceremony in front of a waterfall. Dean's son walked her down the aisle and her daughter served as the maid of honor.

Towards the end of the Republic, religious and political offices became more closely intertwined; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative. Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political, military and priestly powers; at first temporarily, then for his lifetime. He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, including that of pontifex maximus; as he invented none, he could claim them as traditional honours. His reforms were represented as adaptive, restorative and regulatory, rather than innovative; most notably his elevation (and membership) of the ancient Arvales, his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality. Augustus obtained the pax deorum, maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation. This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors.

She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things.

Question: Process: - An isotope has too many protons - The isotope is unstable - The isotope emits radiation - The isotope decays - The isotope loses some atomic particles - The isotope turns into a different element - The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation. Question: suppose the isotope becomes more stable happens, how will it affect the isotope woud emit more radiation. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"When an isotope has too many protons, it becomes unstable and undergoes radioactive decay in an attempt to achieve a more stable state. This process can involve the isotope emitting radiation and losing atomic particles, eventually transforming it into a different element. The isotope will continue decaying and emitting radiation until it reaches a stable state. Now, if we suppose that the isotope becomes more stable, this means that the isotope has already undergone some decay and lost some atomic particles. As a result, the further decay and radiation emission will be influenced. If the isotope becomes more stable, it would typically emit less radiation. This is because stability corresponds to a decrease in the amount of excess energy that must be released for the isotope to achieve its desired stable state. In most cases, an increase in stability results in a decrease in the overall energy required to complete the decay process, which directly corresponds to a decrease in the emitted radiation. However, it is important to recognize that isotopes can decay through different processes that may have varying effects on emission rates. For instance, some decay processes may lead to a less pronounced reduction in radiation emission despite an increased stability. In others, the isotope might still emit a notable amount of radiation even after reaching a relatively stable state. To summarize, when an isotope becomes more stable, it will generally emit less radiation because the energy required for it to achieve a stable state has decreased. However, the specific effect on radiation emission can vary depending on the decay process and the particular isotope involved. In most cases though, increased stability results in a reduced radiation emission, allowing the isotope to move closer to a stable state without emitting more radiation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: It was a dream, then a place, then a memory. My father built it near the Suwannee River. I like to think it was in the heart of Florida, because it was, and is, in my heart. Its name was Dogland. Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled. And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes. And then Grandma Bette wouldn't say a word for half an hour or more, a very long time for Grandma Bette to be quiet.

When Einstein started to work in America, someone asked him what he needed. He said he needed a desk, some paper and a pencil. He also asked for a big waste-paper basket to hold all of his mistakes. This shows that he knew even the cleverest man in the world can only learn by making mistakes. Einstein regarded time as very important. He never wore socks and he thought putting on socks was a waste of time as people already wore shoes. He also thought it was a waste of time remembering things that could quickly be found in a book. That's why he never remembered his own phone number, which was in the phone book. He knew what was worth remembering. It is true that if we are going to do great things in our lives, we can not waste our time. Einstein liked to joke too.

Database In recent years there was a high demand for massively distributed databases with high partition tolerance but according to the CAP theorem it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide consistency, availability and partition tolerance guarantees. A distributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the same time, but not all three. For that reason many NoSQL databases are using what is called eventual consistency to provide both availability and partition tolerance guarantees with a reduced level of data consistency. Q: What explains the difficulty in a system containing availability, consistency, and partition tolerance guarantees?","completion":"Imagine you have a big box of toy blocks. You need to share these blocks with your friends at different tables. In this case, the box of blocks is like a database and your friends are like different computers. Now, let's say you can make sure of three things: 1. Availability: All your friends can play with the blocks at any time. 2. Consistency: All your friends always have the same blocks. 3. Partition Tolerance: Even if some tables are split apart, your friends can still play with the blocks. But there is a rule: you can only choose 2 of these 3 things at the same time. Why is this hard? Let's see: - If we choose Availability and Consistency, it means all your friends can play all the time and they all have the same blocks. But, if some tables separate, your friends may not get all the blocks they need. - If we choose Availability and Partition Tolerance, it means all your friends can play even if the tables are separated, but they might not always have the same blocks. - If we choose Consistency and Partition Tolerance, it means everyone has the same blocks even when tables are separated, but sometimes your friends cannot play with the blocks. This is why it's difficult to have all three things – availability, consistency, and partition tolerance – at the same time in a system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This process often involves physical motions with objects, such as moving them, arranging them in a certain way, mixing them, shaking them, etc. Input: To bake a pie, you can Output:","completion":"begin by following this process: 1. Gather all ingredients and necessary tools: First, consult your pie recipe and gather all the necessary ingredients, such as flour, sugar, butter, lard, salt, and the required filling ingredients (e.g., fruits, vegetables, eggs, milk). You'll also need tools like a mixing bowl, a rolling pin, a pie dish, and a knife or fork for cutting or pricking the dough. 2. Prepare the dough: Combine the flour, salt, and butter or lard in a large mixing bowl. Use your hands or a pastry cutter to combine the ingredients until they form a crumbly texture. Slowly add cold water to the mixture and continue to combine until the dough forms a ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. 3. Roll out the dough: Lightly flour your work surface and rolling pin. Roll out half of the dough to form the bottom crust, ensuring it is large enough to fit your pie dish with some overhang. 4. Prepare the filling: While the dough is chilling, prepare your pie filling. If using fruits, wash, peel (if necessary), and chop them into bite-sized pieces. If making a savory pie, cook any vegetables, meat, or other fillings to the recipe's specifications. 5. Assemble the pie: Place the rolled-out dough into your pie dish and carefully press it against the bottom and sides. Trim any excess dough that hangs over the edge. Add the filling to the pie crust, being careful not to overfill it. 6. Roll out the top crust: Roll out the remaining dough to form the top crust. Place it over the pie filling, gently pressing the edges of the top and bottom crusts together to seal the pie. Trim any excess dough, and crimp the edge of the crust with a fork or your fingers. 7. Cut vents: With a knife or fork, cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape, ensuring even baking and preventing the pie from becoming soggy. 8. Bake the pie: Follow the recipe's instructions for baking time and temperature. Generally, pies are baked at a temperature of 375°F (190°C) for approximately 45-60 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. 9. Allow the pie to cool: Allow your pie to cool on a wire rack for at least 1-2 hours before serving, allowing the filling to set and flavors to meld together properly. By following this process, I used the general knowledge of baking a pie, which involves physically handling ingredients and tools, to guide someone through the steps of making a pie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This magma can eventually rise towards the Earth's surface due to tectonic activity, where it may contribute to the formation of new volcanic eruptions. The entire process is part of the rock cycle, which is a continuous series of events that transform rocks from one type to another over geological time scales. Once the magma is expelled through a volcano or an underwater vent, it can begin the process of cooling, crystallization, and rock formation all over again, maintaining the continuous nature of the rock cycle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Decent fantasy, but Mr. Williams can do much better Product review: Having crossed Otherland's many voluminous, er, volumes, I kind of have high expectations for anything Tad Williams puts to paper. WotF almost meets them. Almost. It's an unevenly paced tale of rather standard human-crosses-over-to-fantasy-land kinda story, with a few twists, but not much more than that. It's good reading if you're a Williams die hard fan and it sure beats the heaps of garbage that get published every year under the fantasy umbrella, but if you're looking for the genius spark that has ignited Otherland and kept it burning for thousands of pages, you probably won't find it here. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?","completion":"This review depicts the product in a somewhat unflattering light. The reviewer acknowledges that while Tad Williams is a skilled and respected author in the fantasy genre, this particular work fails to meet the high expectations they have developed after reading Williams' more successful series, Otherland. The reviewer describes the story as unevenly paced and of a standard nature, which suggests that it may not be their favorite work by the author. However, it is important to note that the reviewer does not completely dismiss the book. They mention that it is still good reading material for fans of Tad Williams and will likely be enjoyable when compared to lesser-quality fantasy titles. But, the reviewer does express disappointment in not finding the distinctive and captivating elements that made Otherland so remarkable. In conclusion, the review is more unflattering than flattering, but it leaves some room for the reader to interpret the book's merits on their own."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Anna BradleyChair of Healthwatch England We know that patients are reluctant to make a fuss when standards slip on hospital wards. Many simply don't know how to make a complaint, others are actually scared of the consequences. Yet we often hear complaints referred to as 'gold dust' by hospital bosses in terms of improving services. You would think then that health and care organisations would be eager to hear from anyone who wanted to report a concern or complaint. However, our research suggests that tens of thousands of incidents are slipping under the radar because those who witness poor care and try to report it are being told, in one particular case, to \\"mind their own business\\". 'Civic-minded individuals' Responding to a Freedom of Information request, a third of hospitals across England told us that they don't record complaints from \\"third parties\\", ie those that witness rather than personally experiencing poor care. Many of the hospital trusts that replied incorrectly stated that such complaints cannot be investigated without the permission of the patient. Others said they record such incidents as informal feedback only, with no follow-up provided to the courageous and civic minded individuals complaining on behalf of vulnerable patients. In the worst cases some hospitals just flat out said they don't record these complaints. Even where these reports are recorded, they are often not included in formal stats allowing hospitals so their complaints data doesn't tell the true story. For me this is symptomatic of a much bigger problem around complaints handling in the NHS and social care services. The fact that doctors and nurses would rather tell one of these \\"citizen whistleblowers\\" they can't complain because they don't tick the right box or have the permission to make a complaint is just wrong. If a passer-by reports an abandoned bag in an airport, the staff don't say: \\"I'm sorry sir, but do you have the permission of the bag owner.\\" Rather they are thanked for their vigilance. If the policy makers and politicians are serious about driving culture change in the NHS then more needs to be done to wipe out this 'compute says no' attitude and encourage staff to welcome feedback - positive and negative. 'Long hard look' With the secretary of state for health's update on progress against the recommendations of the Francis inquiry expected in the next few weeks, I implore him to take a long hard look at the complaints question. In our report, 'Suffering in Silence', we set out a vision for streamlining and refocusing the complaints system around what people want. Firstly, the system needs to make it easier for people to complain, including institutions understanding that everyone, including third parties, has the right to raise concerns. Secondly, every case should be dealt with compassionately, with a speedy, personalised response that actually addresses the poor experience and includes an outline of what happens next. Lastly, those who fail to up their game must be held to account by being put into \\"special measures\\" by the regulators, issued with financial penalties and ultimately being shut down and replaced. In short, it's time for the health and social care sector to get serious about complaints, and stop finding loopholes to avoid having to face up to their mistakes.","completion":"Part #1: Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Cynthia asked Lindsey to instruct them how to use sign language, because","completion":"Cynthia asked Lindsey to instruct them how to use sign language, because she believed that learning this valuable method of communication would not only enable them to engage with the Deaf community, but also provide them with a deeper understanding of language and communication as a whole, fostering empathy, awareness, and inclusivity among their friends, family, and colleagues. Sign language, as an alternate means of communication, has tremendous importance for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, especially when it comes to interacting with others and ensuring their needs are met. By taking the time to learn sign language, Cynthia, as well as others who would be instructed by Lindsey, hoped to bridge the gap that often exists between these two communities and create a more inclusive and comfortable environment for everyone involved. In addition to providing valuable communication skills, learning sign language benefits those who take up the challenge in several other ways. For one, it appeals to kinesthetic and visual learners who might find learning through the spoken word to be challenging, offering them the chance to hone their skills in a different way. Additionally, it deepens their appreciation of non-verbal communication, allowing them to understand and express themselves in ways that words cannot always capture. Moreover, the process of learning to sign helps individuals become better listeners and observers, as it requires a high degree of patience, focus, and attention to detail. It also has practical applications outside of the deaf community. For example, sign language can be utilized in noisy, crowded, or otherwise challenging environments where verbal communication might be difficult or impossible. In this way, sign language offers practical benefits beyond its initial purpose. Furthermore, learning sign language fosters a sense of empathy and understanding. By investing the time and effort to learn this method of communication, individuals show respect and support for the deaf and hard of hearing communities. This open-mindedness can lead to stronger friendships, better professional relationships, and a broader worldview – all of which contribute to the greater social good. With these goals in mind, Cynthia's request to learn sign language from Lindsey served as a responsible and commendable decision. It demonstrated their willingness to expand their horizons, engage with others in a meaningful manner, and foster a more inclusive and well-rounded community in which everyone – regardless of their hearing ability – has the chance to be heard and understood. In the end, this investment into sign language instruction would have a lasting impact on Cynthia and those taught by Lindsey, as they collectively achieved a greater level of empathy, communication, and connectedness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Privilege can be a dangerous thing. It releases you from the task of thinking about things that others must. I am an African-American male and I am privileged. Not on race; but on gender, education, religion, income and many other areas. As a man, my authority and intellect are not second-guessed. As a Christian, my moral code is not questioned, nor am I subject to post-September 11 profiling. I have privilege in these areas, and I realize that this privilege creates blind spots. An advantage to any group creates a corresponding disadvantage to all others. Recently Attorney General Eric Holder made some statements concerning America's need to confront its racial history, and the need for Americans to engage in cross-racial dialogue. Holder's comments offended some and motivated others, not uncommon when dealing with the touchy issue of race. On confronting our history he said:. \\"To get to the heart of this country, one must examine its racial soul. ... in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards. \\" Concerning cross-racial dialogue he opined: \\"If we are to make progress in this area, we must ... have frank conversations about the racial matters that continue to divide us.\\" In a recent interview, President Obama responded by saying, America has made \\"enormous progress, and we shouldn't lose sight of that ... I think it's fair to say that if I had been advising my attorney general, we would have used different language.\\" The president went on to say, \\"I think what solves racial tensions is fixing the economy, putting people to work, making sure people have health care, ensuring that every kid is learning out here.\\" They were both right; but they were addressing two different things. Obama was talking about fixing the economy to ease racial tensions. Holder was talking about overcoming our fears to dialogue and confronting racial privilege so that we can eliminate inequities that cause the racial tensions. Additionally, Holder was not saying that progress had not been made. He was saying that there is much yet to be done in order to fully engage and leverage the abilities of all of the nation's human capital. Elaborating on history, we must acknowledge that whites have been the benefactors of centuries of history that included half-truths that socially affirmed them to the detriment of all others. Addressing this privilege will take extreme courage, for there will be many loud dissenting voices. For example, there has never been a discussion in America about whether we should or should not celebrate a White History Month. That would be an irrelevant waste of time, because white history has been the basis of practically all that we have been taught. Being able to sit in a classroom and open history books that positively portray a plethora of people that resemble you has been, and continues to be, the exclusive historical privilege of whites. This privilege psychologically and economically benefits every member at every level of the advantaged category so profoundly that its members never have to question their place in society. And that place is on top: the expected and accepted norm. If you are white, consider how different life might be for you now if you had grown up from meager beginnings, while simultaneously being denigrated by a society that had denied equal access to you, your parents and every member of your race during every prior generation. This is the history of black America that Holder is saying we must understand to truly know the heart of America. History is history, and these are the facts. When we choose to exclude vital portions of history, we are no longer teaching history; we're teaching ideology. And if you're a person of color, you're excluded. The classroom experience for those who are not white tends to fit the following quote by poet Adrienne Rich: \\"When someone with the authority of a teacher, say, describes the world -- and you are not in it -- there is a moment of psychic disequilibrium, as if you looked into a mirror and saw nothing.\\" It's impossible to grasp the true significance of any groups' contributions when they are taken out of context, and told as a separate story during some isolated month. It's like reading a great novel and leaving out chapters. What's missing is what the late Paul Harvey would have called \\"the rest of the story.\\" George Washington Carver, a black man, had many breakthrough inventions utilizing the peanut. His contributions could sound insignificant until put into context. The south, as a region, made its money through agriculture, primarily cotton. Poor crop management practices eventually damaged the soil throughout the south until it was almost impossible to successfully grow cotton anywhere in the region. The south needed a new cash crop -- then came the peanut. George Washington Carver revitalized the agricultural south; thus the financial south. He saved the south. But because we tell his story out of context, no one understands the significance of his contributions. Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, which was a tremendous invention. However its paper filament was only operable for short periods of time, until a black man named Lewis Latimer contributed his invention, the carbon filament, to the project, making possible the widespread use of electric light. Had there been no Latimer, there would not have been a successful Edison. But most history books have no mention of Latimer. Textbooks currently teach that our great nation became a democracy in 1776. Great nation, strong republic, yes! Democracy, no. The very foundation upon which democracy was built demanded that the political leadership be selected for the people, by a vote of the people. To deny this right to millions of our citizenry for no legitimate reason was to abort democracy before it was born. The uncomfortable and blunt truth is, the United States did not legitimately become a democracy until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 made it law that no citizen could be denied the right to vote based on their race. Until we as Americans change course, grow a spine, teach true history that is inclusive of all races and replace these fallacies and half-truths with reputably documented facts, our citizenry will continue to be relegated to racially segmented ideology instead of history. We are a great democracy, and thus ready for honest dialogue. The time is now, and this discussion must go beyond black and white. It must be inclusive of Arabs, Asians, Latinos and others. It must also go both ways. People of color cannot only talk. We must also listen. All parties must be willing to be critiqued as well as offer criticism. As Holder said, this will be uncomfortable, but \\"this way we can hasten the day when we would truly become one America.\\" It's unusual when someone who is out of the norm makes his or her way into the seat of privilege, because those with whom you now share this privilege do not expect you to speak for those who do not.

NME's Keith Altham said it is \\"a brave effort by Hendrix to produce a musical form which is original and exciting\\". However, not all contemporary writers gave the LP a favorable review; in November 1967, Rolling Stone's Jon Landau wrote that although he considered Hendrix a \\"great guitarist and a brilliant arranger\\", he disapproved of his singing and songwriting. He criticized the quality of the material and described the lyrics as inane: \\"Above all this record is unrelentingly violent, and lyrically, inartistically violent at that.\\"Many music critics have since named Are You Experienced as one of the greatest rock and roll debut albums.

PUBLISHED:. 05:58 EST, 7 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 18:31 EST, 7 November 2012. The new breast-checking glove is said to be as effective as traditional breast cancer screening in detecting lumps. Women are being warned not to rely on a £25 glove claimed to be as effective as a mammogram at detecting signs of breast cancer. The manufacturers of the BE gLOVE say it makes detecting lumps much easier during self-examination because it increases finger sensitivity. But breast cancer charities are telling women not to put their faith in the product, saying evidence of its effectiveness is limited. The warning comes only weeks after an advertising watchdog criticised an £86 ‘breast torch’ that manufacturers said could act as an ‘early breast-screening device’. The glove is being publicised in the UK after clinical tests in Italy showed it allowed women to detect the same number of lumps as a mammogram. Its manufacturer, IC Pharma, says the ultra-thin polyurethane glove magnifies finger sensitivity 15 times, making it easier for women to feel hard areas in their breasts. But Mia Rosenblatt, of Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘Evidence that devices of this nature can improve detection of breast tumours is very limited, so we urge women not to use tools such as the BE gLOVE as a substitute for mammograms or for being breast-aware. ‘We encourage all women to check their breasts regularly, know what is normal for them and discuss any concerns with their GP.’ Sally Greenbrook, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘It is important that women are not misled when it comes to checking their breasts. We do not advocate the use of these gloves and we would like to reassure women that there is no need to spend money on products like these. The best way for women to be breast- aware is to know their own breasts.’ The BE gLOVE is said to work by reducing friction on the skin, stopping lumps being pushed away by the fingers. A clinical study by Professor Stafano Varardi, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at the University of Rome, compared women doing self-examinations with their bare hands with those using the glove. The company behind the glove says it could help the millions of UK women who have no idea how to perform breast self-examination. Those given the glove detected the. same number of lumps as were identified by mammography, according to IC. Pharma. Women using their bare hands found only 50 per cent of the lumps. revealed by breast screening. Official guidelines advise women to. carry out breast self-examinations each month, but a survey by IC Pharma. showed most check themselves only two to three times a year, and 55 per. cent did not know the right way to look for lumps. Company spokesman Karen Winterhalter said: ‘At the age when women should include breast self-examinations as an essential part of their routine in taking care of their health, it is staggering to see that 55 per cent do not know what they are doing. ‘Whilst we know that nine out of ten lumps found in the breast are not cancerous, it is extremely important for women to check their breasts regularly, so it becomes part of their routine.’ Last month the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that marketing of the Breastlight torch device was ‘misleading’ and ‘irresponsible’. Cancer charities said they feared women were using the torches as a substitute for breast screening and getting ‘false reassurance’. Everyone’s breasts are different,. altering with age and at different times of the month. Look for. changes that are unusual for you, such as:. • Lumps or thickening of breast tissue• Continuous pain• One breast becoming larger or lower• Puckering or dimpling of the skin• Nipples becoming inverted (turned in), changing shape or position• Developing a rash, crusting or producing discharge from the nipples• Swelling under the armpit or around the collarbone• Continuous pain in the armpits.

Suck them up into a particular type of air sprayer.; (ii). Suck them up into a particular type of vacuum.;","completion":"To accomplish the goal of moving (removing) bees without killing them, your best option would be to: (ii). Suck them up into a particular type of vacuum. However, it is crucial to specify that the vacuum in question should be a specially designed bee vacuum that ensures the bees are not harmed during the process. Bee vacuums are designed to safely collect bees from unwanted locations and transport them to a more suitable environment. Here's a detailed breakdown of accomplishing this goal: 1. Appropriate Equipment: Start by obtaining a specially designed bee vacuum. Bee vacuums are created to have a gentler suction power compared to regular vacuums, ensuring that the bees stay alive during the process. These vacuums come with a vacuum head, a hose, and a collection chamber. 2. Protective Gear: Wear protective clothing to prevent bee stings. This includes a bee suit, gloves, boots, and a veil that covers the face and neck. 3. Plan and Prepare: Locate the bees' hive or nest and determine the best course of action to safely remove the bees. Ensure you are aware of any potential dangers or difficulties, such as working at a height, and prepare accordingly. 4. Set up the Bee Vacuum: Assemble the bee vacuum as per the manufacturer's instructions and ensure the collection chamber is clean. Adjust the vacuum suction pressure so it is strong enough to lift bees but not kill them during the process. It is important to experiment with a few bees to determine the right suction power before attempting to vacuum the entire colony. 5. Smoke the Bees: Use a bee smoker to calm the bees before starting the vacuuming process. Puff some smoke around the hive, especially the entrance, to subdue the bees and make them less likely to sting during the removal process. 6. Vacuum the Bees: Carefully use the bee vacuum's hose to suck up the bees from the hive or nest. Ensure the suction pressure is set to the appropriate level, so as not to harm the bees. Proceed slowly and methodically to minimize any harm or disturbance to the colony. Be meticulous about collecting the bees on every comb and in the hive itself in order to successfully relocate the entire colony. 7. Collect the Honeycomb: Once all the bees have been vacuumed, collect the honeycomb and any remaining bee larvae from the hive or nest. The honeycomb will serve as a food source and the foundation for the bees to rebuild their hive once they are transported to their new location. 8. Transport the Bees: With the bees safely contained within the vacuum collection chamber, securely transport the vacuum, honeycomb, and remaining larvae to their new location. 9. Release and Re-home the Bees: Set up the new hive or nesting area for the bees at the new location. Gently release the bees from the vacuum's collection chamber and ensure their honeycomb and larvae are placed inside. The bees will immediately start working on rebuilding their colony and producing honey. 10. Monitor the New Site: Keep an eye on the bees' new location for a few days to ensure that they have successfully adapted to their environment and are building a healthy colony. By using a specially designed bee vacuum and following these steps, you can safely remove bees from their current location and relocate them to a more suitable environment without killing them. This method promotes bee population sustainability and helps protect these vital pollinators."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the persont that painted Charles IV of Spain and His Family? In 1692, the Neapolitan painter Luca Giordano became one of the few allowed to view paintings held in Philip IV's private apartments, and was greatly impressed by Las Meninas. Giordano described the work as the \\"theology of painting\\", and was inspired to paint A Homage to Velázquez (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as Las Meninas.An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink. Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas. Francisco Goya etched a print of Las Meninas in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his Charles IV of Spain and His Family. As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of Las Meninas with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of \\"imminent suffocation\\".

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"Orientalist scholars of the 18th century like Sir William Jones marked a wave of enthusiasm for Indian culture and for Sanskrit. According to Thomas Trautmann, after this period of \\"Indomania\\", a certain hostility to Sanskrit and to Indian culture in general began to assert itself in early 19th century Britain, manifested by a neglect of Sanskrit in British academia. This was the beginning of a general push in favor of the idea that India should be culturally, religiously and linguistically assimilated to Britain as far as possible. Trautmann considers two separate and logically opposite sources for the growing hostility: one was \\"British Indophobia\\", which he calls essentially a developmentalist, progressivist, liberal, and non-racial-essentialist critique of Hindu civilisation as an aid for the improvement of India along European lines; the other was scientific racism, a theory of the English \\"common-sense view\\" that Indians constituted a \\"separate, inferior and unimprovable race\\".\\", answer the following question.

Movie title: Run Lola Run Context: Introduction[edit] Lola (Franka Potente) receives a frantic phone call from her boyfriend, Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu). Manni is a small-time criminal who has just collected 100,000 marks cash in his most recent crime. Lola had agreed to meet Manni at the crime scene and to drive him to deliver the money to his boss, Ronnie. Lola tried to do so, but her moped was stolen en route to meet Manni. When Lola failed to arrive on time, Manni, carrying the cash in a bag, took a subway train. Manni panicked when he saw ticket inspectors in his car. He fled and thoughtlessly left the bag of money on the subway because he does not have a subway ticket. As he does, Manni spotted a homeless man examining Manni's money bag in the subway car. Manni, realizing what he had done, pursued the train as it departed, only to find the man and the money gone. Manni calls Lola from a phone booth. He complains that Lola let him down. He tells Lola that unless he raises 100,000 marks to give Ronnie within 20 minutes, Ronnie will kill him. Manni also tells Lola of his plan to rob a nearby supermarketâwhich for several obvious reasons is unwise. Lola implores Manni to wait and promises to find the money. She decides to ask her father (Herbert Knaup), who is a bank manager, for help. After this telephone call, the rest of the film is divided into three \\"runs\\" by Lola, in each of which she tries to obtain the money and save Manni. Each run starts from the same situation, but develops differently and has a different outcome.

The moment I walked in, the air smelled like a big, delicious cupcake! Everyone working there was smiling and so kind, just like how your favorite toy always makes you feel happy. I was feeling adventurous, so I tried their Magical Unicorn ice cream that had sparkly, colorful sugar crystals on it. It tasted like I was eating rainbows and sunshine, and I was as happy as if your favorite cartoon character came to life and was my best friend. Plus, the ice cream shop had a funny little mascot, a dancing ice cream cone, that made me laugh so hard. And the best part? They had a play area where kids can have fun while enjoying their magical ice cream treat. I give this wonderful ice cream shop a big 5-stars, and I can't wait to take you there so we can try all the sweet goodies they have. And remember, sharing is caring, so don't forget to share your ice cream with your friends and family! The end. 😊🍦✨\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.
