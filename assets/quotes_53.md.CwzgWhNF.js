Title: The Devils Nightmare Movie plot: In the 12th century, Sigfried von Rhoneberg signed a pact with the Devil. Along with Rhoneberg's soul, Satan demanded that the eldest daughter of each generation serve him as a succubus. For this reason, the current Baron von Rhoneberg [Jean Servais] killed his firstborn daughter in hopes of stopping the curse. Unknown by the baron, however, his dead brother Rudolph also fathered a daughter with the maid.A tourbus of six [each representing a Deadly Sin]-- seminarian Albin Corvelle [Lorenzo Terson?], rich Mr [?] and Mrs [Colette Emmanuelle] Foster, cynical old Mr Mason [Lucien Raimbourg?], and two pretty girls, Regine [Shirley Corrigan] and Corinne [Ivana Novak] -- plus the ever-hungry tourguide Matt Ducard [Christian Maillet?] are forced to take refuge at the Rhoneberg castle after the road is blocked and a storm threatens. The are joined shortly after arrival by the maid's beautiful and lascivious daughter, Lisa Muller [Erika Blanc]. During the long night, Lisa leads all the tourists one by one to their deaths. Gluttony Matt Ducard chokes on a glass of wine, greedy Mrs Foster falls into a quicksand of gold, Mr Foster (envy?) is guillotined, promiscuous Corinne is impaled in an iron maiden, a snake gets slothful Regine, and Lisa pushes cynical Mr Mason from a tower window to be impaled below on a wrought iron fence. Only the seminarian, Albin Sorelle, seems immune to Lisa's seductive charms. When all six tourists are dead, Satan [Daniel Emilfork] calls on Albin. In his prideful belief that he can outwit anyone in a game of chess, Albin makes a deal with Satan--he offers his soul if Satan will return the dead tourists to life. Satan agrees. The next morning, everyone wakes up as though nothing happened. Even Albin remembers it only as a dream.Unfortunately, the baron is wounded that morning in a fencing accident with Hans the butler [Jacques Monseau]. Albin chooses to remain at the castle while the tourists go on. As Albin and Lisa watch the tourbus heading back to the main road, the bus suddenly swerves to...

Context: Antibacterial-resistant strains and species, sometimes referred to as \\"superbugs\\", now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were for a while well controlled. For example, emergent bacterial strains causing tuberculosis (TB) that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide. For example, NDM-1 is a newly identified enzyme conveying bacterial resistance to a broad range of beta-lactam antibacterials.

Context: Idris' government was increasingly unpopular by the latter 1960s; it had exacerbated Libya's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising the country's federal system in order to take advantage of the country's oil wealth, while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry. Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; allied to the western powers, Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli. Anti-western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt. By 1969, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was expecting segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup.

Movie title: Vantage Point Movie plot: U.S. President Henry Ashton (Hurt) attends a political summit in Salamanca, Spain, to promote an international treaty. Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

Write an article based on this summary: – As the world comes to terms with the sudden and incredibly unusual resignation of the papacy by Pope Benedict XVI, the general consensus appears to be that Joseph Ratzinger was a scholarly, introverted conservative who will ultimately be remembered most for the controversies that surrounded him. Among the opinions: Despite trying twice, Benedict was never able to tame the wild and Byzantine Vatican bureaucracy. \\"The pope's failure to establish a grip on the Curia was to cost him dear, all the more because he showed a marked reluctance to consult others,\\" writes John Hooper in the Guardian, noting the Church bureaucracy is actually larger and more complex than it was at the start of his tenure. Another failed goal: \\"to launch the re-evangelization of Europe\\"; instead, sex-abuse scandals overtook the continent. After the charismatic, 26-year reign of John Paul II, Benedict \\"never had a chance,\\" writes John Moody for Fox News. In contrast to John Paul II's popular brilliance and willingness to show off, \\"Benedict’s meek initial outings were public relations meltdowns.\\" Other goals for the Church—to \\"expand its foothold in Asia, cement its dominance in Latin America, or make serious inroads in Africa\\"—went unachieved. But Moody adds that Benedict's willingness to resign shows both bravery and humility. \\"For that he should be remembered.\\" Actually, Benedict could end up with a legacy of dealing with the secular world in \\"a remarkably liberal, if agonizingly slow, way,\\" writes Martin Baccardax for the International Business Times. He notes that Benedict made the first, tentative steps toward changing the Church's views of contraception and criticized the Church's response to its global child abuse scandal. (Hooper agrees that Benedict's remarks on condoms \\"could yet turn out to have been the most significant initiative of [his] papacy.\\") But others aren't so willing to give Benedict credit in those areas. The resignation presents a chance for the Church to \\"deal with sex-abuse victims more honestly, and to wake up and listen to the parishioners who have been widely ignoring Church teaching for decades,\\" writes Michael Tomasky in the Daily Beast. \\"But I would imagine it's an opportunity the Church won't take.\\" Click to see a list of five names being floated as the potential next pope. Article:","completion":"Title: The Unusual Resignation of Pope Benedict XVI: Legacy of Controversies and Unachieved Goals The sudden and unexpected resignation of Pope Benedict XVI continues to unsettle the world as we attempt to come to terms with his decision and the legacy he leaves behind. Described as a scholarly, introverted conservative, Joseph Ratzinger’s tenure as Pope was marked by controversies, some of which overshadowed his goals for the Catholic Church. One significant criticism is Pope Benedict XVI's inability to establish control over the Vatican bureaucracy, despite two attempts. As noted by John Hooper in the Guardian, this failure was costly, particularly since he was averse to consulting with others. At the end of his tenure, the bureaucracy had grown larger and more complex than before, leading to further mismanagement and difficulties. Another unachieved goal was the effort to re-evangelize Europe. Instead, sex-abuse scandals on the continent overshadowed and impeded progress in the Church. Pope Benedict XVI had the unenviable task of following John Paul II, whose popular and charismatic 26-year reign contrasted sharply with the new pontiff's more humble demeanor. As John Moody wrote for Fox News, Benedict “never had a chance.” In terms of expanding the Church’s presence in Asia, consolidating dominance in Latin America, or making significant inroads in Africa, progress again fell short. However, Moody adds that Benedict's courage to resign exhibited both bravery and humility, which should be remembrance-worthy. An interesting point by Martin Baccardax in the International Business Times is that Benedict's legacy might be defined by his slow but liberal approach to addressing secular issues. The Pope took tentative steps towards changing the Church's stance on contraception and criticized its response to the global child-abuse scandal. Hooper also remarks that Benedict's comments on condoms could be \\"the most significant initiative of [his] papacy.\\" Despite these attempts, some are not convinced that Pope Benedict XVI deserves credit in those areas. The Pope's resignation has provided the Church with an opportunity to address sex-abuse victims more honestly and acknowledge parishioners' perspectives. However, Michael Tomasky in the Daily Beast remains skeptical that the Church will seize this chance. As Benedict's papacy ends, his legacy is marked by controversies and unachieved goals. His resignation offers the Catholic Church a potential turning point, presenting the institution with the challenge of addressing pressing issues and evolving for the better. All eyes are now turned to the Vatican, as discussions of potential candidates for the next Pope ensue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Investments in transportation, for example, include the development and improvement of roads, bridges, ports, airports, and transit systems. These investments immediately create jobs in sectors like construction, engineering, planning, and management, among others. Furthermore, improved transportation networks provide greater access to markets, improve the flow of goods and services, and make it easier for people to travel to work or to find jobs in other regions. Similarly, investments in energy networks, such as renewable energy plants, the electrical grid, or natural gas pipelines, can also create jobs in their construction and operation. When you consider the additional employment created in support industries and the multiplier effect on the wider economy, the job creation potential is considerable. Moreover, they ensure the availability of reliable and sustainable power supplies, which is a critical element of any thriving economy. By nurturing entrepreneurship, these investments can also stimulate innovative businesses, bring about economic diversification, and play a significant role in regional development. Entrepreneurs will find opportunities to start and grow businesses in areas like logistics, tourism, or local trade, resulting in more job creation and socio-economic growth. In sum, investments in transportation and energy networks do much more than create jobs immediately; they lay the groundwork for long-term economic resilience and growth, particularly in regions that would otherwise be left behind. By connecting villages to cities, they can bring about equitable development, mitigating regional disparities, promoting social inclusion, and enhancing the quality of life in these remote or underdeveloped regions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In October 1992, an elite group of North Korean soldiers are put through a brutal training regime. Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years. Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Hyun symbolically gives Yu a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance. Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a 200mL worth of CTX has a 1Â km blast radius. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee. Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them.

These changes are taken into consideration in vaccine development. Many infectious diseases, such as smallpox, polio, diphtheria, and tetanus, were conquered by the use of vaccines. Immunologists are the physicians and scientists who research and develop vaccines, as well as treat and study allergies or other immune problems. Some immunologists study and treat autoimmune problems (diseases in which a person’s immune system attacks his or her own cells or tissues, such as lupus) and immunodeficiencies, whether acquired (such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS) or hereditary (such as severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID). Immunologists are called in to help treat organ transplantation patients, who must have their immune systems suppressed so that their bodies will not reject a transplanted organ. Some immunologists work to understand natural immunity and the effects of a person’s environment on it. Others work on questions about how the immune system affects diseases such as cancer. In the past, the importance of having a healthy immune system in preventing cancer was not at all understood. To work as an immunologist, a PhD or MD is required. In addition, immunologists undertake at least 2–3 years of training in an accredited program and must pass an examination given by the American Board of Allergy and Immunology.

Those who only remember the late Sir Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a professional raconteur would do well to seek out this charming piece of late '60s satire. Ustinov stars as a convicted embezzler (we first see him during his last day in gaol where he is preparing the prison governor's tax return) who, sensing that the future is in computers, poses (by means of a deft piece of identity theft) as a computer expert and sets out to infiltrate an American multinational. Ustinov (who co-wrote the script) is on top form, as is the delightful Maggie Smith, here unusually cast as an accident-prone cockney-sparrow dolly bird. Bob Newhart also puts in an amusing performance as a suspicious executive who has designs on Maggie Smith. In addition, Karl Malden is satisfyingly sleazy as Ustinov and Newhart's womanising boss. What do I particularly like about this film? Not only is it a well-thought-out 'caper movie' but it's also a touching little love story; Ustinov and Smith are very convincing as the two misfits stumbling into love (the whole scene involving the deck of cards is particularly effective.) So, what is there not to like? Well, the script is no more computer-literate than most films (that is, hardly at all) even though it captures the feel of late '60s 'big iron' business computing quite well. Also there are a couple of small plot glitches that you're not likely to notice until the second or third viewing, but I consider these to be minor niggles.

Veteran journalist Mark Halperin sexually harassed women while he was in a powerful position at ABC News, according to five women who shared their previously undisclosed accounts with CNN and others who did not experience the alleged harassment personally, but were aware of it. \\"During this period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me,\\" Halperin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday night. \\"I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain. For that, I am deeply sorry and I apologize. Under the circumstances, I'm going to take a step back from my day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation.\\" MSNBC, where Halperin makes frequent appearances on \\"Morning Joe,\\" said early Thursday that Halperin would leave his roles at that network and as an analyst at NBC News. \\"We find the story and the allegations very troubling,\\" MSNBC said in a statement. \\"Mark Halperin is leaving his role as a contributor until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood.\\" Widely considered to be one of the preeminent political journalists, Halperin, 52, has, among other career highlights, been political director at ABC News; co-authored the bestselling book \\"Game Change,\\" which was made into an HBO movie starring Julianne Moore as Sarah Palin; and anchored a television show on Bloomberg TV. He is featured in Showtime's \\"The Circus,\\" a show that chronicled the 2016 campaign cycle and the early days of the Trump presidency, and has a project in development with HBO, which, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner. But women who spoke to CNN say he also had a dark side not made public until now. The stories of harassment shared with CNN range in nature from propositioning employees for sex to kissing and grabbing one's breasts against her will. Three of the women who spoke to CNN described Halperin as, without consent, pressing an erection against their bodies while he was clothed. Halperin denies grabbing a woman's breasts and pressing his genitals against the three women. Related: The (incomplete) list of powerful men accused of sexual harassment after Harvey Weinstein The women who worked with Halperin and who spoke with CNN did not report to Halperin. However, Halperin made many decisions about political coverage at ABC News, and had a voice in some critical personnel decisions. None of the women have said, though, that he ever promised anything in exchange for sex, or suggested that he would retaliate against anyone. Still, while they no longer work with him, Halperin continues to wield influence in politics and media. The women who spoke to CNN said it was for this reason that they shared their accounts on the condition of anonymity. Others also said they still feel embarrassed about what happened to them and did not want to be publicly associated with it. \\"Mark left ABC News over a decade ago, and no complaints were filed during his tenure,\\" ABC News said in a statement provided to CNN after this article was published. The first woman told CNN she was invited to visit his office in the early 2000s, when he was political director at ABC News, to have a soda, and said that while she was there with him he forcibly kissed her and pressed his genitals against her body. \\"I went up to have a soda and talk and -- he just kissed me and grabbed my boobs,\\" the woman said. \\"I just froze. I didn't know what to do.\\" When she did make her way out of his office, the woman told a friend at ABC News what had happened. That friend told CNN she remembered the woman telling her about the incident and seeing her visibly shaken. The second woman, another former ABC News employee, described a similar experience in his office during the 2004 campaign cycle. This woman said she was around 25 years old then, and wanted to be a \\"campaign off-air\\" -- ABC News' term for one of the reporters who travel embedded with presidential campaigns -- so she reached out to Halperin, who was a part of the decision-making process regarding those assignments at the time. \\"The first meeting I ever had with him was in his office and he just came up from behind -- I was sitting in a chair from across his desk -- and he came up behind me and [while he was clothed] he pressed his body on mine, his penis, on my shoulder,\\" this woman told CNN. \\"I was obviously completely shocked. I can't even remember how I got out of there -- [but] I got out of there and was freaked out by that whole experience. Given I was so young and new I wasn't sure if that was the sort of thing that was expected of you if you wanted something from a male figure in news.\\" The woman said Halperin continued to express a sexual desire for her in subsequent visits, despite being rebuffed. \\"It was more like him coming up too close to me and sort of along the lines of hugging me,\\" she explained. She also alleged that Halperin propositioned her for sex on the campaign trail. \\"He would say, 'Why don't you meet me upstairs?' And I would say, 'That's not a good idea.' And he would push the request further,\\" the person said. \\"Eventually I would just ignore him and go about my business.\\" One of the woman's friends has told CNN that the woman told her about the first incident, in Halperin's office. She said her friend had told her some time after the incident that Halperin had pressed his genitals against her while she was seated in his office, but did not recall being told about unwanted touching during subsequent visits or the alleged propositions for sex. A third woman, also a former ABC News employee, told CNN she was on the road with Halperin when he propositioned her. \\"I excused myself to go to the bathroom and he was standing there when I opened the door propositioning [me] to go into the other bathroom to do something,\\" she said. \\"It freaked me out. I came out of the ladies' room and he was just standing there. Like almost blocking the door.\\" A fourth woman who worked with Halperin and was junior to him told CNN he once asked her late at night on the campaign trail to go up to his hotel room with him, and that she believed him to be propositioning her. She declined. The fifth woman who spoke to CNN was not an ABC News employee at the time of the incident she alleges. She was not comfortable sharing specifics of her story for publication, but said Halperin, while clothed, placed his erect penis against her body without consent. The women who spoke to CNN said that they did not report Halperin's behavior to management either because they feared retribution, given the level of power Halperin had at ABC and in the industry, or because they were embarrassed. In some cases, their fear of him and the sway he holds remains to this day. The woman in the first account, however, said she told a mentor at ABC News who said he wanted to escalate the issue to management. It is unclear if that ever occurred. CNN's investigation found that Halperin allegedly exhibited this type of behavior from the 1990s to the mid-2000s. CNN has not learned of any incidents after Halperin left ABC News. Halperin joined ABC News in the late 1980s. In 1997 Halperin was named political director of ABC News, and rose to prominence with the advent of The Note, a morning digest newsletter previewing the day in politics. The Note became a must-read for industry professionals, and it catapulted him to the upper echelons of the political scene. Halperin left ABC News in 2007 for Time magazine and joined Bloomberg in 2014 for a reported salary of 1 million. At Bloomberg, he co-anchored \\"With All Due Respect\\" with journalist John Heilemann. The show was simulcast on MSNBC for a period. Related: Mark Halperin leaves Bloomberg Halperin also found great success writing books. In 2010, he co-authored \\"Game Change\\" with Heilemann. The duo later published \\"Double Down: Game Change 2012,\\" reportedly receiving a multi-million dollar advance. Halperin and Heilemann are currently working on a third installment about the 2016 election. \\"For the last 11 years, I have had to watch this guy find success in every other news organization,\\" one of the women who said she experienced harassment told CNN. The allegations against Halperin come weeks after Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was first publicly accused of sexual harassment and assault -- allegations that have prompted multiple police departments to launch investigations, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts to expel him, and his firing from the company he co-founded. (Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual acts.) While the allegations against Halperin do not mirror the allegations against Weinstein, the fact that the women who spoke with CNN have chosen to do so now does reflect the larger discussion in entertainment, media, politics and other industries since the Weinstein scandal began. Women -- and men -- are talking about things that have long been rumored but have never been brought to light. Some people are feeling emboldened to tell those stories now. Others are looking back and regretting the things they didn't do. One person who formerly worked with Halperin told CNN that while they were not aware of the extent of the alleged harassment, they believe they had heard enough to warrant reporting the whispers to management. \\"In retrospect, I was such a coward,\\" the person said. \\"I wish I said something. I wish I had done something.\\" ||||| Mark Halperin, a senior political analyst and frequent contributor for NBC News and MSNBC, acknowledged Wednesday night that he had engaged in \\"inappropriate\\" behavior around women he worked with while he was at ABC News and said he would \\"take a step back from my day-to-day work.\\" Halperin apologized for having pursued \\"relationships with women that [he] worked with\\" in a statement to CNN, which quoted five anonymous women, four of them former ABC News employees, as saying Halperin sexually harassed them when he was a top political journalist at ABC News. \\"During this period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me,\\" Halperin told CNN. \\"I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain.

Write a summary based on this article: Twitter suspended the account of Guy Adams, a journalist and critic of NBC's Olympic coverage, for posting the corporate email of an NBC executive. (Twitter) Criticism of NBC's 2012 Olympics coverage has been rampant on Twitter since the Games' opening ceremony Friday, but Sunday evening, one of the biggest critics found his Twitter account suspended. Guy Adams, a journalist who's written about NBC's coverage, had been tweeting up a storm, which you can see here, presenting NBC in a bad manner. But the last straw finally came when Adams tweeted out the following: \\"The man responsible for NBC pretending the Olympics haven't started yet is Gary Zenkel. Tell him what u think! Email: Gary.zenkel@nbcuni.com\\" Adams was referring to Gary Zenkel, the president of NBC Olympics, and NBC wasn't having it. The company reported Adams' tweet, and some time later, Adams' account was suspended and has stayed down since. It's \\"quite worrying that NBC, whose parent company are an Olympic sponsor, are apparently trying (and, in this case, succeeding) in shutting down the Twitter accounts of journalists who are critical of their Olympic coverage,\\" Adams wrote to Twitter, according to a piece put online by the Independent on Monday. But while it can be easy to assume Twitter is just looking out for its Olympic partner, its Terms of Service arguably do appear to back up its actions. The company states online that \\"Posting another person’s private and confidential information is a violation of the Twitter Rules.\\" In another page, Twitter says \\"If the account is violating our policy, then you can file a report and we will investigate the account. If the account is in violation, we will suspend the account.\\" That all seems to support its action, but is a corporate email address considered private information? Well, on that first page, Twitter lists a couple of examples of private information, which include: credit card information social security or other national identity numbers addresses or locations that are considered and treated as private non-public, personal phone numbers non-public, personal email addresses There's no mention of corporate or professional emails, and Deadspin, which has been reporting the story, says the emails of NBC executives are easy to determine since they're all a basic \\"first.last@nbcuni.com\\" format. But in its Terms of Service, Twitter alludes that information is considered private if it isn't listed online, and from what I could find, Zenkel's email was not public prior to Monday. [Updated, 4:20 p.m. July 30: A reader pointed out this Web page dated June 2011 that lists Zenkel's email. It's not a prominent website, but it does list Zenkel's email, which now seems to tilt the argument Adams' way.] Twitter has declined to comment, saying its policy is not to comment about individual users. And I haven't been able to reach Adams for further comment on his part, but it may not be long before Adams' Twitter account is back up because Twitter has told him he simply needs to confirm that he has read and understands Twitter's policy. Regardless, Adams is right about his suspension being worrying. It's not that the suspension is all that bad. Twitter suspends accounts every day, but the fact that this suspension is more of a judgment call than an exact science is disturbing. Twitter and NBC are partners, and friends tend to watch each others' backs. So if you have been criticizing NBC and plan to continue doing so, it may be best to make sure you aren't violating Twitter's policies -- you don't want to find your account down the next time you try to log on.

UPDATED Twitter has suspended the account of a British journalist who tweeted the corporate email address of an NBC executive. The reporter, Guy Adams of the Independent, has been acerbic in his criticisms of NBC’s (awful) performance during the Olympics in London. Adams has posted his correspondence with Twitter, which claims he posted a private email address. It was nothing of the kind, as many including Deadspin have pointed out. (Here’s the policy, which Adams plainly did not violate, since the NBC executive’s email address was already easily discernible on the Web — NBC has a firstname.lastname@ system for its email, and it’s a corporate address, not a personal one — and was publicly published over a year ago.) What makes this a serious issue is that Twitter has partnered with NBC during the Olympics. And it was NBC’s complaint about Adams that led to the suspension. Twitter has been exemplary in its handling of many issues over the past several years, including its (for a social network) brave stance in protecting user privacy. So I’m giving the service the benefit of the doubt for the moment, and hoping that this is just a foolish — if well-meaning — mistake by a single quick-triggered Twitter employee. If so, Twitter should apologize and reinstate Adams’ account immediately. If it does so, there’s little harm done — and the company will have learned a lesson. If not, this is a defining moment for Twitter. It will have demonstrated that it can be bullied by its business partners into acts that damage its credibility and ultimately the reason so many of us use it as a platform. And if that’s the case, there will be much less incentive to use it.

Guy Adams, this newspaper's Los Angeles correspondent, was removed from the social networking site on the day that he wrote a news story detailing widespread public complaints about the network's coverage of the London Games. According to Twitter, he was suspended for a message posted during the Opening Ceremony, when NBC prevented viewers of America from watching live coverage, so that the network could screen the occasion during an evening prime-time slot coveted by advertisers. \\"The man responsible for NBC pretending the Olympics haven't started yet is Gary Zenkel,\\" wrote Mr Adams. \\"Tell him what * think!\\" His tweet then contained the work email address of Mr Zenkel, the President of NBC Olympics. Twitter claimed last night that the tweet breached its guidelines. \\"Your account has been suspended for posting an individual's private information such as private email address, physical address, telephone number, or financial documents,\\" the company informed Mr Adams. \\"It is a violation of the Twitter Rules.\\" In response, Mr Adams wrote: \\"I didn't publish a private email address, just a corporate one, which is widely available to anyone with access to Google and is identical to one that all of the tens of thousands of NBC Universal employees share. It's no more 'private' than the address I'm emailing you from right now. \\"Either way, [it's] quite worrying that NBC, whose parent company is an Olympic sponsor, is apparently trying (and, in this case, succeeding) in shutting down the Twitter accounts of journalists who are critical of their Olympic coverage.\\" News of the suspension sparked tens of thousands of angry messages on Twitter, including comments supportive of Mr Adams from BBC journalist Jeremy Vine, and Piers Morgan, the former editor of the Daily Mirror who now works for CNN. The novelist Irvine Welsh posted the the following comment online: \\"The Guy Adams twitter ban illustrates three tendencies of hegemonic power; 1) hates criticism, 2) takes itself seriously 3) no sense of fun,\\" tweeted. In a statement, NBC said: \\"We filed a complaint with Twitter because a user tweeted the personal information of one of our executives.\\" What exactly did Guy Adams have to say? Plenty. Here's a look at some of his tweets, all of which are now hidden, but have been preserved on Topsy: @guyadams Guy Adams Am I alone in wondering why NBColympics think its acceptable to pretend this road race is being broadcast live? 3 days ago @guyadams Guy Adams According to NBC's commentary team, the Surrey countryside is full of “chateaus” #ffs! @guyadams Guy Adams Matt Lauer: “Madagascar, a location indelibly associated with a couple of recent animated movies.” #tosspot @guyadams Guy Adams Matt Lauer would do well to shut up, wouldn't he? 3 days ago @guyadams Guy Adams Techcrunch call @NBColympics total buffoons http://t.co/1DYypK0T Sums up why Gary Zenkel, moronic exec behind the time delay, shd be fired @guyadams Guy Adams If only someone had invented a technology to help us actually see this.

Email: Gary.zenkel@nbcuni.com ||||| As athletes parade into London's Olympic Stadium this Friday, Twitter Inc.'s Olympic hopes will play out in a spartan office in Boulder, Colo. Twitter and NBC are forming a partnership for the Olympics, as the microblogging site hopes to use the Games as a way to build its following and prove itself as a money-making, sustainable business. Shara Tibken reports on digits. Photo: Getty Images. There, a handful of people will spend 20 hours a day to help corral millions of Twitter messages from Olympic athletes, their families, fans and NBC television personalities into a single page on Twitter.com. Enlarge Image Close Agence France-Presse/Getty Images The London Eye Ferris wheel will light up each night based on tweets. Twitter's Olympics hub, part of a partnership between the San Francisco company and Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal that will be announced as early as Monday, is one of the first times Twitter will serve as an official narrator for a live event. NBC will tout the website with on-air promotions and links to athlete interviews or video clips. With the partnership, Twitter hopes to use the Olympics as a launch pad into a more sustainable business. Twitter, which allows people to post 140-character messages called tweets, has built up more than 140 million monthly users and has become a go-to resource for people to find news or to gab about \\"American Idol.\\" But executives want the six-year-old service to find a larger audience, especially amid doubts about Twitter's ability to become a serious money maker. Research firm eMarketer Inc. estimates Twitter will generate 259.9 million from advertising this year—far less than Facebook Inc.'s 3.15 billion in 2011 revenue. Wider adoption can help Twitter expand its ad business, justify its 8.4 billion valuation and eventually pave the way for an initial public offering. As a result, Twitter's Olympics bet is crucial. \\"This is a way for new users to sample Twitter,\\" said Chloe Sladden, Twitter's vice president of media. NBC said no money is changing hands in its Twitter partnership and that it won't share in revenue from ads that Twitter is selling to Olympics sponsors for its Games website. Brands such as General Electric Co. and Procter & Gamble Co. already have bought ads on Twitter to promote their association with the Olympics.

P&G didn't return a request for comment. GE said it expects \\"the 2012 Games to be a pinnacle of social activity.\\" \\"There's no way of knowing exactly how much advertisers will spend on Twitter during the Olympics, but there is no doubt they will be jockeying for ad space during some of the key events of the Games, when traffic on Twitter will explode,\\" eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said. Twitter has prepared for the Games for months. The company has hosted dozens of sessions with athletes and national sports associations to pitch them on using its service. Twitter has courted companies to buy ads on Twitter to spread their Olympics marketing messages. The International Olympic Committee said well over 1,000 current and former Olympians are using Twitter or Facebook for the Games. Advertisers said Twitter has pushed itself to them as an effective marketing vehicle. Athletes and Olympics organizations said that ever since the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, there has been an explosion of athletes embracing Twitter to talk to fans and occasionally trash talk to rivals. During the Games, Twitter will use its Olympics events page to highlight insiders' views, and to encourage people to watch NBC's on-air and online coverage. Twitter will embed its own staffer with NBC's social media team in London to ensure fresh news, interviews and links to TV highlights will show up on Twitter. The Olympics \\"hashtag\\"—a way for Twitter to organize tweets about a single topic—will pop up on screen during television coverage, NBC said. Twitter will be visible offline as well, not just on TV or online. The London Eye, a giant Ferris wheel dominating the skyline, will light up each night based on the sentiment of Olympic tweets, although Twitter said that isn't part of its campaign. Some research shows social media is fueling viewership of live TV, as people want to interact over Kobe Bryant's dunk or Angelina Jolie's Oscar dress. Social-media analysis firm Trendrr said Twitter accounted for an average of three quarters of the \\"social activity\\" around broadcast TV programs in the first quarter of this year, vs. 16% for Facebook. For sports or other major televised events, Trendrr found Twitter has a near-lock on digital conversations. Twitter believes the Olympics partnership with NBC is a chance to cement that status. It means \\"Twitter is really where the party is,\\" Ms. Sladden said. Facebook, which has a similar events page launched in conjunction with NBC, isn't selling ads there tied to the Olympics. Facebook declined to comment. It is unclear if the interests of Twitter and NBC will always align during the Games. NBC plans to contain highlight clips and other Olympics video on its own websites and mobile applications, which won't necessarily appear on other digital services. Twitter also may tread on NBC's turf by essentially programming the Olympics on its events page. Twitter and NBC said they aren't in competition. NBC's Olympics president, Gary Zenkel, said Olympics coverage anywhere helps NBC by stoking viewer interest. \\"We're quite aware of and comfortable with the fact that [Twitter] is a place where news will surface, and in some cases the news will be made,\\" said Mr. Zenkel. \\"At the end of the day, the only place you can watch the Olympics—which is what people crave—is NBC.\\" Meanwhile, Ms. Sladden said she would be in Twitter's San Francisco headquarters during the Games, closely watching the coverage. \\"I'll be consuming tweets and tweeting—and maybe trying to get some work done,\\" Ms. Sladden said.

Obsession comes in many flavors, and exists for a variety of reasons; for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder, but for others it may be an avenue of survival. Lack of nurturing, combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements, may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone. And in extreme cases, the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession, driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing, and as we discover in \`The Luzhin Defence,' directed by Marleen Gorris, a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem, and in fact, may actually exacerbate the situation. Obsession, it seems, has no prejudice or preference; moreover, it gives no quarter. At an Italian resort in the 1920's, Alexander Luzhin (John Turturro) is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament, the winner of which will be the World Champion. Luzhin is a Master of the game, but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him; rather, it is his obsession, that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life, and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family. So Luzhin is a genius with an Achilles heel, a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands, and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament. That man is Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), Luzhin's former mentor, who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to Luzhin. Valentinov is an unwelcomed, disconcerting presence to Luzhin, and once again life threatens to overwhelm him. Not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament, Turati (Fabio Sartor), against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours, but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life-- his feelings for a young woman he's just met at the resort, Natalia (Emily Watson). And, genius though he may be, dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push Luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace, as well the curse, of his entire life. To tell Luzhin's story, Gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess. And as his background is established, it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who Luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life. For the scenes of his childhood, Gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into, and underlies, the present, more pastoral setting of the resort. The transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled, and with the pace Gorris sets it makes for a riveting, yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well. She also underplays the menace produced by the presence of Valentinov, concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense, which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film, making Luzhin's tragedy all the more believable and unsettling. The single element that makes this film so memorable, however, is the affecting performance of John Turturro. For this film to work, Luzhin must be absolutely believable; one false or feigned moment would be disastrous, as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately. It doesn't happen, however, and the film does work, because the Luzhin Turturro creates is impeccably honest and true-to-life. He captures Luzhin's genius, as well as his inadequacies, and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real. It's a performance equal to, if not surpassing, Geoffrey Rush's portrayal of David Helfgott in \`Shine.' And when you compare his work here with other characters he's created, from Sid Lidz in \`Unstrung Heroes' to Pete in \`O Brother Where Art Thou?' to Al Fountain in \`Box of Moonlight,' you realize what an incredible range Turturro has as an actor, and what a remarkable artist he truly is. As Natalia, Emily Watson is excellent, as well, turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely. Though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to Luzhin, Watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective. Most importantly, because of the detail she brings to her performance, it makes her accelerated relationship with Luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story. You have but to look into Watson's eyes to know that the feelings she's conveying are real. It's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor. The supporting cast includes Geraldine James (Vera), Christopher Thompson (Stassard), Peter Blythe (Ilya), Orla Brady (Anna), Mark Tandy (Luzhin's Father), Kelly Hunter (Luzhin's Mother), Alexander Hunting (Young Luzhin) and Luigi Petrucci (Santucci). Well crafted and delivered, \`The Luzhin Defence' is an emotionally involving film, presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man's inhumanity to man. We don't need a movie, of course, to tell us that there is cruelty in the world; but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget, inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change, and to make a difference in the lives of those around us.

Instead, Father asserts that his parental rights should not be terminated because DCS did not make reasonable efforts to place Arteria H. with a relative and because of ineffective assistance of counsel in the Juvenile Court proceeding. After reviewing his brief, it is clear to this Court that all of Father’s allegations of error involve the alleged lack of reasonable efforts on the part of DCS or errors which occurred during the dependency and neglect proceeding. However, the two grounds upon which Father’s parental rights were terminated, do not require reasonable efforts on the part of DCS or require a previous finding of dependency and neglect.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the full name of one of Massenet's last students? Massenet was a prolific composer; he put this down to his way of working, rising early and composing from four o'clock in the morning until midday, a practice he maintained all his life. In general he worked fluently, seldom revising, although Le roi de Lahore, his nearest approach to a traditional grand opera, took him several years to complete to his own satisfaction. It was finished in 1877 and was one of the first new works to be staged at the Palais Garnier, opened two years previously. The opera, with a story taken from the Mahabharata, was an immense success and was quickly taken up by the opera houses of eight Italian cities. It was also performed at the Hungarian State Opera House, the Bavarian State Opera, the Semperoper, Dresden, the Teatro Real in Madrid, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London. After the first Covent Garden performance, The Times summed the piece up in a way that was frequently to be applied to the composer's operas: \\"M. Massenet's opera, although not a work of genius proper, is one of more than common merit, and contains all the elements of at least temporary success.\\"This period was an early high point in Massenet's career. He had been made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1876, and in 1878 he was appointed professor of counterpoint, fugue and composition at the Conservatoire under Thomas, who was now the director. In the same year he was elected to the Institut de France, a prestigious honour, rare for a man in his thirties. Camille Saint-Saëns, whom Massenet beat in the election for the vacancy, was resentful at being passed over for a younger composer. When the result of the election was announced, Massenet sent Saint-Saëns a courteous telegram: \\"My dear colleague: the Institut has just committed a great injustice\\". Saint-Saëns cabled back, \\"I quite agree.\\" He was elected three years later, but his relations with Massenet remained cool.Massenet was a popular and respected teacher at the Conservatoire. His pupils included Bruneau, Charpentier, Chausson,... A:","completion":"One of Massenet's last students was Camille Saint-Saëns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A submarine cable en route to Britain from Cape Town was landed in November 1899 and extended to Ascension by December and was operated by the Eastern Telegraph Company. For the next two years over six thousand Boer prisoners were imprisoned at Deadwood and Broadbottom. The population reached its all-time record of 9,850 in 1901. Although a number of prisoners died, being buried at Knollcombes, the islanders and Boers developed a relationship of mutual respect and trust, a few Boers choosing to remain on the island when the war ended in 1902. A severe outbreak of influenza in 1900 led to the death of 3.3% of the population, although it affected neither the Boer prisoners nor the troops guarding them.

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - The Daytime Emmy Award is an American accolade bestowed by the New Yorkbased National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in recognition of excellence in American daytime television programming. Ceremonies generally are held in May or June. - As the World Turns (often referred to as ATWT) is an American television soap opera that aired on CBS for 54 years from April 2, 1956, to September 17, 2010.

It is worth noting that the term \\"trail ride\\" often refers to horseback riding, particularly when discussing historical events like the march west. Horseback riding may, therefore, be a more plausible mode of transportation, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph either. In absence of clear information about the mode of transportation, it would be improper to conclude that you drove the anniversary trail ride by car. Further details or context would be necessary to make an accurate determination of the transportation method used during this three-day adventure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: \\"oh it isn't bad\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"It's not terrible.\\" true?","completion":"In order to analyze this premise and hypothesis, we first need to break down the components and understand the meanings of the terms used. Premise: \\"oh it isn't bad\\" The premise is a statement expressing a personal opinion or judgment that something is not of poor quality or undesirable. In this case, the speaker is expressing that \\"it\\" isn't bad, meaning that they believe \\"it\\" to be at least of satisfactory quality or acceptable. Hypothesis: \\"It's not terrible.\\" The hypothesis is a proposed explanation or statement assuming that \\"it\\" is not terrible. In this context, \\"terrible\\" usually implies something very bad or having poor quality. Now that we have a better understanding of the premise and hypothesis, let's analyze the relationship between the two statements. The opinion expressed in the premise that \\"it isn't bad\\" suggests that the quality or condition of \\"it\\" is not bad or poor. On the other hand, the hypothesis is stating that \\"it\\" is not terrible, which also implies that the quality or condition of \\"it\\" is not extremely poor. In general, the meaning of \\"terrible\\" is more extreme than \\"bad,\\" as \\"terrible\\" usually denotes something of very low quality, extremely undesirable, or causing distress. However, based on the speaker's judgment that \\"it isn't bad\\" in the premise, one can infer that they find \\"it\\" to be at least tolerable or adequate. The hypothesis, in turn, does not make an affirmative claim about the quality of \\"it.\\" Instead, it just states that \\"it\\" is not terrible, or in other words, not extremely low in quality or causing distress. Considering how both statements refer to the underlying quality or acceptability of the subject, it appears that the hypothesis \\"It's not terrible\\" is consistent with the premise \\"oh it isn't bad.\\" While both statements are made in the negative, they collectively convey that \\"it\\" is neither bad nor terrible, positioning \\"it\\" within a range of acceptability or adequacy. However, it is important to note that the premise is an expression of personal opinion or judgment, and might not hold true for everyone. There may be individual differences in perception or interpretation regarding what constitutes as \\"bad\\" or \\"terrible.\\" In conclusion, based on the premise \\"oh it isn't bad,\\" it is reasonable to deduce that the hypothesis \\"It's not terrible\\" is true. Both statements share similarities in presenting a common point that the subject is not of extremely low quality or undesirable. However, individual opinions and experiences may vary, which could influence one's perception of the underlying acceptability or adequacy of the subject in question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Crusaders, Mamelukes, and Turks: The Crusaders established a feudal Christian state with Godfrey at its head. They built many impressive churches during the term of the first Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, but in 1187 they were driven out by Muslim forces under the great warrior Saladin. During the Sixth Crusade (1228– 1229), the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II managed to secure Jerusalem for the Christians by negotiation. The Christians, however, could not hold the city. After they lost Jerusalem, a Mongol invasion swept through, and in 1244 the Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control, ruling Jerusalem for the next 250 years. The city struggled to rebuild from Crusader wars and invasions. Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was constructed in the Mameluke era, but the past thousand years had taken their toll: Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had enjoyed in earlier times. In the early 16th century, the Ottoman Turkish Empire was advancing through the Middle East. Jerusalem fell to the Ottomans in 1517, remaining under their control for 400 years. Suleiman the Magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this day. Fountains, inns, religious schools, and barracks were constructed. But when Suleiman died, his empire, including Jerusalem, began a long period of decline. The Holy City remained a backwater until the 19th century, when renewed interest among Christian pilgrims made it the destination of thousands of travelers each year.

He turned a seesaw into a big ship and the sandbox into a treasure island.

Detailed Instructions: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Matthias has rallied people from all over the planet in their fight against the powerful and tyrannical Cohaagan, the planet's dictator, and his military forces known as The Enforcers. Cohaagan has enjoyed unchallenged rule over Terrastra for decades, harnessing the planet's rare mineral resources for his own benefit and propagandizing the usefulness of his regime. As the divide between the wealthy and the impoverished deepens, the unrest surrounding Matthias' movement reaches its boiling point. One fateful day, however, Matthias is found dead in his safe house, sparking chaos and confusion amongst The Flux. Who could have gotten to their fiercely protected leader? Almost immediately, fingers point towards Cohaagan and his Enforcers as the masterminds behind the assassination. Seeking to unravel the truth, Dana Gray, a young, talented investigator within The Flux, and Noah Kash, a former Enforcer with a disdain for Cohaagan's brutal regime, forge an unexpected alliance to uncover who killed Matthias. Rumors and speculations spread like wildfire, inciting chaos and mistrust among the people, which ultimately plays into Cohaagan's hands. No stone is left unturned as Dana and Noah delve deep into the world of espionage, government surveillance, and back-alley deals, revealing the complexities of resistance and the corruption entrenched within Cohaagan's heinous empire.

As Dana and Noah get closer to identifying the mole, they stumble upon a shocking revelation that implicates some of the most trusted individuals within The Flux, triggering a struggle for power and trust within the movement. Meanwhile, they uncover that Cohaagan had orchestrated part of this intricate web of deceit in an attempt to eliminate Matthias, who had stumbled upon an explosive secret that could topple Cohaagan's reign. With time running short and Cohaagan's forces closing in on them, Dana and Noah must race to reveal the shocking truth about Matthias' death, the identity of the mole, and the explosive secret that threatens not just Cohaagan's rule but the very existence of Terrastra itself. In the climax of the story, our heroes finally expose the mole, dismantle Cohaagan's plan to control Terrastra, and bring retribution for the murder of Matthias. As Terrastra emerges into a new age with a chance at a democratic government, it also faces ongoing challenges in reconciling the rifts left behind by years of Cohaagan's rule. The Veiled Truth: Matthias' End is a gripping, action-packed sci-fi thriller set in a world consumed by power, control, and deception.

Now researchers believe that a 33-foot sculpture catalogued merely as ‘JE 46278’ actually depicts Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene - the twin babies of Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII. The revelation comes courtesy of Giuseppina Capriotti, an Egyptologist at the Italy's National Research Council. Ancient: The sculpture, which was found in 1918, depicts Cleopatra's twins.

Each figure has an arm over the other’s shoulder,‭ ‬while the other hand grasps a serpent.’ She added: ‘Unfortunately the faces are not well preserved, but we can see that the boy has curly hair and a braid on the right side of the head, typical of Egyptian children.

This means they have not chosen THC every time it was offered; in fact, they have consistently avoided it. The premise reveals a clear preference of rats for placebo over THC. Given a choice, rats decidedly don't opt for THC, suggesting that, for whatever reason-be it a dislike for the effects, some natural aversion, or some other unknowable rat-logic-THC is not their preferred option. Based on this premise, we can infer that the behavior of rats with respect to the presence of THC is predictable-they are more likely to reject it. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests a different scenario, stating that \\"Rats will choose THC every time it is offered.\\" The hypothesis implies that rats would consistently show a preference for THC rather than avoiding it, which directly contradicts the behavior indicated in the premise. Therefore, if the premise is true, it does not entail the hypothesis. On the contrary, it directly contradicts it. Furthermore, the findings of the premise may lead to various complex discussions and further research opportunities. For example, it encourages the investigation into why rats have displayed an aversion to THC. Understanding the reason behind their constant preference for the placebo can play an essential role in additional animal behavior studies, specifically those involving the effects of different substances. Moreover, it feeds into broader dialogues about the differences and similarities between animal and human responses to substances such as THC, the active ingredient in cannabis. Humans have been known to seek out THC for its psychoactive effects, and understanding why rats seemingly do not could potentially shed light on variances in neurobiology, the influence of social factors on substance use, and other relevant topics. In conclusion, the premise gives us evidence that contradicts the hypothesis \\"Rats will choose THC every time it is offered\\". Instead of endorsing this hypothesis, the premise reveals a much different behavioral pattern: a rat's predictability in avoiding THC when given a choice. This contradiction initiates further inquiry and discussion on the topic, potentially leading to valuable insights in various fields such as animal behavior studies and neurobiology."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The relocation of Polish Jews from surrounding areas to Krakow begins in late 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, when the German Army defeats the Polish Army in three weeks. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a successful businessman, arrives from Czechoslovakia in hopes of using the abundant cheap labour force of Jews to manufacture enamelware for the German military. Schindler, an opportunistic member of the Nazi party, lavishes bribes upon the army and SS officials in charge of procurement. Sponsored by the military, Schindler acquires a factory for the production of army mess kits and cooking paraphernalia. Not knowing much about how to properly run such an enterprise, he gains a contact in Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), a functionary in the local Judenrat (Jewish Council) who has contacts with the now-underground Jewish business community in the ghetto. They loan him the money for the factory in return for a small share of products produced (for trade on the black market). Opening the factory, Schindler pleases the Nazis and enjoys his new-found wealth and status as \\"Herr Direktor,\\" while Stern handles all administration. Stern suggests Schindler hire Jews instead of Poles because they cost less (the Jews themselves get nothing; the wages are paid to the Reich). Workers in Schindler's factory are allowed outside the ghetto, and Stern falsifies documents to ensure that as many people as possible are deemed \\"essential\\" by the Nazi bureaucracy, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps, or even being killed.Amon Göth (Ralph Fiennes) arrives in Krakow to initiate construction of a labor camp nearby, Paszów. The SS soon liquidates the Krakow ghetto, sending in hundreds of troops to empty the cramped rooms and shoot anyone who protests, is uncooperative, elderly, or infirmed, or for no reason at all. Schindler watches the massacre from the hills overlooking the area, and is profoundly affected. He nevertheless is careful to befriend Göth and, through Stern's attention to bribery,...

Article: Australian cities can keep their native wildlife -- but only if they can kick their habit of urban sprawl . That's the finding of a new study by leading Australian environmental researchers Jessica Sushinsky, Professor Hugh Possingham and Dr Richard Fuller of The University of Queensland. \\"While urban development usually reduces the number of birds in a city, building more compact cities and avoiding urban sprawl can slow these reductions greatly,\\" says lead author Jessica Sushinsky. \\"Compact housing development leaves birds' homes untouched, leading to fewer losses of birds.\\" The researchers surveyed native and wild birds in Brisbane's urban areas, including living and industrial areas, public parks and gardens, major roadways and airports. They then used statistical modeling to find out what will happen to the birds as the city grows. The first setting was compact growth -- where multiple homes are built on land that previously had only one house. The second setting was sprawling growth -- a familiar pattern where homes are built here and there beyond the city's current boundaries. The team's forecasts showed that a much greater diversity of species was lost over 20 years in the sprawling setting compared to the more compact setting. \\"Urban sprawl resulted in the disappearance of many urban-sensitive birds -- birds that only live in areas where there is native vegetation , such as parklands and woodlands,\\" Ms Sushinsky says. \\"On the other hand, we found the city with the compact development attracted more birds because it kept more of its parks and green areas.\\" Now the Queensland Government has adopted the more compact urban growth strategy, which, Dr Richard Fuller says, is good news for Australia's native birds. These birds are environmental specialists -- they need a particular environment to do well. \\"While compact development means smaller backyards, it can also make our entire cities more biodiverse,\\" according to Dr Fuller. \\"The study shows that we should hold on to our green spaces instead of...

A great football quarterback, finalist for the Heisman, second-overall pick in the NFL draft. Fast forward a few years, and Leaf is considered one of the biggest busts of all time, having failed to achieve at a high level. Natural talent for playing football doesn't mean anything if you don't commit to building it into a skill. When you find your talent, think of it like a seed that you're planting. You're off to a good start, but you've still got to water it, mulch it, and weed around the edges to make sure your seed grows into a big plant. It takes work. As iron sharpens iron, so one talented person sharpens another. If you've got a talent for something, or even if you just hope to develop talent in some field, surround yourself with other talented people and model yourself after their behaviors, practice routines, and attitudes about their talent. Learn everything you can from talented people. Find a mentor who's willing to show you the ropes and coach you in developing your new skills. Blossoming guitar players need good teachers beyond YouTube. Blossoming singers need other people to play music with. Developing your talent into a skill and your skill into an ability is going to be hard. The more you learn about a subject, a task, or an ability, the more complicated it becomes. Commit to learning everything you can about your field and challenging yourself to become a master. Turn your talent into something special. Make your talent real. Playing chess might not get easier for Magnus Carlsen, just because he’s a phenomenal player. Now he knows just how complicated the game can be. The more you learn about a game, a skill, or a field, the more there will be to learn. It never gets easy. Even if you've got no talent for the guitar, practicing two hours a day guarantees that you'll get a lot better. Someone who practices, whether it be sport, art, or any other field, will always end up more talented than someone who never picks up their instrument, picks up their paintbrush, someone who never practices. Hard work outruns ability every time.","completion":"Ryan Leaf was once a promising football quarterback, but despite his natural talent, he ultimately failed due to a lack of commitment to develop his skills.

The first industrial revolution was the production of goods with machines like steam engines, which was followed by the second industrial revolution that introduced mass production with the help of electric power, followed by the digital revolution --the use of electronics and IT in production. Industry 4.0 is a high-tech project, which promotes the computerization of manufacturing . The basic principle of Industry 4.0 is that by connecting machines, work pieces and systems, we are creating intelligent networks along the entire value chain that can control each other automatically. The goal is the Smart Factory, which adapts well and uses resources efficiently as well as linking customers and business partners with great intelligence. Technological basis are the Internet systems and advanced factories. Experts believe that Industry 4.0 could be a reality in about 10 to 20 years. So, what effects does this change have on the classic manufacturing? According to an expert, \\"it is highly likely that the world of production will become more and more networked until everything is connected with everything else.\\" Networks and processes have so far been limited to one factory. But in the time of Industry 4.0, the boundaries of individual factories will most likely no longer exist. Instead, they will be lifted in order to inter-connect multiple factories or even geographical regions. How is an Industry 4.0 factory different from a today's factory? In current industry environment, providing high-end quality service or product with the least cost is the key to success. Factories are trying to increase their profit as much as possible.

Question: Given the below context: Though it reached No. 130 on the Billboard chart, Freak Out! was neither a major commercial nor critical success when it was first released in the United States. Many listeners were convinced that the album was drug-inspired, and interpreted the album's title as slang for a bad LSD trip. The album made the Mothers of Invention immediate underground darlings with a strong counter-cultural following. In The Real Frank Zappa Book, Zappa quotes a negative review of the album by Pete Johnson of the Los Angeles Times, who wrote: I guess you might call it surrealistic paintings set to music. Not content to record just two sides of musical gibberish, the MOI devote four full sides to their type of \\"artistry\\". If anyone owns this album, perhaps he can tell me what in hell is going on ... The Mothers of Invention, a talented but warped quintet, have fathered an album poetically entitled Freak Out, which could be the greatest stimulus to the aspirin industry since the income tax. The album developed a major cult following in the United States by the time MGM/Verve had been merged into a division of PolyGram in 1972. At that time many MGM/Verve releases including Freak Out! were prematurely deleted in an attempt to keep the struggling company financially solvent. Zappa had already moved on to his own companies Bizarre Records and Straight Records which were distributed by Warner Bros. Records. Freak Out! was initially more successful in Europe and quickly influenced many English rock musicians. According to David Fricke, the album was a major influence on the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Paul McCartney regarded Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as The Beatles' Freak Out! Zappa criticized the Beatles, as he felt they were \\"only in it for the money\\".Freak Out! was honored with the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999, ranked at number 243 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\" in 2003, and featured in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The album... Guess a valid title for it! Answer:","completion":"A valid title for the album could be \\"Surreal Sounds of a Counter-Culture Revolution.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The show debuted on August 30, 1993, and was produced by Letterman's production company, Worldwide Pants Incorporated and CBS Television Studios. The show's music director and leader of the house band, the CBS Orchestra, was Paul Shaffer. The head writer was Matt Roberts and the announcer was Alan Kalter. Of the major U.S. late-night programs, \\"Late Show\\" ranked second in cumulative average viewers over time and third in number of episodes over time. In most U.S. markets the show aired from 11:35 p.m. to 12:37 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time, and recorded Monday through Wednesdays at 4:30 p.m., and Thursdays at 3:30 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The second Thursday episode usually aired on Friday of that week. - Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground is the fourth album by Bright Eyes and the 46th release of Saddle Creek Records. The band made its national television debut in support of the album, performing \\"The Trees Get Wheeled Away\\" (a track that was not on the album) on the \\"Late Show with David Letterman\\". The album is referenced in the Jonathan Franzen novel \\"Freedom\\" when the main characters Walter and Richard attend a Bright Eyes concert in Washington D.C. during the \\"Lifted\\" tour. - Saddle Creek Records is an American record label based in Omaha, Nebraska. Started as a college class project on entrepreneurship, the label was founded by Mike Mogis and Justin Oberst in 1993 (as Lumberjack Records). Mogis soon turned over his role in the company to Robb Nansel. The label is named after Saddle Creek Road, a street that cuts through the east side of midtown Omaha, and the beginnings of a scene whose members included Conor Oberst (then a solo artist, currently of Bright Eyes, Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band, Desaparecidos and Monsters of Folk), Tim Kasher (then of Slowdown Virginia, currently of Cursive and The Good Life), and others. Collectively, they were known unofficially as the \\"Creekers\\". Saddle Creek first appeared in print on a show flyer, offering to \\"Spend an evening with Saddle Creek\\" (later to be the title of the label's DVD.) Saddle Creek became an incorporated entity as a result of a class project on entrepreneurship. Distribution is handled by the Alternative Distribution Alliance, which is under the Warner Music Group umbrella. - \`\` Lover I Do n't Have to Love '' is a song by Bright Eyes released as a single in 2002 and released on the album Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil , Keep Your Ear to the Ground .

Write highlights for this article: There are seemingly millions of smartphone apps out there designed to make traveling easier, but not all of them are very good. Every company seems to think that it needs an app to be cool, but not every app is worth the effort. Here are some of the apps that I find to be most helpful while on the road:. FlightAware. I'm one of those guys who always thinks that more information is better, and that's why I like FlightAware. You can see exactly where your flight (or any other flight) is at the moment. I've used the FlightAware website for years to see near real-time flight tracking, and now there's an app as well. Were you told your airplane is coming from Wichita, but it's still not there and you should be boarding? Go to FlightAware to see where the airplane is right now. FlightAware is hardly the only one in this space. Other frequent fliers swear by FlightTrack Pro, for example. GateGuru. When I was in Atlanta recently, my wife was looking for something before our next flight. Trying to find the right store in an airport the size of Hartsfield-Jackson is a mind-numbing experience. GateGuru, however, gives the rundown on which stores and restaurants are in each terminal and it pulls in reviews as well. If you're in an airport looking for a particular product or service, this will make your task much easier. Hotel Tonight. Have you ever been somewhere and realized you needed a room for the night? Maybe your flight was canceled or perhaps your meetings ran long. This company negotiates deals with hotels for last-minute rooms in many big cities. Within seconds, you can have the room reserved for a low rate. Taxi Magic. If you don't know a city well, the taxi scene can be confusing. Where is the best place to hail a cab? How much should you pay? Taxi Magic makes it a lot easier. If there's a participating cab company in your city, Taxi Magic will have a cab sent right to you. You can pay directly through the app so you don't have to worry about whether credit is accepted or not. The app and booking services are free, and there's a 1.50 documentation fee for using a credit card through the app. If there isn't a participating cab company in the area, Taxi Magic will give you phone numbers for local companies so you can call and arrange for a cab yourself. TripIt. If you've ever used TripIt online to manage your travel, you know it's a great tool for keeping all your travel plans in one place. Of course, there's also an app for that. See and manage all your travel plans in the TripIt app so you never lose your details. Beyond the basics of flights, hotels and cars, you can also put in things like appointments and meals. Your airline app. This isn't one app; it's dependent upon which airline you fly. If you fly a different airline every time, then it's probably not worth downloading every single airline app. But if you're a loyalist, you should absolutely have it. There are some excellent apps out there that allow you to check flight status, see the standby list, book flights and even check in. Apps will store a mobile boarding pass so you can just flash your phone to get on the airplane (not in all airports, but it's getting there). Some airlines have better apps than others. I've heard rave reviews about the new United Airlines app, but get the apps for the airlines you fly frequently. What would you add to the list? Highlights:","completion":"1. FlightAware: This app provides near real-time flight tracking and allows users to see exactly where their flight is at any given moment to stay informed about delays and boarding issues. 2.

Hotel Tonight: For last-minute accommodation needs, Hotel Tonight negotiates deals with hotels in major cities and allows users to reserve rooms at low rates within seconds. 4. Taxi Magic: This app simplifies the taxi experience by sending participating cabs directly to the user's location and allowing payment through the app, or by providing local cab company phone numbers in areas without participating companies. 5. TripIt: The TripIt app allows users to manage and consolidate all their travel plans, including flights, hotels, car rentals, appointments, and meals, in one place for easy access and organization. 6. Airline Apps: Downloading dedicated airline apps for the specific airlines a user frequents can provide useful tools such as flight status updates, mobile boarding passes, booking options, and check-in capabilities, streamlining the travel experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Yves Gomes is now a university student in Maryland, but he may soon have to leave the country. \\"I still want to continue with my college education and I want to be able to study here and go to medical school,\\" he said. Gomes is one of thousands of young illegal immigrants who grew up in the United States and are now studying at American colleges and universities. He is doing well in his studies, but he is fighting deportation to India, a country he left with his parents when he was just 14 months old. They were deported more than a year ago. \\"If I was to go back to India I would just feel like all of that would have gone to waste because here at least I am still able to go to college,\\" he said. Immigration is a divisive political issue in the United States with some 11 million people in the country illegally. One element of the debate is the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States before the age of 16. Pending legislation know as the DREAMAct would give them a chance to become legal residents if they complete two years of college or join the military. Milanie Schwartz, a politically conservative student at the University of Texas, explains why some Americans oppose the legislation. \\"We think it's unfair that students who are illegal immigrants would get a fast track to citizenship, while people who did come here legally wouldn't have those same opportunities,\\" she said. \\"The question is legalization or not, \\" said Jon Feere, who also opposes the DREAM Act. He is a policy analyst with the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington and is concerned about the act's effect on the economy. \\"There's a lot of unemployment in the United States right now. And there are already many legal immigrants who are already here who are desperate for those jobs,\\" he said. But supporters of the DREAMAct say well-educated immigrants would help the economy. Raul Hinojosa is an immigration research analyst at UCLA.\\" Not letting them contribute to the economy would not only lose all the financial investment we have already made in these youths, but we would lose literally trillions of dollars of potential value because they want and are ready to contribute to the US economy,\\" he said. That's exactly what Yves Gomes wants to do -- finish school and become a doctor. He says without the DREAMAct, many students' dreams will be lost. \\"They are studying at Harvard, they are studying at UCLA--the top universities -- and they all have bright futures and because of the system they are going to be told to go home, go back to a country they don't even know, \\" he said. The DREAMAct has failed to win passage in Congress since it was first introduced 10 years ago. Now time is running out for passage this year, and opposition Republicans have threatened to block it.

Approximately 55% of the lines in the world are this gauge. All high-speed rail lines (except those in Russia, Uzbekistan, and Finland) are standard gauge. The distance between the inside edges of the rails is defined to be (except in the United States, where it is still defined in Imperial and US customary units as ). It is also called the UIC gauge or UIC track gauge, the European gauge in the EU and Russia, or uniform gauge in Queensland, Australia. - The Petaluma River is a river in the California counties of Sonoma and Marin that becomes a tidal slough for the majority of its length. The headwaters are in the area southwest of Cotati. The flow is generally southward through Petaluma's old town, where the waterway becomes navigable, and then flows another through tidal marshes before emptying into the northwest corner of San Pablo Bay. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. - High-speed rail is a type of rail transport that operates significantly faster than traditional rail traffic, using an integrated system of specialized rolling stock and dedicated tracks. While there is no single standard that applies worldwide, new lines in excess of and existing lines in excess of are widely considered to be high-speed, with some extending the definition to include lower speeds in areas for which these speeds still represent significant improvements. The first such system began operations in Japan in 1964 and was widely known as the bullet train. High-speed trains normally operate on standard gauge tracks of continuously welded rail on grade-separated right-of-way that incorporates a large turning radius in its design. - In rail transport, track gauge is the spacing of the rails on a railway track and is measured between the inner faces of the load-bearing rails. - A marsh is a wetland that is dominated by herbaceous rather than woody plant species. Marshes can often be found at the edges of lakes and streams, where they form a transition between the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. They are often dominated by grasses, rushes or reeds. If woody plants are present they tend to be low-growing shrubs. This form of vegetation is what differentiates marshes from other types of wetland such as swamps, which are dominated by trees, and mires, which are wetlands that have accumulated deposits of acidic peat. - The Northwestern Pacific Railroad is a regional railroad that serves the North Coast of California. Its main line is long and runs between Schellville and Eureka. An additional portion of the line runs from the Ignacio Wye to the edge of San Rafael. Currently, only the stretch between Schellville and Windsor is in operation with freight and SMART commuter trains. - George Stephenson (9 June 1781 12 August 1848) was an English civil engineer and mechanical engineer who built the first public inter-city railway line in the world to use steam locomotives, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway which opened in 1830. Renowned as the \\"Father of Railways\\", the Victorians considered him a great example of diligent application and thirst for improvement, with self-help advocate Samuel Smiles particularly praising his achievements. His rail gauge of , sometimes called \\"Stephenson gauge\\", is the standard gauge by name and by convention for most of the world's railways. - San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad ( SF&NP ) provided the first extensive standard gauge rail service to Sonoma County and became the southern end of the regional Northwestern Pacific Railroad . Sonoma County 's first standard - gauge railroad was the 1 - mile ( 1.6 - km ) Petaluma and Haystack Railroad connecting the city of Petaluma with ferry service to San Francisco from Haystack Landing on the Petaluma River in 1864 . Petaluma and Haystack coaches were pulled by horses after the locomotive exploded on 27 August 1866 . SF&NP began construction from Petaluma northward in 1869 , but inability to make satisfactory arrangements with the City of Petaluma caused the railroad to establish a new southern ferry terminus on the Petaluma River at Donahue Landing . Service was extended north to Santa Rosa in 1870 , and Cloverdale in 1872 . The Fulton and Guerneville Railroad was formed in 1874 to build a SF&NP branch from Fulton to Guerneville on the Russian River . The branch was completed in 1877 . In 1879 , the SF&NP was extended south through Petaluma to San Rafael in Marin County . The San Francisco and San Rafael Railroad was formed in 1882 to extend the SF&NP south another 3 miles ( 5 km ) to a new ferry landing in Tiburon . SF&NP ferry terminal facilities were moved to Tiburon in 1884 ; and Donahue Landing faded into the rural countryside . The Cloverdale and Ukiah Railroad was formed in 1886 to extend the SF&NP north to Ukiah in Mendocino County . Service began to Ukiah in 1889 . The Santa Rosa , Sebastopol and Green Valley Railroad was formed in 1889 to build a SF&NP branch from Santa Rosa to Sebastopol . The branch was completed in 1890 . The California Northwestern Railway Company was formed in 1898 as part of Southern Pacific Railroad ambitions to reach the redwood lumber mills around Humboldt Bay . SF&NP struggled through the panic of 1893 , and was leased by the California Northwestern in 1898 . California Northwestern oversaw eastward connections to the Southern Pacific Railroad and northward... - In the United States, a regional railroad is a railroad company that is not Class I, but still has a substantial amount of traffic or trackage (and is thus not a short line). The Association of American Railroads (AAR) has defined the lower bound as of track or 40 million in annual operating revenue. (The Class I threshold is 250 million, adjusted for inflation since 1991.) - A tidal marsh is a type of marsh that is found along coasts and estuaries of which the flooding characteristics are determined by the tidal movement of the adjacent estuary, sea or ocean.

The question you mentioned: \\"What country is Mexico in?\\" is looking for a straightforward reply but the provided answer is more about historical aspects and does not answer the query directly. Mexico is not in any other country; it is a country itself. It's officially known as the United Mexican States and it lies in the southern part of North America. Bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico is the third largest country in Latin America, after Brazil and Argentina. Dating back to 2000 BC, Mesoamerican cultures such as the Olmec, Toltec, Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Maya, and Aztec flourished in Mexico before the arrival of Europeans. In the 16th century, Spaniards conquered and colonized the region, leading to a period of three centuries of Spanish rule. Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821, after a long and hard-fought war. Today, Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and Mexico City, its capital city and largest metropolis. It's considered an upper-middle-income country by the World Bank and a newly industrialized country by several analysts. It has the 15th largest nominal GDP and 11th largest by purchasing power parity. It's also renowned for its rich culture and history, which is a blend of indigenous and Spanish influences. This unique cultural blend is reflected in its food, art, music, language, and literature. So, when structuring an answer to the original question, it's crucial to give the factual and direct response that Mexico is not in another country; it is a country in itself while its historical context can be an additional encompassing explanation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step-by-step justification: 1. In the dialogue, Jerry mentions that he goes to the gym every morning before work. 2. When asked about the reason, he says, \\"it gives me the energy I need to make it through the day.\\" 3. This statement directly implies that going to the gym makes him energetic, which allows him to perform well throughout his workday. 4. Although Jerry confirms he takes a shower at the gym, he does not mention it as a reason for going to the gym. It's a consequence of his gym routine, but not a primary motivation. 5. Jerry also explains that he doesn't feel like exercising after work, but this does not refer to gym-timing being the \\"only\\" time he can exercise; rather, it is his preference for when he does his exercise routine. 6.

News article: Greece Holds Activists as Migrants and Police Clash Anew at Macedonia Border ATHENS — Clashes erupted at Greece’s northern border for the second time in three days on Wednesday, with the Macedonian police firing tear gas on scores of migrants as they protested border closings that have left more than 12,000 stranded in a makeshift refugee camp. The protests in Idomeni, a town in Greece on the border with Macedonia, came as Greek authorities arrested 14 activists there, saying that they had incited the migrants to storm the razor-wire fence dividing the two countries. The police accused the activists, from Britain, Germany and other European countries, of encouraging the migrants to protest by telling them that doing so would arouse sympathy among European governments and in that way help reopen borders and let them proceed on what was once the main migrant path to Germany, where most say they want to go. Around 300 migrants, including women and children, were injured on Sunday when they sought to break through the border fence and the Macedonian police fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Greek television showed a crowd of migrants on Wednesday, their faces covered with scarves, chanting, “Open the border!” as the Greek police moved in to restore calm. Macedonian police officers could be seen sitting on several tanks lined up on their side of the fence. Less than two months after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece warned that Europe’s migration policies risked turning his country into a “warehouse for souls,” Athens is struggling to manage the tide of people trapped in Greece since Balkan nations, like Macedonia, closed their borders, trying to avert a chaotic flow of tens of thousands of refugees and migrants into Europe like that of last year. Since a European Union deal with Turkey to try to stem Europe’s migrant crisis went into effect on March 20, migrants who now arrive in Greece from Turkey face deportation. But the migrants, like those in Idomeni, who arrived before that date now find themselves stuck in recession-hit Greece, unable to make their way to their preferred destinations in Northern Europe. The Greek government is overwhelmed by asylum applications from tens of thousands of migrants who realize they cannot move. Many are biding their time in Greece as they try to figure out what to do if their applications are rejected and they face deportation. In the meantime, numerous countries have revived border controls 20 years after the so-called Schengen agreement permitted largely passport-free travel among European Union members. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, warned on Tuesday that it might soon authorize member states to extend border controls for up to two years instead of the normal six months, if Greece does not quickly outline how it plans to tighten control of its borders. The commission said Greece had still not made adequate progress in registering thousands of migrants throughout the country. Analysts and European politicians have warned that reinstating border controls could deal a sharp blow to the European Union economy. Greece, which does not have the resources to process and assist the migrants, has been waiting for more than 1,000 police officers and asylum experts to arrive from other European countries to help. In the meantime, the authorities in Greece are trying to confront growing tensions among migrants on the mainland as well as among thousands held at detention camps on Greek islands, where migrants are living in increasingly squalid and dangerous conditions. Just over two weeks after Greece began carrying out the terms of the March 20 deal and started deportations from the Greek islands back to Turkey, Pope Francis is scheduled to visit the Greek island of Lesbos on Saturday, a trip aimed at highlighting the plight of migrants. Greek officials have also been trying to clear the camps in Idomeni and another migrant camp in Piraeus, the port of Athens, where more than 4,000 have been living in tents and warehouses for over a month. The migrants have been reluctant to move to military-style camps amid fears that, once there, the government might shut them in. In the last two days, however, around 15 busloads of people have agreed to be transferred from Idomeni to nearby camps, while hundreds have agreed to leave Piraeus. Still, large numbers of migrants at both places have insisted on staying, leading the government to warn that they may soon be forcibly cleared.

After Paris, which is the next largest French speaking city????","completion":"To find the next largest French-speaking city after Paris, I will follow these steps: 1. Make a list of major French-speaking cities around the world. 2. Gather information about the population of each city, particularly the French-speaking population. 3. Compare the populations of these cities to find the next largest French-speaking city after Paris. Step 1: List of major French-speaking cities Here are some major French-speaking cities: - Montreal, Canada - Brussels, Belgium - Marseille, France - Lyon, France - Geneva, Switzerland - Port-au-Prince, Haiti - Dakar, Senegal - Abidjan, Ivory Coast Step 2: Gather population information I will now research the approximate population of these cities. The population of Paris is around 2.1 million as of the latest data. - Montreal: 1.7 million - Brussels: 1.2 million - Marseille: 0.87 million - Lyon: 0.52 million - Geneva: 0.2 million - Port-au-Prince: 1.2 million - Dakar: 1.3 million - Abidjan: 4.7 million Step 3: Compare populations Looking at the population numbers, we can see that: - Montreal is the largest among the listed cities, with 1.7 million inhabitants. - Abidjan has more inhabitants than Montreal, but the exact number of French speakers may be harder to determine due to multiple languages spoken in the region. With this information, I can conclude that Montreal is the next largest French-speaking city after Paris, as it has the largest number of inhabitants among these cities, and French is the official language in Montreal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. Now, I have a new situation: Rob is an environmental scientist. He is looking at two samples of soil, sample A and sample B. Sample A is from Amazon Rain-forest, where they get one of the highest rainfall in the world. Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples. Answer this question please: Would sample B rocks have more or less chemical reactions? A:","completion":"Sample B rocks, which are from the Atacama Desert, would likely have less chemical reactions than sample A rocks from the Amazon Rainforest. This is primarily due to the difference in the amount of rainfall these two regions receive. As mentioned in the background information, rainfall plays a significant role in influencing the rate of weathering. In the Amazon Rainforest, the high rainfall results in more rainwater passing through the soil. This rainwater reacts chemically with the particles in the soil, including the rocks. Since there is a greater amount of rainwater in the Amazon Rainforest, the rocks from sample A would generally experience more chemical reactions than those found in sample B. On the other hand, the Atacama Desert experiences one of the lowest rainfalls in the world. Due to the scarcity of water, the rocks in sample B would be subjected to a considerably lower number of chemical reactions. The limited availability of water means there is less of it to react chemically with the particles in the soil. Consequently, the overall rate of weathering in the Atacama Desert would be significantly lower than that of the Amazon Rainforest. In addition to the differences in rainfall, other environmental factors may also influence the degree of chemical reactions and weathering in the two samples. However, given the importance of rainfall in impacting the rate of weathering and chemical reactions within the soil, it is reasonable to conclude that rocks from sample B, originating from the Atacama Desert, would experience fewer chemical reactions compared to those from sample A found in the Amazon Rainforest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How often should I have sex with my wife?","completion":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. They address entirely different subjects and require separate discussions. The first question is asking for a statistical figure related to a specific crime in the United States: \\"What is the percentage of incest incidents in the USA?\\" Incest refers to sexual relationships between close family members and is considered illegal and morally wrong in many societies. This question seeks to understand the prevalence of this crime in America, which may be related to sociological discussions, crime rates, and legal framework. To provide an in-depth answer for this question, one would need to consult various sources, including governmental organizations, specialized NGOs, and academic research. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the prevalence of incest incidents might be underrepresented due to several reasons, such as stigma, fear of legal consequences, and lack of disclosure by victims. In contrast, the second question revolves around personal relationships and intimate matters: \\"How often should I have sex with my wife?\\" This question concerns an individual's preferences, habits, and relationship dynamics rather than a crime or a societal issue. The answer to this question depends on factors including personal desires, physical health, emotional well-being, and communication between the couple. One key factor to consider is the importance of discussing and understanding each other's needs and desires when it comes to intimacy. Every couple is different, and there is no one-size-fits-all recommendation about how often they should engage in sexual activities. The frequency and quality of a couple's sex life should be something that brings happiness and satisfaction to both partners, built upon open communication, trust, and understanding."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

They are killers. Unlike most bees which will sting you only if they are disturbed , tree-bees will attack you in thousands for no reason. And they will chase you for your life. Walking along a dusty road while I was on holiday there last year. I found myself, without the least warning, the centre of such an attack. The air above me suddenly became thick with bees. Though it was hot, I went cold all over. Until then I had never heard of Indian tree-bees, but I had recently seen a film called \\"The Angry Swarm\\", which was about killer-bees. I began running to the village about half a mile away, but I was soon covered from head to foot with bees. I drove them away with my hands, only to make room for others. Each time I opened my mouth for breath, more bees entered my mouth, until it was stung to twice its usual size and I could hardly breathe. When I reached the village, I found some workers building a house. I ran towards them for help. But as soon as the workers saw the bees with me, they ran for safety at top speed. Soon my eyes had completely closed. I fell into a pile of brick dust. I pushed myself wildly down into it until my head and shoulders were covered. And then I tried hard to get out of the dust, the angry bees made a new attack on me. I was tired out and ran weakly about in circles. Soon I lost my consciousness . Later I learned that two quick-minded villagers ran to a pile of dry grass and quickly surrounded me with a thick wall of fire and smoke until the bees were driven away. They stayed with me, taking stings out of my body for the next three hours until a doctor came and gave me further treatment. Question: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?

Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and mechanics (the very theory he helped create), despite its acceptance by other physicists, stating that God \\"is not playing at dice.\\" Einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory, and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76. In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser. This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws. Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrodinger's work of 1926. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Would Einstein live to disprove the theory he had a role in developing?\\" is \\"Yes\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Would Einstein live to disprove the theory he had a role in developing?\\" is actually \\"No\\". Although Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and mechanics (the very theory he helped create) and attempted to disprove it until his death at the age of 76, he was unsuccessful in doing so. The paragraph outlines some of the significant contributions Einstein made to the field of quantum mechanics, such as proposing the possibility of stimulated emission and giving a wave equation for de Broglie waves. While Einstein might have disagreed with some aspects of the theory and sought to disprove it, he was unable to do so during his lifetime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"The answers to these two questions would not be the same. While they both pertain to Oprah Winfrey, they address different aspects about her. Question 1: \\"How has Oprah Winfrey impacted the world?\\" explores the influence, legacy and impact Oprah Winfrey has had on the world. This would require delving into her various achievements, initiatives and contributions to society. This question might also require exploring the broader impact of Winfrey's work, including her influence on popular culture, her role in promoting various social causes, and her socio-economic impact. To answer that, one could say that Oprah has had a huge impact on the world in many ways. As a media mogul, philanthropist, actress, and television host of The Oprah Winfrey Show, she has influenced millions of viewers around the globe. Empowering people through media, she shares countless inspirational stories, promotes self-improvement and personal growth, and has brought light to a variety of societal issues. Additionally, through her philanthropic endeavors, Oprah has greatly contributed to various causes, notably education. She created the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa, providing high-quality education to underprivileged girls. She has donated millions to various causes and has used her platform to raise funds and awareness for numerous charitable organizations. Question 2: \\"Who is Oprah Winfrey?\\" would likely require providing a general overview or biography of Oprah Winfrey's life. This would include details about her personal background, her career trajectory, and any significant accomplishments or milestones throughout her life. An answer to that might go as follows: Oprah Winfrey is an American media executive, actress, talk show host, television producer, and philanthropist. She is best known for her talk show \\"The Oprah Winfrey Show,\\" which was the highest-rated television program of its kind in history and was nationally syndicated from 1986 to 2011 in Chicago. Born in poverty in rural Mississippi to a teenage single mother and later raised in inner-city Milwaukee, Oprah has spoken openly about her experiences with molestation and teenage pregnancy. Her career took off when she moved to Chicago in 1983 to host WLS-TV's low-rated half-hour morning talk show, AM Chicago, which became the highest-rated talk show in Chicago within months. Renamed The Oprah Winfrey Show, it was nationally syndicated and aired for 25 seasons from 1986 to 2011. Oprah has also made a significant impact as a philanthropist, establishing several charitable foundations and donating millions to causes such as education and disaster relief. However, there would certainly be an overlap in the content of the two responses given her life's success and influence is inherently tied to her background, career, and personal history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Given your request, here is a comprehensive, multi-part question that challenges the students' understanding of the passage: 1. In the context of the passage, what is Nutritionism and who are the key figures associated with the concept's creation and popularization? (The students should respond that Nutritionism is the belief that an overreliance on food science and the study of nutrition can result in poor nutrition and ill health. Furthermore, they should identify Gyorgy Scrinis as the person originally credited with the concept, and Michael Pollan as the one who popularized it.) 2. According to the passage, why do policy makers rely heavily on nutrition experts for advising on food choices? (The students should indicate that nutrients are invisible and therefore policy makers depend on the guidance provided by these nutritional experts.) 3. What are Michael Pollan's arguments about the effects of Nutritionism on the health problems in the Western World? (The answer should emphasize that, according to Pollan, due to the incomplete understanding of science about how food impacts the human body, Nutritionism can be held responsible for numerous dietary-related health issues witnessed in the Western World.) 4. From the passage, we can infer that nutritionism critiques the reliance on food science to inform nutrition choices. In your view, what potential consequences could result from an overreliance on food science and nutrition experts? (This question is subjective. You should inspect responses for critical thinking, coherence and whether the student incorporates and expands upon the ideas presented in the passage. Potential responses might include: food choices might become overly narrow or homogenized, people could be misinformed because of incomplete or changing science, or the public might be misled by policymakers or experts with conflicts of interest.)

Cases of West Nile virus are up 25% over the past week and are expected to rise further over the next several weeks, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday. As of Tuesday, 1,993 reported cases of West Nile virus have been reported in humans, including 87 deaths. Last week, the CDC said there were 1,590 cases with 66 deaths. \\"As we expected, the number of humans with West Nile virus disease continues to rise in the United States,\\" said Dr. Lyle Petersen, director of the CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Diseases. \\"We expect this increase to continue for the next several weeks, probably until October.\\" The number of West Nile cases is the highest reported to the CDC through the first week in September since 1999, when the mosquito-borne virus was first detected in the United States. Fast facts on West Nile virus. More than 70% of cases are in six states: Texas, South Dakota, Mississippi, Michigan, Oklahoma and Louisiana, officials said. Texas bears the brunt of the outbreak, with nearly 45% of cases. Wednesday's briefing focused on how Hurricane Isaac may have affected the outbreak and how Texas is managing its high number of cases. \\"As of now, 2012 is the worst year in the state of Texas for West Nile disease,\\" said Dr. David L. Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services. He says that before this, 2003 was the worst year for the virus. Although Petersen did not give any specific numbers associated with states affected by Hurricane Isaac, he stressed that the CDC is working with state and local officials in those areas to offer assistance on managing infestations. Experience with natural disasters such as hurricanes has shown that West Nile virus cases do not tend to increase in their wake, he said. However, people who spent more time outdoors because they were displaced from their homes or during recovery efforts may be more likely to contract the virus. Who's at risk for West Nile virus? Aerial spraying has sometimes been used to control mosquitoes after hurricanes, Petersen said. In Texas, spraying has been effective in areas that utilized it, Lakey said. A 93% reduction was seen in the density of mosquitoes in areas that received two consecutive sprays, he said. Unsprayed areas showed increases in virus-carrying mosquitoes, and places that were not sprayed consecutively showed smaller reductions in mosquitoes. Protection against mosquito bites is the best defense against West Nile virus, Petersen said. He recommended wearing long pants and sleeves during dusk and dawn -- prime mosquito times -- to prevent bites. In addition, he said, wear insect repellent when you go outdoors; install or repair screens on doors and windows; use air conditioning if possible; empty standing water from outdoor containers and objects that collect water; and support local mosquito control programs.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again? ? Released in September 1980, Never for Ever saw Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first experience as a producer was on her Live on Stage EP, released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker \\"Violin\\" to the wistful waltz of hit single \\"Army Dreamers\\". Never for Ever was her first album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's eponymous third album in early 1980. It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status, and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top. The top-selling single from the album was \\"Babooshka\\", which reached number five in the UK singles chart. In November 1980, she released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again\\", which reached number 29 in the UK charts. September 1982 saw the release of The Dreaming, the first album Bush produced by herself. With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. The Dreaming received a mixed reception in the UK, and critics were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become \\"less accessible\\". In a 1993 interview with Q (magazine), Bush stated: \\"That was my 'She's gone mad' album.\\" However, the album became her first to enter the US Billboard 200 chart, albeit only reaching number 157. The album entered the UK album chart at number-three, but is to date her lowest-selling album, garnering only a silver disc.\\"Sat in Your Lap\\" was the first single from the album to be released.

Swaddling is believed to recreate the coziness of the womb, and may enhance the calming impact of other soothing steps. Once swaddled, turn baby on their side and gently jiggle them. Shush them loudly — make sure they can hear you over their own screaming. Think about how loud the vacuum cleaner is — that's the kind of volume it might take to get their attention. The recurring motion may soothe your shrieking baby and get them to stop crying, at least briefly. While it’s tempting to let a crying baby sleep anywhere they please, experts recommend not letting babies sleep in swings, carriers, car seats, etc. — try to get them to sleep in a safe, secure crib. Driving, strolling, or even carrying your baby around may provide some relief to both of you. Some people swear by car rides as a colic remedy — bundle the baby up, buckle them in, and within ten minutes in the car, their cries might be quieted. Or, if you prefer fresh air and exercise, going for walks with a baby carriage can also work. If you have tasks or chores to do, try using a baby sling or carrier that holds the baby close to your body, yet leaves both hands free as you walk around the house. The vibrations can be calming to a baby. Secure the baby properly in a car seat or a baby bouncer. Do not ever leave your baby on a washing machine or dryer unattended. Try the vacuum cleaner. It sounds odd, but many parents swear it works. Just set the baby in the bassinet or car seat and let them become fascinated by a sound louder than they're making. Or, turn on a floor fan or window air conditioner. Make sure it’s an older, roaring type, not some new whisper-quiet model. You might also want to invest in a sound machine that mimics a mother's heart beat (or makes other white noise sounds). This can be a lifesaver for both parent and child. Lay the baby on their stomach across your knees — but remember to support the head at all times. Jiggle your feet up and down and pat softly. This vibration can be very soothing. Instead of over-stimulating your baby's senses, see if reducing external stimulation works. Lie on your back in a quiet, dark place. Hold the baby firmly on your chest with their head over your heart. Raising your knees with your feet flat on a solid surface, rock yourself, calming the infant.

Hinton accidentally... (Associated Press) DALLAS (AP) — An attorney handling Johnny Manziel's domestic violence case expressed doubts about the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback's ability to stay clean and said he was given a receipt that shows Manziel may have spent more than 1,000 at a drug paraphernalia store just 15 hours after he was involved in a hit-and-run crash, according to a lengthy text message accidentally sent to The Associated Press. Defense attorney Bob Hinton's text indicated Manziel's legal team was seeking a plea deal with prosecutors, but suggested that could be tricky. \\"Heaven help us if one of the conditions is to pee in a bottle,\\" the attorney wrote. Hinton also wrote that he had been emailed a \\"heads up\\" receipt \\"which purports to reflect\\" that Manziel made a purchase of 1,018.77 at a Gas Pipe store at 12:03 p.m. on Tuesday, less than a day after his crash. A manager at a Gas Pipe location not far from where Manziel's crash was reported declined to discuss whether he bought anything there. A sign in the store says ID is required for purchases above 200. \\"I don't know if the receipt is legitimate or not,\\" Hinton responded when asked about it by the AP. \\"I just know that it doesn't say Johnny's name on it anywhere that I can see. It's just that somebody in that store, I guess, circulated that to the other store managers and employees saying, 'Guess who was here today and spent this amount of money.' That's all I know.\\" The errant text was sent Wednesday after the AP sought comment via text about Monday night's crash. When asked about the text, Hinton said he had meant to send it to co-counsel Jim Darnell and was unaware the AP had received it instead. He insisted the contents were protected by attorney-client privilege and threatened to sue if certain details were published. Manziel's spokeswoman, Denise Michaels, said in a statement to the AP that Hinton \\"has always only operated on the periphery of this case.\\" \\"Lead counsel Jim Darnell has told me from the beginning that he would never have Johnny plead guilty in this and that position has not changed,\\" Michaels said. The text shows that Manziel's attorneys are pushing for leniency, even as they grapple with indications he could still be struggling with substance abuse more than a year after his stay in a rehab center. The charges the former Cleveland Browns quarterback is facing come amid heightened scrutiny of legal cases involving professional athletes following domestic violence accusations against NFL players Ray Rice and Greg Hardy. The 23-year-old Manziel is accused of hitting and threatening former girlfriend Colleen Crowley during a night out in January. He faces a misdemeanor assault charge that carries a penalty of up to a year in jail and a 4,000 fine. As the case has played out, the 2012 Heisman winner at Texas A&M has been photographed partying from Hollywood to Las Vegas to New York in recent months, and his own family has expressed concern about his well-being after he was cut by the Browns this year following two underwhelming seasons. On Friday, Manziel's father, Paul, told ESPN.com his son has refused repeated efforts to help him. \\"I don't know what to say other than my son is a druggie and he needs help,\\" he told the website. \\"If I have to bury him, I'll bury him. That's the fact. So if not, if he calls me and needs help, I'll go get him. Until then, he's on his own. I've done everything I can do.\\" Hinton's text said the Gas Pipe receipt was sent to him by an attorney who is involved in a federal case accusing two people affiliated with the chain of making and selling synthetic marijuana. Michaels called the purchase \\"a rumor.\\" \\"We don't know for sure whether the receipt does or doesn't represent a purchase he made since there are always unfounded stories flying around, but we all make it a policy to keep each other up to date on them,\\" she said. Hinton also wrote that he had met Wednesday morning with Jerry Varney, an administrative chief in the Dallas County District Attorney's Office. \\"He is very interested in working with us to arrive at some agreement\\" in the case, he wrote. A spokeswoman for the DA's office did not comment. Dallas police said Manziel reported that his car had been struck Monday night in a hit-and-run, but Hinton said in the text that there was \\"conflict as to whether Johnny reported it or not.\\" Manziel was not seriously injured. It's unclear how close Manziel's domestic violence case is to being resolved. Similar cases usually result in deferred adjudication probation, meaning the charges are dismissed after one to two years, said David Finn, a Dallas attorney and former judge who is not associated with the Manziel case. Finn said drug-testing conditions depend on whether the defendant has shown a pattern of substance abuse. The defendant is normally required to enroll in anger management classes and a domestic violence program, an outcome similar to that of Dallas Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant when he faced a misdemeanor charge in 2012 over an incident in which he allegedly struck his mother with a hat. Manziel's rise and fall has long been punctuated with headlines for his off-field partying. The Browns selected the player dubbed \\"Johnny Football\\" in 2014, but he struggled on the field and was dropped this year. Since the 2015 season ended, two agents have cut ties with Manziel after demanding a second trip to rehab. He also faces potential punishment from the NFL under tougher standards regarding domestic violence cases adopted in 2014 following the Rice case. However, he is not currently with a team, and therefore not subject to league policies. The allegations stem from a night out on Jan. 30. Crowley alleged Manziel accosted her at a Dallas hotel, a confrontation that continued downstairs to the valet station. She said he forced her into a car and that a valet disregarded her pleas for help. The two eventually drove to where her car was parked in front of a Dallas bar, she said in an affidavit. She said Manziel got into the driver's seat and began to drive. Crowley said Manziel stopped when she tried to jump out of the car, but that he then dragged her back inside and hit her. ___ This story has been corrected to show ESPN.com interview was Friday. ||||| Josina Anderson joins SportsCenter and provides an insight into how Johnny Manziel's parents are dealing with their son's condition with drugs and alcohol.

He was booked and went before a judge last month and told not to have any contact whatsoever with Crowley. He also had to sign an affidavit confirming he doesn't own any firearms and that there aren't any firearms where he lives. The NFL has said it is looking into the incident and Manziel could face discipline under the league's personal-conduct policy.

What is \\"Who was the star witness at the Senate Watergate hearings ?\\" asking about?","completion":"The question \\"Who was the star witness at the Senate Watergate hearings?\\" is asking for the identity of the key or central witness who gave essential testimony during the Senate hearings into the Watergate scandal. These hearings were held in 1973 by the United States Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, which was established to investigate the Watergate break-in and the subsequent cover-up by President Richard Nixon's administration. Before delving into the details of the hearings and the star witness, it is crucial to first understand the Watergate scandal itself. In June 1972, five men were arrested for breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters located in the Watergate office building in Washington, D.C. It was later discovered that the burglars were connected to President Nixon's reelection campaign, and they were trying to gather information and plant listening devices in the Democratic Party's offices. The Nixon administration initially tried to cover up its involvement, but mounting evidence and relentless media coverage eventually led to a series of damning revelations. To investigate these allegations and maintain public transparency, the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, chaired by Senator Sam Ervin, began holding hearings in May 1973. These hearings were televised, and millions of Americans followed them closely. Key administration officials and individuals involved in the scandal testified before the committee, providing a wealth of information about the break-in, the cover-up, and any possible abuse of presidential power. The star witness at these hearings was John Dean, who served as White House Counsel for President Nixon from July 1970 to April 1973. Dean had a significant role in the Watergate cover-up, participating in events such as facilitating the payment of hush money to the arrested burglars and attempting to derail investigations into the break-in. However, he became increasingly uneasy with the cover-up's criminal aspects and potential consequences. In his testimony, which took place from June 25 to June 29, 1973, Dean provided a detailed account of his role in, as well as his knowledge of, the Watergate scandal and the Nixon administration's efforts to obstruct justice. He implicated several top White House officials, including President Nixon himself, revealing that the president had direct knowledge of the cover-up and had participated in several attempts to obstruct the investigation. Dean also disclosed the existence of a secret White House taping system, which ultimately provided crucial evidence against President Nixon. John Dean's testimony was a turning point in the Watergate hearings, captivating the attention of both the committee members and the American public. His extensive knowledge of the inner workings of the White House, combined with his ability to connect events and individuals within the scandal, made his testimony invaluable to the Senate Committee's investigation. In many ways, Dean's dramatic and far-reaching revelations laid the groundwork for the subsequent impeachment processes against President Nixon, who resigned on August 8, 1974, to avoid an imminent impeachment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although the cat is white in both sentences, they have a different situation, and sentence 2 provides more detailed appearance information. Step 4: Rate the textual similarity Based on the analysis, I would rate the textual similarity as a 2 out of 5. The sentences have some similarity in terms of the cat's color, but the location and appearance details differ significantly, leading to a low overlap in overall meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: what is the name for the oldest island in the hawaiian hot spots I found the following answer on Google: The volatile state of the Hawaiian volcanoes and their constant battle with the sea was a major element in Hawaiian mythology , embodied in Pele , the deity of volcanoes. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer provided does not accurately address the question regarding the name for the oldest island in the Hawaiian hotspots. While the mention of Pele, the deity of volcanoes, and the volatile nature of Hawaiian volcanoes is interesting and related to the topic, it doesn't answer the specific question about the oldest island. The correct answer would be Kure Atoll or Ocean Island, which is considered the oldest island in the Hawaiian hotspots. The Hawaiian hotspot is a volcanic hotspot located in the North Pacific Ocean, forming a chain of volcanic islands and seamounts that include the Hawaiian Islands. As the Pacific tectonic plate moves northwestward over the fixed hotspot, new islands form while older islands move away from the hotspot and eventually erode. Kure Atoll, also known as Ocean Island, is located at the northwest end of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, more than 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) northwest of the main Hawaiian Islands. Kure Atoll is part of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument and is the northernmost point of the Hawaiian Archipelago. Its age is estimated at around 30 million years old, making it the oldest island in the Hawaiian hotspots created by volcanic activity. In summary, the answer to the question, \\"What is the name for the oldest island in the Hawaiian hotspots?\\" is Kure Atoll or Ocean Island, and not the information related to the Hawaiian mythology and Pele, the deity of volcanoes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although there is some evidence of earlier inhabitation in the region of Utrecht, dating back to the Stone Age (app. 2200 BCE) and settling in the Bronze Age (app. 1800–800 BCE), the founding date of the city is usually related to the construction of a Roman fortification (castellum), probably built in around 50 CE. A series of such fortresses was built after the Roman emperor Claudius decided the empire should not expand north. To consolidate the border the limes Germanicus defense line was constructed along the main branch of the river Rhine, which at that time flowed through a more northern bed compared to today (what is now the Kromme Rijn). These fortresses were designed to house a cohort of about 500 Roman soldiers. Near the fort settlements would grow housing artisans, traders and soldiers' wives and children. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What was first built in 50 BCE","completion":"The question about what was first built in 50 BCE cannot be specifically answered, as it would depend on various regions or areas around the world and their respective development and historical contexts during that time. However, some notable events and constructions that occurred around 50 BCE include: 1. Julius Caesar completing the conquest of Gaul (modern-day France and Belgium) and consolidating Roman power in the region. 2. Construction of various buildings, temples, and structures in the Roman Republic and other parts of the ancient world, two of which are the Temple of Apollo in Pompeii and the Theater of Marcellus in Rome. 3. Expansion of the Han dynasty in China, with Emperor Wu of Han leading advancements in infrastructure and culture.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was honored in 1884 and awarded with a lifetime pension? from the following article ? Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (English: chy-KOF-skee; Russian: Пётр Ильи́ч Чайко́вский, tr. Pyótr Ilʹyích Chaykóvskiy, IPA: [pʲɵtr ɪlʲˈjitɕ tɕɪjˈkofskʲɪj] (listen); 7 May 1840 [O.S. 25 April] – 6 November [O.S. 25 October] 1893), was a Russian composer of the romantic period, whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension. Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity... Answer:","completion":"Tchaikovsky"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: Any food scraps or stains need to be removed prior to storage as these tend to attract insects as their own food source. Also remove dirt, smudges and any other source of stains. The safest method for cleaning a quilt is vacuuming, followed by airing, then washing. Each approach is discussed in the following steps. The best vacuum is a hand-held one, such as a dust buster. Alternatively, use the upholstery nozzle of a standard household vacuum cleaner, covered with muslin/cheesecloth or similar light fabric. Set the vacuum to the lowest level and sweep it back and forth across the quilt to collect loose fluff, debris and dirt. Check that the quilt looks okay before deciding whether anything further is needed before storage. If the quilt is antique, place a nylon or fiberglass screen across the quilt before vacuuming; this will protect the fibers from the strong suction. If the only noticeable problem with the quilt is that it smells musty or unpleasant, airing might be the answer. To air the quilt: Wait for a dry day without too much wind. Find a suitable shady spot outside. The spot should be fairly clean, such as concrete, nice grass or fresh new leaves, etc. Don't choose a spot where there is a lot of dust liable to blow over the quilt. Throw a large cotton sheet across the ground. This will keep the quilt separate from the surface, preventing any potential stains. Lay the quilt over the sheet, taking care not to overlap at the edges. Alternatively, a quilt that is in good, strong condition can be laid over a clothesline. If so, throw the base sheet over several of the lines of the clothesline (as if you were laying the table), then drape the quilt across the sheet, over the several lines. This method will probably use up all of the clothesline, so avoid doing it on a usual washing day. Avoid pinning the quilt to the clothesline as usually done for drying clothing, as this will stretch the stitches and fibers too much. This requires full knowledge on your behalf of what can happen to the quilt, and given that quilts are made from varying materials, this can be hard to know sometimes. Issues that you might encounter include dyes running, fabric shrinkage, stretched stitches and fibers due to the heaviness of being wet and pummeling by the washing process itself. To know whether or not it's okay to wash the quilt, answer the following questions: Do you know the age of the quilt? A more recent quilt may be less impacted by a wash than an older one. What condition is the quilt in? If it's already falling apart, washing is not really an option. However, it is possible to baste fraying edges with tulle, organza or netting before washing, provided you're up for the extra effort. Have you tested the fabric dyes in the quilt? This is easier done if you made the quilt as you'll likely have swatches of the fabric pieces used. If it's an heirloom quilt, and the person who made it is still alive, ask this person whether the fabrics are dye-fast. If neither is possible, test by dampening a back or non-obvious section of each fabric pieces and blot with a white face washer or other cloth. If the dye comes off on the blotter, you'll know it's going to run during a wash. Even if it doesn't come off on the blotter, try this test again with a little detergent this time; if the dye shows, the fabric will run when detergent is added. If both tests show no dye, it's safe to wash. Has the quilt been washed before? If so, you'll already know how it stood up to a wash. Is the quilt strong or fragile? Only strong quilts should be washed. If you've answered the above questions to your satisfaction, consider washing by hand. Machine washing is really only suitable for very strong quilts (or those cheap ones made in China that you intend to only hang on to for a short time). The bathtub is the best place as it's big and there's plenty of room to maneuver. Ideally, you will need a helper to wash and lift the wet quilt. Fill the bath about 8 inches/20cm with lukewarm/tepid water. (If your local water is hard, consider using distilled water or rainwater from the tank, heated in a kettle or saucepan.) Lower a large sheet into the bath first. This acts as a \\"sling\\" for the quilt. Gently lower the quilt onto the sheet. Press gently across the quilt. Swish the water around gently, but not the quilt; keep it steady. If using a detergent, make sure it is suitable for the quilt. Ask at a local quilt retailer or society for advice on a suitable detergent. A wool wash will usually be okay if you can't find a specialized detergent but dilute it before adding it to the bathwater. Drain the water, taking care to keep the quilt away from the drain suction. Refill with lukewarm water for a rinse cycle. Gently agitate, drain again. Do this about 4 to 6 times until you feel the quilt has been cleaned adequately and the detergent is off the quilt. Drain one last time. Pat the quilt with large dry and clean towels. These will start to absorb leftover water from the quilt. Lift the quilt out of the bath by holding the corners of the sheet it is sitting on. Carry it outside to dry (see Airing above, although you may wish to substitute a blanket for a sheet on the ground). This really needs to be done with a helper, to prevent a mishap (and wet quilts tend to be heavy). When drying, place right side down to keep this as clean as possible. Allow to dry completely. It should not be stored until it is completely dry, to avoid the possibility of mildew growth. This is riskier than washing by hand but may be suitable for a strong, modern quilt that you know won't run when washed. It's also a fairly painful process because you can't just shove the quilt in and walk away. Here is what to do: Check that the quilt will fit. Many times they won't and it's no good pushing it in so tightly that it'll break the washing machine. Use the delicate washing cycle only. Use wool wash for the detergent, or a suitable quilt detergent. Check the progress of the washing every half a minute. Stop the washing after 3 minutes. Use a short rinse cycle. If you have a gentle spin dry, use this. Remove the quilt from the washing machine. Dry as for Airing above. These aren't just old, they're usually very delicate and they've suffered their fair share of wear and tear. The fibers and colors of such quilts are likely to have been exposed to light, moisture and acidic conditions over time and hence will have weakened. If the quilt seems too fragile to wash, call a local museum or textile conservator society to ask for their opinion. There will usually be someone in such a community organization who is willing to offer advice on the best cleaning options. Do not give an antique quilt to a dry cleaner unless a select service is recommended by a quilt society or textile conservator.","completion":"Food scraps, stains, and dirt should be removed from quilts before storage, as they can attract insects. Three cleaning methods recommended are vacuuming, airing, and washing, each of which is elaborated upon below. Vacuuming is the safest method.

For antique quilts, place a nylon or fiberglass screen on the quilt to protect fibers. Assess the quilt afterwards to determine if further cleaning is needed. Airing the quilt can help if it smells musty. Wait for a dry day and find an outdoor shady, clean spot. Lay a large cotton sheet on the ground and place the quilt on top, being careful not to overlap edges. Strong quilts can be draped over a clothesline draped with a sheet, but avoid pinning the quilt to the line as it can stretch fibers.

After a month or so of dating, you may want to take the relationship to the next level. This can be complicated if a child is involved and you and your partner need to be able to communicate openly about where things are headed. Define the terms of the relationship. All relationships come with a set of expectations that develop naturally over time. After a certain point, however, you should have an open discussion about what you both expect. How serious are you about one another? Can you picture a future with this person? If so, how should you proceed? If not, is it worth it to continue dating for the time being? In terms of physical intimacy, a child can complicate things. Sex may have to occur when the child is out of the house and it may not be possible for you spend the night. Your partner might not be comfortable having you stay overnight until you've been together for awhile. You want to make sure you're respectful of your partner's wishes and boundaries. If you're in a serious relationship and your partner as a child, you should have a talk about the future. You need to know where you stand in the frame of your partner's family. Do you see yourself ultimately ending up with your partner? Do the two of you want the same things in regards to family and career? Do you share similar values about raising children? Can any big differences between the two of you be reconciled in a healthy manner? In the event you get engaged or married, how do you factor into the child's life? Would you be a step parent? Would you be granted any legal rights in regards to custody? Would the child refer to you as \\"Mom\\" or \\"Dad\\" or keep using your first name? Meet the ex. At some point, your partner's co-parent will want to meet you. He or she will be invested in what kind of person you are as you'll be spending a lot of time with his or her child. Talk to your partner about meeting his or her ex and what the expectations are for your behavior during this meeting. In the event you marry or become engaged, you'll become a step parent to the child. You need to make sure you're ready for this kind of commitment. Remember, needs should come before wants. Once you're a step parent, you're no longer the child's friend. You need to be able to set rules and encourage the child to their chores and homework and go to bed on time. You and your partner will need to start creating new family traditions. Once you become a step parent, there will be a whole new family unit. To help the child feel like the three of you are a family, introduce new activities like board game nights, family dinners, and special games and events around the holiday season. Communicate openly with your partner. It's unlikely to the two of you will always be on the same page in regards to parenting. You should keep communication open throughout the course of your relationship so that any disputes can be resolved smoothly. Summary:","completion":"1. Define the terms of the relationship - Have an open discussion about your expectations, seriousness, and future plans. 2.

Movie plot title: The Mummy Movie plot: In Egypt, circa 1290 BC, high priest Imhotep engages in an affair with Anck-su-Namun, the mistress of Pharaoh Seti, despite strict rules that other men are forbidden to touch her. When the Pharaoh discovers their tryst, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murder the monarch. Imhotep is dragged away by his priests before the Pharaoh's guards can discover his involvement; Anck-su-Namun then kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. After Anck-su-Namun's burial, Imhotep breaks into her crypt and steals her corpse. He and his priests flee across the desert to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, where they begin the resurrection ceremony. However, they are caught by Seti's guards before the ritual could be completed, and Anck-su-Namun's soul is sent back to the Underworld. For their sacrilege, Imhotep's priests are mummified alive, and Imhotep himself is forced to endure the curse of Hom Dai: his tongue is cut out and he is buried alive with a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs. The ritual curses him to become an immortal walking plague if he were ever to be resurrected. He is buried under high security, sealed away in a sarcophagus below a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis, and kept under strict surveillance throughout the ages by the Medjai, descendants of Seti's palace guards. If Imhotep were ever to be released, the powers that made him immortal would allow him to unleash a wave of destruction and death upon the Earth.In 1923, soldiers from the French Foreign Legion, led by American Rick O'Connell, make a final stand at Hamunaptra against an overwhelming force of Medjai warriors. The soldiers are massacred and O'Connell makes a final retreat inside the city, only to be cornered by a group of Medjai. However, they flee when Imhotep's evil presence manifests itself, leaving him to die in the desert.In 1926, Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist, Evelyn Carnahan is presented with an intricate box and map by her bumbling brother Jonathan, who says he found it in Thebes.

But eating organic food could make you fat, experts have warned. A studyhas shown that people tend to believe that organic foods contain fewer calories, so buy and eat more. But people who decide to \\"go organic\\" could soon find themselves piling on the pounds. The warning comes from American researchers who studied whether the sight of an organic label was enough to influence a person's choice. For example, if people believe organic foods, produced without using pesticides and artificial fertilizers , have fewer calories, they may end up eating far too much and spending less time on sports activities and put on weight. Cornell University researchers said: \\" Some people mistakenly think that these foods are more nutritious , just because they carry an organic label.\\" \\"The growing popularity of organic foods has led to some concern, as these foods may not necessarily be healthier than non-organic ones, but still may lead consumers to nutritional mis-judgments. If people feel a food to be more nutritious, they tend to let their guard down when it comes to counting calories---in the end leading them to overeat.\\" Although a small number of differences in nutrient content were found to exist between organically-produced crops and traditionally-produced ones, these are of little health importance.

Melungeon ( m@-LUN-j@n) is a term traditionally applied to one of numerous \\"tri-racial isolate\\" groups of the Southeastern United States. Historically, Melungeons were associated with the Cumberland Gap area of central Appalachia, which includes portions of East Tennessee, Southwest Virginia, and eastern Kentucky. Tri-racial describes populations thought to be of mixed European, African and Native American ancestry. Although there is no consensus on how many such groups exist, estimates range as high as 200. According to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, which Virginia incorporated into law in 1662, children were assigned the social status and ethnicity of their mother, regardless of their father's ethnicity or citizenship. This meant the children of African slave mothers were born into slavery. But it also meant the children of free white or mulatto women, even if fathered by enslaved African men, were born free. The free descendants of such unions formed many of the oldest free families of color. Early colonial Virginia was very much a \\"melting pot\\" of peoples, and some of these early multiracial families were ancestors of the later Melungeons. Each family line has to be traced separately. Over the generations, most individuals of the group called Melungeon were persons of mixed European and African descent, whose ancestors had been free in colonial Virginia. Edward Price's dissertation on Mixed-Blood Populations of the Eastern United States as to Origins, Localizations, and Persistence (1950) stated that children of European and free black unions had intermarried with persons of Native American ancestry. These conclusions have been largely upheld in subsequent scholarly and genealogical studies. In 1894, the U.S. Department of the Interior, in its \\"Report of Indians Taxed and Not Taxed,\\" noted that the Melungeons in Hawkins County \\"claim to be Cherokee of mixed blood\\". The term Melungeon has since sometimes been applied as a catch-all phrase for a number of groups of mixed-race ancestry. In 2012, the genealogist Roberta Estes and her fellow researchers reported that the Melungeon lines likely originated in the unions of black and white indentured servants living in Virginia in the mid-1600s before slavery became widespread. They concluded that as laws were put in place to prevent the mixing of races, the family groups could only intermarry with each other. They migrated together from western Virginia through the Piedmont frontier of North Carolina, before settling primarily in the mountains of East Tennessee.

Information: - The is a period in Japanese history marked by social upheaval, political intrigue and near-constant military conflict. Japanese historians named it after the otherwise unrelated Warring States period in China. It came to an end when all political power was unified under the Tokugawa shogunate. - The Warring States period was an era in ancient Chinese history following the Spring and Autumn period and concluding with the Qin wars of conquest that saw the annexation of all other contender states, which ultimately led to the Qin state's victory in 221 BC as the first unified Chinese empire known as the Qin dynasty. Although different scholars point toward different dates ranging from 481 BC to 403 BC as the true beginning of the Warring States, Sima Qian's choice of 475 BC is generally the most often cited and popularly accepted one. The Warring States era also overlaps with the second half of the Eastern Zhou dynasty, though the Chinese sovereign, known as the king of Zhou, ruled merely as a figurehead and served as a backdrop against the machinations of the warring states. - Shinmen Sokan ( active 16th century ) was a Japanese lord , daimyo of the Shinmen clan ( Shinmen - shi ) during the middle of the Sengoku period . Sokan was known as a rather petty daimyo in the mountainous regions of Sakushu , which was west of Kyoto . Even though this was so , the Shinmen clan had very good ties with that of the Hirata family , leading to the Shinmen receiving a good amount of support . One such swordsman of note that served under Sokan was the famous Shinmen Munisai , the father of the legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi . In 1589 , Sokan ordered Munisai to kill Honiden Gekinosuke ( a minor student under Munisai ) for unknown reasons . Due to this fact however , Munisai was forced to leave his village of Miyamoto . - , also known as Shinmen Takez, Miyamoto Bennosuke or, by his Buddhist name, Niten Draku, was an expert Japanese swordsman and rnin. Musashi, as he was often simply known, became renowned through stories of his excellent and unique double-bladed swordsmanship and undefeated record in his 60 duels (next to 33 of It Ittsai). He was the founder of the Hyh Niten Ichi-ry or Niten-ry style of swordsmanship and in his final years authored , a book on strategy, tactics, and philosophy that is still studied today. - , which can be loosely translated as \\"the school of the strategy of two heavens as one\\", is a kory (ancient school), transmitting a style of classical Japanese swordsmanship conceived by the warrior Miyamoto Musashi. Hyh Niten Ichi-ry is mainly known for the two-swordkatana and wakizashikenjutsu techniques Musashi called \\"Niten Ichi\\" (, \\"two heavens as one\\") or \\"Nit Ichi\\" (, \\"two swords as one\\"). - Originally named It Yagor, he at the age of fourteen found himself in a little seaside village called Izu. Legend tells that he floated across the Sagami Bay on a piece of driftwood from shima Island, part of the Izu Islands. The trust of the local villagers was earned when Yagor chased away a group of bandits that went around raiding and pillaging. As he desired to be a great swordsman, the villagers paid for Yagor's travels in seeking out a master. On his journey, Yagor reached Tsurugaoka Hachimang Shinto shrine in Kamakura where he paid homage to the gods and practiced his swordsmanship. One particular day, an unknown assailant tried to attack Yagor but he somehow unconsciously and without thinking drew his sword and cut him down in one swift stroke. Not understanding this technique, Yagor would later describe it as \\"Musken\\" (), a fundamental aspect of his swordsmanship's philosophy. Musken is either an offensive or defensive technique that is delivered spontaneously and without thinking, fully anticipating an opponent's movement; a type of extra-sensory perception similar to mushin. - A was a samurai with no lord or master during the feudal period (11851868) of Japan.

The cinematographer is clearly in love with the place. But this is no happy travelogue, and — given the high level of local menace and corruption portrayed on the show — the Belize tourism groups are probably going to hate it. This paradise will be lost, suddenly and brutally, and so will the vestiges of youth that the show’s middle-age characters are clinging to. In “Mad Dogs,” things go from bad to worse, and then a few more steps from worse to worst, a little like they did in “Fargo,” as the fall of one calamity knocked the next one down like a set of dominos. Actually, the show, whose first season is available on Friday, reminds me most of all of “Deliverance,” where men naively head straight into the heart of darkness. “Mad Dogs” is about the myths of masculinity, as they fall apart and men are forced to become simply human. The show begins with a group of five longtime friends reuniting after many years at the lush Belize villa of the wealthy one, Milo (Billy Zane). They’re on vacation, and trying to recapture some of their old banter. The cast is top-notch, with Michael Imperioli, Steve Zahn, Romany Malco, and Ben Chaplin acting like a bunch of fun-loving dudes having their male-only “Big Chill” moment — but then also bringing a palpable undercurrent of tension and competition that gradually rises to the surface. Early on, Milo, who is dodgy about how he has made his money, tells the group that if something happens to him they’ll inherit the villa; from that moment on, the men’s ears and hackles and suspicions all perk up. The show is co-produced by Shawn Ryan of “The Shield” and the short-lived “Terriers,” and it’s based on fellow co-producer Cris Cole’s UK series of the same title. It moves along at a thriller’s pace, as the men’s troubles accumulate, and there are a lot of satisfying plot turns, blackly comic moments, and guest appearances along the way. These guys don’t always make sensible decisions, just like the innocents in “Fargo,” whose blamelessness became increasingly compromised as they tried to get out of a giant pickle. But I don’t think “Mad Dogs” is asking us to make complex moral judgments about the characters. They are dealing with their mortality, both literally and psychologically, as the series unfolds. The question that lurks behind the drama is: Will they, can they, help one another out?

Use a small mason or other jar with a tight lid, place paint in, and screw the lid in a clockwise direction. Step 2: Assess the most reasonable option Analyze the provided options (A and B) and determine the main difference, which is the direction of screwing the lid of the jar on. Generally, screwing lids on in a clockwise direction tightens them, while a counterclockwise direction loosens them. Step 3: Choose the option that involves tightening the lid Since the goal is to store the paint without it drying out or spilling, the tightness of the lid is essential. Therefore, the most logical choice is Option B, as it involves screwing the lid in a clockwise direction, which is tightening the lid. Step 4: Implement the chosen solution To perform the task, follow these steps: 1. Get a small mason jar or another jar with a tight lid. 2. Clean the jar if needed so there is no residue or dust inside. 3. Carefully pour the unused paint into the jar, filling it up to an appropriate level to leave some room for the lid to close tightly. 4. Place the lid on top of the jar. 5.

This is a British (Excelsior Films) version of an M-G-M musical complete with second tier stars. I would imagine that Vera-Ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star. But, I'm sorry to say, Ms. Ellen's chance did not pay off. Opening with a horrible Scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune, this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy. The predictable mistaken identity plot is very thin, and with the exception of David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is way over the top in his role of a Producer) and Bobby Howes (who is totally wasted in a nothing role) the rest of the cast is totally forgettable.

My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter. If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well. I still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you.

Which Yuri was president of the USSR for two years after heading the KGB for 15 years????","completion":"The Yuri you are referring to is Yuri Vladimirovich Andropov. He was the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) – the equivalent of president – and head of state of the USSR from November 12, 1982, until his death on February 9, 1984. Before becoming the leader of the Soviet Union, Andropov served as the Chairman of the Committee for State Security (KGB) for 15 years, from 1967 to 1982. Yuri Andropov was born on June 15, 1914, in Nagutskoye, Russia. He began his political career in 1939 when he became the secretary of the Central Committee of the Komsomol in the Karelo-Finnish SSR. In 1944, he joined the Communist Party and took up various administrative and political roles. In 1954, Andropov joined the Soviet diplomatic service, being posted to Hungary as an ambassador, where he played a vital role in the brutal suppression of the 1956 Hungarian Uprising. His actions caught the attention of the Soviet leadership, and by the early 1960s, Andropov was appointed as the head of the newly established Department for Liaison with Socialist Countries within the Central Committee administration. In 1967, Andropov took over as the head of the KGB, where he gained a reputation as an effective and resourceful leader. He is known for overseeing the crackdown on political dissidents and maintaining strict control over the organization's foreign and domestic operations. His tenure witnessed the KGB's role expanding in suppressing internal dissent and monitoring activities of potential opponents. In 1982, upon the death of Leonid Brezhnev, Andropov was appointed as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. As the leader of the Soviet Union, he embarked on a new course of political and economic reforms. He attempted to improve discipline and productivity within the Communist Party and the workforce, implementing anti-corruption measures and campaigns to fight against alcohol abuse. Andropov also sought to rejuvenate the leadership, promoting younger, more technically competent officials to key positions. In terms of foreign policy, he pursued détente with the United States and aimed to find a solution to issues like nuclear disarmament and arms control. However, Andropov's term as the Soviet leader was short-lived due to his deteriorating health. He suffered from chronic kidney disease, and his health worsened significantly during his time in office. Andropov passed away on February 9, 1984, after serving just over a year as the General Secretary of the Communist Party. His successor, Konstantin Chernenko, continued his efforts to reform the Soviet Union but faced similar limitations due to his poor health. Eventually, it was Mikhail Gorbachev, who took office after Chernenko's death, that brought about significant changes in the Soviet Union with his policies of Perestroika and Glasnost."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While Raff was able to offer \\"practical suggestions [in orchestration] which were of great value to Liszt\\", there may have been \\"a basic misunderstanding\\" of the nature of their collaboration. Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me.\\"Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff. Walker writes that Joachim later recalled to Raff's widow \\"that he had seen Raff 'produce full orchestral scores from piano sketches.'\\" Joachim also told Raff's biographer Andreas Moser that \\"the E-flat-major Piano Concerto was orchestrated from beginning to end by Raff.\\" Raff's and Joachim's statements effectively questioned the authorship of Liszt's orchestral music, especially the symphonic poems. This speculation was debased when composer and Liszt scholar Peter Raabe carefully compared all sketches then known of Liszt's orchestral works with the published versions of the same works.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person the soldiers try to take the staff from? South Boston teenager Jason Tripitikas is a fan of martial arts films and awakens from a dream of a battle between the Monkey King and celestial soldiers in the clouds. He visits a pawn shop in Chinatown to buy wuxia DVDs and discovers a golden staff. On his way home, Tripitikas is harassed by some hooligans, whose leader Lupo attempts to use him to help them rob the shop-owner Hop, who is shot by Lupo. Hop tells Tripitikas to deliver the staff to its rightful owner and Tripitikas flees with the staff. He is cornered on the rooftop before being pulled off the roof by the staff. When Tripitikas regains consciousness, he finds himself in a village in ancient China that is under attack by armored soldiers. The soldiers see his staff and attempt to seize it. He is saved by the inebriated traveling scholar Lu Yan, a supposed \\"immortal,\\" who remains alert and agile even when drunk. Lu tells him the story of the rivalry between the Monkey King and the Jade Warlord.

The Olympic Broadcast Center is responsible for transmitting the live coverage of the sporting events worldwide and sharing the unforgettable moments experienced by athletes and viewers alike. At around 10:30 AM local time, an anonymous caller informed the authorities about a potential bomb that was supposedly placed inside the premises of the Olympic Broadcast Center. The threat triggered an immediate response from the law enforcement agencies, prioritizing the safety of all individuals within the location. In a matter of minutes, the premises was swiftly evacuated, with all staff members and attendees instructed to vacate the area in an orderly, efficient manner. Collaborating with explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) teams and other emergency services, law enforcement personnel conducted a meticulous search of the broadcast center, utilizing state-of-the-art equipment and assistance from specially trained K9 units to identify any signs of explosive devices. During the operation, the broadcast of several Olympic events was inevitably disrupted, causing a temporary blackout in the live coverage shared with millions of viewers across the globe. Olympic fans eagerly waiting for the outcome of various competitions were left disappointed and concerned about the safety of the athletes, officials, and staff members involved. Meanwhile, security measures and protocols were strictly implemented in all adjacent areas of the Olympic site, ensuring the safety and well-being of every individual in the vicinity. The temporary suspension of several events allowed the teams to adjust their schedules and allocate additional resources to guarantee a swift resolution of the situation. After approximately three hours, the EOD teams and law enforcement personnel completed their search and declared the Olympic Broadcast Center safe and free of any explosive devices. The anonymous bomb threat was confirmed as a hoax, providing relief to all those affected by the distressing incident. In a joint statement released by the Olympic organizers and relevant law enforcement agencies, they expressed gratitude for the efficient response from all parties involved and the cooperation of staff and attendees during the evacuation. Although the anonymous caller disrupted the broadcast schedule and generated unnecessary panic, they assured that safety remained the top priority throughout the incident and commended the professional behavior of all the teams involved. The Olympic Broadcast Center resumed its normal operations shortly after receiving clearance from the authorities. All staff members and attendees returned to their respective roles in delivering the world-class coverage of the Olympic Games. Although this hoax caused a momentary pause during a celebration of international sportsmanship, the passion and dedication of everyone involved assured that the Olympic spirit remained unbroken. Authorities are conducting a thorough investigation into the incident, actively seeking the anonymous caller responsible for the bomb scare. Law enforcement agencies, together with the Olympic organizers, are committed to maintaining a secure and safe environment for everyone involved, and those responsible for causing such disturbances will face prosecution. However, despite the temporary setback, the Olympic Games will continue to showcase the incredible talents of athletes from around the world, captivating the hearts and spirits of millions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Before settling on their current name in January 1984, the band performed under the name Death Cult, which was an evolution of the name of lead singer Ian Astbury's previous band Southern Death Cult. They gained a dedicated following in the UK in the mid-1980s as a post-punk/gothic rock band, with singles such as \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\", before breaking mainstream in the United States in the late 1980s as a hard rock band with singles such as \\"Love Removal Machine\\" and \\"Fire Woman\\". According to music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the band fuse a \\"heavy metal revivalist\\" sound with the \\"pseudo-mysticism ... of The Doors [and] the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin ... while adding touches of post-punk goth rock\\". In 1991, Astbury and Duffy were writing again for their next album. During the demo recordings, Todd Hoffman and James Kottak played bass and drums respectively. During the actual album recording sessions, Curry was recruited again to play drums, with Charley Drayton on bass, and various other performers. Astbury and Duffy's working relationship had disintegrated by that time, with the two men reportedly rarely even being in the studio together during recording. The resulting album Ceremony was released to mixed responses. The album climbed to US No. 34, but sales were not as impressive as the previous three records, only selling around one million copies worldwide. Only two official singles were released from the record: \\"Wild Hearted Son\\" (UK No. 34, Canada No. 41) and \\"Heart of Soul\\" (UK No. 50), although \\"White\\" was released as a single only in Canada, \\"Sweet Salvation\\" was released as a single (as \\"Dulce Salvacion\\") in Argentina in 1992, and the title track \\"Ceremony\\" was released in Spain. The Cult's Ceremonial Stomp tour went through Europe in 1991 and North America in 1992. In 1991 the Cult played a show at the Marquee Club in London, which was recorded and released in February 1993, packaged with some vinyl UK copies of their first greatest hits release. Only a handful of CD copies of it were ever manufactured originally, however it was subsequently reissued on CD in 1999. An incomplete bootleg video of this show is also in circulation. The band were sued by the parents of the Native American boy pictured on the cover of Ceremony, for alleged exploitation and for the unauthorized use of the child's image. This image of the boy is also burned in the video for \\"Wild Hearted Son\\". This lawsuit delayed the release of Ceremony in many countries including South Korea and Thailand, which did not see the record's release until late 1992, and it was unreleased in Turkey until the Cult played several shows in Istanbul in June 1993. A world tour followed with backing from future Thin Lizzy drummer Michael Lee and bassist Kinley Wolfe, and keyboardist John Sinclair returning one last time, and the Gathering of the Tribes moved to the UK. Here artists such as Pearl Jam performed. The warm-up gig to the show, in a small nightclub, was dedicated to the memory of Nigel Preston, who had died a few weeks earlier at the age of 31. Following the release of the single \\"The Witch\\" (#9 in Australia) and the performance of a song for the 1992 Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie soundtrack entitled \\"Zap City\\", produced by Steve Brown and originally a B-side to \\"Lil' Devil\\", two volumes of remixes of \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\", called Sanctuary Mixes MCMXCIII, volumes one and two, and in support of Pure Cult: for Rockers, Ravers, Lovers, and Sinners, a greatest hits compilation which debuted at No. 1 on the British charts and later went to number one in Portugal, Astbury and Duffy fired the \\"backing band\\" and recruited Craig Adams (the Mission) and Scott Garrett for performances across Europe in 1993, with some shows featuring Mike Dimkich on rhythm guitar. This tour marked the first time the band performed in Turkey, Greece, and the Slovak Republic. were there any singles released on ceremony?","completion":"Yes, there were singles released on the Ceremony album.

It took me a lot of hours on Yelp to decide where to have a top notch steak while in Vegas. I mean, it's not like there are 431 steakhouses in Vegas or anything. I am going to do my best to cover all the bases here, but I gotta be honest. Charlie Palmer Steak delivered one of the greatest and most synchronized dining experiences I have ever had and this is how the story goes. The location: Located inside the four seasons hotel, the restaurant itself is a bit darker than I enjoy, but it's a huge location that is very inviting. There is a very nice bar located near the front that seemed to be a bit dead. More than likely that has more to do with the fact that if your reservation is for 7PM you get seated at 7PM. That is how it went on Wednesday night, so I am not sure how it works out on the weekends when there are more folks in town. The menu: Very extensive menu that hits on a number of different price points. They give you an opportunity to go small, medium or big and big is B-I-G!!! They have what's called the \\"cut of the week\\" which is a pri fix menu option that includes 3 courses and two sides for 48. That's a great deal for the amount of food they serve. The Food: I knew before I sat down that I was going to pay a premium for dinner and that wasn't an issue for me. I was just hoping that the food would be off the charts good and I would get what I paid for and that's exactly how it went down. We ordered oysters which were from the pacific northwest (I forget the name but I'm not hypercritical about the specific types of oysters when I dine at a high end restaurant) and they were amazing. Perfectly chilled, perfectly shucked and almost as fresh as the oysters I get here in San Francisco. My date doesn't even dig oysters and she loved them. My date for the evening, Lizzy, ordered their \\"cut of the week\\" option and it was as follows: First course Bib lettuce salad The lettuce was too large to eat and probably could have been chopped to fit on the fork. The blue cheese was really strong for my taste but the bacon lardons were perfectly crisp and delicious. Overall the salad was good, but nothing special. Second course 16 oz. NY Steak The cut was a very large portion and it was cooked almost perfectly. It had a bit too much gristle for my taste but it Lizzy killed it so she clearly didn't have a problem with it. Seasoned well, tender and the sauce that accompanied it was flavorful and a great addition. Dessert Meyer Lemon Creme Brulee Custard is not my thing but I tried it. It was a bit too tart for my taste buds and I wouldn't order it. 2 sides Baby Broccoli and Garlic Mashed Potatoes Baby broccoli was cooked just they way I like it. Crisp, bright green and still crunchy but cooked all the way through. Garlic mashed were good. It tasted like there was a bit of truffle oil goin on but I was focused on the red meat more than the starch. I mean, I didn't come to Vegas for the mashed potatoes. Feel me?? My Entree Surf and Turf Wonderfully seasoned and perfectly cooked filet mignon. Melt in your mouth good and absolutely amazing quality on this cut. Each bite tasted better than the previous bite. half tail of Maine lobster, cooked perfectly, with drawn butter and it was stuffed with a truly delicious mix of lobster, lobster stalk, fresh bread crumbs and a few special ingredients the waiter left out. Lobster meat was pulled away from the shell, which is a nice touch b/c who really wants to sit there with a bib on shucking lobster from the shell? I sure don't. Dessert The waiter comes out with these tiny, fabulous house made ice cream sandwiches, compliments of the chef. They were too kill for! The cookies were soft, delicious and the ice cream was a creamy dream of wonderful. We could have eaten about 8 more of those bad boys without an issue. The service 10 out of 10. The waiter was friendly, he knew the menu up and down, answered all of our questions (and we had plenty) and was on top of his game. A step further. Our waiter had a party of 8 and a party of 6 seated as we were eating dinner. Instead of ditching us all together, another waiter came over to make sure we were doing ok and was also on top of his game. The communication between waiters, servers and the rest of the staff was absolutely perfect and I had never seen anything like it. Something as simple as pouring water in a glass was handled with such care. The waiter would hold a napkin over the glass each time she/he poured making sure we didn't get splashed. At times, they were a bit too fast for their own good. They took away my fork, knife and small plate after they cleared the oysters, but I'm not complaining because I was flat out impressed by the attention to detail. Each and every person working the room had a smile on their face, they were chatty but not too chatty, they took pics of people who wanted them to and it was truly a top notch dining experience and I can't wait to head back for more.

Russia's success at Azov strengthened its positions during the Karlowitz Congress of 1698-1699 and favored the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople in 1700.As Azov's harbor was not convenient for the military fleet, the Tsar selected another more appropriate site on July 27, 1696, on the cape Tagan-Rog . On September 12, 1698, Taganrog was founded there, which became the first military base of the Russian Navy. Although the campaign was a success, it was evident to Peter I of Russia that he achieved only partial results, since his fleet was bottled up in the Sea of Azov due to Crimean and Ottoman control of the Strait of Kerch. A regular navy and specialists who could build and navigate military ships were necessary for resisting the Ottoman attacks. On October 20, 1696, the Boyar Duma decreed the creation of the regular Imperial Russian Navy; this date is considered to be the birthdate of the Russian Navy. The first shipbuilding program consisted of 52 vessels. In 1697, a Russian ambassador present at the Safavid court raised an issue by handing over a note which stipulated that \\"Lezgi, Circassian, and other Caucasian tribesmen, ostensibly Persian subjects\\", had provided assistance to the Ottomans during the Azov campaigns. The report also included the request to declare war on the Ottomans, as well as to repay some 300,000 tomans to the Russians, which the report asserted were owed to the Tsar \\"since the days of shah Safi\\" . Question: What event was first, the founding of Taganrog or the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople? Answer:","completion":"The founding of Taganrog came first before the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople. Taganrog was founded on September 12, 1698, which became the first military base of the Russian Navy. This was a strategic move by Peter I of Russia after the success of the Azov campaigns to establish a stronger naval presence. In contrast, the Treaty of Constantinople was signed later, in 1700, which marked the end of the Russian-Turkish war of 1686-1700. The treaty established a peace agreement between Russia and the Ottoman Empire and confirmed Russia's access to the Azov Sea, among other territorial gains. The success of Russia at Azov and the establishment of Taganrog as a military base strengthened Russia's position during the Karlowitz Congress of 1698-1699, leading to the eventual signing of the Treaty of Constantinople. Overall, the founding of Taganrog preceded the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople and played a crucial role in shaping Russia's maritime power and its diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Legend of Bloody Jack is set in the Alaskan wilderness & starts as a relative of some murderous deceased occultist Lumberjack reads incantations (The Evil Dead (1982) style) from an ancient spell book in an attempt to resurrect him, he succeeds & not being a big believer in family unity the Lumberjack dude kills his relative. Two days later & Ray (Travis Quentin Young) along with his sister Dawn (Erica Hoag), her boyfriend Nick (Craig Bonacorsi) & four of their friends pull up outside a cosy log cabin (The Evil Dead style...) with a view to a relaxing weekend in the wilderness. Unfortuntaely the killer Lumberjack dude show's up with his axe & starts to slaughter the friends one-by-one... Edited, written, executive produced & directed by Todd Portugal this is a pretty rotten modern slasher flick the likes of which are killing the horror genre for me, I'm just not a big fan of ultra low budget horror films with the production values of a holiday video. The script is absolutely terrible in every way for 80 minutes, it has every bad slasher cliché, the character's are awful, the dialogue is terrible & it's hard to care about anyone or anything in this pretty worthless excuse for a teen slasher film. The teens are even more annoying & stupid than usual, the script is more moronic, predictable & flawed than usual & the killer Lumberjack dude is just lame. Then there's the final 10 minutes or so which, if you make it that far & believe it's tough going, produces one of the worst twist ending in slasher film history which as far as I'm concerned pokes fun at us the paying audience who has just had to sit through 90 minutes worth of crap. I will now spoil the ending so anyone who doesn't want to know it stop reading now. Basically just before the end of the film it cuts back to Ray telling a story & it turns out he was telling the story of what we had just seen & Nick & Dawn & everyone else berates him for telling such a bad story (I felt their pain) & then proceed to pick holes in it & laugh at it. From saying why did they stand around & argue, why didn't they pick the axe up & such things, I felt like this was poking fun at the audience as those were the sorts of things I was asking myself while watching this crap & to have it shoved down my throat & made perfectly clear that the makers knew the script was crap & could see all the holes in it & went for a twist ending which unashamedly rubbishes the preceding 80 minutes (which we have just had to sit through remember) is just a little grating. Then to add insult to injury the Lumberjack dude turns up & kills everyone within two minutes, why didn't he do that to start with? It would have saved everyone a lot of time. Director Portugal turns in a real mess, this has the worst continuity between night & day in a film I have ever seen. The whole film is meant to set at night & I suspect the makers tried to use the day for night process but it didn't work & most of it looks like it is set during the day. For example, look at when Lisa is trapped in the bathroom & she climbs out of the window. It is clearly pitch black outside when we are looking out from inside the bathroom but when she falls to the ground & the films cuts to an exterior shot it's bright daylight. Then there's the fact Ranger Vince says we can't get a search party out here until 'the morning' indicating it was supposed to be night, then several minutes later when he walks outside & it looks like it's the middle of the day he is actually carrying around a torch which is clearly on & he is clearly pointing it in the directions where he is looking like it's night. Anytime there is a scene set in the cabin look at the windows, it's pitch black outside & when the Ranger walks in through the door to start with is also another clear example. The continuity in this film is simply the worst I have ever seen. There isn't much gore, there are a few scenes of an axe going into people bodies but nothing memorable. It's not scary, there's no tension or atmosphere & the appalling day & night continuity is just so distracting because it's so obvious. Technically the film is rock bottom, again the continuity between night & day has to been seen to be believed how bad it is. The special effects are poor & they couldn't even afford to show a car blowing up even though it's pretty vital to the plot. This has amateur hour written all over it from start to finish. The acting is absolutely brilliant & everyone involved should get an Oscar, nah only joking, not really they were utterly awful & even the girls who got their breasts out weren't very good looking. The Legend of Bloody Jack is just an awful teen slasher flick, it looks like it was shot on a camcorder without the use of a tripod or steadycam, it has awful effects, is boring & has a twist ending which is either the most insulting in horror film history or I've got it totally wrong & it's the most clever. Not recommended, watch a decent slasher from the 70's or 80's to remind you how they should be done.

Make this proper case.","completion":"Keeping the soil evenly moist, but not soaking wet, is an essential aspect of proper plant care and maintenance. This ensures that plants receive an adequate amount of water, which is crucial for their growth and overall health. Achieving this ideal balance of moisture can be done through various methods, such as proper watering techniques, soil composition, and weather management. First and foremost, it is vital to understand the watering needs of your specific plants. Different plants may have different water requirements, depending on their species, size, and stage of growth. Always research your plants' water preferences to ensure that you provide the optimal amount of moisture. When it comes to watering, you should opt for a slow and steady approach. This helps the water reach the root zone rather than just staying at the surface. Utilizing a drip irrigation system or a soaker hose can deliver water directly to the roots, allowing for even and efficient coverage. For container gardens, bottom watering (i.e., placing the pot in a tray filled with water) can also ensure that the moisture reaches deep into the root system. Another vital factor in maintaining evenly moist soil is the composition of the soil mixture itself. A well-draining soil mix ensures that only the right amount of moisture is retained while preventing overly saturated conditions. The ideal soil mix consists of organic matter (e.g., compost, peat moss, or coconut coir) and inorganic particles (e.g., perlite or vermiculite). This combination creates a porous structure that holds water within the soil but also allows for proper drainage to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Additionally, periodic monitoring of soil moisture levels is necessary to strike the right balance between overly wet and overly dry conditions. You can assess the soil dampness by feeling it with your fingers. This simple method will help you understand whether your soil is moist, dry, or waterlogged. You can also use a moisture meter, a handy tool that measures the moisture content of the soil without the need for direct contact. Mulching is another useful method for maintaining consistent soil moisture levels. Applying a layer of organic material, such as wood chips, straw, or leaves, around the base of your plants will help to retain moisture and regulate soil temperature. Mulching not only offers added benefits such as weed suppression and improving soil fertility, but it also reduces water evaporation, ensuring that the soil remains evenly moist throughout the day. Finally, keep in mind that weather conditions can impact your soil's moisture levels. Hot, sunny days can cause rapid moisture loss through evaporation, so be mindful of adjusting your watering practices accordingly. Similarly, during prolonged rainy periods, reduce the frequency of watering to prevent oversaturating the soil. In summary, achieving evenly moist soil is a delicate balance that entails proper watering techniques, appropriate soil composition, and active monitoring. Alongside regular care and weather management, you can keep your plants healthy and thriving by ensuring that their soil remains moist, but not soaking wet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael Jackson’s three children went to visit their father’s body ten times in the morgue following his death, the singer’s mother revealed in her first TV interview yesterday. The star’s daughter, Paris – who tried to commit suicide earlier this year – was particularly traumatised by the tragedy. ‘She was screaming and crying when Michael died saying ‘I want to go with you daddy, I don’t want to live without you,’ said Katherine Jackson. Speaking days after what would have been the King of Pop’s 55th birthday on August 29, the 83-year-old Jackson family matriarch added: ‘I was feeling so bad for her. 'Paris suffered a lot after his death. She had to have pictures of Michael all over her room. Every picture that was hanging on the wall had to be of Michael.’ Mrs Jackson, who has 26 grandchildren and 11 great grandchildren, said all three children struggled to come to terms with their father’s sudden death in June 2009. ‘Michael’s kids went back to the morgue where Michael was about ten times. When I was in the room, I couldn’t go there,' she said, adding that she asked her daughter LaToya what the children were doing at the funeral home. ‘She said the children are all kissing and hugging Michael. Even though he is dead they are still doing that,’ she explained. The grandmother said Paris is doing ‘much better’ after cutting her wrists and swallowing an overdose of pills in her failed suicide attempt. The emotional interview was screened on the news show ’60 Minutes’ in Australia last night. Mrs Jackson, who was appointed guardian for Prince Michael, 16, Paris, 15 and 11-year-old Blanket after their father died, is currently suing concert promoters AEG Live in a wrongful death civil suit in Los Angeles. Scroll down for video. Grieving: (L - R) Prince Jackson, Blanket Jackson and Paris Jackson after ceremony honoring their father in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles. The Jackson’s claim the entertainment giant was negligent in hiring Conrad Murray, the private doctor now serving four years behind bars for causing Jackson’s death by giving him an overdose of the anaesthetic drug propofol. Mrs Jackson said it was ‘the worst day of my life’ when her son died. ‘I’ve never had that feeling before and I never want to feel like that again,’ she said. Mrs Jackson defended her son over claims that he abused drugs and tried to surgically change his appearance. Despite her advancing years, she rejects claims that she’s too old to care for her son’s children adequately, but admits to doing some things differently. ‘I didn’t like Michael’s children wearing masks in public so after his passing I never put any on them,’ she said. She said the vultures began circling soon after Jackson’s overdose. ‘People have been so greedy and have been taking things that don’t belong to them, and stealing things. All that happens when someone dies, especially when people think they have a lot of money,’ she added. And she insisted she always believed in her son’s innocence in the face of claims that he molested young boys. ‘I know that Michael didn’t do it,’ she said. ‘I have no doubt. ‘I didn’t ask him but we talked about it all the time. We talked about a lot of things.’ She said it made her ‘angry’ that Jackson made a multi-million pound pay-off to the family of Jordan Chandler, one of his accusers. Mrs Jackson also defended Jackson over claims that he abused drugs and tried to surgically change his appearance. ‘Michael was in a lot of pain so he was taking a lot of painkillers. Michael’s life changed when he was seriously burned doing the Pepsi commercial. 'It burned him so badly that his hair wouldn’t grow back at the top of his head and he didn’t like that part of it. That’s why he started wearing wigs,’ sher added. ‘People might think that Michael would over-indulge in plastic surgery but they don’t know what went on before. Michael also had a disease so the colour of his skin was changing. ‘I don’t know why people said he had too much facial surgery. He got his nose done so that being in the centre of his face would change how he looked but I don’t think he got too much done.’ She reminisced about how the singer refined some of his famous dance moves when he was still a child. ‘When he was a baby he used to dance to the sound of a washing machine. He used to dance to the rhythm of our old rickety washing machine so he started doing those rickety moves and dancing to the sounds,’ she said. ‘There will always be questions hanging in the air that I would like the answer to but I probably won’t get them,’ she said of the circumstances surrounding her son’s death.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Sir Francis Drake, vice admiral ( 27 January 1596) was an English sea captain, privateer, navigator, slaver, and politician of the Elizabethan era. Drake carried out the second circumnavigation of the world in a single expedition, from 1577 to 1580, and was the first to complete the voyage as captain while leading the expedition throughout the entire circumnavigation. With his incursion into the Pacific he inaugurated an era of privateering and piracy in the western coast of the Americasan area that had previously been free of piracy. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. It is the southernmost location in England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most westerly in England. - Drake 's Drum is a snare drum that Sir Francis Drake took with him when he circumnavigated the world . Shortly before he died he ordered the drum to be taken to Buckland Abbey , where it still is today , and vowed that if England was ever in danger someone was to beat the drum and he would return to defend the country . According to legend it can be heard to beat at times when England is at war or significant national events take place . - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - The snare drum or side drum is a percussion instrument that produces a sharp staccato sound when the head is struck with a drum stick. Snare drums are often used in orchestras, concert bands, marching bands, parades, drumlines, drum corps, and more. It is one of the central pieces in a drum set, a collection of percussion instruments designed to be played by a seated drummer, which is used in many genres of music. Snare drums are usually played with drum sticks, but the use of other beaters such as the brush or the rute can be used to achieve a very different sound. The snare drum is a versatile and expressive percussion instrument due its sensitivity and responsiveness to playing technique. The sensitivity of the snare drum allows it to respond audibly to the softest strokes, facilitates playing of complex rhythmic patterns and engaging solos at moderate amplitudes, and its high dynamic range allows the player to produce powerful accents with vigorous strokes and a thundering crack (120+ dB) with so-called rimshot strokes. - Sir Richard Grenville (15 June 1542 10 September 1591) (alias \\"Greynvile\\", \\"Greeneville\\", \\"Greenfield\\" etc.) lord of the manors of Stowe, Kilkhampton in Cornwall and of Bideford in Devon, was an English sailor who, as captain of the \\"Revenge\\", died at the Battle of Flores (1591), fighting heroically against overwhelming odds, and refusing to surrender his ship to the far more numerous Spanish. His ship, the Revenge, met 53 Spanish war ships near Flores in the Azores. He and his crew fought the fifty three in a three-day running battle. Many Spanish ships were sunk or so badly damaged that they had to retire from the battle. The Revenge was boarded three times and each time the boarders were seen off. He was also a soldier, an armed merchant fleet owner, privateer, colonizer, and explorer. He took part in the early English attempts to settle the New World, and also participated in the fight against the Spanish Armada. His non-military offices included Member of Parliament for Cornwall, High Sheriff of County Cork from 156970 and Sheriff of Cornwall in 157677. He was the grandfather of Sir Bevil Grenville (1596-1643) of English Civil War fame, whose son was John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (16281701). - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - Buckland Abbey is a 700-year-old house in Buckland Monachorum, near Yelverton, Devon, England, noted for its connection with Sir Richard Grenville the Younger and Sir Francis Drake and presently in the ownership of the National Trust. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea.

Please briefly summarize this news article: House prices fall for second month in a row Published: 6:38AM GMT 14 Dec 2009 Property asking prices fell for the second month in a row during December as the market suffered its traditional seasonal slowdown, research showed today. The 2.2pc drop left the average property put up for sale in England and Wales during the four weeks to December 5 nearly £5,000 cheaper at £221,463, according to property website Rightmove. But despite the fall, which came as the number of homes for sale hit its lowest level for 21 months, house prices are still 1.7pc higher than they were 12 months ago. All areas of the country saw a fall in asking prices during the month, except East Anglia, where they rose by 0.5pc. The North saw the biggest price slide at 5.8pc, followed by the North West and South East, both at 4.3pc. The group said it expected to see a further price drop during the coming month, as winter sellers generally ask for lower prices in a bid to secure a sale. It is then predicting a burst of activity and price rises in the early spring, before the housing market enters a \\"more challenging period\\" after the General Election. Overall, it thinks asking prices will remain flat during 2010, after rising by around 2pc this year. But the group expects to see big geographical and socio-economic variations, with desirable areas where there continues to be a shortage of homes for sale seeing further price increases. Miles Shipside, commercial director of Rightmove, said: \\"Sales volumes are still set to remain well down on historic norms, with the consequent thin-market danger of relatively small changes in economic fundamentals having a marked impact on asking prices. \\"We have already seen how some local markets have been adversely affected by over-supply of property and a lack of mortgage-ready buyers, and more areas could become similarly blighted if forced sales increase later next year as expected.\\" The group expects only around one million homes to change hands during 2010, half the level seen in 2007. But it warned that there could be more forced sales during the year, particularly if lenders showed less forbearance to borrowers who are in arrears after the election. While the housing market is expected to have a subdued year during 2010, the rental one is expected to benefit from rising demand from people who are unable to buy their own home. At the same time, the supply of rental properties is expected to fall as accidental landlords, who rented out their home after being unable to sell it, put their property on the market again. Mr Shipside said: \\"Existing landlords will find themselves in an increasingly privileged position in 2010, where competition from new landlords is frozen out by a dearth of buy-to-let mortgages. \\"In addition, tenant demand and landlords rental returns will grow due to demand from those who are unable to buy.\\"","completion":"Property asking prices in England and Wales fell for the second consecutive month in December, dropping by 2.2%, making the average property price £221,463, according to research by property website Rightmove.

Henry David Thoreau (see name pronunciation; July 12, 1817 - May 6, 1862) was an American essayist, poet, philosopher, abolitionist, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, and historian. A leading transcendentalist, Thoreau is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay \\"Civil Disobedience\\" (originally published as \\"Resistance to Civil Government\\"), an argument for disobedience to an unjust state. Thoreau's books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry amount to more than 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions are his writings on natural history and philosophy, in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history, two sources of modern-day environmentalism. Thoreau contracted tuberculosis in 1835 and suffered from it sporadically afterwards. In 1860, following a late-night excursion to count the rings of tree stumps during a rainstorm, he became ill with bronchitis. His health declined, with brief periods of remission, and he eventually became bedridden. Recognizing the terminal nature of his disease, Thoreau spent his last years revising and editing his unpublished works, particularly The Maine Woods and Excursions, and petitioning publishers to print revised editions of A Week and Walden. He wrote letters and journal entries until he became too weak to continue. His friends were alarmed at his diminished appearance and were fascinated by his tranquil acceptance of death. When his aunt Louisa asked him in his last weeks if he had made his peace with God, Thoreau responded, \\"I did not know we had ever quarreled.\\" Aware he was dying, Thoreau's last words were \\"Now comes good sailing\\", followed by two lone words, \\"moose\\" and \\"Indian\\". He died on May 6, 1862, at age 44. Amos Bronson Alcott planned the service and read selections from Thoreau's works, and Channing presented a hymn. Emerson wrote the eulogy spoken at the funeral. Thoreau was buried in the Dunbar family plot; his remains and those of members of his immediate family were eventually moved to Sleepy Hollow Cemetery (42deg27'53''N 71deg20'32''W) in Concord, Massachusetts. Thoreau's friend William Ellery Channing published his first biography, Thoreau the Poet-Naturalist, in 1873. Channing and another friend, Harrison Blake, edited some poems, essays, and journal entries for posthumous publication in the 1890s. Thoreau's journals, which he often mined for his published works but which remained largely unpublished at his death, were first published in 1906 and helped to build his modern reputation. A new, expanded edition of the journals is under way, published by Princeton University Press. Today, Thoreau is regarded as one of the foremost American writers, both for the modern clarity of his prose style and the prescience of his views on nature and politics. His memory is honored by the international Thoreau Society and his legacy honored by the Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods, established in 1998 in Lincoln, Massachusetts.","completion":"The text is about Henry David Thoreau, an American essayist, poet, philosopher, abolitionist, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, and historian.

Q:Given the below context: Lancaster's career designing for the theatre began and ended with Gilbert and Sullivan. His first costumes and scenery were for the Sadler's Wells Ballet's Pineapple Poll (1951), John Cranko's ballet with a story based on a Gilbert poem and music by Sullivan. His last were for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's revival of The Sorcerer (1973). In between, he designed more productions for the Royal Ballet, as well as for Glyndebourne Festival Opera, the Old Vic and the West End. It was a matter of mild regret to him that of the twenty plays, operas and ballets that he designed between the two, only one was for a thoroughly serious piece, Britten's Peter Grimes, for the Bulgarian National Opera in Sofia in 1964.Only two of Lancaster's theatre designs have remained in use in 21st-century productions, both by the Royal Ballet: Pineapple Poll and La fille mal gardée. In an article on the latter in 2016, Danielle Buckley wrote, \\"Lancaster's surrealist and stylized designs for Fille amplify the story's pantomime quality, and the exaggerated burlesque of its comedy – but the backdrops of fields that roll into the distance, bundles of hay, dreamy skies and village cottages provide the idealized, pastoral context that the story needs\\". Buckley adds that Lancaster’s designs have been criticised for locating the ballet in no particular time or place – \\"except, that is, of a 1960s London view of idyllic country life\\".Lancaster's stated view was that stage sets and costumes should reflect reality, but \\"through a lens, magnifying and slightly over-emphasising everything which it reflects\\". Sir Geraint Evans commented on how Lancaster's designs helped the performer: \\"[His] design for Falstaff was superb: it gave me clues to understanding the character, and reflected that marvellous, subtle sense of humour which was present in all his work.\\" Guess a valid title for it!

Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. I am facing a new situation today: Robin and Samantha are both bodybuilders preparing for a competition. Both of them are trying to change their skin complexion to help their appearances at the competition. Robin begins exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week.

However, Jeannie pays more attention to talking on the telephone apathetically than her actual babysitting. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return the baby to where it came from simply results in the baby escaping from the pram again. During one escape, the baby crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of the baby, and is promptly attacked, scratched and bit. This time, Tom angrily brings the baby back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken the baby away from her. Realising that the baby is no longer worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after the baby crawls down to the street and into a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site. The baby crawls from one steel beam to another while the two look on. Jerry manages to catch up, and saves the baby from crawling off a wooden plank lying on the 50th floor by grabbing his diaper. The diaper comes loose, and the baby falls, but he is then caught by Tom. Tom attempts to put the baby's diaper back on, but in the impending confusion, ends up putting the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off, nonchalantly.

What is going to be the fate of Indian economy if Indians stop buying Chinese product and the whole trade between India and China comes to an end? What will be the effect in the economy of China if Indians boycott all the Chinese products? Do those questions have the same meaning? Pick from: a. no; b. yes;","completion":"a. no The two questions have different meanings, as they focus on the potential impact of Indians boycotting Chinese products on both Indian and Chinese economies. To answer these questions, let's discuss each one in detail: 1. What is going to be the fate of the Indian economy if Indians stop buying Chinese products and the whole trade between India and China comes to an end? Step 1: Identify the impact on Indian imports - If Indians stop buying Chinese products, this would lead to a decreased demand for Chinese imports. Since China is one of India's largest trading partners, this could have a significant impact on the balance of trade. Step 2: Determine the impact on domestic industries - With reduced imports from China, domestic industries in India may experience increased demand as consumers turn to locally-produced alternatives. This could lead to an increase in local production and potentially generate more employment opportunities. Step 3: Analyze the impact on foreign exchange - Reduced imports from China could lead to a lower demand for Chinese currency in India, and thus potentially affect the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee (INR) and the Chinese Yuan (CNY). Step 4: Consider the impact on diplomatic relations - Ending trade between the two countries could exacerbate already strained diplomatic relations between India and China, potentially affecting other agreements and collaborations between them. 2. What will be the effect on the economy of China if Indians boycott all the Chinese products? Step 1: Identify the impact on Chinese exports - If Indians boycott Chinese products, this will lead to a drop in demand for Chinese exports. As India is a significant export market for China, this could have a noteworthy impact on China's economy. Step 2: Assess the effect on Chinese industries - Reduced demand from India could lead to production cutbacks in certain Chinese industries, which in turn may cause job losses and affect economic growth. Step 3: Examine the impact on foreign exchange - A drop in demand for Chinese products from India could affect the exchange rate between the currencies, potentially impacting China's overall trade with other countries as well. Step 4: Consider the impact on diplomatic relations - As with the potential impact on the Indian economy, strained diplomatic relations between the two countries could affect ongoing and future agreements and collaborations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","completion":"For additional information about configuring SSO on a server farm, see the Setting up Single Sign-On (Office SharePoint Server) section. Setting up Single Sign-On (SSO) in a server farm for Office SharePoint Server involves several important steps and considerations to ensure maximum efficiency, security, and reliability. Office SharePoint Server, also known as Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS), is a platform that allows organizations to collaborate, share files, and access various resources in a centralized location. Single Sign-On (SSO) simplifies the user experience by eliminating the need for multiple authentication processes. In this answer, we will provide an overview of the main steps and components involved in setting up SSO on a server farm. 1. Plan your infrastructure: Before configuring SSO, you'll need to plan your network infrastructure, server topology, and IT resources. This includes: - Deciding the number of server farms needed - Determining server specifications and storage requirements - Selecting appropriate load balancers and other network components - Evaluating security aspects, such as firewalls and encrypted connections 2. Install and configure Office SharePoint Server: After planning your infrastructure, you'll need to install and configure the Office SharePoint Server software on each server within the farm. This involves: - Installing prerequisites, such as the Microsoft .NET Framework and Windows Server features - Installing the Office SharePoint Server software - Creating a SharePoint configuration database - Configuring web applications and site collections 3. Implement Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS): In order to efficiently manage the SSO system, you need to use AD FS, which provides a mechanism for managing authentication and authorization across multiple applications and systems. To set up AD FS, you must: - Install and configure AD FS on a dedicated Windows Server instance - Configure trust relationships between your organization's AD FS and SharePoint server farm - Create and manage claims, rules, and policies to govern access control 4. Configure the SSO service in SharePoint: With AD FS in place, you can now configure the SSO service within Office SharePoint Server. This includes: - Enabling and configuring SharePoint's built-in SSO service - Adding and managing SSO service accounts - Specifying the authentication provider and authentication mode 5. Configure SharePoint's web applications for SSO: Following the configuration of the SSO service, you must also configure your SharePoint web applications to use SSO for authentication. This includes: - Modifying the web.config files for the web applications - Specifying the SSO provider and connection settings 6. Test and verify your SSO implementation: After completing the above steps, it's crucial to test the SSO system to ensure it works correctly. You can perform SSO testing by: - Accessing various SharePoint resources, such as documents and list items, using different user accounts - Testing the SSO authentication process with various devices and web browsers 7. Monitor and maintain SSO: Once your SSO implementation is complete, it's important to regularly monitor and maintain it to ensure its ongoing security, performance, and reliability. This may involve: - Monitoring user activity and authentication attempts - Reviewing and updating SSO authentication policies and rules - Regularly updating the SharePoint server software and related components By following these steps and understanding the key components involved, you can successfully set up Single Sign-On on a server farm for Office SharePoint Server. This will streamline the user experience, reduce administrative overhead, and help maintain a secure and efficient collaboration environment for your organization."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague reports that the incident was relayed to the public gallery and the recordings have since spread on social media, and even appeared on YouTube. Our correspondent adds that protecting witnesses is one of the key promises of the ICC, and the court goes to great lengths to shield the identities of sensitive witnesses from the public by pixellating their faces and disguising their voices. In some cases, witnesses are even moved to a new country and given a new identity. This is the highest profile trial yet for the ICC, which has only convicted two people, both Congolese warlords, since its establishment in 2002. Mr Gbagbo, 70, and ex-militia leader Charles Ble Goude, 44, deny murder, rape, attempted murder and persecution in the violence after Ivory Coast's election in 2010.

Question: Across countryside, non-food crops are growing alongside wheat.Some are used in new alternatives to plastics and other materials, but others will simply be burned. Burning crops is becoming more popular because it is good for the planet.Doing so is also cheaper than burning fossil fuels.As more land is devoted to non-food crop production, the economics of crops for fuel are likely to become even more favorable. Humans have been burning such biomass--organic materials from plants or animals-- since they discovered fire.But that burning fossil fuels could have catastrophic consequences has brought biomass back into fashion. Even allowing for emissions of carbon dioxide from fuel used in planting, harvesting, processing and transporting biomass fuel, replacing fossil fuel with biomass can typically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 90 percent. Power stations around the world are experimenting with forms of biomass to add to their coal or oil, with encouraging results.Indeed, power companies could profit by turning to biomass, especially when the subsidies many governments offer for using renewable energy are taken into account. Farmers can benefit from growing biomass.In Europe, the reduction of subsidies for certain crops is exposing farmers to market forces.Instead of being paid for whatever they produce, farmers must seek a clear demand for their product.Many believe that the demand for alternatives to fossil fuels could be just such a driver. But while biomass offers a variety of potential alternatives, the world's infrastructure has developed around burning fossil fuels to such a stage that switching to biomass involves a change in conception that many companies have not accepted.

However, the director's widow, G. G. Sparrow, the main benefactor to the church, believes she should have been given the position.

In the third quarter, Miami tried to rally as Gado got a 20-yard TD run, while kicker Jay Feely nailed a 41-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Buffalo would put the game away as Edwards hooked up with Evans again on a 70-yard TD pass to secure a season-sweep. Answer this question: How many total TD pass yards did Trent Edwards have?","completion":"Alright kiddo, let me explain this to you like a story. So, there was this football game between the Buffalo Bills and the Miami Dolphins. Trent Edwards, the quarterback for the Bills, threw some passes that ended in touchdowns. Let's see how many yards he got from those touchdown passes: 1. He threw a 13-yard TD pass. 2. He threw a 28-yard TD pass. 3. He threw a 9-yard TD pass. 4. And finally, he threw a 70-yard TD pass. So, to find out how many total TD pass yards Trent Edwards had, we need to add up all those numbers. 13 + 28 + 9 + 70, which equals 120 yards. So, Trent Edwards had a total of 120 TD pass yards in that game!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Translate to French","completion":"Il y a eu un certain nombre de traités internationaux qui ont vu le jour dans les années 1920, 1930 et 1940 et qui ont effectivement bénéficié des contributions de membres du parlement travaillant dans l'UIP. Dans ces différentes décennies, nombre de traités internationaux ont été élaborés et signés, ayant un impact significatif sur les relations entre les nations. Les membres du parlement, travaillant au sein de l'Union interparlementaire (UIP), ont joué un rôle essentiel dans le processus de conception et de mise en œuvre de ces traités. Les années 1920, 1930 et 1940 ont été marquées par des changements politiques, économiques et sociaux importants. À cette époque, le monde connaissait l'émergence de nouvelles idéologies et la montée des nationalismes. Plusieurs traités ont été signés pour répondre à ces défis et créer un cadre juridique international stable. Parmi ces traités, on peut citer le Traité de Versailles (1919), qui a mis fin à la Première Guerre mondiale et redessiné la carte de l'Europe. Le rôle de l'UIP dans l'élaboration de ce traité a été déterminant. Les membres du parlement ont contribué à définir les conditions de paix et les réparations exigées des pays vaincus, ainsi qu'à établir le principe de la Société des Nations, ancêtre de l'Organisation des Nations Unies. Dans les années 1930, les tensions internationales accrues et la montée des régimes totalitaires ont conduit à la signature de nouveaux traités. Le Pacte de la Société des Nations de 1920, le Pacte Kellogg-Briand de 1928 visant à renoncer à la guerre comme instrument de politique nationale, ou encore la Conférence de La Haye (1930) sur le désarmement sont autant d'exemples de l'implication active des membres du parlement dans l'UIP pour promouvoir la paix et la coopération internationale. Enfin, les années 1940 ont été marquées par la Seconde Guerre mondiale et la naissance du système international d'après-guerre. Les membres du parlement travaillant dans l'UIP ont également contribué à l'élaboration des principes fondamentaux de l'Organisation des Nations Unies, à travers la Charte de San Francisco (1945) et la Déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme (1948). Ils ont également participé aux négociations des statuts de la Cour internationale de justice et du Fonds monétaire international (FMI). En résumé, pendant les années 1920, 1930 et 1940, les membres du parlement travaillant dans l'UIP ont joué un rôle majeur dans l'élaboration de traités internationaux et dans la promotion de la paix, de la stabilité et de la coopération entre les nations. Leurs efforts ont été essentiels à la mise en place d'institutions internationales et à l'établissement d'un cadre juridique pour réguler les relations entre les États dans un monde en mutation rapide."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

But, with 20 grand prix starts to his name, it can be easy to forget that 18-year-old Max Verstappen is still exactly that - a teenager. We've not seen much of the Toro Rosso driver's moody side, but it was on full, potty-mouthed display in the Australian GP on Sunday. There was even the teenage trademark of a slammed bedroom door (it was actually the office door of team principal Franz Tost), just to complete the histrionics. Having started fifth on the grid, the Dutchman was sixth midway through the race when he turned into mad Max. \\"I wanted to pit first,\\" he grumbled down the radio after his team-mate Carlos Sainz went into the garage for new tyres. Eventually, Verstappen was given a new set of tyres and re-emerged in 10th, a place behind Sainz. That's when the strop hit its stride. Three more radio messages followed, with some choice language removed: The pair proceeded to pass Renault's Joylon Palmer at consecutive corners, before Verstappen's impatience almost got the better of him. With three laps to go, Verstappen clipped the back of his team-mate and went into a spin. He recovered to finish 10th, but it could have been oh-so costly for a team that looks like it could lay claim to being the best of the rest behind Mercedes and Ferrari, with Verstappen and Sainz having qualified fifth and seventh respectively on Saturday. It's anyone's guess what was said behind Tost's slammed door in the Toro Rosso debrief. In front of the microphones Verstappen, who refused a team order to let Sainz past at Singapore last year, made his thoughts clear. \\"It was a very disappointing race. The start was great. But from there onwards it turned into a nightmare really,\\" he said. \\"There was miscommunication for the second stop and at the end we chose the wrong tyres for the last stint.\\" From Sainz's point of view, there was not an issue. \\"I think it was a nice battle. I have no issues at all with what happened. I don't know why there is something to be angry about,\\" said the 21-year-old Spaniard. And Tost explained why Sainz was allowed to pit before Verstappen: \\"Carlos had a lot of front locking. Therefore we called him for an early pit stop. \\"Within the next three laps also Max came into the pits, but the team was not prepared for this stop, as we did not call him. Therefore he lost seven seconds.\\" Verstappen was praised for his overtaking ability and willingness to race in his debut campaign last season, when he finished 12th in the drivers' championship. But social media users were quick to poke fun at his teenage sulk. BBC Radio 5 live reporter Tom Clarkson said Verstappen lost his cool. \\"There is no doubt Max Verstappen has got hot under the collar in this race,\\" he said. \\"This is the first time we have seen over-exuberance from him and frustration in his driving.\\" And fans using the #bbcf1 hashtag on social media were less than impressed with the Toro Rosso man's manner. Garrick Chandler: \\"Max is childish and I am sick of the whinging. Turn his radio off.\\" Robert Leon Felix: \\"So, Verstappen is sounding more and more self-centred and arrogant.\\" Garry Holett: \\"If Max spent a little less time acting the spoilt child and more on looking for gaps, he wouldn't need people to let him past!\\" Jonathan Evans: \\"Verstappen is only a kid but boy doesn't it show. Needs to be taken down a peg or two.\\" Rhyan Paul: \\"Someone get Max V a pacifier, petulant child! Time on the naughty step for you after the race!\\" But there were words in defence of Verstappen, with one contributor comparing him to seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher.

Starting fifth on the grid, he was running sixth midway through the race when he began complaining over the radio about his teammate Carlos Sainz pitting for new tires before him. Verstappen's impatience was once again evident, as he clipped the back of Sainz's car and went into a spin with just three laps to go in the race. After the race, Verstappen expressed his disappointment and frustration, blaming miscommunication for his pit stop and the wrong tires for his final stint. Team principal Franz Tost, on the other hand, explained that Sainz had front locking issues, which necessitated an early pit stop, and that Verstappen pitted without being called in, causing him to lose seven seconds. The young driver's attitude during the race was met with mixed reactions on social media, with some defending him and others calling him childish, self-centered, and arrogant.

Would \\"Many of those state acts may be similar but not identical to the federal act.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a federal law enacted in the United States in 1966 and amended several times since then. It applies specifically to federal agencies and is designed to provide citizens with access to information held by the government. The FOIA is meant to promote transparency and hold government agencies accountable by allowing the public to request records pertaining to the policies, decisions, and actions of those agencies. However, the FOIA does not apply to private entities, non-federal organizations, or state and local governments. To address these gaps, each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia has enacted their own laws, often referred to as \\"state open records laws\\" or \\"sunshine laws,\\" that provide access to information held by state and local agencies. These laws may collectively be considered as \\"state counterparts\\" or \\"state versions\\" of the FOIA. Your proposed answer, \\"Many of those state acts may be similar but not identical to the federal act,\\" is reasonable, as it emphasizes that while state acts may have similarities with the FOIA, there are also key differences depending on the particular state. These differences may include: 1. Scope: State laws may cover additional types of entities beyond what is covered by the FOIA. For example, some state laws may apply to private organizations that receive public funds or are performing public functions, while others may cover legislative or judicial records that are exempt under the FOIA. 2. Exemptions: While the FOIA contains nine specific exemptions, state laws may have different exemptions or broader/narrower interpretations of comparable exemptions. States may also have additional provisions or exceptions that are unique to the state. 3. Processes and timelines: The FOIA has specific requirements for how federal agencies must respond to requests, including response timeframes and appeal processes. State laws may have different requirements for how agencies are to handle requests, which could result in varying levels of efficiency and responsiveness. 4. Fees: The FOIA allows for agencies to charge fees for search, review, and duplication of records, although fee waivers may be granted under certain circumstances. State laws may have different fee structures or conditions for granting fee waivers. 5. Enforcement: Violations of the FOIA can lead to lawsuits in federal courts. State laws may provide for different enforcement mechanisms, such as mediation, state administrative processes, or litigation in state courts. In conclusion, the FOIA applies specifically to federal agencies and serves as a model for state open records laws, which may share similarities but also have distinct characteristics based on the state in which they were enacted. Your answer is a reasonable representation of the relationship between the FOIA and state acts; however, it is important to emphasize that the FOIA does not directly apply to state and local governments, and the specific provisions, exemptions, and enforcement mechanisms may vary from state to state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that had a solo album named Radio K.A.O.S? In Waters' absence, Gilmour had been recruiting musicians for a new project. Months previously, keyboardist Jon Carin had jammed with Gilmour at his Hookend studio, where he composed the chord progression that became \\"Learning to Fly\\", and so was invited onto the team. Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin (co-producer of 1979's The Wall) to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters' offer of a role on the development of his new solo album, Radio K.A.O.S., saying it was \\"far easier for Dave and I to do our version of a Floyd record\\". Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as \\"mucking about with a lot of demos\\".At this stage, there was no commitment to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album. CBS representative Stephen Ralbovsky hoped for a new Pink Floyd album, but in a meeting in November 1986, told Gilmour and Ezrin that the music \\"doesn't sound a fucking thing like Pink Floyd\\". Gilmour later said that the new project was difficult without Waters. He experimented with songwriters such as Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, but eventually settled on Anthony Moore, who was credited as co-writer of \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"On the Turning Away\\". Whereas many prior Pink Floyd albums are concept albums, Gilmour settled for the more conventional approach of a collection of songs without a thematic link. By the end of that year, he had decided to make the material into a Pink Floyd project.

Input: The Westboro Baptist Church is about to get a big surprise in the form of a new neighbor who plans to give the notoriously anti-gay group a taste of its own medicine. Aaron Jackson, one of the founders of Planting Peace, a multi-pronged charity that has in the past concentrated on rainforest conservation, opening orphanages and deworming programs, bought a house that sits directly across from the church's compound six months ago. On Tuesday, March 19, he and a team of volunteers are painting it to match the gay pride flag. The project -- which the nonprofit is calling the \\"Equality House\\" -- is the first in a new campaign Planting Peace plans to wage against the group. Westboro is known for its intimidating tactics of protesting (or threatening to protest) what they refer to as America's pro-gay, anti-God agenda, in close proximity to pride parades, soldier funerals and other events like the Sandy Hook memorial services. \\"I read a story about Josef Miles, a 10-year-old kid who counter-protested the Westboro Baptist Church by holding the sign that says 'God Hates No One,'\\" Jackson told The Huffington Post. \\"I didn't know anything about the church or where they were located, but that story kept popping up. And one night I wondered, Where is this church? I got on Google Earth, and I was 'walking down the road,' and I did a 360 view. And I saw a 'For Sale' sign sitting in the front yard of a house. Right away it hit me, Oh my gosh, I could buy a house in front of the WBC! And immediately I thought: And I'm going to paint that thing the color of the pride flag.\\" Jackson said he's always wanted to get involved in gay activism, but hadn't been sure of how to do it until this opportunity presented itself. \\"The reason I haven't gotten into the gay rights activism is because, in a sense, it's almost silly -- it's 2013, are we really still in this position? It just seems ludicrous,\\" he said. \\"But it is a real issue and kids are killing themselves. I've wanted to do something, and I knew when I saw that house for sale that it all came together. Everyone who knows me knows that I'm a little crazy and there's no red tape in my charity. When I want to do something, I do it.\\" Planting Peace bought the house for roughly 83,000, and Jackson has been living in Topeka for just over a month. As he waited for the perfect time to transform the house into a very visible celebration of gay pride -- and a direct challenge to what Westboro preaches -- he encountered members of the group, including the Phelps family, which has run the church since it was established in 1956. \\"They own the majority of the homes in the community, and I walk through the area every day, and I see them running in between each other's houses,\\" he said. \\"One day I was walking, and Shirley Phelps [one of Westboro's main spokespeople and the daughter of the church's leader, Fred Phelps] was on her four-wheeler. And I said, 'Hey guys, how are you?' And [she and her husband] responded, 'Oh, we're good. How are you?' We had a short conversation, and she was extremely nice, and she made a joke and we all laughed.\\" \\"It's the craziest thing -- and it really throws you off -- because she's the type of woman who calls you \\"hun\\" and \\"darling\\" -- she's very Southern,\\" he said. \\"It's like, aren't you the lady that's supposed to be casting me into hell? It's truly mind-boggling, but I can't say anything personally bad about her because she was kind to me and she made me laugh. She'd probably be fun to hang out with.\\" But pleasantries aside, Jackson said he's confident that the church is already wary of his presence and may be expecting some sort of action from him. \\"They're extremely smart, and I would be willing to guess that when I moved into this community that they looked up property records, especially considering that I drive a Prius and I have an original reelect Jimmy Carter sticker on the back of it -- I'm a screaming liberal,\\" he said. Jackson said he's also witnessed members of the church taking photos of the house and the industrial flagpole he installed, which stands in opposition to the flagpole that currently flies the pride flag and the American flag upside-down in front of the Westboro Baptist Church. \\"It looks like the United Nations is having a stand off with flags. These flag poles are huge. They know that we've forked out big money for this,\\" Jackson said. Jackson said he's seen people who he thinks are members of the church, including high-ranking member Steve Drain, taking photos of the house. By the end of Tuesday, the Westboro Baptist Church will no longer be wondering what is going on at Jackson's home. But beyond painting the Equality House the colors of the rainbow flag and flying the flag from the newly installed flagpole, Jackson is already working on the next steps in his new fight for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LBGT) equality. \\"We want this house to be a message that where there's hate, there's also love. But we also want to raise awareness and capital, and we want to put all that money into creating and sustaining anti-bullying programs, along with supporting anti-bullying programs that already exist,\\" he said. \\"Beyond the symbolic message of the home, [the house] will be utilized by volunteers to live here, and these volunteers will work on promoting equality anywhere in the world and managing these anti-bullying initiatives that we plan on creating.\\" While Jackson understands that Westboro feeds off of the attention that it receives from the media and others, he said he believes that it's still critical to address their hate. \\"The media has already given them such a huge platform, and I don't see that stopping,\\" he said. \\"We're taking the energy that's being poured into them and turning it into something positive. This is how we plan on playing it: Use their energy and let's turn it into something incredibly positive for the LGBT community.\\" Jackson said he also sees the Equality House as one more step toward bringing about the demise of the organization. In recent months, the group has faced a backlash both from former members -- like Lauren Drain, who released a book about her life in the church and who recently suggested that Westboro's leader, Fred Phelps, may himself be gay -- and city governments, which have passed legislation aimed at limiting the group's ability to picket. \\"I think the future for the Westboro Baptist Church is very bleak,\\" he said. \\"These poor kids will hopefully continue to leave that church. They have a lot of kids over there, but unfortunately they're not in a place where they can make decisions for themselves.\\" Jackson is confident that Westboro's loss of power and relevance is just one sign of the good things still to come for the LGBT community. \\"I love seeing all of these Republicans and all these people who have been anti-gay all this time jumping ship because they know they're on the wrong side of history. It's an amazing thing to see,\\" he said. \\"I know we have a long way to go in fighting bigotry, but we all know the gays are going to win. It's going to happen.\\" To find out how you can help support the Equality House and its anti-bullying campaign, click here.

By the end of today, the inhabitants of the Westboro Baptist Church compound in Topeka, Kansas, should have a new view out their windows, just past their FAG MARRIAGE DOOMS NATIONS sign: a new gay-rights center across the street, painted in brilliant rainbow colors, with a pride flag flying from a 30-foot flagpole. Right now, a crew of volunteers is at work on the siding of a house opposite the headquarters of the publicity-hunting hate-preacher Fred Phelps. The center is the work of a roving do-gooder named Aaron Jackson, a 31-year-old community-college dropout whose other projects have included opening orphanages in India and Haiti and buying a thousand acres of endangered rain forest in Peru. This year, his charity, Planting Peace, also intends to de-worm every child in Guatemala. Jackson was drawn to Topeka after reading about Josef Miles, the local boy who last year, at the age of nine, photobombed one of the Westboro protests with a handmade sign that read \\"God Hates No One.\\" Jackson had been looking for a way to support equality, anti-bullying programs, and some sort of pro-LGBT initiative, he said. \\"I've been accused in the past of being all over the place, and they're probably right on some level,\\" Jackson told me last night by phone. \\"Right now we are standing up to bigotry and promoting equality.\\" So while considering the Westboro Baptist Church, he began dinking around on Google Maps late one night. He pulled up the church, at 3701 SW 12th St. in Topeka, and took a virtual walk around the block. In the front yard of a house across the street, he noticed a For Sale sign. \\"It hit me right away,\\" Jackson told me last night by phone. \\"Huh. That would be interesting to own a house across from the Westboro Baptist Church and turn it into something.' And then, within five seconds: 'And I'll paint it the color of the pride flag.' Perfect.\\" The house he'd thought for sale no longer was, but he found another, two doors down, that was still across the street from the Westboro compound. It was listed for something in the 80,000s. \\"I find that if you have a hate group in front of your home, that should bring the price of your home down just a little bit,\\" Jackson said. \\"Unfortunately the gentleman that was selling the house, he didn't seem to agree with me.\\" The guy wouldn't budge. Jackson was tempted to walk away. \\"What he did not know,\\" Jackson said, \\"where he had me, was I needed this home. I had to have this house. There was no way around it.\\" Eventually the guy dropped to 81 and threw in a new roof. Jackson bought it sight unseen, without knowing so much as the number of bedrooms. Turns out there are two bedrooms, one bathroom, a carpeting dining area, two garages (the house sits at a corner), a fireplace, hardwood floors, a small porch, and a decent-sized yard that overlooks the headquarters of an active hate group. \\"The view is what I bought the home for,\\" Jackson said. He closed on it about six months ago. In January he and his friend Davis Hammet, a 22-year-old Florida State grad, drove up from Florida overnight to move in. \\"We thought we were about to become popsicles,\\" Hammet said. They've been hunkering down, waiting for the weather to break, so they could get the house painted. The plan is to ride the coattails of Westboro's own media strategy. \\"We're going to take the negative attention and try to spin it into something positive,\\" Hammet said. \\"Instead of millions of children around the world getting this hate message, they're going to see this message of compassion and love.\\" When I visited the house, during a cross-continental road trip in February, they had scarcely a stick of furniture other than the tables and chairs at the front picture window, their office and de facto crow's nest. They were keeping a low profile, but were making some friends. This wasn't long after Valentine's Day, and a confidante at a fruit-basket outfit had given them a small fortune in leftover strawberries. It paired well with a housewarming six-pack I'd bought at a gas station in rural-highway Kansas. We looked out the front window sipping beers and munching berries and wondering what the WBCers, who live throughout the neighborhood around the church, made of two dudes with a Jimmy Carter sticker on the bumper of their Prius moving to the neighborhood and staying up late every night. The painters prepped over the weekend and did the white shutters on Monday. If all goes well, it should be a multi-hued spectrum by the early afternoon. Monday night, Hammet was exhausted but thrilled for Tuesday. \\"It's the most important day of my life so far,\\" he said. To the best of anyone's knowledge, this will all come as a surprise to the WBCers. A few weeks ago, Jackson was walking around the iced-over block when he met Fred Phelps' daughter Shirley, out plowing snow on an ATV. She was wearing a helmet, so he didn't know who she was was until they and her husband got to chatting. She apparently cracked a pretty decent joke. \\"We all shared a giggle together,\\" Jackson said. \\"It was a sweet moment. And I just carried on.\\" ||||| House Across From Westboro Baptist Is Painted With Gay Pride Rainbow Colors Aaron Jackson took inspiration from a 9-year-old kid who stood up to Westboro Baptist Church protesters. As Mark wrote last year, Josef Miles stood in front of protesters carrying signs that read \\"God Hates [Gays]\\" with his own sign that read \\"God Hates No One.\\" Today, Jackson is following through on a project that started about six months ago when he decided to buy a house across the street from the infamous church in Topeka, Kan. Jackson and volunteers began painting the house in the colors of the gay pride rainbow. Once they are done, they will also add a huge rainbow flag in front of the house. \\"It looks like something that should be at the U.N., not in a residential neighborhood,\\" Jackson told The Destin Log. Jackson, whose charity Planting Peace, has opened orphanages and bought endangered forest land in Peru, told Gawker earlier today that they have renamed the building \\"Equality House\\" and the project seeks to fight bigotry. As we've explained before, Westboro Baptist has attracted publicity in recent years for protesting against homosexuality, abortion and other issues outside the funerals of military veterans and celebrities. Gawker explains that Jackson's plan is: \\"... to ride the coattails of Westboro's own media strategy. 'We're going to take the negative attention and try to spin it into something positive,' Hammet said. 'Instead of millions of children around the world getting this hate message, they're going to see this message of compassion and love.'\\" The Kansas City Fox affiliate reports that Jackson said throughout the day, people have driven past the house \\"honking horns, taking pictures.\\" \\"There has been no negative response,\\" Jackson said. Westboro responded in its usual way. (Don't click, if you're easily offended.) Update at 12:35 p.m. ET. The Proximity: This video posted on Twitter gives out an idea of the proximity of the house to the Westboro Baptist building. ||||| Output:","completion":"Aaron Jackson, founder of Planting Peace charity, bought a house across from the Westboro Baptist Church and painted it to match the gay pride flag, renaming it the \\"Equality House\\". The project aims to combat bigotry and promote love and compassion. The Westboro Baptist Church is known for its anti-gay protests and controversial signs.

He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty’s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)

It is logical to assume that the mascot is in a role to entertain, educate, or engage the children in a group activity. Among the options provided, the one that aligns most with common sense and the context of a campfire setting would be option B - read to the children. Reading stories to children around a campfire is a popular activity often associated with camping trips and outdoor gatherings. The cozy atmosphere created by the warmth of the fire and the dim light from the flames creates a perfect environment for storytelling. Engaging children with captivating stories around a campfire can help stimulate their imaginations, hold their attention, and provide opportunities for learning. Option A, going to the movies, does not align with the context of the campfire setting and is not a feasible option in this situation. Option C, imagining, is vague and does not provide a clear understanding of what the mascot is doing to engage the children. Option D, eating s'mores, may be a typical campfire activity, but it is not directly related to the mascot's role in this scenario. Lastly, option E, playing games, is not entirely unreasonable; however, it is less likely to be the main focus when the children are gathered specifically around a campfire. In summary, the most fitting answer to the question, \\"The mascot gathered the children around the campfire, he then began to what them?\\", would be option B - read to the children.

Writer Joyce Carol Oates led the tributes to Trevor on Twitter. \\"William Trevor, one of the great short story writers. Beautifully composed, lyrical, understated prose,\\" she wrote. Crime novelist Sarah Hilary : \\"RIP William Trevor, one of my favourite authors.\\" Trevor was born in Mitchelstown, County Cork, in the Republic of Ireland on 24 May 1928. He was educated at St Columba's College and Trinity College in Dublin before working briefly as a teacher, and later as a copywriter in an advertising agency. Trevor married his college sweetheart Jane in 1952 and went on to dedicate many of his books to her. They had two sons. His first novel, A Standard of Behaviour, was published in 1958 but he only began to work full-time as a writer in 1965. He later disowned his first novel and said in later interviews that he considered 1962's The Old Boys to be his debut. Trevor went on to publish more than 30 novels and short story collections during his career. He was awarded an honorary CBE in 1977 for his services to literature, and was made a Companion of Literature in 1994. In 2002, he received an honorary knighthood. The writer's most recent novel, Love and Summer, was published in 2009 and was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize. He has also been shortlisted four times for The Story of Lucy Gault, Mrs Eckdorf in O'Neill's Hotel, Reading Turgenev and The Children of Dynmouth.

Information: - Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. - Lepidosauromorpha is a group of reptiles comprising all diapsids closer to lizards than to archosaurs (which include crocodiles and birds). The only living sub-group is the Lepidosauria: extant lizards, snakes, amphisbaenians and tuataras. - In Greek mythology, Daedalus (\\"Daidalos\\", perhaps related to \\"to work artfully\\" Etruscan: \\"Taitale\\") was a skillful craftsman and artist. He is the father of Icarus, the uncle of Perdix and possibly also the father of Iapyx, although this is unclear. - Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, . Philadelphia is the economic and cultural anchor of the Delaware Valleya region located in the Northeastern United States at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers with 7.2 million people residing in the eighth-largest combined statistical area in the United States. - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New Jersey, and to the north by Pennsylvania. The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor. - Diapsids (\\"two arches\\") are a group of amniote tetrapods that developed two holes (temporal fenestra) in each side of their skulls about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous period. The diapsids are extremely diverse, and include all crocodiles, lizards, snakes, tuatara, turtles, and dinosaurs (both avian and non-avian). Although some diapsids have lost either one hole (lizards), or both holes (snakes and turtles), or have a heavily restructured skull (modern birds), they are still classified as diapsids based on their ancestry. At least 7,925 species of diapsid reptiles exist in environments around the world today (nearly 18,000 when birds are included). - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - A turbine (from the Latin \\"turbo\\", a vortex, related to the Greek , \\"tyrb\\", meaning \\"turbulence\\") is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. The work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a generator or producing thrust, as in the case of jet engines. A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels. - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east. - Icarosaurus ( meaning \`\` Icarus lizard '' ) is an extinct genus of kuehneosaurid reptile from the Late Triassic ( Carnian age ) Lower Lockatong Formation of New Jersey , dated to around 228 million years ago . It is closely related to lizards and the tuatara . Based on a partial skeleton missing part of the tail , some ribs , a hand , and parts of the legs , it was a small animal , about 10 centimeters ( 4 in ) long from the skull to the hips . Like its relative Kuehneosaurus , it was able to glide short distances using ' wings ' consisting of highly elongated ribs covered with skin , with the upper surface convex and the lower surface concave , thus creating a simple airfoil structure well - suited to gliding . This method of gliding is also seen in Coelurosauravus and the modern Draco , neither of which are closely related to Icarosaurus . - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - It is part of the Newark-Union, NJ-PA Metropolitan Division of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. - Per capita income or average income measures the average income earned per person in a given area (city, region, country, etc.) in a specified year. It is calculated by dividing the area's total income by its total population. - New Jersey is a state in the Northeastern United States and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. It is bordered on the north and east by New York, on the southeast and south by the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Pennsylvania, and on the southwest by Delaware. New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state but the 11th-most populous and the most densely populated of the 50 United States. New Jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia and is the third-wealthiest U.S. state by per capita income as of 2014. - Toxicofera (Greek for \\"those who bear toxins\\"), is a proposed clade of scaled reptiles (squamates) that includes the Serpentes (snakes), Anguimorpha (monitor lizards, gila monster, and alligator lizards) and Iguania (iguanas, agamas, and chameleons). Toxicofera contains about 4600 species, (nearly 60%) of extant squamata. It encompasses all venomous reptile species, as well as numerous related non-venomous species. There is little morphological evidence to support this grouping, however it has been recovered by all recent molecular analyses. - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes. - Skin is the soft outer covering of vertebrates. Other animal coverings, such as the arthropod exoskeleton have different developmental origin, structure and chemical composition. The adjective cutaneous means \\"of the skin\\" (from Latin \\"cutis\\", skin). In mammals, the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue, and guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs. Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. All mammals have some hair on their skin, even marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and porpoises which appear to be hairless. The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors. For example, the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss. Its other functions are insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, and the production of vitamin D folates. Severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue. This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented. The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism. In humans for example, the skin located under the eyes and around the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5 mm thick, and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as \\"crows feet\\" and wrinkles. The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4 mm thick and the back is 14 mm thick and is the thickest skin in the body. The speed and quality of wound healing in skin is promoted by the reception of estrogen. - Kuehneosaurus is an extinct genus of Late Triassic kuehneosaurid reptile known from the Late Triassic (Norian stage) of southwest England. It was named by P. L. Robinson in 1962 and the type and only species is Kuehneosaurus latus. Measuring 72 centimetres long (2.3 feet), it had \\"wings\\" formed from ribs which jutted out from its body by as much as 14.3 cm, connected by a membrane which allowed it to slow its descent when jumping from trees. It is a member of a family of gliding reptiles, the Kuehneosauridae, within the larger group Lepidosauromorpha, which also contains modern lizards and tuatara. - The Triassic Lockatong Formation is a mapped bedrock unit in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. It is named after the Lockatong Creek in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. - Amphisbaenia (called amphisbaenians or worm lizards) is a group of usually legless squamates, comprising over 180 extant species. Amphisbaenians are characterized by their long bodies, the reduction or loss of the limbs, and rudimentary eyes. As many species have a pink body and scales arranged in rings, they have a superficial resemblance to earthworms. While the genus \\"Bipes\\" retains forelimbs, all other genera are limbless. Although superficially similar to the snakes and Dibamidae, recent phylogenetic studies suggest that they are most closely related to the Lacertidae. Amphisbaenians are widely distributed, occurring in North America, Europe, Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. Most species are less than long. Little is known of them outside of their anatomy, and even that is difficult to study due to the mechanics of dissecting such small animals. - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals. - The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) are an order of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles. They appeared 83.5 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, a less ambiguous vernacular term for this group is crocodilians. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - An airfoil (in American English) or aerofoil (in British English) is the shape of a wing, blade (of a propeller, rotor, or turbine), or sail (as seen in cross-section). - Herpetology (from Greek \\"\\"herpein\\"\\" meaning \\"to creep\\") is the branch of zoology concerned with the study of amphibians (including frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians (gymnophiona)) and reptiles (including snakes, lizards, amphisbaenids, turtles, terrapins, tortoises, crocodilians, and the tuataras). Batrachology is a further subdiscipline of herpetology concerned with the study of amphibians alone. - A combined statistical area (CSA) is composed of adjacent metropolitan (MSA) and micropolitan statistical areas (µSA) in the United States and Puerto Rico that can demonstrate economic or social linkage. The United States Office of Management and Budget defines a CSA as consisting of various combinations of adjacent metropolitan and micropolitan areas with economic ties measured by commuting patterns. These areas that combine retain their own designations as metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas within the larger combined statistical area. - The Northeastern United States, also referred to as the American Northeast or simply the Northeast, is a geographical region of the United States of America bordered to the north by Canada, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the south by the Southern United States, and to the west by the Midwestern United States. The Northeast is one of the four regions defined by the Census Bureau for the collection and analysis of statistics. The Census Bureau-defined region has a total area of with of that being land mass. Though lacking a unified cultural identity, the Northeastern region is the nation's most economically developed, densely populated, and culturally diverse region. Of the nation's four census regions, the Northeast is the second most urban, with 85 percent of its population residing in urban areas, led by the West with 90 percent. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Rhynchocephalia is an order of lizard-like reptiles that includes only two living species of tuatara (\\"Sphenodon punctatus\\" and \\"Sphenodon guntheri\\"), which only inhabit parts of New Zealand. Despite its current lack of diversity, the Rhynchocephalia at one time included a wide array of genera in several families and represents a lineage stretching back to the Mesozoic Era. Many of the niches occupied by lizards today were then held by sphenodontians. There were even several successful groups of aquatic sphenodontians such as pleurosaurs and the bizarre \\"Ankylosphenodon\\". - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - The Lepidosauria (from Greek meaning \\"scaled lizards\\") are reptiles with overlapping scales. This subclass includes Squamata and Rhynchocephalia. It is a monophyletic group and therefore contains all descendents of a common ancestor. Squamata includes snakes, lizards, and amphisbaenia. Rhynchocephalia was a widespread and diverse group 220-100 million years ago; however, it is now represented only by the genus \\"Sphenodon\\", which contains two species of tuatara, native to New Zealand. Lepidosauria is the sister taxon to Archosauria, which includes Aves and Crocodilia. Lizards and snakes are the most speciose group of Lepidosaurs and, combined, contain over 9,000 species. There are many noticeable distinguishing morphological differences between lizards, tuataras, and snakes. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\" - Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis, or skin. Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair types and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably keratin. - The Carnian (less commonly, Karnian) is the lowermost stage of the Upper Triassic series (or earliest age of the Late Triassic epoch). It lasted from 237 to 228.4 million years ago (Ma). The Carnian is preceded by the Ladinian and is followed by the Norian. Its boundaries are not characterized by major extinctions or biotic turnovers, but a climatic event (known as the Carnian Pluvial Event) occurred during the Carnian and seems to be associated with important extinctions or biotic radiations. - Coelurosauravus (meaning \\"hollow lizard grandfather\\") is a genus of basal diapsid reptile, with specialized wing-like structures allowing it to glide. These were rod like structures with skin stretched over them. These bony rods are not extensions of the ribs but are newly evolved dermal bones, a feature which is unique to the genus. - In Greek mythology, Icarus (the Latin spelling, conventionally adopted in English \\"Íkaros\\", Etruscan: \\"Vikare\\") is the son of the master craftsman Daedalus, the creator of the Labyrinth. Often depicted in art, Icarus and his father attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris, asking that he fly neither too low nor too high, so the sea's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the sun, when the wax in his wings melted and he fell into the sea. This tragic theme of failure at the hands of hubris contains similarities to that of Phaëthon. - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - Arthropods (class Athropoda) are covered with a tough, resilient integument or exoskeleton of chitin. Generally the exoskeleton will have thickened areas in which the chitin is reinforced or stiffened by materials such as minerals or hardened proteins. This happens in parts of the body where there is a need for rigidity or elasticity. Typically the mineral crystals, mainly calcium carbonate, are deposited among the chitin and protein molecules in a process called biomineralization. The crystals and fibres interpenetrate and reinforce each other, the minerals supplying the hardness and resistance to compression, while the chitin supplies the tensile strength. Biomineralization occurs mainly in crustaceans; in insects and Arachnids the main reinforcing materials are various proteins hardened by linking the fibres in processes called sclerotisation and the hardened proteins are called sclerotin. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although resembling most lizards, they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia. Their name derives from the Mori language, and means \\"peaks on the back\\". The single species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which flourished around 200 million years ago. Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes). For this reason, tuatara are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs, birds, and crocodilians. - Kuehneosauridae is an extinct family of small, lizard-like lepidosauromorph diapsids known from the Triassic period of Europe and North America. - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.

To say the least he was annoying. He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks.

Movie title: The Mummy's Ghost Context: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (December 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Andoheb, the aging High Priest of Arkam (Karnak in the previous films), has summoned Yousef Bey to the Temple of Arkam to pass on the duties of High Priest. Beforehand, Andoheb explains the legend of Kharis to Bey. Meanwhile, in Mapleton, Massachusetts, Professor Matthew Norman, who had examined one of Kharis' missing bandage pieces during the Mummy's last spree through Mapleton, also explains the legends of the Priests of Arkam and Kharis to his History class who are less than believing. After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey, meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori, a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. However, a strange, clouded feeling in her mind occurs when ever the subject of Egypt is mentioned. Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousefâs mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt. Yousef Bey pledges his devotion before Andoheb explains that during each full moon, Yousef Bey is to brew the fluid from nine tana leaves. Kharis will sense this and find the leaves wherever they are. The moon is full in Mapleton as Professor Norman studies the hieroglyphics on a case of tana leaves. He has deciphered the message about brewing nine tana leaves during the full moon and decides to do just that. The battered, ragged form of Kharis the Mummy, however, senses the leaves brewing and heads toward them. On the way, he passes the home of Amina and she follows him in a trance-like state. Kharis soon arrives at the home of Professor Norman, strangles him, and drinks the fluid of the tana leaves. Amina sees Kharis, which snaps her out of her trance but also causes her to faint. She falls to the ground with a strange birthmark now apparent on her wrist. The next morning, the...

Question: I have a new situation: Pam and Alice studied Earth's climate and vegetation. Pam studied more about high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied about lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S). But I can use this background: Alpine tundra occurs at high enough altitude at any latitude. Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft). What is an answer for this question: Which person studied less about the North American Cordillera? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question of which person studied less about the North American Cordillera, we need to analyze the information provided regarding Pam and Alice's study areas as well as the background information about alpine tundra and its distribution. Step 1: Identify the study areas of Pam and Alice Pam studied high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S). Step 2: Analyze the background information about alpine tundra Alpine tundra occurs at high enough altitude at any latitude. Large regions of alpine tundra can be found in the North American Cordillera, which is the main focus of this question. Step 3: Determine the latitudes of the North American Cordillera The North American Cordillera spans a wide range of latitudes. For the purpose of this question, we know that its alpine tundra biomes, which can be found at high altitudes, fall within Pam's study area (high latitudes), specifically within the 70 to 50°N latitude range. Step 4: Compare Pam and Alice's study areas with respect to the North American Cordillera Pam studied high latitudes, which include the alpine tundra regions within the North American Cordillera. Alice, on the other hand, focused on lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S) that do not include the North American Cordillera alpine tundra. Step 5: Determine which person studied less about the North American Cordillera Based on the comparison made in Step 4, we can conclude that Alice studied less about the North American Cordillera because her study area (30°N to 20°S) does not include the region's alpine tundra found in the high latitudes (70 to 50°N) that Pam studied.

How does the sentence end? (CNN) -- The recent NATO summit in Newport, Wales was initially meant to prepare the alliance for the post-Afghanistan era and pooling of resources at the time of defense cuts, known in NATO lingua as \\"smart defense.\\" However, as often happens, the summit agenda was hijacked by more current and dramatic developments: the rise of ISIS in Iraq and Russia's push into Ukraine. Both these developments have reminded NATO that its core business -- the defense of its member states -- needs to be returned to the center of the alliance's agenda. Russia's annexation of Crimea and continued push into the south-east of Ukraine -- a NATO partner country -- has inevitably provoked fear amongst Ukraine's neighbors, all of whom have relatively fresh memories of Russian domination. Russia's actions in Ukraine have made the pretense of partnership ridiculous and as much was acknowledged by NATO states in OPTIONS: - CNN. - Crimea. - ISIS. - Iraq. - Marcin Zaborowski. - NATO. - Newport. - Russia. - Russian. - Ukraine. - Wales. - Zaborowski. - post-Afghanistan.","completion":"NATO.

I can use this background: Earthquakes may take place every day near a volcano. But before an eruption, the number and size of earthquakes increases. This is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion causes stresses on neighboring rock to build up. Eventually the ground shakes. A continuous string of earthquakes may indicate that a volcano is about to erupt. Scientists use seismographs to record the length and strength of each earthquake.

Translate to English.","completion":"Facing the decline in public development aid flows and the targeted amounts for the allocation of basic resources, UNDP will seek to partner with various development actors and donors in order to pool its resources with theirs and provide maximum development impact. In recent years, there has been a decline in public development aid flows and the amounts allocated for basic resources. This has prompted the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to look for alternative ways to maximize the impact of development aid. The UNDP has identified the need to collaborate with other development actors and donors to ensure more efficient use of resources and a greater overall impact on development. In response to these challenges, the UNDP has set out several strategies to explore new partnerships and alliances. These strategies include: 1. Engaging with innovative sources of financing for development: The private sector, in particular, can offer unique opportunities to tap into additional sources of funding, such as impact investing, social impact bonds, and public-private partnerships. These new sources of financing can provide the much-needed resources to address development challenges effectively. 2. Collaborating with diverse development stakeholders: The UNDP acknowledges the importance of collaborating with various actors in the development sphere, such as civil society organizations, foundations, academic institutions, and bilateral and multilateral organizations. These diverse partnerships can bring unique expertise, knowledge, and perspectives to enhance the UNDP's efforts and broaden its reach. 3. Encouraging South-South and triangular cooperation: The UNDP recognizes the importance of fostering partnerships between countries of the Global South. South-South cooperation enables developing countries themselves to lead and participate in the development process, while triangular cooperation allows for more traditional, Northern donors to support South-South initiatives. 4. Harnessing the power of technology: Digital technology has great potential to revolutionize the way we approach development. The UNDP will explore partnerships with technology firms, research institutes, and other actors within the digital ecosystem to address development challenges through innovative and locally-adapted solutions. 5. Leveraging networks and platforms: UNDP will work with existing international and regional networks and platforms to share knowledge, experiences, and best practices. These networks and platforms can foster collaboration and synergy among various development actors, enabling them to learn from one another and jointly tackle shared challenges. Through these targeted partnership strategies, the UNDP aims to mobilize its resources more effectively and amplify the impact of development efforts. By engaging a wide range of actors, the UNDP can better address the multifaceted challenges of poverty, inequality, environmental degradation, and political instability, thus supporting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rachel Carruthers and Jamie, Michael Myers's 8-year-old niece are being pursued by Michael while in a truck. Michael climbs onto the roof and tries to drive them off the road, but Rachel slams on the brakes, sending Michael slamming onto the gravel below. As he stands up, Rachel floors it and slams into him, sending him flying into a nearby field. At this time, police cars arrive and Rachel leaves the truck to go speak with them, telling Jamie to stay there. But Jamie is too curious and walks over to Michael's lifeless body, taking his hand in hers. Right then, Rachel spots her and yells for her not to touch him. Suddenly, Michael's grip tightens on his knife as he begins to rise. Jamie ducks down as the police begin firing at him. Michael eventually stumbles backwards into an abandoned mine shaft, apparently dead. The police then set up a dynamite, causing the entire shaft to explode, but Michael, who we now know is alive, but mortally wounded, has already managed to crawl out into the river below. Next to the river is a small cottage where a hermit and his pet parrot live. The hermit stands by a stove, stirring something in a pot as the parrot chatters away. Annoyed, the hermit yells at it to be quiet as Michael slowly approaches the cottage outside. The hermit, now suspicious that someone might be outside, ventures out the door, finding nothing at all. As he goes back into the house, Michael suddenly leaps out and grabs him by the neck, but he then falls over, unconscious once again.

Cook was a student of Antonín Dvořák and performed for King George V among others. He is probably best known for his popular songs and Broadway musicals, such as \\"\\" and \\"In Dahomey\\".","completion":"Based on the provided text, we can determine the age of William Mercer Cook, better known as Will Marion Cook, at the time of his passing by calculating the time duration between his birth and death dates. William Mercer Cook was born on January 27, 1869, and passed away on July 19, 1944. To determine his age at the time of his passing, we must calculate the difference in years between the two dates: 1944 (year of death) - 1869 (year of birth) = 75 years Since Cook was born on January 27th and died on July 19th, we need to verify if he had his birthday before passing away: January 27th comes before July 19th, which means Cook turned 75 in 1944 before his passing.

Desperate to prove himself again, he searches for a story that can put him back in the spotlight. 2. One night, Adam hears a strange, uncontrollable laughter coming from a house nearby. Peeping through a window, he sees a drugged girl, Emma, whose laughter is both disturbing and contagious. 3. Intrigued by the mystery, Adam begins to investigate Emma's life and soon finds out that she is a victim of an overbearing mother who drugs her with multicolored pills to keep her quiet and obedient. 4. The townspeople of Hawkes seem entranced by Emma's laughter. They gather around her house, gaining euphoria from the sound of her laughter. Act 2: 1. As the story unfolds, Adam learns that the drugged girl's laughter is linked to a series of unsolved murders that happened years ago in Hawkes. The victims, all young women, had been found dead with a single multicolored pill in their hands. 2. Adam delves deeper into the story and begins receiving anonymous threats, urging him to stop his investigation. Despite the danger, Adam finds the story he's been longing for and continues to unravel the town's dark secrets. 3. In the meantime, Emma's mother feels the pressure of the impending exposure of her involvement in the decades-old murders. 4. Adam discovers the truth: The multicolored pills were created by Emma's mother, who merely wanted to suppress her daughter's precognitive ability to expose the murderers with her laughter. However, when the townspeople found out about the pills and the \\"cure\\" to their troubled past, they became addicted to the peculiar sound of Emma's laughter. Act 3: 1. The entire town spirals into chaos as the residents become more addicted to Emma's laughter, which begins to take a significant toll on her well-being. Emma's mother realizes the destruction her actions have caused and tries to reverse the effects of the pills. 2. Meanwhile, Adam publishes the full truth in a major newspaper, causing the town's dark past to resurface and its inhabitants to pay for their addiction to the laughter they thought would heal them. 3. Emma's mother confesses her crimes and tries to evade the consequences of her actions but is ultimately arrested. 4. The town now struggles to recover from its dark past and newfound infamy. However, Emma, finally free from the pills and her mother's control, starts a new life away from Hawkes, her laughter now a symbol of her reclaimed freedom and a reminder that she has survived the darkness that once consumed her. In \\"The Haunting Laughter,\\" the mystery of what makes the drugged girl laugh becomes an exploration of forgiveness, addiction, and facing the consequences of one's actions. The residents of Hawkes will never forget the laughter that both seduced and destroyed their town and the journalist who brought the truth to light."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Carson?\\", is \\"someone who does not read instrucions\\" a valid answer? Options: --Yes --No","completion":"Option: No While it might seem reasonable to describe Carson as \\"someone who does not read instructions\\" based on the information that he exceeded the weight limit of his suitcase, this is not necessarily a valid description. It is important to remember that people's behaviors and actions cannot be interpreted as a comprehensive reflection of their character based on a single instance. If Carson exceeded the weight limit of his suitcase, there could be a variety of reasons behind this. For example, he might have been unaware of the weight limit, did not have a means to measure the weight of his suitcase, could have been in a hurry while packing, or he might had a belief that the airline would be lenient. It's also possible he did read the instructions, but made an error in estimating the weight of his items. Any of these scenarios could occur even if a person was usually diligent in reading instructions. In order to validly describe Carson as \\"someone who does not read instructions,\\" we would need a consistent pattern of behavior that indicates this trait. For instance, if Carson regularly overlooks instructions in different scenarios - assembling furniture, operating electronics, following recipes, abiding by traffic rules etc., then we could more confidently label him as \\"someone who does not read instructions.\\" Therefore, without further evidence of Carson's behavior in other contexts, it would be misleading and unsubstantiated to describe him as \\"someone who does not read instructions\\" based solely on the fact that he exceeded the weight limit for his suitcase. It is essential to avoid generalizations based on a single instance and to consider a broad range of behaviors and contexts when forming a characterization of someone's personality or traits. This respects the complexity of individuals and the multi-faceted nature of our actions and behaviors. It also ensures we do not unfairly label or stereotype people based on limited information."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Her doubles match alongside sister Venus lasted just three games, with Serena unable to get the ball over the net when it was her turn to serve. But now, as she prepares to return to action at the WTA's Stanford tournament, the 32-year-old says the commotion caused by her viral illness had taken her by surprise. \\"They just said I was really ill, and really under the weather and I just wasn't doing very well,\\" Williams told reporters prior to the Bank Of The West Classic in California about her turn at Wimbledon. \\"I was really scared after because I didn't realize how I felt until later and it's just, you know, 'Serena, keep your time, you will have the rest of your life to keep playing tennis hopefully.' \\"I heard a lot of the response weeks and weeks later because I didn't leave my house or my bed for a few days. \\"But by the time that happened when I read or heard about it from other people I was just like, 'Oh really, I already moved on.'

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the name of the record company that reissued the album? Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, Kirk Hammett. Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping...

Here's a detailed explanation on how to do it: 1. Gather your materials: To start melting your butter, you will need a pan (preferably a non-stick pan), a spatula or wooden spoon for stirring (to help with even melting), and your desired amount of butter. 2. Preheat the stove: Set the stove to a low heat. This is crucial for melting the butter gently and evenly, without burning it. Butter can sometimes burn quickly if the heat is too high, so setting the stove to low heat ensures that it melts smoothly and you have more control over the process. 3. Add the butter to the pan: Cut your butter into small, uniform pieces, so it melts more evenly. Carefully place the pieces into the pan, spreading them out to make sure they are not all clumped together. 4. Gently stir the butter: Use your spatula or wooden spoon to gently stir the butter as it melts. This will help ensure that the butter melts evenly and prevents the likelihood of burning or scorching. Stirring also helps to break down any larger pieces that may still be solid. 5. Monitor the melting process: Keep a close eye on the butter as it melts, paying attention to the color and consistency. Melting butter should maintain a light yellow color. If it starts to turn brown, it means that the heat is too high, and you should reduce the stove's heat settings immediately. 6. Remove the pan from the heat: Once the butter has reached your desired consistency – it should be fully melted and smooth – carefully remove the pan from the heat source. Make sure to turn off the stove when you are finished. 7. Allow the butter to cool slightly: Depending on your intended use for the melted butter, you might need to let it cool for a few moments before incorporating it into your recipe. Be cautious when handling the hot pan and melted butter to avoid burns. By following the instructions in Option B, you will be able to melt butter gently and evenly without the risk of burning it. This method provides greater control over the melting process, ensuring that you achieve the desired consistency and avoid any scorching or burning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation.

The cooler air from the sea then rushes in to fill the space, and we get what's called a sea breeze. At night, the opposite happens. The land cools down faster than the sea. So, the air above the sea is now warmer and rises. The cooler air from the land then goes toward the sea to fill the space, making what we call a land breeze. So the wind direction changes between day and night because of these temperature differences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. John was responsible for the biggest oil spill ever. It was entirely what? A. detestable B. enabled C. effusive D. weird E. accidental The best answer is A:","completion":"A. detestable The best answer in this context is A. detestable, as it describes the oil spill as something that is considered deeply unpleasant, abhorrent, and deserving of strong disapproval. The massive oil spill, for which John was held responsible, would have had immensely detrimental consequences on the environment, marine life, and local ecosystems. Such a disaster would typically garner negative reactions and widespread disapproval from both the public and environmental activists, thus making \\"detestable\\" an appropriate choice of word. An oil spill of that magnitude would not only have immediate consequences but also long-lasting effects on the environment. The spilled oil can suffocate marine plants and animals, poison the food chain, contaminate breeding grounds, and cause a decline in local fisheries and tourism industries. Furthermore, cleaning up oil spills may require considerable resources and time, and sometimes complete recovery is virtually impossible. This can lead to significant economic and ecological losses. The other options given do not accurately convey the severity or implications of such a disastrous event: B. Enabled - This option suggests that the oil spill was facilitated or made possible by certain conditions, but it does not appropriately address the negative impact of the incident. C. Effusive - This term refers to expressing excessive emotion, enthusiasm, or gratitude, which does not align with the context of an oil spill. D. Weird - While the term \\"weird\\" denotes something strange or unusual, it is not strong enough to express the repugnance associated with a massive oil spill. E. Accidental - Although many oil spills may be accidental, the term itself does not effectively convey the negative implications and gravity of such an event. It is not necessarily the best descriptor in the context provided. In conclusion, the best answer to describe John's responsibility for the biggest oil spill ever is \\"A. detestable,\\" as it emphasizes the immense negative impact the event would have on the environment, wildlife, and local communities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways. - Porphyritic is an adjective used in geology, specifically for igneous rocks, for a rock that has a distinct difference in the size of the crystals, with at least one group of crystals obviously larger than another group. Porphyritic rocks may be aphanites or extrusive, with large crystals or phenocrysts floating in a fine-grained groundmass of non-visible crystals, as in a porphyritic basalt, or phanerites or intrusive, with individual crystals of the groundmass easily distinguished with the eye, but one group of crystals clearly much bigger than the rest, as in a porphyritic granite. Most types of igneous rocks may display some degree of porphyritic texture. One main type of rock that has a porphyritic texture are porphyry, though not all porphyritic rocks are porphyries. - Jeffrey Corwin (born July 11, 1967) is an American wildlife biologist and nature conservationist, known as host and executive producer of the Animal Planet cable channel television programs \\"The Jeff Corwin Experience\\" and \\"Corwin's Quest\\". - The bighorn sheep (\\"Ovis canadensis\\") is a species of sheep native to North America named for its large horns. These horns can weigh up to , while the sheep themselves weigh up to . Recent genetic testing indicates three distinct subspecies of \\"Ovis canadensis\\", one of which is endangered: \\"O. c. sierrae\\". Sheep originally crossed to North America over the Bering land bridge from Siberia: the population in North America peaked in the millions, and the bighorn sheep entered into the mythology of Native Americans. By 1900, the population had crashed to several thousand, due to diseases introduced through European livestock and overhunting.

Suggestion: The question may involve starting question words like WHERE, WHEN, HOW, WHAT (in Spanish). CONTEXT: Críticas negativas al Plan Marshall Las primeras críticas al Plan Marshall llegaron desde diversos economistas de corte liberal. Wilhelm Röpke, que tuvo una gran influencia sobre las decisiones económicas del canciller alemán Ludwig Erhard en su programa económico de recuperación, creía que la recuperación económica debía basarse en la eliminación de la planificación centralizada, y en la restauración de la economía de mercado en Europa, y en especial en aquellos países que habían adoptado políticas económicas de carácter fascista y corporativista. Röpke criticaba el Plan Marshall porque se interponía en la transición al libre mercado mediante el subsidio de los sistemas existentes. Erhard puso en práctica la teoría de Röpke, y más tarde le atribuiría el mérito en el éxito económico de Alemania. Henry Hazlitt, por su parte, criticaba el Plan Marshall en su libro Will Dollars Save the World? (en español, ¿Salvarán el mundo los dólares?), publicado en 1947, y en el que argumentaba que la recuperación económica procedía a través del ahorro, la acumulación de capital y la empresa privada, y no a través de subsidios monetarios. Ludwig von Mises también criticó el Plan Marshall en 1951 y, según sus palabras, creía que \\"los subsidios americanos posibilitan que los gobiernos oculten parcialmente los efectos desastrosos de varias medidas socialistas que han adoptado.\\" También hacía una crítica general a la ayuda extranjera, considerando que servía para crear enemigos ideológicos en lugar de socios económicos, por interferir con el libre mercado.

Children can spend hours a day looking at computer screens and other digital devices . Some eye doctors say this leads to an increase in \\"computer vision syndrome .\\" Nathan Bonilla-Warford is an optometrist in Tampa, Florida. He has seen an increase in problems in children. \\"A lot more children come into the office either because their parents have noticed that they have headaches or red or watery eyes or discomfort, or because their nearsightedness appears to be increasing and they're worried,\\" he says. Dr. Bonilla-Warford says part of the problem is that children may be more likely to pay no attention to early warning signs than adults. \\"Even if their eyes start to feel uncomfortable or they start to get a headache, they're less likely to tell their parents, because they don't want to have the game or the computer or whatever taken away,\\" he explains. He says another part of the problem is that people blink less often when they use digital devices. He says, \\"A person who uses an electronic device blinks about one third as much as we normally do in everyday life. And so that can result in the front part of the eye drying and not staying protected like normal.\\" Eye doctors offer suggestions like following which is known as the 20/20/20 rule. That means every twenty minutes look away twenty feet or more for at least twenty seconds from whatever device you're using. Other suggestions include putting more distance between you and the device and using good lighting. Of course, another way is to spend less time looking at screens. Many experts say children should spend no more than two hours a day using digital devices--with no screen time for children under two. But not all eye doctors have noticed an increase in problems in children. Dr. David Hunter, from Children's Hospital Boston, has not seen an increase in his practice. \\"While it is possible to develop _ looking at screens for a long period of time, there's certainly no proof that it actually causes any damage to the eyes.\\" he says. 1.

Jon Stewart was born Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz on November 28, 1962, in New York City, to Marian (nee Laskin), a teacher and later educational consultant, and Donald Leibowitz, a professor of physics at The College of New Jersey and Thomas Edison State College. Stewart's family are Litvak Jews who emigrated to America from Poland, Ukraine and Belarus. One of his grandfathers was born in Manzhouli (now part of Inner Mongolia). He is the second of four sons, with older brother Lawrence and younger brothers Dan and Matthew. Stewart was an important factor in the unionization of the Comedy Central writers. The Daily Show writers were the first of Comedy Central's writers to be able to join the guild, after which other shows followed. Stewart supported the 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike. On The Daily Show episode just before the strike, he sarcastically commented about how Comedy Central had made available all episodes for free on their website, but without advertising, and said, \\"go support our advertisers\\". The show went on hiatus when the strike began, as did other late night talk shows. Upon Stewart's return to the show on January 7, 2008, he refused to use the title The Daily Show, stating that The Daily Show was the show made with all of the people responsible for the broadcast, including his writers. During the strike, he referred to his show as A Daily Show with Jon Stewart until the strike ended on February 13, 2008. Stewart's choice to return to the air did bring criticism that he was undermining the writers of his show. Seth MacFarlane wrote an inside joke into an episode of Family Guy about this, causing Stewart to respond with an hour-long call in which he questioned how MacFarlane could consider himself the \\"moral arbiter\\" of Hollywood. Other former writers of The Daily Show such as David Feldman have also indicated that Stewart was anti-union at the time and punished his writers for their decision to unionize. The Writers Guild Strike of 2007-08 was also responsible for a notable mock feud between Stewart, Stephen Colbert, and Conan O'Brien in early 2008. Without writers to help fuel their banter, the three comedians concocted a crossover/rivalry in order to garner more viewers during the ratings slump. Colbert made the claim that because of \\"the Colbert bump\\", he was responsible for Mike Huckabee's success in the 2008 presidential race. O'Brien claimed that he was responsible for Huckabee's success because not only had he mentioned Huckabee on his show, but also that he was responsible for Chuck Norris's success (Norris backed Huckabee). In response, Stewart claimed that he was responsible for the success of O'Brien, since Stewart had featured him on The Jon Stewart Show, and in turn the success of Huckabee. This resulted in a three-part comedic battle between the three pundits, with all three appearing on each other's shows. The feud ended on Late Night with Conan O'Brien with a mock brawl involving the three hosts. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: How long was it on hiatus?","completion":"The Daily Show went on hiatus during the 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike. The show went off air at the start of the strike, returning when Jon Stewart resumed hosting on January 7, 2008. Thus, the show was on hiatus for an unmentioned specific length of time spanning from the end of 2007 to the beginning of 2008. However, since the strike ended on February 13, 2008, it might suggest that the \\"hiatus\\" for the Daily Show, as with other late-night shows, would revolve around the duration of the strike. It is essential to mention that the hiatus didn't end with resumption of the show on January 7th but they returned to air without their team of writers, which was essentially the backbone of the show. This action stirred quite a lot of controversy. The exact duration of the hiatus isn't explicitly mentioned in the information provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Malcolm X was an influential African American figure, civil rights activist, and a key member of the Nation of Islam before his assassination.

The assassination was carried out by three members of the Nation of Islam: Talmadge Hayer (also known as Thomas Hagan), Norman 3X Butler (also known as Muhammad Abdul Aziz), and Thomas 15X Johnson (also known as Khalil Islam). It is broadly understood that tensions between Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam exacerbated following his departure from the organization in 1964, ultimately resulting in the plot to murder him. Hayer admitted his involvement in the assassination, and all three men were convicted of first-degree murder. They were subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment. Butler and Johnson maintained their innocence, and many researchers and scholars have questioned their involvement in the assassination. Butler was paroled in 1985, and Johnson was paroled in 1987.

Passage:A military flying school was set up at the site of the present-day RAAF base on 28 August 1916, when the area was known as Ham Common. RAAF Station Richmond was established on 30 June 1925 as the fledgling service's first air base outside Victoria. Its initial flying unit was No. 3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron, operating Airco DH.9 light bombers and Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 fighters, and for the next decade the commanding officer of No. 3 Squadron was also in charge of the base. Among these were Squadron Leaders Frank Lukis (1925–30), Harry Cobby (1930–31), and Bill Bostock (1931–33). Headquarters RAAF Station Richmond was formed as a separate entity on 20 April 1936, under the command of Group Captain Adrian \\"King\\" Cole. Other units, including No. 22 Squadron flying Hawker Demons, and No. 2 Aircraft Depot, had been established in the preceding months. No. 4 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron was formed in May 1937, followed by No. 6 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron in March 1939. Two Fleet Cooperation units were also established, No. 5 Squadron in April 1936 and No. 9 Squadron in January 1939. No. 23 (General Purpose) Squadron formed in February 1939. As well as an Air Force base, in its pre-war days Richmond was used as a supplementary airport for Sydney; various aviation pioneers employed it in the 1930s, including Charles Kingsford Smith and Jean Batten.

The question in question is: \\"How old was Adrian \\"King\\" Cole the year that headquarters RAAF Station Richmond was formed as a separate entity?\\" Guidelines to complete this task: 1. Skim through the main question and understand what it is asking. In this case, you need to know the age of Adrian \\"King\\" Cole in a particular year. 2. Read through the context passage provided. 3. Identify the proper nouns/terms in the passage to understand potential sources of information to answer the main question. 4. Now, start to analyse if these identified terms provide enough information to answer the asked question. Recall that you have two options: Yes (a) or No (b). In the passage, you can see that the headquarters RAAF Station Richmond is the term that directly relates to the question, particularly where it mentions the year it was formed as a separate entity, which is 1936. Adrian \\"King\\" Cole, the person of interest, is mentioned as the commander of the station in that year. However, there is no information provided in this passage about Adrian \\"King\\" Cole's birth year or his age at any particular point in time. Therefore, no matter how many terms you refer to in this passage, you won't be able to determine Adrian \\"King\\" Cole's age in 1936 based solely on this passage.

Step 1: Define homogeneous mixture A homogeneous mixture is a mixture in which all its components are uniformly distributed throughout the mixture, giving it a consistent appearance and composition. Step 2: Discuss properties of homogeneous mixtures Some properties of homogeneous mixtures are: - Uniform appearance: These mixtures have a consistent look with no visible boundaries between their components. - Uniform composition: The ratio of the components in the mixture remains constant throughout, irrespective of the amount taken from the mixture. - Interconvertibility: Homogeneous mixtures can often be separated into their original components through physical processes such as evaporation, distillation, or filtration. Step 3: Give an example of a homogeneous mixture where all components are dissolved in the same phase An example of a homogeneous mixture where all components are dissolved in the same phase would be a solution of salt dissolved in water, also known as saline solution. In this case, both the components (salt and water) are present in the liquid phase.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? an ebullient tunisian film about the startling transformation of a tradition-bound widow who is drawn into the exotic world of belly dancing .","completion":"The sentiment of the given movie review sentence is positive. The basic tenet of sentiment analysis is to determine whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. In this case, specific words and phrases used express positive sentiments about the film. The word \\"ebullient\\" stands out prominently as a strong positive sentiment. It means being cheerful and full of energy, which highlights the reviewer's enthusiastic response towards the film. This term provides an overall positive tone, indicating the critic's favorable impression. Another expression that exudes positivity is \\"startling transformation,\\" implying that the change the chief character goes through is impressive and unexpected, thereby exciting the viewer. Although the word 'startling' could sometimes be associated with surprise or fear, in this context, it's used to provide a sense of amazement and thus denotes positive sentiment. Further, the phrase, \\"drawn into the exotic world of belly dancing,\\" also suggests an allure or attractiveness. The word \\"exotic\\" often implies an enchanting or appealing difference from the norm, indicating another positive sentiment. The sentence does not contain any words or phrases that would traditionally indicate a negative or neutral sentiment. Terms which could sometimes be seen as negative such as 'tradition-bound widow' are flipped into a positive context through the narrative of her transformation and entrance into an 'exotic world'. In conclusion, the sentiment of the review sentence indicates a positive and favorable opinion towards the film. The language and diction used by the reviewer express enthusiasm, surprise, and interest. It suggests that the movie is engaging, energizing, and takes the viewer on an unexpected and pleasing journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a premise: radios and cassettes and things like that Here is a hypothesis: Things like radios and cassettes. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To evaluate whether the hypothesis holds true if the premise is true, let's first break down the given premise and hypothesis. Premise: \\"Radios and cassettes and things like that\\" This premise refers to a class or group of objects that include radios and cassettes and other similar items. We can infer that \\"things like that\\" within the context of the premise encompass objects with similar or related functionalities, such as devices that transmit, record, or reproduce audio signals. These may include, but are not limited to, radio receivers, cassette players and recorders, turntables, media playback devices, and audio transmission devices. Hypothesis: \\"Things like radios and cassettes\\" The hypothesis also addresses a group of objects that share similarities with radios and cassettes. Although the hypothesis does not specify \\"and things like that,\\" it still suggests that the focus is on objects which possess functionalities related to those of radios and cassettes. Now, to evaluate if the premise being true leads to the hypothesis being true, we can examine the correlation between the two statements. When the premise states \\"radios and cassettes and things like that,\\" it is describing a broader category of devices that encompass not only radios and cassettes but also other devices with similar functions. Since the hypothesis specifically mentions \\"things like radios and cassettes,\\" it can be deduced that the hypothesis narrows down the broader category to focus on objects similar to these two specific items. Thus, if the premise is true, meaning there is a class or group of objects that include radios, cassettes, and other similar items, it is reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis would also be true because radios and cassettes form the core basis of the objects' classification in both the premise and hypothesis. The hypothesis focuses on a subset of objects from the broader category that the premise covers, but the underlying connection to radios and cassettes is consistent and clear. In conclusion, if the premise is true and there indeed exists a group of objects consisting of radios, cassettes, and related devices, then the hypothesis, which centers on \\"things like radios and cassettes,\\" also holds true as it captures a more specific yet coherent classification of objects within the larger context established by the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If The airy, bright Baroque church of St-Louis-en-l'Ile illuminates with a golden light its fine collection of Dutch, Flemish, and Italian 16th- and 17th-century art., can we conclude that \\"The Church of St-Louis-en-I'Ile is right across the street from The Louvre. \\"?","completion":"Based on the information given about the airy, bright Baroque church of St-Louis-en-l'Ile and its fine collection of Dutch, Flemish, and Italian 16th- and 17th-century art, it is not possible to conclude that \\"The Church of St-Louis-en-l'Ile is right across the street from The Louvre.\\" To determine the location of the church in relation to the Louvre, it is necessary to review additional information and context. The Church of St-Louis-en-l'Ile, also known as Église Saint-Louis-en-l'Île, is situated on Île Saint-Louis in Paris, France. Île Saint-Louis is one of the two natural islands on the River Seine. The church was built between 1624 and 1726 and is renowned for its beautiful baroque architecture, rich history, and unique art collection. The Louvre, on the other hand, is one of the world’s most famous museums, also located in Paris, France. It is situated on the Right Bank of the River Seine, housed within the Louvre Palace. The museum houses an extensive art collection, including the renowned Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. Even though The Church of St-Louis-en-l'Ile and The Louvre are both situated in Paris and are near the River Seine, they are not located right across the street from each other. Île Saint-Louis, where the church is located, is approximately 2.5 kilometers from the Louvre. To travel from The Louvre to St-Louis-en-l'Ile, one could walk along the banks of the Seine, which would take approximately 30 minutes. Alternatively, using public transportation like the metro could shorten the travel time to around 15-20 minutes. In conclusion, while both The Church of St-Louis-en-l'Ile and The Louvre share a commonality of being culturally and historically significant places in Paris near the River Seine, they are not directly across the street from each other. The claim that they are in such close proximity is inaccurate based on the actual locations and distances between these two landmarks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Bunraku Movie plot: In a hyperreal, hyper-saturated, hyper-driven dystopia, guns are banned upon pain of death and the sword is now king.Nicola the Woodcutter is the most powerful man east of the Atlantic, a shadowy crime boss who rules with an iron fist with the help of his lady Alexandra, a femme fatale with a secret past, and nine diverse assassins and the Red Gang, a force not to be trifled with. His right-hand man is Killer #2, a cold-hearted, smooth-talking, toe-tapping murderer dressed in red and wielding a deadly blade without remorse. The citizens live in fear of this pack of wolves, and wait for the hero who can overthrow the tyrant.One night, a mysterious drifter walks into the Horseless Horseman Saloon of the local insurgent bartender and desires two things: a shot of whisky and to kill Nicola. Soon, another stranger enters the bar, a samurai named Yoshi. Yoshi wants to avenge his father by taking back a talisman that Nicola stole from his clan. Armed with crossed destinies and incredible fighting skills and guided by the wisdom of the bartender, the two eventually join forces to bring down the corrupt and contemptuous reign of Nicola and set out on a journey, breaking bones and cracking heads in search for Nicola.In an amalgam of samurai film, spaghetti western and chop socky and using a stylish blend of neo-noir, German expressionism and Russian futurism, characters in the world of Bunraku spin and ricochet against a backdrop that resembles a pop-up-book made of origami, ever-changing and whirring like a steam driven Victorian theatre set. It is a universe driven by pugilistic force, delivered in a brash style of amazing physical combat sequences. A:","completion":"In the plot of the movie \\"Bunraku\\", the weapons that are banned are guns. This prohibition is so strict that the use of guns is punished by death. Other forms of weaponry, such as swords, are still allowed as indicated by the phrase \\"the sword is now king\\". This suggests a predominant reliance on melee weapons, exemplified by the various characters' use of swords and physical combat skills as their primary means of conflict resolution. The ban on firearms leads to a society characterized by intense hand-to-hand combat, creating a distinct, hyperreal environment in the movie's dystopian setting. This choice of banning guns in favor of other weapons adds an additional layer of stylistic and thematic complexity to the film's narrative. In this dystopian world, power is enforced not just by ruling with an 'iron fist', but literally by the use of bladed weaponry and brutal physical prowess. This same prohibition also sets the stage for the intense martial arts sequences and stylistic flourishes that characterize the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a title: AFP - Portuguese Prime Minister Pedro Santana Lopes defended his government's budget for 2005 on the eve of its vote in parliament, arguing it will maintain budgetary rigor even as it cuts income taxes and raises pensions and civil servant salaries.","completion":"Title: \\"Portuguese Prime Minister Advocates for 2005 Government Budget Prior to Crucial Parliamentary Vote, Assuring Fiscal Discipline in Conjunction with Tax Cuts and Increased Pensions\\" Prime Minister Pedro Santana Lopes of Portugal stood before the parliament on the eve of a pivotal vote on the government's 2005 budget, articulating a detailed defense. The Portuguese leader highlighted the budget's commitment to remain fiscally responsible while providing beneficial economic adjustments to the population such as reductions in income taxes, raises in pensions, and an increase in civil servant salaries. In a political climate where the health of the nation's finances is an area of concern, Santana Lopes stressed that the proposed budget for 2005 provides an avenue for maintaining budgetary rigor. As a leader, he was keenly aware of the balancing act required to manage a country's finances, making it a point to express how it is possible to uphold financial discipline while not compromising on the welfare of its citizens. The Prime Minister’s speech was seen as a response to concerns that the government might incur debt or fail to keep the deficit in check while facilitating these changes. Undeniably, one of the proposed budget's most notable features is a planned cut in income tax rates. This move, as Santana Lopes believes, will give much-needed relief to the hardworking citizens of Portugal. While tax reductions often result in diminished government revenue, the Portuguese Prime Minister argued confidently that a cut in the taxes could stimulate consumer spending, which in turn would stimulate the economy. Furthermore, Santana Lopes discussed the augmentation of pensions that is also part of the proposed 2005 budget. The increase in pension amounts is a drastic move that aims to reassure and support the nation's elderly population, providing them with a more comfortable retirement. This step also showcased the government’s commitment to prioritize social causes, reflecting their empathy towards elderly citizens. The government employees, the backbone of any functioning state, were also given attention in the proposed budget. Santana Lopes brought up the decision to increase civil servant salaries, a proposal that he believes is a necessary investment for a more productive, efficient, and motivated government workforce. This pay rise is a testament to the government's recognition of the role of public servants in running the state and their commitment to improving their living conditions. In defense of these ambitious initiatives, Prime Minister Santana Lopes repeatedly emphasized the government's commitment to maintaining budgetary discipline. Despite the generous outlays detailed in the proposed 2005 budget, he assured that the Portuguese government would continue to exercise prudent fiscal management to ensure long-term economic stability. As the parliament prepared to cast their votes, the words of Santana Lopes echoed within the hall, embodying his and his government’s vision for Portugal in 2005. By maintaining fiscal rigor alongside the proposed tax cuts and increased direct spending on pensions and civil servants, the Prime Minister hoped to convince lawmakers that this proposed budget was not just balanced, but it also offered significant benefits to the various sectors of Portuguese society. Ultimately, the fate of the 2005 government budget lay in the hands of the parliament. The strong defense articulated by Prime Minister Santana Lopes underscored the importance of this vote, not just to his administration but to the future wellbeing and economic prosperity of Portugal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \\"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\\"The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: \\"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\\" The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois.

Simpson Said When Asked About Murder Evidence\\"","completion":"Title: \\"What O.J. Simpson Said When Asked About Murder Evidence\\" Introduction Orenthal James \\"O.J.\\" Simpson, a former American football player, broadcaster, and actor, was found at the center of one of the most high-profile murder cases in United States history. On June 12, 1994, Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman, were found brutally murdered outside her Brentwood, California, home. Despite overwhelming evidence pointing to his guilt, Simpson was acquitted of the double murder on October 3, 1995. Since then, the question of what O.J. Simpson said when asked about the murder evidence remains fascinating for legal scholars, psychologists, and the general public alike. This article attempts to unpack Simpson's reactions to the evidence brought forward in trial, as well as his subsequent public responses to the issue. Reacting to the Evidence in Court The murder trial of O.J. Simpson, dubbed \\"The Trial of the Century,\\" had numerous pieces of physical and circumstantial evidence presented against him. One of the most damning was a bloody glove found near the crime scene, which appeared to match a glove discovered at Simpson's home. When asked about the glove during the trial, Simpson famously said, \\"If it doesn't fit, you must acquit,\\" referring to his inability to smoothly put on the glove during a courtroom demonstration. This critical moment played a crucial role in creating doubt in the jurors' minds, potentially contributing to his eventual acquittal. Furthermore, crime scene DNA evidence, including blood drops and hair fibers, had strong connections to Simpson. However, Simpson's defense team continuously cast doubt on the reliability of the forensic evidence and the methods the LAPD used to collect it, alleging potential contamination and mishandling. Throughout the trial, Simpson kept silent and maintained his innocence in the face of this evidence, deferring to his legal team's explanations. The Hypothetical Confession In a subsequent television interview in 2006, Simpson participated in the controversial \\"If I Did It\\" special hosted by Judith Regan. During the interview, Simpson provided a hypothetical account of how he would have committed the murders – if he were guilty. Although the special did not directly relate to the existing evidence, Simpson's detailed description of the hypothetical murder scene sparked even more speculation and controversy surrounding his involvement. Simpson later claimed that his statements during the interview were entirely fictionalized and purely for entertainment purposes. Continued Denial Since his acquittal, Simpson has been consistent in his denial of any involvement in the murders. In various media appearances and interviews, he often evades questions that deal with the factual evidence brought forward during the trial. For instance, in a 2018 interview with the Buffalo News, he declined to comment on specifics and only stated that the case has \\"already been covered\\" and accused the media of exploiting the tragic murders. Furthermore, when asked to address the DNA evidence revealing his blood at the crime scene, Simpson's narrative has focused on discrediting the LAPD's handling of the evidence rather than directly acknowledging or refuting the physical presence of his blood. Conclusion The question of what O.J. Simpson said when asked about the murder evidence remains inconclusive, as Simpson has been meticulously cryptic in responding to queries, whether it be during the trial or in various interviews after his acquittal. It is noteworthy, however, that Simpson's explanations have centered around casting doubt on the evidence and procedure rather than blatantly refuting the existence of incriminating evidence. Nevertheless, with the 1995 crime still unsolved, public curiosity about Simpson's association with the murders and his thoughts on the evidence brought against him in court persist to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

B. spending of money - This option is too vague; it doesn't provide a clear method of evaluating what to buy. C. have fun - This option is not directly related to the process of evaluating what to buy at a shop; it's more about the experience people have while shopping. D. splurge - This option entails spending a lot of money without necessarily considering the value of the products being purchased, which is not in line with common sense for evaluating what to buy.

Question: What type of creature is a basilisk? Answer:","completion":"A basilisk is a mythical creature that has its origins in ancient European and Middle Eastern folklore, mythology, and literature. Often depicted as a reptilian or serpentine creature, the basilisk has fascinated and terrified people for centuries due to its fearsome reputation and deadly powers. There are various descriptions and interpretations of the basilisk found in different cultures, but generally, the following characteristics are associated with this legendary monster: 1. Appearance: The basilisk's appearance has evolved over time and varies across different sources. In early Greek and Roman mythology, it was portrayed as a small, venomous snake. Later descriptions from medieval European myth present the basilisk as a large, serpent-like creature with a crown-shaped crest on its head, hence its nickname \\"king of serpents.\\" Some legends even depict it as a hybrid creature with the body of a serpent and other features such as a rooster's head, wings, or legs. The latter representation is more commonly known as the cockatrice. 2. Deadly Gaze: One of the most fearsome attributes of the basilisk is its deadly gaze. It is said that the basilisk can kill a person or petrify them just by locking eyes with them. In some myths, even catching a glimpse of the basilisk's eye in a mirror can induce the same dreadful fate. Many heroic tales involve brave knights or heroes seeking to defeat the basilisk by using reflective surfaces such as polished shields or mirrors to avoid its fatal stare. 3. Venomous Breath and Bite: In addition to its lethal gaze, the basilisk is also notorious for its venomous breath and bite. The venom is said to be so potent that it can kill living creatures instantly or even cause plants and grass to wither away at the slightest touch. In some stories, the basilisk's breath is so toxic that it can poison the air and kill any birds that fly overhead. 4. Invincibility: The basilisk is often portrayed as an invulnerable creature that is virtually impossible to kill. According to some legends, it can only be defeated using cunning tactics and specific items or creatures, such as a weasel, which was believed to possess a natural resistance to the basilisks' venom. Another common way to kill a basilisk was by exploiting its deadly abilities, such as tricking it into looking at its reflection in a mirror or a shield, thus causing it to petrify or kill itself. 5. Symbolism: In various mythologies and cultures, the basilisk symbolizes numerous concepts such as death, evil, fear, and sin. During the medieval ages, it was often used as an allegory for the devil or demonic forces in religious writings and moral literature. In alchemy, the basilisk was associated with the process of transmutation and the combination of opposing elements, mirroring its dual nature as both a deadly serpent and a fantastical hybrid creature. Despite being a prominent figure in myth and folklore, modern zoology and biology have not found any evidence of the existence of the basilisk. However, intricate stories and vivid depictions of this legendary creature continue to spark the imagination and contribute to the rich tapestry of world mythology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: How does the vampire used to make the filmmaker believe Nick die? ? Aspiring filmmaker Sean is working as a freelance driver to make ends meet. He's assigned to deliver an expensive Mercedes-Benz from Los Angeles all the way to its owner in Miami, which will also allow him to attend the wedding of his sister. He's given strict instructions not to damage the vehicle or pick up any hitchhikers. Sean is driving cross country when he picks up Nick, a hitchhiker who happens to be a vampire hunter hunting a group of vampires led by one of the Forsaken--a group of knights who made a pact with the fallen angel Abaddon to live forever. Two of the Forsaken are located in the United States (including the one Nick is tracking, Kit). Nick was bitten and infected by a vampire but, thanks to an antiviral drug cocktail, the vampire virus is kept at bay. Each of the Forsaken carry a unique strain of vampirism; killing a Forsaken kills his entire bloodline and reverses the condition of anyone infected. Nick believes that if he kills Kit, he will be cured before he turns (as the drug cocktail eventually will lose effect). At first Sean is less than willing to indulge his new acquaintance; however, he is convinced after the two come across a disoriented young woman, Megan, at a diner, who was bitten by the vampires and left for dead. Nick also proves he is telling the truth by killing a vampire, Teddy, with exposure to sunlight. Sean and Nick take Megan to their motel room, but she goes into a rage and bites Sean; they realize they must kill the Forsaken responsible to prevent Sean from turning. Forsaken can only be slain on hallowed ground, so the three head for a Spanish mission 60 miles away. They stop at a gas station where an old woman, Ina, lets them in. She shows them a newspaper connecting Megan to a bloodbath in Arizona; when Megan wakes up and is coherent enough to talk, she explains she was a victim of the vampires' bloodbath. Kit catches up to them and lays siege to the gas station. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The vampire used to make the filmmaker believe Nick die is Teddy.

Shifts are long but significant bonuses are paid as incentives to boost production. Explaining in an opening disclaimer, Con Am 27 is franchised to Con-Amalgamate by the League of Industrial Nations located on Earth.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What war did the Victory Loan campaign make an effort to raise money for by organizing If Day? is inside the article: By 1911, Winnipeg was the third largest city in Canada, and remained so until overtaken by Vancouver in the 1920s. A boomtown, it grew quickly around the start of the 20th century, with outside investors and immigrants contributing to its success. The drop in growth in the second half of the decade was a result of the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, which reduced reliance on transcontinental railways for trade, as well as a decrease in immigration due to the outbreak of the First World War. Over 18,000 Manitoba residents enlisted in the first year of the war; by the end of the war, 14 Manitobans had received the Victoria Cross.After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) and union members (over wage rates) resulted in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.Government efforts to violently crush the strike, including a Royal Northwest Mounted Police charge into a crowd of protesters that resulted in multiple casualties and one death, had led to the arrest of the movement's leaders. In the aftermath, eight leaders went on trial, and most were convicted on charges of seditious conspiracy, illegal combinations, and seditious libel; four were aliens who were deported under the Canadian Immigration Act.The Great Depression (1929–c. 1939) hit especially hard in Western Canada, including Manitoba. The collapse of the world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification, moving away from a reliance on wheat production. The Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, forerunner to the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), was founded in 1932.Canada entered the Second World War in 1939.

Sometimes alone time is necessary because plans fall through or nothing is going on, but it is also a good idea to make plans to spend time on your own now and then. Try setting aside about 30 minutes per day to be alone and do something that you want to do.","completion":"This could be anything from going for a walk, reading a book, practicing a hobby, or simply sitting in silence and reflecting on your day. By consciously planning time to be alone, you'll begin to understand that solitude can be a positive and enriching experience, rather than something to dread or avoid. It’s important to recognize that being alone doesn't have to be synonymous with being lonely. Embrace the benefits of solitude by focusing on self-improvement, reflection, and relaxation. Alone time can provide the perfect opportunity to reconnect with yourself, evaluate your goals and priorities, and dive into new interests without the distractions of social interactions. One way to feel more comfortable with being alone is to practice mindfulness and meditation. Mindfulness exercises can help you remain centered and aware of your thoughts and emotions, and being present in the moment can alleviate feelings of loneliness. Whether you dedicate ten minutes a day to meditation or find moments throughout your day to practice mindfulness, this skill can help you become more comfortable when you're alone and enhance your overall mental wellbeing. When you are alone, take advantage of the time to engage in activities that you love and genuinely enjoy. This could be something as simple as taking a bath or cooking your favorite meal, or it could be diving into a creative endeavor like writing, painting, or playing an instrument. The more you enjoy the time you spend alone, the less you will be bothered by the feeling of being alone. Furthermore, use your alone time as an opportunity to expand your knowledge and personal development. Read books, attend online courses, or explore new topics and ideas to keep your mind engaged and stimulated. Not only will this help you to maintain healthy cognitive function, but it can also make you feel more content when you're alone. Additionally, staying connected with friends and family can provide a healthy balance to your alone time. Make time for phone calls, video chats, or even write letters to stay on top of your relationships, while still maintaining your independence. Make sure to appreciate the social interactions you do have and use them as a way to recharge before you continue enjoying your solitude. Although being alone can initially feel overwhelming or lonely, you can learn to deal with it by understanding that solitude can be a source of personal improvement, reflection, and relaxation. By setting aside time for yourself, practicing mindfulness techniques, engaging in fulfilling activities, focusing on personal development, and maintaining relationships, you will gain a whole new appreciation for the freedom and peace that comes from spending time alone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The little pig, born with deformed hind legs, first shot to fame when his owner, veterinarian Dr Len Lucero from Clermont, Florida, built him a tiny wheelchair from children’s toys to help him move around. A video of ten-day-old Chris P. has been seen by more than 500,000 people and he has since become a bona fide online celebrity with 17,000 Facebook fans and a Twitter account. Scroll down for video. Bacon roll: Chris P is pleased as punch in his new wheelchair. Testing, testing: The world's most famous disabled piglet, Chris P. Bacon, nibbles on his new custom-made wheelchair. One month later, Chris P. has grown out of his first two wheelchairs, made from K’nex toys, and cannot wait to get into his new device. Dr Lucero estimates that Mr Bacon will be ready to test-drive his new wheelchair, donated from a company which specialises in devices for handicapped animals, in three weeks’ time. Chris P. Bacon was born unable to use his hind legs and arrived at Dr Lucerno’s office in mid-January when his owner, one of Dr Lucero’s clients, could not take care of him. ‘It's been a dream, almost not real,’ Dr Lucero told Orlando Sentiel about his piglet’s online fame. ‘He gave a lot of snorts and grunts, and people just ate it up.’ Child star: The Florida porker has shot to fame thanks to his owner's videos of him learning how to use his first wheelchair when he was ten days old. Big boy: Chris P. Bacon lies impatient in front of his new wheelchair, but he has to wait another few weeks before he is big enough to use it. Pigging out: Veterinarian Len Lucero feeds Mr Bacon in his office in Clermont, Florida. New dad: The handicapped piglet was adopted by Dr Lucero after his owner failed to take care of him. Chris P. has still got some growing to do before he is ready for the new chair, but until then, the piglet hops short distances across Dr Lucero’s office floor. As soon as he has grown into it the chair will greatly increase his mobility. The wheelchair attaches to his body with a harness around his neck and his rear end and Chris P. uses his front legs to pull him forward and the wheels of the contraption help him carry his weight. The wheels raise his rear end to the same height that his back legs would, enabling him to imitate standing. The celebrity pig has become accustomed to the limelight and tweets his fans several times a day, wishing his 1,250 followers a 'Happy Voinkentines day' and exclaiming 'Next, it will be the pigarazzi following me!

Answer:","completion":"The Houston Astros joined the American League on November 17, 2011. This change was a part of Major League Baseball's (MLB) realignment plan, which aimed to create two balanced leagues with an even number of teams, 15 in each league. Before the Astros' move to the American League, they were a part of the National League for more than five decades. Houston's MLB journey began in 1962, when the club was established as the Houston Colt .45s. It was an expansion team, and they played in the National League as members of the West Division from 1962 until 1968 and Central Division from 1994 until 2012. Brad Mills, a former manager of the Astros, played a pivotal role in this historic decision of joining the American League. The transition from the National League to the American League was significant for several reasons. The realignment was designed to achieve a more uniform schedule, allow for interleague games to be played throughout the season, and facilitate the creation of an extra Wild Card playoff spot in each league. All of these changes helped to improve the overall competitive balance and fan experience of baseball, particularly in the case of the Astros. As a result of the realignment, the Houston Astros became members of the American League West Division, joining other notable teams, such as the Los Angeles Angels, Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners, and Texas Rangers. Their first game as a member of the American League took place on March 31, 2013, against their in-state rival, the Texas Rangers. Since joining the American League, the Astros have enjoyed remarkable success. The highlight of their tenure has undoubtedly been their 2017 World Series Championship, which was also the first in the franchise's history. In recent years, they have made multiple postseason appearances and have been consistent contenders for the American League pennant. In conclusion, the Houston Astros joined the American League on November 17, 2011, as part of MLB's realignment plan. Their first official game in the American League took place on March 31, 2013. Since then, the Astros have experienced success, including their historic 2017 World Series Championship, and continue to be competitive within their division."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – Alex Rodriguez can't even avoid drama with souvenir baseballs. A-Rod smacked his 3,000th hit last night, but the fan who caught the home run ball is resisting the Yankees' efforts to have him return it. At least temporarily: \\"At first, I was 100% adamant about not giving the ball back,\\" Zack Hample tells the AP. \\"Now, I'm thinking about it.\\" But it sounds like A-Rod will have to be willing to shell out big money, as Hample makes clear in an entertaining quote to Newsday: \\"He's not going to offer me a million dollars. If he did, I would consider it. It's kind of like, well, I don't like you and I have something you want and you can't have it. I wanted you to not take steroids and be the greatest of all time and you disappointed me. So I still respect A-Rod, he's an amazing player and I think he is pretty fan-friendly, but I have to hang on to this ball right now.\\" Hample says he might eventually put it up for auction. Both stories explain that it's no fluke Hample ended up with the souvenir: He's actually written a book called How to Snag Major League Baseballs. Though he was wearing his glove at the time, the 37-year-old Yankees season-ticket-holder didn't catch the ball. When it cleared the wall, a crowd surged forward to try to grab it, but everybody missed. \\"I looked down and the ball was at my feet,\\" says Hample. \\"It was almost touching my shoe.\\"","completion":"Title: A-Rod's 3,000th Hit Milestone Ball Caught, But Fan Hesitates to Return It Alex Rodriguez, widely known as A-Rod, achieved an impressive milestone when he smacked his 3,000th hit, but drama has followed even with that accomplishment. The fan who caught the home run ball, Zack Hample, is not eager to return it to the Yankees player, creating a tense situation between the two parties. Hample, a 37-year-old Yankees season-ticket holder and author of the book \\"How to Snag Major League Baseballs,\\" originally claimed to be \\"100% adamant about not giving the ball back.\\" However, he later reconsidered, stating that Rodriguez would have to offer a significant amount, potentially as high as a million dollars, for him to seriously consider handing over the iconic ball. Hample's reasoning for holding onto the ball includes his feelings towards Rodriguez as a player. Although he still respects and admires A-Rod's incredible skills on the field and his fan-friendly demeanor, he expressed disappointment in the baseball star's use of steroids. Hample had hoped that A-Rod would avoid the controversial substance and become the greatest of all time. The dramatic story of the catch itself reveals how Hample, wearing his glove and surrounded by a crowd, didn't catch the ball at first. As spectators surged forward to try to grab the ball, everyone seemed to miss it. It was only when Hample looked down and noticed the ball at his feet, almost touching his shoe, that he realized he had snagged the momentous souvenir.

Available choices: [+] Yes; [+] No; Answer:","completion":"No; Chordates, which include animals like humans, birds, fish, and reptiles, do go through various experiences and states throughout their lives. However, saying that chordates can go through \\"loss\\" is a broad and general statement that doesn’t solely relate to their biological experience. When mentioning chordates experiencing \\"shock,\\" this is generally a reference to a bodily response to changes in the environment, stress, or injury, not necessarily a \\"loss\\" in the sense of losing something or someone. Chordates are organisms characterized by having a dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, endostyle, and a post-anal tail at some point during their development. These organisms possess unique physiological systems and can undergo a wide range of biological and physiological processes, like growth and development, reproduction, response to stimuli, adaptation to environment, and more. Though animals can suffer physical losses (like the loss of a limb or habitat) and some higher animals can even experience emotional distress, it would be an oversimplification to say that the primary thing chordates can go through is \\"loss.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: The Transylvanian city of Brasov is usually just a day trip from Bucharest. People spend maybe an hour or so to wandering around the town square, and buy a drink before hopping back on their transport back to the capital city of Romania. But, thanks to an epic tip-off from the travel ninja Shikha at Why Waste Annual Leave and a few other Brasov devotees, instead of following the crowds, we booked a couple of leisurely nights there. At the end of our day trip, instead of returning to Bucharest and getting stuck in the Sunday evening traffic, we checked into our hotel and waved our guide off. Yes, you can easily ‘do’ Brasov in an afternoon – it’s a popular stop off at the end of a day trip after visiting the “home” of Dracula – Bran castle, and the beautiful Peles castle – but having the leisure to linger was exquisite. In addition to trying local dishes, we also ate lunch at McDonalds. Yes, yes, as a blogger we shouldn’t pretend to eat anything other than caviar washed down with champagne and unicorn tears, but we were hungry and couldn’t be bothered to find somewhere. (For the record, we both opted for a Big Mac and a diet coke.) For the first half day, we wandered around whilst the skies were beautifully blue… …learned a lot of local history, admired the Hollywood style sign in the hills… …slipped into a couple of churches (not to mention dodged giggling kids racing around on miniature cars)… …some hidden, and some hidden in plain sight… …and admired the sign from our cosy hotel, as it lit up at twilight Our only full day dawned fairly murky for the most part, it was a Sunday so a lot of things were closed, so after hitting 20,000 steps and getting lost a few times in the less pretty corners of the city… Question: How does the blogger probably feel about having McDonalds in Brasov? Answer: (A). She was stuck in traffic and wanted something simple; (B). She didn't have a choice everything else as closed; (C). not enough information; (D). She was thrilled to be able to have a Big Mac; Answer:","completion":"A).

The G-7, or Group of Seven, is an international intergovernmental economic organization consisting of seven major industrialized countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan, in addition to the ones mentioned in the premise. With respect to the hypothesis, \\"National saving data for France and Canada were equally considered,\\" we can infer as follows based on the given premise: 1. Inclusion of both France and Canada: Since the research/study has used national saving data for G-7 countries (including Canadian and French data), we can conclude that the data for both France and Canada were utilized in the analysis. 2. Equal consideration: The premise does not explicitly mention the weights given to the data from each G-7 nation. However, considering the context in which G-7 countries are referred to as a collective group, it can be reasonably assumed that the research or study has taken a comparative approach to study the national saving data. Comparative approaches generally involve giving equal consideration to the countries in question in order to maintain a fair, unbiased assessment of the data. Based on these two points, we can cautiously deduce that the hypothesis \\"National saving data for France and Canada were equally considered\\" may be accurate, assuming the analysis was conducted with the intention of maintaining an equal approach to studying and comparing the national saving data of all G-7 nations.

There's my name, Alexander Spencer, typed on the front. I throw it under the bed. The piles of envelopes are growing. The envelopes were applications to all the colleges I was supposed to attend. I did open the first envelope. Then I saw the application, all those blank spaces I was supposed to fill with my own writing, spaces for my name and birth date and grade average and ... statement of purpose. I looked at them for a long time. I could write for hours and not fill all those spaces. So I put the application back in the envelope. I would fill it out the next day, when I had time. But another envelope arrived. And then the pile began. The pile scares me -- it is really like a monster. All the while, I feel the weight of a million envelopes raining down on my head until my grandmother calls me and wants to know how I am. \\"I am overcome by too many tasks,\\" I say. \\"Honey, you just take it bit by bit,\\" she says, and she reminds me about the green beans. When I was a little kid I hated green beans. But my mom said I couldn't leave the table until I ate ten green beans. All alone at the table, I stared at the green beans for what seemed like hours. It was a mountain of green beans. I couldn't do it. My grandma came to me and asked if I could eat one green bean. \\"But Grandma, I have to eat ten!\\" She said all I had to do was to eat one green bean. One tiny little green bean. So I ate one. It was bad, but not as bad as I'd thought it would be. Then she asked me again if I could eat one. So I ate one green bean nine more times. My grandma doesn't know about the envelopes, but she tells me anyone can do one thing every day. Back in my room, I lay down on the bed.

As a long-time collector, she knew that investing in art not only provided her with personal satisfaction, but it could also potentially appreciate over time, making it an excellent financial decision in the long run. Step 1: Identifying the value of the drawing for Sarah Sarah was an art enthusiast and had a good understanding of the market. By doing diligent research on the artist and the drawing being purchased, she was confident in her decision to spend two thousand pounds on the artwork. Step 2: Considering the financial potential of the artwork As a collector, Sarah was aware that well-chosen pieces can significantly appreciate over time. Buying a high-quality drawing at the right price might not only bring her joy in the present, but also serve as an asset in the future. Step 3: Evaluating Sarah's personal satisfaction To Sarah, owning and displaying the drawing in her home brought her immense pride and pleasure. The unique piece spoke to her on an emotional level, and she believed that the intrinsic value of the art transcended its monetary worth. On the other hand, Lindsey had different priorities when it came to spending money. She was more inclined to invest her resources in practical needs and experiences. Spending two thousand pounds on a drawing seemed excessive and frivolous to her, as she could not comprehend the value or potential return on investment that it held. Step 4: Analyzing Lindsey's values regarding expenditure Lindsey's focus on practicality and maximizing the utility of her purchases made it difficult for her to justify spending a large sum on a drawing. She would rather allocate her money to other necessities or experiences that brought her personal fulfillment. Step 5: Identifying Lindsey's reluctance to invest in art Lindsey did not have the same passion for art as Sarah, nor the experience and understanding of its market value, which made it difficult for her to see the potential in owning such a piece. Step 6: Understanding the difference in perspectives between Sarah and Lindsey When it came to the drawing, Sarah and Lindsey had divergent opinions on its worth and what constituted a valuable investment. While Sarah saw the artwork as a meaningful and potentially profitable addition to her collection, Lindsey viewed it as an unwise expenditure that could be used for more practical purposes. In conclusion, Sarah and Lindsey's different values and perspectives on art and investment shaped their opinions on whether or not to spend two thousand pounds on a drawing. While Sarah embraced the purchase as an opportunity to enrich her collection and potentially profit in the future, Lindsey could not justify the cost and preferred to allocate her resources elsewhere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Los Angeles police mistakenly kill hostage fleeing from attacker Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies mistakenly shot to death a hostage who was fleeing from a knife-wielding attacker at a West Hollywood apartment, authorities announced Thursday. John Winkler, 30, an aspiring television producer, died at a hospital following Monday night's confrontation. \\"Taking the life of an innocent person is a police officer's greatest nightmare,\\" interim sheriff John Scott said at a news conference. The entire department mourned Winkler's death, he added. Winkler was with some friends who lived in the apartment below him on Palm Avenue when a man who also lived in that apartment took them hostage at knifepoint, authorities said. Alexander McDonald climbed over a balcony into his own home with a 10-inch butcher knife, authorities said. He was \\"in an incoherent state of mind, seemed very paranoid, which was uncharacteristic\\", sheriff's homicide Lt David Coleman said. He took his roommate, Winkler and another man hostage, then flew into a rage and began stabbing and fighting with them, authorities said. Scott said deputies received a panicky 911 call that someone was threatening residents with a knife and went to the apartment, where they were told the attacker was a thin man in a black shirt. Deputies announced themselves and pounded on the door and at that moment one of the stabbing victims took the opportunity to escape, Coleman said. \\"The door suddenly opened and a man with blood spurting form his neck entered the doorway,\\" Scott said. Winkler also ran out, behind but nearly on top of the other man, authorities said. Deputies, noting his thin build and black shirt, mistook Winkler for the suspect and thought he was continuing to attack the other man, Coleman said. Three deputies fired four shots. Winkler was hit once and mortally wounded. The other man was hit in the leg and was hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. Deputies burst into the apartment and allegedly saw McDonald choking a man on the floor. That man was treated for stab wounds and other injuries and released, according to a sheriff's department statement. McDonald, 27, was treated for minor injuries. County prosecutors have charged him with torture, murder and two counts of attempted murder. He remained jailed Thursday. \\"We don't know what caused his rage or what caused his outburst,\\" or whether drugs were involved, Coleman said. Winkler had moved to West Hollywood from Washington state six months ago to work in the entertainment industry, his friend, Devin Richardson, told the Los Angeles Times. Winkler's Facebook page said he studied directing at the Seattle Film Institute and was in the class of 2010. Institute communications director Chris Blanchett told the Seattle Times that Winkler was a good student and \\"a genuinely nice guy\\". Another friend, Trevor Jess, told KING-TV in Seattle that Winkler was \\"just starting out, ready to climb the ladder and that's the thing that breaks my heart.\\" The deputies, all department veterans, were removed from patrol after the shooting but were expected to return to full duty next week, sheriff's officials said.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is a drought happens, how will it affect more cubes can be made. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"In the event of a drought, the process of making ice cubes can be affected both directly and indirectly. While the fundamental steps in the process remain unchanged, the availability of water, conservation strategies, and potential cube-making alternatives would be influenced. Direct Effects: 1. Water Availability: During a drought, the availability of water might be significantly reduced. This scarcity of water may lead to water rationing or restrictions, which in turn, would impact the amount of water that can be used for non-essential tasks, such as making ice cubes. 2. Water Quality: Droughts can also affect the quality of the water supply. The lower water levels in reservoirs increase the concentration of contaminants, affecting water taste and safety. The use of such water in making ice cubes might not be advisable due to potential health risks and undesirable taste. Indirect Effects: 1. Conservation Efforts: As communities and individuals take steps to conserve water during a drought, making ice cubes might be viewed as a wasteful activity. To ensure the conservation of resources, people may choose to reduce or eliminate their ice cube production altogether. This shift in priorities would affect the willingness to use available water for ice cubes. 2. Economic Factors: During a drought, the costs associated with water usage might increase. As a result, the financial burden associated with utilizing water for non-essential purposes (like making ice cubes) can lead to reductions in its use. 3. Alternative Solutions: The scarcity of water coupled with the need for cooling could prompt individuals to seek alternative methods of achieving the desired outcome (i.e., cooling beverages or food). For example, they may choose to use reusable ice packs, explore dry ice options, or turn to more energy-efficient refrigeration techniques. Overall, the perturbation of a drought has both direct and indirect effects on the process of making ice cubes. It influences the water availability, its quality, conservation efforts, economic considerations, and the search for alternative cooling methods. While the fundamental steps involved in making ice cubes may not change, the execution of the process is undoubtedly affected by the drought conditions."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Combine facts and answer this: Where is the friend of Rahul Bhatt, who is accused of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, being held?

The hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that a long-shot legal victory indeed occurred as of January. The premise and hypothesis are not inherently contradictory; however, the premise does not guarantee the occurrence outlined in the hypothesis. The question at hand is whether the premise entails the hypothesis. Entailment refers to a relationship between statements where if one statement is true, the other must also be true. In this case, the premise sets forth that the long-shot legal victory is not expected but raises the possibility of its occurrence. The hypothesis then speculates that the long-shot legal victory did happen in January. Based on the premise provided, while it allows for the possibility that a long-shot legal victory may happen in January, it does not definitively assert that it will happen. The premise establishes that the legal victory is unlikely (\\"barring a long-shot legal victory\\"), yet it does not have enough information to guarantee the legal victory outcome. As such, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise and hypothesis, when taken together, allow for two potential scenarios: one where the long-shot legal victory does not happen, and the other where it materializes in January. However, the relationship between these two statements does not equate to entailment, as the premise does not guarantee that the hypothesis will be true. Instead, the premise merely sets up a scenario that puts forth the possibility of the long-shot legal victory happening, without promising it. In summary, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Although the premise acknowledges the existence of a long-shot legal victory as an improbable outcome, it does not definitively assert that this outcome will come to fruition.

Q:Question: \\"What status do many Pygmies have?\\" Context: \\"Many Pygmies belong from birth to Bantus in a relationship many refer to as slavery. The Congolese Human Rights Observatory says that the Pygmies are treated as property the same way \\"pets\\" are. On December 30, 2010, the Congolese parliament adopted a law for the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples. This law is the first of its kind in Africa, and its adoption is a historic development for indigenous peoples on the continent.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The status of many Pygmies, particularly in the Congo Basin region of Central Africa, can be described as marginalized and vulnerable, with many of them facing severe social, economic, and political challenges. These challenges largely stem from a historical and ongoing relationship with their Bantu neighbors that is often described as akin to slavery. While the situation has somewhat improved in recent years, with the adoption of laws and measures designed to protect the rights of indigenous peoples, Pygmies still struggle to fully enjoy their human rights and fundamental freedoms. For centuries, the Pygmies have lived in the Congo Basin, which spans several countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Gabon, and others. These communities primarily focus on hunting, gathering, and some rudimentary agricultural practices. However, their way of life and their rights to access and use their traditional lands and natural resources have increasingly come under threat from different factors, such as deforestation, mining, and encroachment by other communities. The relationship between Pygmies and the Bantu people, who live in close proximity and dominate the political and social structures of the region, has long been problematic. This relationship has often been characterized by exploitation, discrimination, and abuse, with many Pygmies essentially belonging to Bantu individuals or families from birth. As a result, they are subject to forced labor, land dispossession, and numerous forms of violence and degradation. The Congolese Human Rights Observatory has pointed out that the treatment of Pygmies by their Bantu \\"masters\\" is similar to that of pets, demonstrating the inhumane and unequal power dynamics at play. This situation has prompted some organizations, activists, and scholars to refer to the status of the Pygmies as a form of modern-day slavery. In an effort to address the plight of the Pygmies and other indigenous peoples in the region, the Congolese parliament adopted a groundbreaking law on December 30, 2010, which seeks to promote and protect their rights. Known as the Law on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, this legislation is the first of its kind in Africa and represents a significant step in the right direction for advancing the rights of these marginalized communities. The law, in theory, provides a framework for promoting the social, economic, and cultural rights of indigenous peoples, including the Pygmies. This includes provisions aimed at combating discrimination, ensuring access to basic social services, such as education and healthcare, safeguarding land and natural resource rights, and promoting the participation of indigenous peoples in decision-making processes that affect them. While the adoption of this law was heralded as a historic development for indigenous peoples in Africa, its implementation remains a challenge. Many Pygmies and their advocates argue that little has changed in practice, with the community still facing widespread discrimination, exploitation, and abuse. The obstacles for translating the law's provisions into tangible progress on the ground are numerous, including weak governance and rule of law structures, pervasive corruption, lack of awareness and understanding of the law, as well as cultural and social barriers that reinforce the marginalization of the Pygmies. In summary, the status of many Pygmies can be characterized as a form of modern-day slavery, perpetuated by historically-rooted power dynamics with their Bantu neighbors. While recent legal advancements, such as the adoption of the Law on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in the DRC, have created a promising framework for advancing their rights, the struggle for genuine equality, respect, and freedom from discrimination and exploitation continues for these communities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Alex Gore and Reuters Reporter PUBLISHED: 22:02 EST, 26 February 2013 | UPDATED: 01:22 EST, 27 February 2013 Police have identified a 22-year-old woman as a 'person of interest' in last week's slaying of an aspiring rapper who was shot and killed while driving his Maserati on the Las Vegas strip. Police said Tineesha Lashun Howard was riding in a black Range Rover with prime suspect Ammar Harris when he opened fire on the Maserati being driven by 27-year-old Kenneth Wayne Cherry Jr. before dawn on Thursday. Cherry, who performed under the name 'Kenny Clutch,' was mortally wounded and his silver sports car veered out of control, colliding with a taxi in an intersection at the heart of the strip - killing the cab driver and his passenger. No weapons were found in the silver","completion":"Maserati, which led investigators to believe that Cherry was not involved in a shootout as initially theorized by some witnesses. Police also reported that there were no known connections between Cherry and Harris prior to the fatal incident. Howard, who reportedly has a criminal history involving solicitation and prostitution, was identified through surveillance footage obtained from the Strip. Authorities called for her to come forward and speak with detectives, emphasizing that she would be considered a witness, not a suspect, in the case. Officials also shared that Howard may hold critical information that could help piece together the events leading up to this tragedy. As for Harris, law enforcement agencies across the country launched a nationwide manhunt, offering a 35,000 reward for any information leading to his arrest. Evidence suggested that Harris and Cherry had a brief altercation at a nearby parking lot before the shooting occurred. Reports indicated that individuals inside the black Range Rover opened fire on Cherry's Maserati as both vehicles sped away from the lot. With the assistance of federal agencies, authorities were able to apprehend Harris a week later at an apartment in Los Angeles. Harris was extradited to Nevada, where he faced trial on multiple charges, including three counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder. Tineesha Lashun Howard later came forward and cooperated with the investigation, providing key testimony that proved crucial in building a case against Harris. Her account of the events paints a clearer picture of what transpired leading up to and during the fatal incident. At trial, the prosecution claimed that Harris had encountered Cherry at a club earlier that night and, after a disagreement escalated, became intent on killing him. The defense, however, maintained that Cherry had threatened Harris and that Harris was merely acting in self-defense. Ultimately, a jury found Harris guilty, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the three counts of first-degree murder. In the wake of this tragedy, the Las Vegas community rallied together to support the victims' families and renew their efforts to address the growing issue of violence in the city. Mayor Carolyn Goodman vowed to step up law enforcement presence on the Strip to ensure public safety, while community activists called for greater investments in education and outreach programs to help at-risk youth avoid a life of crime. The incident, which highlighted the potential for violence to erupt in even the most seemingly glamorous settings, serves as a stark reminder of the importance of fostering a culture where disputes can be managed through dialogue and understanding, rather than resorting to devastating acts of violence. The memories of the lives senselessly lost in this event will continue to shape the ongoing conversation around public safety, law enforcement practices, and social support systems – not just in Las Vegas, but across the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The training on a vibration plate is a training method which causes contractions of muscles and stretch reflexes by vibrations Add punctuation","completion":"The training on a vibration plate is a training method, which causes contractions of muscles and stretch reflexes by vibrations. This innovative approach to fitness harnesses the power of vibrations, stimulating muscle fibers and activating the body's natural reflexes. Utilizing a vibrating platform, the training engages several muscle groups at once – leading to increased strength, flexibility, and overall fitness. The vibration plate works by generating rapid, oscillating movements that transmit energy to the muscles, causing them to contract and relax involuntarily. As the muscles continue to work through these contractions, they are essentially subjected to an intensified workout. The vibration plate provides a frequency range from 20 to 50 Hz, which allows users to choose the intensity of their sessions. One of the primary benefits of this type of training is the ability to engage a higher percentage of muscle fibers during each workout. This enhanced activation leads to increased strength and muscle tone. Additionally, the rapid contractions can help boost circulation, leading to improved overall health and well-being. Some of the potential benefits of training on a vibration plate include improved muscle strength, better balance and coordination, increased flexibility and range of motion, improved bone density, and reduced pain associated with arthritis or other joint conditions. Training on a vibration plate can be highly effective for individuals of all fitness levels and can be easily integrated with traditional workouts. Users can perform various exercises on the platform, such as squats, push-ups, and calf raises, to target specific muscle groups and enhance overall performance. Furthermore, the oscillating vibrations help to create a more efficient training session, meaning users can achieve their fitness goals in less time than with conventional methods. It is important, however, that users approach this type of training with caution and seek guidance from a qualified professional to ensure proper technique and prevent injury. Certain medical conditions and contraindications, such as pregnancy or heart issues, may preclude individuals from training on a vibration plate; therefore, it is essential to consult with a medical professional before beginning any vibration plate training regimen. In conclusion, training on a vibration plate is an innovative method of fitness training that leverages the power of vibrations to stimulate muscle contraction and improve overall physical performance. With a range of potential benefits, including increased strength, flexibility, and general health, it is an excellent addition to any well-rounded workout routine. However, individuals should always consult with a medical professional before beginning any new exercise program and seek guidance from qualified trainers to ensure safe, effective workouts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports/ Reuters) SAN FRANCISCO – The U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday formally dropped its criminal prosecution of Barry Bonds, Major League Baseball's career home run leader. The decade-long investigation and prosecution of Bonds for obstruction of justice ended quietly with the DOJ's one-paragraph court filing announcing it would not ask the U.S. Supreme Court to consider a lower court's reversal of his felony conviction. A jury convicted Bonds in 2011 of obstruction of justice for giving a meandering answer to a federal grand jury when asked about injections. A federal appeals court overturned that conviction in April. The DOJ could have asked the high court to take the case. Instead, the DOJ said the reversal of Bonds' conviction would stand. Bonds attorney Dennis Riordan decline comment early Tuesday, saying he needed to speak with his client before discussing the case publicly. The U.S. Attorney's office in San Francisco didn't respond immediately to a phone call seeking comment. The San Francisco office obtained an indictment of Bonds in 2007, charging him with lying to a federal grand jury about performance-enhancing drug use. A jury convicted him of obstructing justice because of the answer he gave when he was asked if his personal trainer Greg Anderson ever injected him with steroids. \\"That's what keeps our friendship,\\" Bonds replied. \\"I was a celebrity child, not just in baseball by my own instincts. I became a celebrity child with a famous father. I just don't get into other people's business because of my father's situation, you see.\\" The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in April said that answer didn't amount to obstruction. The court said the answer wasn't \\"material\\" to the sprawling federal investigation into sports doping centered in the San Francisco Bay Area. A federal judge sentenced Bonds to 30 days of home confinement, two years of probation, 250 hours of community service in youth-related activities and a 4,000 fine after the 2011 trial and conviction. Bonds served the home confinement before his conviction was overturned. Bonds ended his career after the 2007 season with 762 career home runs, surpassing Hank Aaron's long-standing record of 755.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. and the situation: Ann decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift.

Photo: moodboard/Corbis Would you go to a movie alone? For some people, the question elicits a quick and easy nod — of course! Why not? For others, panic: The idea of sitting there, all alone, surrounded by people who aren’t alone is humiliating. Everyone has different internal guidelines for solo outings, and these guidelines are often marked by a fair degree of irrationality. I’ve never been able to work up the nerve to see a movie alone, for example, and yet I’ve eaten plenty of meals in restaurants without a dining partner — despite the fact that it’s a much more visible activity than sitting in a dark theater. And while going to a concert alone makes perfect practical sense — none of my friends are really into Listener, after all — I just don’t have it in me. I’d feel awkward standing around during the interminable period between the last opener and the main act, having no one to talk to, surrounded by happily socializing concertgoers. Or that’s how I think I’d feel, at least. An article in the August Journal of Consumer Research suggests that I — and all the other solo-outing-phobic folks out there — might be wrong. If we’d just actually fight through our fears and go to that movie or restaurant alone, we’d have a good time. We’re missing out on a potentially fun experience because of ill-grounded fears. (The article isn’t available online yet, though the issue’s table of contents can be found here.) The paper, co-authored by Rebecca Ratner and Rebecca Hamilton of the University of Maryland and Georgetown business schools, respectively, reports on five experiments. Four of them involved surveys asking people which sorts of activities they preferred to do alone or in groups, and why, and the fifth involved a real-world attempt to nudge people out of their comfort zones. The survey results, which held across not just Americans but Chinese and Indian respondents as well, largely lined up with common-sense intuitions about why some people avoid participating in certain activities alone — particularly so-called “hedonic” ones, which are simply about having fun, as opposed to “utilitarian” ones, which involve at least a veneer of productivity (doing work in a restaurant rather than simply sitting there and eating, for example). Across the surveys, the researchers write, they consistently found that “[c]onsumers worry that if they engage in [hedonic] activities alone, observers will infer that they could not find friends to accompany them.” There were ways to make people feel more comfortable, though — “Cues that reduce the degree to which an activity is perceived as hedonic (e.g., reading a book while at a coffee shop) or reduce the anticipated number of observers increase interest in engaging in public activities alone.” This suggests that there’s nothing inherently uncomfortable about sitting alone in a coffee shop for some people; rather, what’s uncomfortable is the idea of other people seeing and judging — a fear that largely dissipates in the presence of a “reason” to be there, such as a book or magazine to read. These fears feel a bit silly, of course, even for those of us who fall victim to them. Why would anyone actually care whether strangers in a coffee shop are judging them for not having enough friends? And why should the presence of a newspaper magically protect against these judgments? Ratner and Hamilton were curious what would happen when people engaged in these sorts of activities despite their misgivings. So in the paper’s one on-the-ground experiment, the researchers had interns recruit students walking through a campus center — some alone, some in groups — and ask them if they wanted to check out a nearby art gallery for five or ten minutes. Participants were asked beforehand how much fun they expected to have, and to then rate the experience after. As expected, they expressed less interest in visiting the art gallery alone, and anticipated having a worse time, as compared to those who were in a group when they were approached. But reality didn’t match their predictions: As it turned out, there was no statistically significant difference in how solo people and group members rated the experience afterward — everyone had the same amount of fun. The experiment, write the researchers, “provides empirical support for a key premise of our investigation: consumers who forego hedonic activities alone are missing out on opportunities for rewarding experiences.” This is a particularly pressing issue right now, the researchers argue, because Americans are spending more and more time alone — there’s a reason the paper is titled “Inhibited from Bowling Alone,” a reference to the famous Robert Putnam book about Americans’ declining membership in the sorts of groups and organizations that help people form meaningful social ties. “So many people are getting married later or are in dual-career families where one person is watching the kids at night,” Ratner told Science of Us. “You can’t always be going out with people.” So she and Hamilton don’t just see their research project as shedding light on a strange quirk of human nature; they think the stakes are a bit higher, that people are missing out on significant quantities of happiness — and businesses missing out on significant amounts of revenue — as a result of overblown fears. A single, small study of students can’t definitively prove that people’s solo-outing fears are misguided, of course, and Ratner said she hopes to conduct more research in a similar vein, particularly studies involving activities that are more time-consuming than a quick pop-in to an art gallery. “This paper was almost like a sampler platter of things that could be interesting to look at on this general topic,” she said. She also wants to look at the other side of the equation: Do people who are out in a group actually judge those who are alone? “It’ll be interesting to understand more about how people actually evaluate a person, and what moderates those effects,” she said. Ratner and Hamilton think that, whether or not concerns of being seen as a loner are well founded, solo-outing-phobia could contribute to a vicious cycle among those who really do lack sufficient companionship. After all, they write, attending events alone is a prime way to meet new people. Ratner said she’d recently experienced this firsthand, during a work trip to Turkey and Singapore that included some free time for travel. “I found myself talking to people more alone than I normally would traveling with other people, when you’re more insulated,” she said. But the aura of travel certainly weakens the everyone-will-think-I’m-a-loser effect. Does Ratner practice what she preaches when she’s Stateside? “Oh my God, it’s so hard for me,” she said with a laugh. “It’s so hard. Wow. I did sign up for something that’s in a couple weeks — I’m going to go to a concert alone. It’s a weekday evening and it’s pretty near my house, so it feels sort of like baby steps, I think. The Saturday night alone, Friday night alone would feel harder for the very reason that people would be making stronger inferences — or I’d be thinking they’d be making stronger inferences.” If even social psychologists studying these fears have trouble fighting through them, it suggests an uphill battle for the rest of us. But Ratner’s convinced it’s worth it, that we’re probably underestimating the likelihood of both having a good time and meeting other people. “Don’t put your life on hold until you have people to do things with,” she said. ||||| Not as sad as it looks. (Winslow Townson/AP Photo) On any given Friday night, bars, restaurants and movie theaters tend to fill up with people spending time with friends, lovers, and family. But when the weekend comes, those who find themselves on their own are likelier to be found on the couch, at home, doing something in private. There's nothing particularly strange here. But maybe we're missing out when we automatically choose to stay in when we don't have social plans. \\"People decide to not do things all the time just because they're alone,\\" said Rebecca Ratner, a professor of marketing at the Robert H. Smith School of Business, who has spent almost half a decade studying why people are so reluctant to have fun on their own and how it may lead to, well, less fun overall. \\"But the thing is, they would probably be happier going out and doing something.\\" Ratner has a new study titled 'Inhibited from Bowling Alone,' a nod to Robert Putnam's book about Americans' waning participation in group activities, that's set to publish in the Journal of Consumer Research in August. In it, she and co-writer Rebecca Hamilton, a professor of marketing at the McDonough School of Business, describe their findings: that people consistently underestimate how much they will enjoy seeing a show, going to a museum, visiting a theater, or eating at a restaurant alone. That miscalculation, she argues, is only becoming more problematic, because people are working more, marrying later, and, ultimately, finding themselves with smaller chunks of free time. The conclusions stem from five separate experiments. In four of them, the researchers surveyed people about certain activities, probing whether they preferred to participate in them with others or alone. In the fifth, Ratner and Hamilton put the preferences to the test by gauging whether people actually enjoyed visiting an art gallery more when they were in the company of others, compared to when they were alone. What they found is that people expected to enjoy the gallery less when they were alone, but they actually tended to have just as good a time whether they had company or not. \\"When you compare an experience that is very similar with or without someone else, like visiting a gallery or going to a movie, you find little difference in enjoyment,\\" said Hamilton. \\"Going to a restaurant might be a little different, because there's that element of conversation, but that doesn't preclude the reality that going to a restaurant alone is still enjoyable.\\" Indeed, the question isn't whether we're going to have more fun doing something with friends rather than not. It's about those times when we don't have someone to see a new movie with, or eat at a newly opened restaurant, and there's discomfort about going by ourselves, even though we'd probably have a fine time. \\"The reality is that you're foregoing a lot of fun,\\" said Ratner. \\"We all are.\\" Why? Ratner says it's mostly because we're overly self-conscious. \\"The reason is we think we won't have fun because we're worried about what other people will think,\\" said Ratner. \\"We end up staying at home instead of going out to do stuff because we're afraid others will think they're a loser.\\" But other people, as it turns out, actually aren't thinking about us quite as judgmentally or intensely as we tend to anticipate. Not nearly, in fact. There's a long line of research that shows how consistently and regularly we overestimate others' interest in our affairs. The phenomenon is so well known that there is even a name for it in psychology: the spotlight effect. A 2000 study conducted by Thomas Gilovich found that people regularly adjust their actions to account for the perspective of others, even though their actions effectively go unnoticed. Many other researchers have since confirmed the pattern of egocentric thinking that skews how we act. \\"If we get people to see that it’s okay to do something for pleasure on their own that’s the way to get rid of the stigma,\\" Hamilton said. How exactly we might go about shedding the stigma is unclear. For one, businesses could be more accommodating of people doing solo activities. \\"Something as simple as adding a second set of tableware instead of removing that second set could set a subtle but important precedent,\\" Ratner said. Another solution might involve tweaking how people perceive the activities themselves. Ratner and Hamilton found that people are much more likely to pursue an activity alone when it's a learning experience. For that reason, bringing reading material along to a cafe or restaurant tends to shed a new light on the experience. But doing that, too, is often a coy way of hiding your shame. \\"It makes it look like they’re occupied and busy, not just that they have no friends\\" said Hamilton. But the best way to get rid of the stigma of doing things in public alone is probably for people to just start doing it more. \\"We need the norms to shift a little. We need for people to think it’s a gutsy cool thing to have fun on our own,\\" said Ratner. \\"Someone needs to start the new trend.\\" ||||| Crawl of outlinks from wikipedia.org started March, 2016.

The story is set in Rome the early 4th century AD, during the time of the persecution of Christians under the Roman Emperor Diocletian. The heroine of the book is Fabiola, a young beauty from a noble Roman family. She is spoiled by her father Fabius, who cannot deny her anything. Fabiola seems to have everything, including a superior education in the philosophers, yet under the surface, she is not content with her life. One day, in a fit of rage, she attacks and wounds her slave girl Syra, who is a secret Christian. The proud, spoiled Roman girl is humbled by Syra's humility, maturity and devotion to her in this situation, and a slow transformation begins, which finally culminates in her conversion to Christianity, brought on by Syra and of her own cousin Agnes, whom she adores and dotes on. Another thread of the story deals with the young boy Pancratius, a pious Christian and son of a martyr, who is himself preparing for martyrdom. Pancratius' nemesis is Corvinus, a bullying schoolmate who is irritated by the young Christian's saintliness. He does everything to bring him and the Christian community of the catacombs of Rome down. This includes the orchestrating of the lynching of their former teacher Cassianus, who is secretly Christian. Yet Pancratius shows his enemy the meaning of Christian forgiveness when he saves his life shortly after Corvinus had Cassianus killed. Another major villain in the story is the enigmatic Fulvius, an apparently rich young man from the East who soon reveals himself to be a hunter of Christians who turns them in to the authorities for money. His aim on the one hand is to gain the hand of either Fabiola or Agnes, and on the other hand, to uproot the Christian community in Rome. After some dramatic events that reveal his surprising connections to Syra, who is his long-lost younger sister Myriam, Fulvius rejects his evil ways, converts to Christianity and becomes a hermit. Answer:","completion":"Syra's real name is Myriam. She is a secret Christian and a slave girl in the story set in Rome during the early 4th century AD. Syra, or Myriam, plays a significant role in the transformation of the heroine Fabiola and helps her convert to Christianity. Myriam's connection to Fulvius, the enigmatic hunter of Christians, is also a crucial aspect of the story, as she is revealed to be his long-lost younger sister."},{"prompt":"Read the following context and answer the question.

He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves. That was 30 years ago, and I still get tears just thinking about what I consider the most beautiful moment of my life, one that I was lucky to share with these two wonderful people.

Reverend Al Sharpton has blasted his former attorney collaborator in the wake of accusations he raped an adviser to Sharpton's National Action Network. Sharpton's highly visible move Tuesday to distance himself from Sanford Rubenstein came a day after police combed the 70-year-old civil rights attorney's apartment for evidence that could paint a picture of what happened in the hours after Sharpton's birthday bash Saturday. Among the potential evidence hauled from Rubenstein's Upper East penthouse on Monday were two bloody condoms and a sex toy. Accused: A file photo shows civil rights power attorney Sanford Rubenstein, who's been accused of raping another trusted ally of Al Sharpton after the reverend's 60th birthday bash on Saturday","completion":"Reverend Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and founder of the National Action Network, has publicly denounced his former attorney collaborator, Sanford Rubenstein, in response to allegations of rape involving a trusted adviser of Sharpton's organization. This strong and clear action taken by Sharpton demonstrates his desire to distance himself and his organization from the ongoing scandal surrounding Rubenstein, emphasizing that there is no tolerance for such heinous acts within his organization. The accusations against Rubenstein surfaced after Sharpton's 60th birthday celebration on Saturday, prompting an immediate investigation by law enforcement. On Monday, officers searched Rubenstein's Upper East Side penthouse, seizing potentially incriminating evidence, including two blood-stained condoms and a sex toy. This development has heightened the scrutiny of Rubenstein, raising several questions about the validity of the allegations and the impact on his professional relationships. The swift response from Sharpton aims to ensure that the core values and mission of the National Action Network are preserved and upheld, in light of these alarming accusations. Recognizing the potential damage that could be inflicted upon the reputation of both himself and his organization, Sharpton chose not to stand in solidarity with Rubenstein. Instead, he has taken a stand against the alleged misconduct and reinforced the message that the National Action Network is committed to fighting for justice and ensuring rights for all individuals. The case against Rubenstein is ongoing, with law enforcement working tirelessly to gather evidence and determine the truth of these accusations. Meanwhile, Sharpton's decision to distance himself and the National Action Network from the scandal surrounding Rubenstein is a critical means of safeguarding the organization's credibility and maintaining focus on the pursuit of civil rights. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete this passage is by discussing Sharpton's swift response to the allegations against Rubenstein and the subsequent actions taken to dissociate himself and the National Action Network from the accused. His commitment to supporting the investigation and ensuring that the integrity of his organization remains uncompromised is a testament to his dedication to civil rights, social justice, and accountability. The unfolding case against Sanford Rubenstein brings broader attention to the issue of justice and accountability, both in relations to the allegations and within the context of civil rights activism."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

News article: Sitting for extended periods of time has been a sort of 21st century epidemic – TV-gazing isn’t new, but streaming movies and tablets aren’t helping our habit of sitting. In studies, sedentariness has been connected to obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and diabetes; it’s even linked to an earlier death. Now, a new study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute suggests that sitting is also connected to cancer – not all types, but to colon and endometrial (uterine) cancer. And it’s not just because sitting takes us away from exercising – even those who sit a lot and exercise have an increased risk for these cancers. This means that there’s something intrinsic about the unhealthiness of sitting apart from lack of exercise. To study this question, the team from University of Regensburg carried out a meta-analysis of 43 earlier studies, including over 4 million people. The studies had all periodically queried the participants on how much time they spent sitting – TV-related sitting, occupational sitting, and total sitting time. Over the years, there were almost 69,000 cancer cases. The more a person sat, the higher the cancer risk for two types of cancer: Endometrial and colon. Sedentariness was linked to a 24% increased risk of colon cancer and a 32% higher risk of developing endometrial cancer. For every two-hour increase in overall sitting time, the risk of cancer rose 8% for colon cancer and 10% for endometrial cancer (it rose 6% for lung cancer, but the association was just borderline). On the upside, breast, rectal, ovarian, prostate, stomach, esophagus, testicular, kidney, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were not linked in any way to sitting. Of course, the famously bad pastime of sitting-while-watching-TV was associated with the greatest risk: a 54% increased risk of colon cancer and 66% higher risk for endometrial cancer. But it’s very likely that body weight plays a role here, since TV-watching is often accompanied by snack foods and soda – and weight is a known risk factor for certain cancers (more on this below). “We found that TV viewing was associated with an increased risk of cancers of the colon and the endometrium,” says lead author Daniela Schmid. “We further observed that the results were independent of physical activity, showing that sedentary behavior represents a potential cancer risk factor distinct from physical inactivity.” And this last point she makes is the more striking finding – that the connection between sitting and cancer was evident regardless of the exercise a person got. In other words, even people who sat a lot and exercised had the elevated risk. This means that there’s something intrinsically bad about sitting, apart from lack of exercise. What are the mechanisms that could possibly explain this? Schmid tells me that part of the connection could certainly be mediated by body weight. “Obesity may mediate carcinogenesis through several pathways, including insulin resistance…and low-grade systemic inflammation,” she says. She adds that in postmenopausal women, fat tissue represents the main source of estrogen; overweight and obesity are a well-known risk factors for endometrial cancer “Moreover,” Schmid adds, “vitamin D deficiency, which more often occurs in overweight individuals compared to normal weight individuals poses a risk for development of colon cancer.” But there seems to be something else going on, because even holding body weight constant, there’s still a link between sitting and cancer. One possibility may be that lack of movement triggers an inflammatory cascade that includes a rise in the biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). “In experimental trials, 14 days of bed rest in young volunteers increased C-reactive protein and pro-inflammatory interleukin 6 levels,” says Schmid. Animal studies have arrived at similar results, she adds. More research will be needed to understand why a lack of movement might be connected to cancer growth. But at least we know what the solution is. Exercising more isn’t enough – you have to punctuate long periods of sitting with regular periods of movement. “Cutting down on TV viewing and sedentary time is just as important as becoming more active,” says Schimd. “For those whose jobs require them to sit at a desk for most of the day, we recommend breaking up the time spent sitting by incorporating short bouts of light physical activity into the daily routine.” Here are a few more tips: - Walk over and talk to your colleagues rather than emailing or calling. - Get up a few times an hour and walk around for a few minutes. - Try not to eat at your desk: Walk to a park or restaurant, or just have a standing lunch. - Try out a standing desk, assuming your office is open to it. - If it’s a reasonable distance, bike or walk to work. - If you drive or take public transportation, park farther away from work or get off the train/bus a couple of stops early and walk the rest of the way. - Don’t watch back-to-back Game of Thrones episodes without taking breaks. - Take an evening walk after dinner or do some exercise at home at night. - Set a good example for your kids. It’s better if they don’t develop the sitting habit in the first place.

The more time people spend sitting, the higher their risk of certain types of cancer, according to a new review of previous studies. Researchers found that, with each 2-hour increase in people's sitting time per day, their risk of colon cancer increased by 8 percent, and women's risk of endometrial cancer increased by 10 percent. For instance, women in the study who spent a total of 10 hours per day watching TV and sitting at work had an 8 percent increased risk of colon cancer and a 10 percent increased risk of endometrial cancer compared with women who typically sat for 8 hours daily. What's more, it didn’t matter how active the study participants were when they were not sitting, according to the findings, published today (June 16) in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. \\"The results were independent of physical activity, showing that sedentary behavior represents a potential cancer risk factor, distinct from physical inactivity,\\" study author Dr. Daniela Schmid, of the University of Regensburg in Germany, told Live Science in an email. [Don't Sit Tight: 6 Ways to Make a Deadly Activity Healthier] In the United States, 4.8 in 100 people get colon cancer during their lifetime, and 2.7 per 100 women get endometrial cancer, said Dr. Graham Colditz, of the Siteman Cancer Center and Department of Surgery at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. In the new review, the researchers analyzed data from 43 previous observational studies, which looked at more than 4 million people, including nearly 70,000 who had cancer. The data in the studies came from interviews and questionnaires. \\"One of the reassuring features was how consistent the results are across the studies,\\" Colditz told Live Science. \\"There was not a lot of variation.\\" Research on the negative consequences of sitting dates back to the 1960s, Colditz said, when researchers examined how postal workers who walked a lot every day had lower rates of mortality from colon cancer compared with accountants and other office workers. As for the potential mechanism behind the association between sedentary behavior and increased cancer risk, a number of factors may be at play, Colditz said. \\"Obesity is a major driver for multiple cancers,\\" and research has shown that obesity and sedentary behavior are related, Colditz said. Studies have also shown that more time spent sitting after meals is related to higher blood-sugar levels, which have also been associated with an increased risk of colon cancer, he said. So, what are people supposed to do if their jobs require them to sit for long periods of time? The researchers recommend that people break up the time they spend sitting by incorporating some sort of light physical activity into their daily routine. \\"For example, instead of calling your colleagues on the phone or sending emails, you may walk down the aisle or take the stairs to reach their office,\\" Schmid said. And although the study showed an increased risk of cancer regardless of people's overall physical activity, the researchers still said that exercise in any form is beneficial to overall health. \\"If people are not warm to a morning jog, then walking or bicycling to the workplace, or inserting a brisk lunchtime walk may bring benefits for your health,\\" Schmid said.

As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those.

Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, people from a place called Spain came to Jamaica and saw Spanish Town. They really liked it! So, they built their houses there and named it Santiago de la Vega. That's its first name! Can you say it? San-ti-ago de la Ve-ga. Very good! However, Spanish Town got another name when people from England came to visit. They liked it too! They thought, \\"Hey, let's call this place St. Jago de la Vega!\\" So, they did. I know it sounds very similar to the first name, but that's the second name. Can you say it now? St. Jago de la Ve-ga. Great job! Time passed, and the city grew. New people came from all around the world. Then, one day, everyone decided to call it Spanish Town. That's its third name, and that's how we know this place today. So, Spanish Town is its final name.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 and 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdams population died in 1623–1625, and again in 1635–1636, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576–1577 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629–1631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norways population died in 1348–1350. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Sonora Webster lives with her sister and abusive aunt during the Great Depression. She learns that because of her accidentally letting the cows loose and her suspension from school, her treasured horse Lightning has been sold and she will be placed in an orphanage. Instead, Sonora slips out of the house during the night. She ends up at a county fair and sees a performance by Marie, a diving girl who rides a horse off a platform, and aspires to do the same. Doc Carver, Marie's employer, tells her she is too young but gives Sonora a job as a stable hand due to her ability with horses, and she begins traveling with them. Doc's son Al wins a wild horse in a card game and Sonora names him Lightning. She later surprises Doc by taming and riding Lightning, so he promises to train her as a diving girl if she can mount it while it's moving, which she succeeds after multiple attempts. Marie falls and dislocates her shoulder, leaving her unable to perform, and Sonora steps in. Although she has never dived with Lightning, their first jump is successful. Marie becomes jealous, and as Doc tires of her diva-like behavior, she quits rather than share billing with Sonora. Al develops a romance with Sonora that strains his relationship with his father, leaving after a particularly bad fight. Al promises to write to Sonora, but Doc hides his letters. As Doc and the new stable hand Clifford leave the farm in search of work, Lightning falls ill with colic. Al returns, and he and Sonora work together to heal Lightning. Doc fails to find any jobs, but Al announces he has arranged a six-month contract to perform at the Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey, reconciling father and son. Doc passes away en route from a heart attack, and Al assumes his father's role as show presenter. Sonora searches for Doc's jacket to give Al confidence on his first show, and finds one of Al's letters inside, confessing his love for her, letting him know she feels the same.

Despite winning numerous cases, his moral compass begins to deteriorate as he realizes that many of the people he represents are truly guilty. Deep down, Jin Wei yearns for redemption and a chance to fight for justice. When Jin Wei's estranged brother, Liang Wei (Raymond Wong Ho-yin), returns to Hong Kong after years of self-imposed exile, he brings with him a crucial piece of information: the imminent release of a notorious crime lord, Lo Fung (Ng Man-tat), from prison. Lo Fung has made a deal with law enforcement to disclose the inner workings of his criminal empire, in exchange for his freedom. Liang Wei, a former detective, has been working undercover to bring down Lo Fung's crime syndicate, which has been involved in human trafficking, drug smuggling, and other illegal activities. He desperately needs his brother's help to prevent Lo Fung's release and ensure the crime lord's testimony is inadmissible in court. Initially reluctant, Jin Wei sees this as a chance to redeem himself and agrees to help his brother. He channels all his expertise and insider knowledge of the legal system to undermine Lo Fung's credibility, isolate the criminal lord from his corrupt contacts within the government, and find evidence proving Lo Fung is still active in the criminal underworld. As the brothers work as a team to bring down Lo Fung, they must navigate various moral dilemmas and overcome multiple obstacles, including corrupt officials, dirty cops, and assassins hired to silence them. They gradually unravel a vast network of corruption that goes beyond Lo Fung, implicating powerful politicians and business tycoons in Hong Kong's elite society. In an intense climax, Jin Wei successfully exposes Lo Fung's criminal activities and invalidates the deal with law enforcement through a groundbreaking court case, sending him back to prison for life while exposing the corrupt individuals who have been protecting him. The Lawyer's Redemption explores themes of family loyalty, moral ambiguity, and the complex nature of justice, with Lau Ching-wan delivering a powerful performance as a flawed but ultimately redeemed protagonist. Ultimately, Jin Wei has a newfound sense of justice and purpose. The victory has a healing effect on the brothers' relationship, and they continue to work together, using their combined skills to fight corruption and bring justice to Hong Kong's criminal underworld."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One of those classmates, Dylan, invites Mandy to a pool party at his house and she accepts with the provision that her best friend, Emmet (Michael Welch) can come along with her. At the party, Dylan attacks Emmet, and holds his head under water in the pool until Mandy intercedes. As revenge, Emmet convinces a drunken Dylan to jump off the roof into the pool, but he hits his head on the cement and dies. Nine months later, Mandy has since befriended many of Dylan's popular friends, while Emmet has been almost completely ostracized and is subjected to even more intense bullying.

Information: - Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \\"tenor high C\\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \\"leggero\\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor. - Orestis Makris ( Greek : ; September 30 , 1898 -- January 29 , 1975 ) was a Greek actor and tenor . He graduated from the Greek Odeum of Athens and first entered the scene as a tenor in the troupe of Rosalia Nika in 1925 . He later joined the Papaioannou troupe , before moving to more comedic roles . Makris excelled in the portrayal of folk characters , especially the stock role of the \`\` drunkard '' . Makris also participated in about forty movies , mostly as an over-strict father . He is considered one of the most significant modern Greek actors . He was decorated with the Order of the Phoenix . He died on January 29 , 1975 in Athens and is buried at the First Cemetery in a family grave . - Vocal range is the measure of the breadth of pitches that a human voice can phonate. Although the study of vocal range has little practical application in terms of speech, it is a topic of study within linguistics, phonetics, and speech and language pathology, particularly in relation to the study of tonal languages and certain types of vocal disorders. However, the most common application of the term \\"vocal range\\" is within the context of singing, where it is used as one of the major defining characteristics for classifying singing voices into groups known as voice types. - Spinto (from Italian, \\"pushed\\") is a vocal term used to characterize a soprano or tenor voice of a weight between lyric and dramatic that is capable of handling large musical climaxes in opera at moderate intervals. (Sometimes the terms \\"lirico-spinto\\" or \\"jugendlich-dramatisch\\" are used to denote this category of voice.) - A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\\"passaggio\\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \\"Fach\\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted. - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock. - In music, an octave (: eighth) or perfect octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. It is defined by ANSI as the unit of frequency level when the base of the logarithm is two. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the \\"basic miracle of music\\", the use of which is \\"common in most musical systems\\".

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose work fell from favor during his later years? from the following article ? Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his...

This musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie Cagney would star in. Cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing. And it needs to be said that he was not bad at it. He plays the role with a lot of confidence. He apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time, so it actually isn't a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career. He obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him in. The movie is directed by Lloyd Bacon, who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre. His earliest '30's musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as \\"42nd Street\\". His musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really. '30's musicals never were really about its singing, this was something that more featured in '40's and later made musicals, mainly from the MGM studios. As usual it has a light and simple story, set in the musical world, that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way. It nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch. So do the characters and actors that are portraying them. Sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie, when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routines. The musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done, even though I'm not a too big fan of the genre itself.

'Row,': This is an essential word because it helps in picturing a specific arrangement of the cottages. The word develops an image where cottages are not scattered but placed in a certain structure contributing to the overall aesthetic of the scene. 2. 'Sleepy': This adjective is fundamental in developing the mood of the sentence. \\"Sleepy\\" here gives an idea about the peaceful, quietude environment of the place. It also implies that the setting may not be bustling with activities and has a slow pace. 3. 'Cottages': This is undeniably a significant word because it represents the primary object of the sentence. The sentence revolves around these 'cottages,' hence it's at the core. 4. 'Cobbled': The essence of the street is captured by this word. Cobbled points to a kind of old-fashioned stone pavement. This directs the reader's mind towards a rustic or charmingly old and unhurried setting. 5. 'Street': Another focal element of the sentence is 'street'. When paired with 'cobbled' it contributes to the visualization of a quaint, picturesque scene, and links the setting to a certain period in history. Therefore, 'row,' 'sleepy,' 'cottages,' 'cobbled,' and 'street' can be considered the most important words in the sentence \\"a row of sleepy cottages on a cobbled street\\".

John Bruce \\"Jack\\" Thompson (born July 25, 1951) is an American activist and disbarred attorney, based in Coral Gables, Florida. Thompson is known for his role as an anti-video-game activist, particularly against violence and sex in video games. During his time as an attorney, Thompson focused his legal efforts against what he perceives as obscenity in modern culture. This included rap music, broadcasts by shock jock Howard Stern, the content of computer and video games and their alleged effects on children. Thompson has heavily criticized a number of video games and campaigned against their producers and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as \\"murder simulators\\" to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games and a number of school massacres. According to Thompson, \\"In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers.\\" Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior. According to Thompson, \\"If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, one has to wonder why he doesn't get a life, but when it comes to kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain.\\" Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as \\"Pearl Harbor 2\\". According to Thompson, \\"Many parents think that stores won't sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked.\\" Thompson has rejected arguments that such video games are protected by freedom of expression, saying, \\"Murder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech. They're not even speech. They're dangerous physical appliances that teach a kid how to kill efficiently and to love it,\\" as well as simply calling video games \\"mental masturbation\\". In addition, he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military, saying that it was looking \\"for a way to disconnect in the soldier's mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end\\". Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and simulation technologies, such as those being developed at the Institute for Creative Technologies, which, he suggests, were created by the Department of Defense to help overcome soldiers' inhibition to kill. He also claims that the PlayStation 2's DualShock controller \\"gives you a pleasurable buzz back into your hands with each kill. This is operant conditioning, behavior modification right out of B. F. Skinner's laboratory.\\" Although his efforts dealing with video games have generally focused on juveniles, Thompson got involved in a case involving an adult on one occasion in 2004. This was an aggravated murder case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant in a series of highway shootings the previous year around Columbus, Ohio. When McCoy was captured, a game console and a copy of The Getaway were in his motel room. Although not representing McCoy and over the objections of McCoy's lawyers, Thompson succeeded in getting the court to unseal a search warrant for McCoy's residence. This showed, among other things, the discovery of additional games State of Emergency, Max Payne, and Dead to Rights. However, he was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia. In Thompson's estimation, McCoy was the \\"functional equivalent of a 15-year-old,\\" and \\"the only thing insane about this case is the (insanity) defense\\". Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What was the claim in that case?","completion":"The claim in the Charles McCoy Jr. case was that McCoy's defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia.

Answer:","completion":"Peasant Woman Against a Background of Wheat is an oil on canvas created by the renowned Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh in 1890. It is important to note that providing an exact number of oil paintings created by van Gogh throughout his lifetime can be challenging, as he was a prolific artist and worked on multiple paintings simultaneously. However, it is widely known that van Gogh produced around 900 paintings in a span of just over a decade (from 1880 to 1890). As a passionate and expressive painter, van Gogh's artwork can be categorized into several distinct periods. These periods are mainly characterized by variations in color and style while reflecting his emotional state and experiences throughout his life. 1. Early works (1880-1883): During this time, van Gogh focused primarily on dark, somber colors in his depictions of peasant life. One notable painting from this period is The Potato Eaters (1885). 2. Dutch period (early 1880s): This period is known for its realistic style and muted, earthy tones in works showcasing everyday life. Examples include Still Life with a Basket of Apples (1881) and Fisherman on the Shore (1882). 3. Antwerp and Paris (1885-1888): van Gogh's work underwent significant transformation during his time in these cities. He began experimenting with brighter colors and Impressionist techniques, influenced by artists like Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. 4. Arles (1888-1889): This period is famous for the vivid colors and light that dominate his work. The sunflower paintings, Café Terrace at Night (1888), and Bedroom in Arles (1888) are some popular examples from this period in his career. 5. Saint-Rémy and Auvers-sur-Oise (1889-1890): His final years were marked by intense emotions and a flurry of creative activity, resulting in several masterpieces such as Starry Night (1889) and Wheatfield with Crows (1890). Throughout these periods, Vincent van Gogh produced many oil paintings, and several of them stand out as timeless treasures that art enthusiasts and experts continue to admire today. The exact number of oil paintings remains ambiguous.

Summarize: For Fred Evans, that was supposed to be the start of a glorious boxing career, the kind Joshua has enjoyed since 2013. However, five years, two convictions for assault and a British Boxing Board of Control ban later, it is only now that Evans is daring to dream again. His professional career begins on Friday in Cardiff, as the 26-year old looks to live up to his potential. Evans was once one of British boxing's top prospects, having dazzled in London and then in the World Boxing Series that followed for Britain's brightest amateur prospects. The super-welterweight now faces Belgian Najim Fennane at Cardiff's Motorpoint Arena in his debut, but the St Mellon's boxer is only too aware he almost curtailed his career before it began, almost cost himself the chance to even compete. The St Josephs-trained boxer was given a suspended jail term in 2015 shortly after turning professional, while a 2014 assault in a lap-dance club had already cost him the chance to represent Wales in the Commonwealth Games. Media playback is not supported on this device It is fair to say, lessons have been learned. \\"Things haven't worked out as I wanted, I've had a few backward steps and a few issues, but I just put that behind me now and look to the future ahead,\\" Evans said. \\"It was stuff outside the ring, I've got some regrets, I've been in the wrong place at the wrong time and of course I regret it, but now I have to look to the future. \\"I had to put the boxing to one side and I had to accept what was going on (the judges' decision to find him guilty twice) that's what gave me the backward steps. \\"But now I am hopefully looking towards a bright future ahead.\\" For Evans, only 21 when he dazzled at the Olympics, fame simply came too fast. \\"Adjusting to fame after the Olympics was weird to adapt to, it was a shock to the system, but I tried to take it in my stride,\\" he said. \\"It was very hard after London, all I've known since I was 10 years old is boxing, and I've been in the gym all the way through. \\"So to not be able to do it, leading up to the professional ranks, it's a time I am glad is behind me. \\"I had a couple of little hurdles to cross over in terms of getting a licence from the British Boxing Board of Control, but we got there in the end and I am back where I belong. \\"I've ticked over for the last few years, just waiting for that period in my life to be over. \\"I've had to take lessons and I have learned the hard way. \\"It has been a long time coming turning pro, it is something I have been looking forward to.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Evans, proud of his Traveller heritage, says he has been inspired in recent years by both Tyson Fury and Billy Joe Saunders making a big impression across the world stage. Evans thinks it is even an advantage for a fighter to come from a background where your supporter base remains strong. \\"I've been inspired by Tyson Fury and Billy Joe Saunders, they've shown what is possible (for someone from a Traveller background) and I want a piece of that,\\" he told BBC Wales Sport. \\"They've gone out and won world titles and that's hopefully something I can follow. \\"Travelling fighters have an advantage in that we have a huge in-built fan base, I will never have a problem selling tickets, they can't wait for me to get going and I know for a fact they will follow me for my whole career. \\"I've had months preparing, I put on a lot of weight, but that is trimmed off, I am as strong and as fit as I have been.\\" For promoter Barry McGuigan, the Fred Evans story now only has one likely outcome. \\"He's got all the talent to go right to the very top,\\" he told BBC Wales Sport.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Billy always loved blueberries. They were his favorite fruit. Today he was going to make juice with his uncle. His uncle liked to make juice out of everything. He made carrot juice, apple juice, vegetable juice, and more juices. He had never made blueberry juice before though! First, Billy and his uncle went to a blueberry farm. They were each given a basket. They picked for an hour and got several pounds. It was hard work picking the little berries from the trees. Now Billy understood why they were expensive in the store. Next, they had to wash the fruit. Some of them still had leaves. Those had to be pulled off. Then the bad berries had to be thrown away. They washed the berries and made them air-dry. After that, they pushed the blueberries through a strainer . The strainer caught most of the seeds and skins, and only left a small glass of dark purple juice to _ When they tasted the juice, it wasn't very sweet. Billy's uncle didn't want to add white sugar to the juice. It was better to use a naturally sweet juice, like apple juice, pear juice, or grape juice. They used grape juice as a sweetener , because grapes had a similar color to the blueberries. Finally, they could drink it. It was a lot of work to make juice, but it sure was refreshing!

Problem:A recent study of plasma neutralization breadth in HIV-1 infected individuals at nine International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) sites reported that viral load, HLA-A*03 genotype, and subtype C infection were strongly associated with the development of neutralization breadth. Here, we refine the findings of that study by analyzing the impact of the transmitted/founder (T/F) envelope (Env), early Env diversification, and autologous neutralization on the development of plasma neutralization breadth in 21 participants identified during recent infection at two of those sites: Kigali, Rwanda (n = 9) and Lusaka, Zambia (n = 12). Single-genome analysis of full-length T/F Env sequences revealed that all 21 individuals were infected with a highly homogeneous population of viral variants, which were categorized as subtype C (n = 12), A1 (n = 7), or recombinant AC (n = 2). An extensive amino acid sequence-based analysis of variable loop lengths and glycosylation patterns in the T/F Envs revealed that a lower ratio of NXS to NXT-encoded glycan motifs correlated with neutralization breadth. Further analysis comparing amino acid sequence changes, insertions/deletions, and glycan motif alterations between the T/F Env and autologous early Env variants revealed that extensive diversification focused in the V2, V4, and V5 regions of gp120, accompanied by contemporaneous viral escape, significantly favored the development of breadth. These results suggest that more efficient glycosylation of subtype A and C T/F Envs through fewer NXS-encoded glycan sites is more likely to elicit antibodies that can transition from autologous to heterologous neutralizing activity following exposure to gp120 diversification. This initiates an Env-antibody co-evolution cycle that increases neutralization breadth, and is further augmented over time by additional viral and host factors. These findings suggest that understanding how variation in the efficiency of site-specific glycosylation influences neutralizing antibody elicitation and targeting could advance the design of immunogens aimed at inducing antibodies that can transition from autologous to heterologous neutralizing activity.

The bourgeoisie (Eng.: ; ) is a polysemous French term that can mean: The \\"Bourgeoisie\\", in its original sense, is intimately linked to the existence of cities recognized as such by their urban charters (e.g. municipal charter, town privileges, German town law) so there was no bourgeoisie \\"outside the walls of the city\\" beyond which the people were \\"peasants\\" submitted to the stately courts and manorialism (except for the traveling \\"Fair bourgeoisie\\" living outside urban territories, who retained their city rights and domicile). In Marxist philosophy the bourgeoisie is the social class that came to own the means of production during modern industrialization and whose societal concerns are the value of property and the preservation of capital, to ensure the perpetuation of their economic supremacy in society. Joseph Schumpeter saw the creation of new bourgeoisie as the driving force behind the capitalist engine, particularly entrepreneurs who took risks to bring innovation to industries and the economy through the process of creative destruction. The Modern French word \\"bourgeois\\" derived from the Old French \\"burgeis\\" (walled city), which derived from \\"bourg\\" (market town), from the Old Frankish \\"burg\\" (town); in other European languages, the etymologic derivations are the Middle English \\"burgeis\\", the Middle Dutch \\"burgher\\", the German \\"Bürger\\", the Modern English \\"burgess\\", and the Polish \\"burżuazja\\", which occasionally is synonymous with the intelligentsia. 1.

Title: Stephanie Daley Movie plot: A quiet teen becomes pregnant when a cute boy shows interest in her at a party. Ashamed and confused by her pregnancy and isolated by her parents' focus on their own troubled relationship, she hides her pregnancy. In a scene which is excruciating to watch, she labors and delivers the infant in a restroom at a ski lodge, and ends its life right there. These events are revealed well into the film, after Stephanie has been accused of and denied that she killed the baby. An additional twist is that the forensic psychologist investigating her case is an older, pregnant Tilda Swinton. The patient and client have parallel family relationships, dominated by strained silences and misunderstandings, and this adds to the tension and explains the mutual, unspoken understanding they share. Stephanie eventually shares the circumstances surrounding the birth with Ms. Swinton's character, and she is ultimately convicted. Little sympathy is shown for her situation, but then, she never tells her whole story, so that in the end those around her are left with only the horror of what she did and no understanding of the angst and pain she has experienced.","completion":"The forensic psychologist investigating Stephanie's case is the older, pregnant Tilda Swinton character."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Given this review: \\"network kill option hello you hav not network kill option to block connection when vpn disconnect?\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

The draft, which started at 7:00 pm Eastern Daylight Time (2300 UTC), was broadcast in the United States on ESPN. In this draft, National Basketball Association (NBA) teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players. This draft set a record with five players being drafted from the same school in the first round. The players were John Wall (first), DeMarcus Cousins (fifth), Patrick Patterson (fourteenth), Eric Bledsoe (eighteenth), and Daniel Orton (twenty-ninth), all from the University of Kentucky. This draft also marked the second time that an NBA D-League player was drafted, with the first case coming in 2008. - Basketball is a sport that is played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop in diameter and mounted at a height of to backboards at each end of the court. The game was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, who would be the first basketball coach of the Kansas Jayhawks, one of the most successful programs in the game's history. - James Naismith (November 6, 1861 November 28, 1939) was a Canadian-American physical educator, physician, chaplain, sports coach and innovator. He invented the game of basketball at age 30 in 1891. He wrote the original basketball rule book and founded the University of Kansas basketball program. Naismith lived to see basketball adopted as an Olympic demonstration sport in 1904 and as an official event at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, as well as the birth of the National Invitation Tournament (1938) and the NCAA Tournament (1939). - The Kansas Jayhawks, commonly referred to as KU, are the teams of the athletic department at the University of Kansas. KU is one of three schools in the state of Kansas that participate in NCAA Division I. The Jayhawks are also a member of the Big 12 Conference. University of Kansas athletic teams have won eleven NCAA Division I championships: three in men's basketball, one in men's cross country, three in men's indoor track and field, three in men's outdoor track and field, and one in women's outdoor track and field. - The history of basketball is traced back to a YMCA International Training School, known today as Springfield College, located in Springfield, Massachusetts. The sport was created by a physical education teacher named James Naismith, who in the winter of 1891 was given the task of creating a game that would keep track athletes in shape and that would prevent them from getting hurt a lot. The date of the first formal basketball game played at the Springfield YMCA Training School under Naismith's rules is generally given as December 21, 1891. Basketball began to spread to college campuses by 1893. - The Memphis Grizzlies are an American professional basketball team based in Memphis, Tennessee. The Grizzlies compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member team of the league's Western Conference Southwest Division. The Grizzlies play their home games at FedExForum. The team is owned by Robert Pera. The Grizzlies are the only team in the major professional North American sports leagues based in the city of Memphis. - The University of Kentucky (UK) is a public co-educational university in Lexington, Kentucky.

Write a title for this article: My 20-year-old daughter was home from college for the weekend, and I noticed an aphorism she had written into her planner: \\"Don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.\\" It made me smile because the quotation is a favorite of mine. I've used it often in my speaking and in my coaching. Never had I shared it with my daughter; she found it herself and, as she told me later, found it to be inspiring. I agree. It's a line that can be of great value to those who aren't at the top and seek to lead from the middle of their organizations. The author is John Wooden, the basketball coach who shepherded the UCLA Bruins to 10 championships in 12 years. The principle guided Wooden and his teams on the hard court, but it resonates off court too, especially in these challenging times. Too often we are tempted to throw in the towel and give up on doing something hard. The forces of \\"no\\" always seem stronger than the forces of \\"yes.\\" Those who lead upward, who effect positive change from the middle of an organization, particularly need to find ways to steel themselves against negativity. For them, Wooden's words can serve as a both a beacon and a challenge. Here are three steps to take to make those words work for you. Put the \\"no\\" into perspective. John Adams said that during the American Revolution \\"we were about one-third Tories, and [one] third timid, and one-third true blue.\\" That is, only a third of the colonists favored breaking with Britain. The other two-thirds were either committed to the King or simply--as is often the case--waiting to see which side won. Every corporate initiative will have more people saying no than saying yes, until momentum, or the chief executive officer, determines which is the right way to proceed. Size up your obstacle. Obstacles come in all shapes and sizes. Take stock of the situation. If you advocate change and your CEO says no, you may try to persuade him or her. But if it could cost you your job, you'll want to think twice. Maybe you'd be wiser to wait for another CEO or to bide your time until conditions otherwise change in your favor. Whatever you do, don't assume that because a colleague doesn't like your idea it's dead. Maybe the higher-ups will go for it. Assess the risks and proceed. Make a firm decision. Based on all you know, make up your mind and act. Decisiveness is critical to leadership. Not making a decision is a decision, as the adage goes. A leader who avoids making a decision is failing to provide proper guidance to followers. And deciding late is often as bad as not deciding at all. It shows weakness and causes people to doubt your capabilities. Note the word can in Wooden's remark. The word can implies choice; it isn't must. Sometimes when you face obstacles it's smart to turn away. You don't have to remove every obstacle every time. Climbers know that conditions at high altitude are risky in the best of times, and that to summit a peak when supplies run low, when someone becomes sick or when the weather gets bad is folly. Not only can you turn back, you should. Likewise, pushing your people to overcome every obstacle will not only exhaust yourself but will also overwhelm them and waste valuable resources. Very often people oppose initiatives at first not because they're wrong or impossible but because they're difficult. Learning to deal effectively with such adversity, and with people who say \\"no\\" when they shouldn't, is critical to organizational success, as well as to every manager's ability to lead his team. So keep Coach ( COH - news - people ) Wooden's wisdom in mind, and choose positive action over negative thinking.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Mike has to learn more about the periodic table for his chemistry exam. To make things easier for him he chose two elements from the table, element A and element B. Element A has higher electronegativity and element B has lower eletronegativity. David found it easier to learn about elements by comparing their properties. Which element would have increased effect of electron shielding, element A or element B? The answer is:","completion":"Element B would have an increased effect of electron shielding compared to element A. To understand this, let's first define electronegativity and electron shielding. Electronegativity is the measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons. Elements with a higher electronegativity have a greater tendency to attract electrons towards them. The electronegativity of an element is influenced by its atomic size and the effective nuclear charge. Electron shielding, also known as shielding effect, is the phenomenon that occurs in the electron cloud around an atomic nucleus. It is the phenomenon where inner shell electrons shield outer shell electrons from the full effect of the positively charged nucleus. As a result, it reduces the net positive charge that the outer electrons experience, which in turn affects the attraction of these electrons to the nucleus. Now, let's compare elements A and B: Element A - Higher electronegativity Since element A has higher electronegativity, it means it has a smaller atomic radius and stronger effective nuclear charge. This results in a higher attraction between the outer shell electrons and the nucleus, which means there is less electron shielding occurring in element A. Element B - Lower electronegativity As opposed to element A, element B has lower electronegativity. This means it has a larger atomic radius and weaker effective nuclear charge. As a result, there is less attraction between outer shell electrons and the atomic nucleus. Consequently, there is more electron shielding occurring in element B, as the impact of the positively charged nucleus is diminished due to the shielding effect of the inner electrons. In conclusion, element B, with lower electronegativity, would have an increased effect of electron shielding when compared to element A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: In this formalism, distances in space can be measured by how long light takes to travel that distance, e.g., a light-year is a measure of distance, and a meter is now defined in terms of how far light travels in a certain amount of time. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Yes, the question is answered in a satisfactory fashion, but I can provide a more detailed step-by-step explanation, including mention of the Minkowski metric, to illustrate the process of measuring distances in Minkowski spacetime: 1. Convert all relevant units: In Minkowski spacetime, we work with units that are compatible with the speed of light. Therefore, it is important to convert all the distances and time intervals into units that are consistent with this framework. One common choice is to use units where the speed of light, c, is equal to 1 (natural units). 2. Understand the concept of spacetime intervals: Minkowski spacetime combines three spatial dimensions with a single time dimension, treating them uniformly. To define a distance in spacetime, we use the concept of spacetime interval, which accounts for both spatial and temporal distance. 3. Calculate spacetime intervals using the Minkowski metric: The Minkowski metric (also known as Minkowski spacetime metric or flat metric) is used to calculate spacetime intervals. It is a mathematical object that encodes information about the structure of spacetime and is given by the formula: ds² = -c²dt² + dx² + dy² + dz² Here, ds² is the spacetime interval, c is the speed of light, and dt, dx, dy, dz are the differences in time and the three spatial coordinates, respectively. 4. Take into account the Lorentz transformations: When dealing with relativistic scenarios (i.e., objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light), keep in mind that distances must respect the principles of special relativity. The Lorentz transformations enable the conversion of distance measurements between two inertial reference frames moving relative to each other. 5. Extract spacelike distances: If we are interested in measuring purely spatial distances in Minkowski spacetime (ignoring any time component), we can set dt = 0 in the formula for the Minkowski metric. In this case, the spacetime interval (squared) becomes the spatial distance squared: ds² = dx² + dy² + dz² By following these steps and applying the appropriate mathematical tools, distances in space can be measured in Minkowski spacetime, taking into account not only spatial distances but also time intervals."},{"prompt":"Q:Question: Where is angel killed?

Article: Caterpillars have many different forms, but most of the ones you’ll see crawling around in the wild will have the same general shape. Beware that it’s easy to get caterpillars confused with worms, so look for the small segments on the body to tell the insects apart. There are many different species of caterpillar, and they can range in length and width. All caterpillars will have the same body parts. Look for a head, which will have a pair of jaws for eating plants, a thorax, which contains most of the caterpillar’s legs, and a long abdomen, which can also have a few sets of legs. If you’re having trouble identifying these parts, look at the caterpillar under a magnifying glass for a closer view. If you’re not sure whether you’re looking at a caterpillar, check by counting the insect’s legs. There should be 3 sets of 2, or 6 total legs, on the thorax, which is right behind the head. Look for up to 4 extra sets of legs at the middle and end of the caterpillar’s abdomen. The caterpillar will sometimes lose the legs on its abdomen before forming a cocoon, so it’s best to rely on the thorax legs to confirm whether an insect is a caterpillar or not. Usually, caterpillars will live near or on the plants that they eat. When you find a caterpillar, try to identify the plants around it, and observe as it eats the leaves, flowers, or even fruit in its habitat. These can give you a better idea of what species of caterpillar you’re looking at. For example, Monarch butterfly caterpillars tend to live on and eat milkweed. In contrast, centipedes, millipedes, and worms tend to live in the dirt, under rocks, or in rotting wood. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article delves into the features, anatomy, and habits of caterpillars, the larval stage of butterflies and moths. It notes that although caterpillars come in varied forms, they generally share the same physique. They can be distinguished from similar creatures like worms by their segmented bodies. All caterpillars possess a head equipped with jaws for consuming vegetation, a thorax housing most of the legs, and a lengthy abdomen that may also bear some legs. If one struggles to identify these parts, a magnifying glass can aid closer examination. The number of legs a caterpillar has also helps in identification. They should have six legs on the thorax right behind the head, while there could be up to four additional sets of legs along the abdomen. However, these abdomen legs might be lost before a cocoon is formed. The caterpillars' habitat and diet can also give an insight into their species. They usually dwell near or on the plants they eat. For instance, Monarch butterfly caterpillars are known to live on and eat milkweed, while other creatures like centipedes, millipedes, and worms are more likely to reside underneath rocks, within dirt, or in decaying wood.

On the day he is to be married, Detective Kanzaki, who happens to be on the case, discovers that his fiancÃ© Mina has been murdered with her heart also missing. He also learns that the killers are Kudo, a geneticist, and his evil secretary Rei. The two are trying to obtain six hearts from the guardians so that they may call forth a horde of demons from the Gate of Rage and have their every desire granted. Only problem is, once they open the gate the entire world will be covered in darkness. Meanwhile, in the afterlife, Mina encounters Izuko, the Guardian of the Gate. Izuko gives her three options: Mina can choose to ascend to heaven and be reborn, she can choose to forever walk the earth as a ghost or she can choose to curse one of the living to death and as a result be cursed to descend to hell.

This indicates that the app has some features or functionalities that could be useful to a friend. So there's a possibility that the application might be helpful to them in some way. However, the review also points out that the app has caused an error message, specifically stating \\"Unfortunately, Wordpress has stopped.\\" This indicates that there could be some stability or compatibility issues with the app, which may be frustrating for a potential user.

Pulakeshin II conquered the eastern Deccan, corresponding to the coastal districts of modern Andhra Pradesh in 616, defeating the remnants of the Vishnukundina kingdom. He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as Viceroy in 621. Thus the Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Vengi Viceroyalty developed into an independent kingdom and included the region between Nellore and Visakhapatnam.After the decline of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, territorial disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by Vijayaditya II(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of Bhima I (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of Bhima I, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.The fortunes of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up a new era in Chola–Chalukya relations. Saktivarman I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king Rajaraja Chola I. This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.Initially, the Eastern Chalukyas had encouraged Kannada language and...

To say the least he was annoying. He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the last name of Emilius Bangert teacher? ? From 1916, Nielsen taught at the Royal Academy where he became director in 1931, shortly before his death. He also had private students in his earlier days in order to supplement his income. As a result of his teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark. Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and Jørgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist Knud Jeppesen, the pianist Herman Koppel, the academy professor and symphony composer Poul Schierbeck, the organist Emilius Bangert who played at Roskilde Cathedral, and Nancy Dalberg, one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of Aladdin. Nielsen also instructed the conductor and choirmaster Mogens Wöldike, remembered for his interpretations of Baroque music, and Rudolph Simonsen, the pianist and composer who became director of the Academy after Nielsen's death.The Carl Nielsen Society maintains a listing of performances of Nielsen's works, classified by region (Denmark, Scandinavia, Europe apart from Scandinavia and outside Europe) which demonstrates that his music is regularly performed throughout the world. The concerti and symphonies feature frequently in these listings. The Carl Nielsen International Competition commenced in the 1970s under the auspices of the Odense Symphony Orchestra. A four-yearly violin competition has been held there since 1980. Flute and clarinet competitions were later added, but these have now been discontinued.

This famous doll, called Barbie, was created by Ruth Handler in 1959. Now Barbie is known everywhere. Before Barbie, all dolls were made to look like babies. People thought that this was a way to teach young girls how to become a good mother. Barbie was the first doll made to look like an adult instead of baby. From the beginning, Barbie was a modern career girl. There was a different Barbie for each job: nurse, teacher, police officer, race car driver, professional basketball player, pilot, as well as the very first female to fly in space. Barbie made it possible for young girls to dream about a future other than being a mother and a housewife. It showed girls that they had choices and could become anything they wanted to be. At the time, these ideas were very new and positive. The movement for equal opportunity for women had just begun and women wanted to have the same chance as men to do important work. However, Barbie's approval as a role model has not lasted. Today, many people criticize Barbie for making young girls too concerned about their appearance . These people complain that the beautiful, well-dressed Barbie seems to tell girls that while they can hope to have different career, it is more important for them to be beautiful and thin. The female figure that Barbie represents has also been criticized for being unrealistic . Young girls might think that Barbie's figure is beautiful and desirable . However, if Barbie were a real person, she would be six feet tall and wear a size three shoe!

Review: Disney goes to the well one too many times as anybody who has seen the original LITTLE MERMAID will feel blatantly ripped off. Celebrating the birth of their daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric plan on introducing her to King Triton. The celebration is quickly crashed by Ursula 's sister, Morgana who plans to use Melody as a defense tool to get the King 's trident. Stopping the attack, Ariel and Eric build a wall around the ocean while Melody grows up wondering why she cannot go in there. Awful and terrible is what describes this direct to video sequel. LITTLE MERMAID 2 gives you that feeling everything you watch seemed to have come straight other Disney movies. I guess Disney can only plagiarize itself! Do not tell me that the penguin and walrus does not remind you of another duo from the LION KING! Other disappointing moments include the rematch between Sebastien and Louie, the royal chef. They terribly under played it! The climax between Morgana and EVERYONE seemed to be another disappointment. I will not give anything away, but in 75 minutes, everything seemed incredibly cramped and too much to handle. An embarrassment to Disney, LITTLE MERMAID 2 is better left to rent and laugh at.

Jot down a few reasons why you feel nervous about your speech. Try to dig into specific reasons. For example, if you write down that you’re worried that you’ll look stupid in front of a crowd, think about why you think you’ll look stupid. Is it because you worry that your information is wrong? Once you know this, you can spend more time researching and learning your topic. When you think negative thoughts about yourself and your performance, your anxiety will grow. If you don’t have confidence in yourself, you may think, how will your audience have confidence in you? When you catch yourself thinking negatively, stop yourself. Replace it with a positive thought. For example, you might think, “I’ll forget my entire speech. I don’t know what I’m doing.” Stop this thought and replace it with, “I know my topic. I’ve done lots of research.

That means we are taking away the same thing from both sides to keep it fair! So, we'll get: 4314*x - 4309*x = 30 2. Now, let's see the difference between the 4314*x and the 4309*x. We just have to subtract 4309 from 4314. So, we get: (4314 - 4309)*x = 30 5*x = 30 3. Finally, let's find the value of \\"x\\".

Paris Whitney Hilton (born February 17, 1981) is an American television personality and business woman. She is the great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels. Born in New York City and raised there and in Beverly Hills, California, Hilton began her modeling career as a teenager when she signed with New York-based modeling development agency Trump Model Management. Her lifestyle and rumored short-lived relationships made her a feature of entertainment news and tabloid magazines, and Hilton was proclaimed \\"New York's leading It girl\\" in 2001. Hilton was born in New York City. Her mother, Kathy Hilton (nee Kathleen Elizabeth Avanzino), is a socialite and former actress; her father, Richard Howard \\"Rick\\" Hilton, is a businessman. She was raised in the Catholic faith. Hilton is the oldest of four children; she has one sister, Nicholai Olivia \\"Nicky\\" Hilton (born 1983), and two brothers: Barron Nicholas Hilton II (born 1989) and Conrad Hughes Hilton III (born 1994). Her paternal great-grandfather was Conrad Hilton, who founded Hilton Hotels. Hilton has Norwegian, German, Italian, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. She moved frequently in her youth, living in a suite in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, Beverly Hills and the Hamptons. As a child, she was friends with other socialites, including Ivanka Trump, Nicole Richie and Kim Kardashian. Growing up in Los Angeles, Hilton attended the Buckley School and St. Paul the Apostle School, finishing elementary school in 1995. Her freshman year of high school (1995-96) was spent at the Marywood-Palm Valley School in Rancho Mirage, California. In 1996, Hilton and her family left California for the East Coast. At age 16, Hilton spent one year at the Provo Canyon School for emotionally troubled teens. She then attended the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut from fall 1998 to February 1999 (her junior year), where she was a member of the ice hockey team. In February 1999, Hilton was expelled from Canterbury for violating school rules, returning to the Dwight School before dropping out a few months later. She later earned a GED certification. Hilton began modeling as a child, originally at charity events. When she was 19, she signed with Donald Trump's modeling agency, T Management. Hilton said that she \\"wanted to model\\", Trump wanted her at his agency, and she was \\"loving\\" the work. While modeling, she became a daily feature of entertainment news for her partying; according to Vanity Fair, Cisco Adler (producer of Sweetie Pie, in which Hilton acted) called her \\"a young party girl who gets sucked into the L.A. party scene and grew up a little too fast\\". In 2001, Hilton developed a reputation as a socialite; she was called \\"New York's leading It Girl\\", whose fame was beginning to \\"extend beyond the New York tabloids\\". Around that time she made a cameo appearance in Zoolander and appeared on several magazine covers, including the UK's Tatler, Italy's Giola and the US' Vanity Fair and FHM. Hilton also appeared in Vincent Gallo's \\"Honey Bunny\\" video. In 2002, she played a lead role in the straight-to-video horror film, Nine Lives. According to Beyondhollywood.com, \\"Hilton's presence in the cast is the film's main marketing point, which is plainly obvious by the fact that she's front and center on the box art and is the only recognizable name in the cast\\". The website noted that her character was, basically, herself: \\"Hilton plays--what else?--a spoiled American socialite who shops on three continents in one day. The script is even clever enough to take a few jabs at Hilton's real-life social standing, even mentioning that she's been on the cover of a few sleaze rags in her day\\".

Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: By. Associated Press. Eric Garner (pictured) died on July 17 after being put in a choke-hold by an NYPD officer. A New York prosecutor will ask a grand jury to consider charges in the death of a black man placed in an apparent choke-hold by a white police officer, he said today. Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan announced that an extra grand jury will be asked to hear evidence next month in the July 17 death of Eric Garner. 'I assure the public that I am committed to conducting a fair, thorough and responsible investigation into Mr. Garner's death, and that I will go wherever the evidence takes me, without fear or favor,' Donovan said in a statement. Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, could be heard on an amateur video shouting 'I can't breathe!' as Officer Daniel Pantaleo placed him in an apparent chokehold. Police said the officers were arresting Garner on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. A second video, which appeared to have been shot shortly after Garner was handcuffed, showed him lying on the sidewalk, apparently unresponsive. More than three minutes in, medics arrive and one checks his pulse. Garner is lifted onto a gurney and transported to a waiting ambulance about two minutes later. A bystander asks why no one is performing CPR and one officer responds, 'because he's breathing.' Garner, who had asthma, died a short time later. Donovan said his decision to take the case to a grand jury was based on his office's investigation and the medical examiner's ruling that the death was a homicide caused by neck compressions from the chokehold, chest compression and Garner's prone position while being restrained. Donovan said a court granted his request for the extra grand jury on Monday. He said in a statement that he would make no additional comment about the panel's work, including possible witnesses and charges, to maintain proceedings' secrecy. Eric Garner's body lies in a casket during his funeral at Bethel Baptist Church in the Brooklyn borough of New York on July 23. Pantaleo, an eight-year NYPD veteran, was stripped of his gun and badge after Garner's death and another officer was placed on desk duty. Two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians were suspended without pay. Pantaleo's lawyer, Stuart London, said it was too early to say whether his client would testify before the grand jury. 'That's a decision that I weigh very carefully,' London said. Patrick Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said the union expected a grand jury investigation and is encouraged that the process is moving forward. 'We are confident that a fair and impartial grand jury that is allowed to conduct its deliberations based on facts and not emotion or political considerations will see that justice is served,' Lynch said in a statement. Civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton plans to lead a march to Donovan's office on Saturday. Protesters are calling for Donovan to file criminal charges or let federal prosecutors take over. Several members of New York's congressional delegation last week echoed the call for the Justice Department to investigate. They questioned whether Donovan, a Republican, could adequately investigate the case given his close working relationship with police and the borough's large population of police officers. Sharpton said he, Garner's family and the family's lawyers will meet Thursday with U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch to reiterate their desire for a federal investigation. 'This announcement does not impact our move for federal takeover of this case at all,' Sharpton said in a statement.","completion":"A man named Eric Garner passed away after a police officer put him in a choke-hold. This happened in New York City on July 17th. To understand why this happened, a special group of people called a grand jury will listen to evidence and decide if anyone should be charged for Eric Garner's death. The police officer involved, Daniel Pantaleo, had his gun and badge taken away while the investigation is happening.

Article: There were serious scientific objections to the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including Karl von Nägeli's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century. Now answer this question: What justification for his objections to the process of natural selection did Karl von Nägel give?","completion":"Karl von Nägeli's justification for his objections to the process of natural selection was his insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection.

Please add spaces between words: farting,Japanese,Japaneselesbian","completion":"Farting Japanese Japanese Lesbian It seems like you have mentioned three separate phrases: \\"farting,\\" \\"Japanese,\\" and \\"Japanese lesbian.\\" Here is a detailed explanation of each phrase: 1. Farting: Farting, also known as flatulence, is a natural bodily function that occurs when gas is expelled from the digestive system through the rectum. This gas can contain nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, and small amounts of other gases. Farting is a normal part of the digestion process and can occur as a result of swallowing air or due to the breakdown of certain foods in the gut. Factors that can contribute to increased farting include a diet high in certain vegetables like beans and brussels sprouts, consuming carbonated beverages, and some medical conditions. While farting can sometimes be embarrassing due to the sound or smell, it is important to remember that it is a natural and necessary bodily function. 2. Japanese: Japanese is both a language and a nationality. Japanese, as a language, belongs to the Japonic language family and is spoken primarily in Japan, where it is the official language. Japanese is an agglutinative language with a complex writing system that consists of three scripts: Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana. The language also makes use of thousands of characters borrowed from Chinese. The Japanese language is renowned for its honorifics and varying degrees of politeness. In terms of nationality, Japanese refers to an individual who hails from Japan, a country that consists of four main islands and numerous smaller islands, located in East Asia. Japan is known for its rich cultural heritage, ancient traditions, and modern advancements in technology. 3. Japanese Lesbian: The term \\"Japanese lesbian\\" is a combination of the nationality \\"Japanese\\" and the sexual orientation \\"lesbian.\\" It refers to a Japanese woman who identifies as a lesbian, or someone who is attracted to other women. In Japan, as in many other countries, there has been a historical presence of LGBTQ+ individuals, but it is important to note that societal attitudes and legal standing have changed over time. In recent years, there has been more visibility and awareness of LGBTQ+ individuals and issues in Japan, with pride events and support organizations becoming more commonplace. However, Japanese LGBTQ+ individuals may still face challenges and discrimination both legally and socially. Same-sex marriage is not currently recognized in Japan, and there are limited legal protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation. In conclusion, each phrase has its own distinct meaning. Farting is a natural bodily function related to the digestive system, Japanese refers to the language and nationality of an individual from Japan, and Japanese lesbian refers to a Japanese woman who is attracted to other women."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who made alliances with the Holy Roman Empire? from the following article ? Alexios's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118 and ruled until 1143. John was a pious and dedicated Emperor who was determined to undo the damage to the empire suffered at the Battle of Manzikert, half a century earlier. Famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign, John was an exceptional example of a moral ruler at a time when cruelty was the norm. For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius. During his twenty-five-year reign, John made alliances with the Holy Roman Empire in the West and decisively defeated the Pechenegs at the Battle of Beroia. He thwarted Hungarian and Serbian threats during the 1120s, and in 1130 he allied himself with the German emperor Lothair III against the Norman king Roger II of Sicily.In the later part of his reign, John focused his activities on the East, personally leading numerous campaigns against the Turks in Asia Minor. His campaigns fundamentally altered the balance of power in the East, forcing the Turks onto the defensive, while restoring many towns, fortresses, and cities across the peninsula to the Byzantines. He defeated the Danishmend Emirate of Melitene and reconquered all of Cilicia, while forcing Raymond of Poitiers, Prince of Antioch, to recognise Byzantine suzerainty. In an effort to demonstrate the Emperor's role as the leader of the Christian world, John marched into the Holy Land at the head of the combined forces of the Empire and the Crusader states; yet despite his great vigour pressing the campaign, his hopes were disappointed by the treachery of his Crusader allies. In 1142, John returned to press his claims to Antioch, but he died in the spring of 1143 following a hunting accident.

Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who seizes his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for Shrek to appear to save his life.

Quick Review: If it weren't for the stellar fish fry and the awesome beer selection, this place would be a solid 2.5-star establishment. Alas, the fish is unreal and the beer selection rivals many (if not most) of Madison's finest. Detailed Review: The Fish Fry Fanatics stumbled into Dexter's Pub this past Friday and decided to give their fish fry a shot. The menu selection is vast - we counted at least 6 or 7 solid fish fry options, from shrimp to Lake Perch to Walleye. We put our name in for a table, and were told it would be a 35-40 minute wait, so we ordered some of our customary Old Fashioneds. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the bartenders muddle their Old Fashioneds, but were disappointed by the inclusion of a huge chunk of orange. I'm sorry to say, but a Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour should *not* include half-of-an-orange as garnish. Regardless, the Old Fashioned was solid - very good, actually. So much so that when we ordered a second round and requested they drop the orange, it wasn't a problem. Dexter's recovered nicely, and as luck would have it, our table became available soon after we grabbed round 2 of drinks. We immediately ordered cheese curds, salad, and soup. I went with the vegetable garden soup; others at the table went with chili and salad. The soup and salads arrived within seconds; the soup was good - not great, but good - and it could've been a little warmer. I'm told the chili was good as well - not life altering, but good. The waiter came back to take our dinner order: two orders of beer battered cod, an order of lake perch, and an order of shrimp. He said he'd be back in 10 minutes with our fish. Nearly an hour later, we flagged down a waitress for: refills on our drinks, and to inquire about our curds and fish. She apologized profusely... curds came out a few minutes later - apparently they forgot about us. The only benefit to being forgotten was that we had plenty of time to read the beer menu, which features a nice selection of craft beers from microbreweries - Dexter's doesn't strike me as a place that would feature such a wide selection of unique beers, but I guess it goes to prove that you can never judge a book by its cover. Curds were excellent - not your typical \\"from the bag\\" curds, which was a nice surprise. They were breaded and featured a mild white cheese; they were cooked perfectly. Fish arrived within minutes, and it was well worth the wait. The cod was phenomenal. Three huge pieces with a mound of fries - now that's what we're talkin' about. The batter was light, crisp, and flavorful. The fish was thick, meaty, and perfectly flavored. I loved every single bite of it. I also sampled the Lake Perch and shrimp - both of which were excellent as well. Huge props to Dexter's for their fish fry - it's definitely a top-10 offering. In the end, they also made things good as the waiter comp'ed us our drinks and curds, so we got out of there for under 40. We tipped well and called it a night. I'd definitely go back to Dexter's - sure, they dropped the ball, but they did an honorable thing and made everything right by us. Thanks, Dexter's!! Dexter's = WIN Food = 4.5 stars (excellent fish; curds and fries were stellar) Service = 2 stars (they forgot about us, but made up for it) Value = 2 stars (would've been over 85 for the 4 of us) Misc = 3 stars (the place isn't much to look at, but has an excellent beer selection...) Oh - also, parking is hard to come by, so be prepared to park on the street and/or walk a bit to get there. Choose the sentiment of this review? Available choices: [1]. negative [2]. positive","completion":"[2]. positive The sentiment of this review is positive because even though they had some minor issues with service, the reviewer praises the fish fry and beer selection. They also mention that the establishment made up for the service mistakes, and they would consider returning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Joe Gliniewicz.Police reports just obtained by ABC7 reveal new details about what investigators encountered when they responded to the call \\"officer down\\".In the final moments of Lt. Gliniewicz's life, officers were converging on his position in response to his call that he was chasing three suspicious men.Newly-released documents reveal two responding officers were on opposite sides of the field - essentially surrounding him - and close enough to hear the fatal gunshot. No one was seen leaving the field.When officers discovered him face down, one observed that Lt. Gliniewicz's hand was \\"empty in a position that would lead to believe he was possibly holding a gun.\\" His service weapon was later found in thick brush, a couple feet from his body. All were early clues the shooting may have been a suicide \\"If they had, almost immediately, information that it was a probable suicide and kept it from the people of Fox Lake for so long, I think there's going to be liability with respect to the government,\\" said Prof. Richard Kling, IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law.With investigators pursuing the case as a homicide for weeks, the documents reveal some of the tips that came from the public - from the serious to the sensational.One tipster suggesting Gliniewicz's wife had motive to kill him based on racy photos on her MySpace page.One anonymous caller said he'd heard Mayor Donny Schmit instructed Gliniewicz the night before his death to take a squad car home that had no video camera installed.A village spokesperson adamantly denied that claim Thursday night.\\"You're going to have legitimate people who call in with legitimate concerns, and you're going to have goofs who call in with concerns that aren't so legitimate,\\" Kling said.The first lawsuit related to the Gliniewicz case will be filed in federal court on Friday. Among those named in the suit are Mayor Schmit, Former Police Chief Michael Behan, and the estate of Joe Gliniewicz. ||||| Officials investigating 'thousands' of pieces of military surplus in Gliniewicz' possession Investigations Officials investigating 'thousands' of pieces of military surplus in Gliniewicz' possession For the first time, FOX 32 got to look into the Fox Lake Police Explorers clubhouse, where Lt. Joe Gliniewicz conducted meetings and stored hundreds of pieces of military equipment. CHICAGO (FOX 32 News) - For the first time, FOX 32 got to look into the Fox Lake Police Explorers clubhouse, where Lt. Joe Gliniewicz conducted meetings and stored hundreds of pieces of military equipment. That military surplus is now at the center of an investigation by State of Illinois and Fox Lake officials. Most of it was apparently obtained through a federal program called the Law Enforcement Surplus Office (LESO), which makes surplus military equipment available to local law enforcement agencies across the country. Gliniewicz was in charge of requisitioning equipment through the program for the Fox Lake Police Department. But officials told FOX 32 that it appears he was handing much of that military surplus over to the Police Explorers unit, which he and his wife ran for years. The problem is, federal and state rules make clear the military surplus should only be used for police purposes, and the Police Explorers would not have qualified to receive it. \\"We learned that there was evidence through the text messages that he had forged documents, being the chief's signature, to obtain through LESO and other military programs,\\" Fox Lake Interim Police Chief Michael Keller said. Looking through everything, FOX 32 found helmets, uniforms, gun vests, military boots, sleeping cots, life jackets, backpacks, US Army water bottles, and more. FOX 32: So much of what we see here right now may have been obtained fraudulently? \\"We believe so,\\" Keller responded. Pictures show that authorities also found flares and airsoft guns that shot plastic BB’s. And there’s visible evidence on the wall that people were firing the guns in the storage room. \\"Right now I would say the equipment that we have is excessive for an Explorer post. Some of the items here, I don't see why an Explorer post would need this,\\" said Keller. Investigators are also looking to see whether Gliniewicz sold any of the equipment he obtained from the program. \\"The equipment is used for police departments only and not youth programs. So that's why it's one of our priorities to get this counted, see where it came from and what we need to do from here,\\" said Fox Lake Village Administrator Anne Marrin. The Explorers clubhouse, which is located in the basement of a Fox Lake community center, is filled with boxes containing hundreds, if not thousands, of pieces of military equipment, including bullet proof vests, gun belts, gas masks, ammunition and flares. There are also cots, mattress pads, Tupperware, t-shirts and boots obtained through the program, items which police officials said they would have no use for. The Village of Fox Lake has hired a private company to identify and inventory all of the materials. That inventory list will be checked against acquisition records provided by the state to see whether all the military surplus has been accounted for. Investigators say they don't have any evidence yet that Gliniwiecz was selling the military surplus, but they are looking into that possibility. They also told FOX 32 that canines brought into the Explorers Clubhouse by the sheriffs indicated positive for drugs in several areas, but no narcotics were found. ||||| On the morning of Fox Lake police Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz's death Sept. 1, a trio of his fellow officers were close enough to the scene to hear what was likely the fatal shot, according to police reports released Thursday. The three officers were responding to a call to assist Gliniewicz a few minutes before 8 a.m. after he radioed that he was checking out three suspicious individuals in a swampy area near U.S. 12, according to the police reports. \\"They were all in the vicinity and one said, 'Is that a shot?'\\" said Detective Christopher Covelli with the Lake County sheriff's office. One of the officers, a military veteran, described it as a \\"muffled shot,\\" which helped lead them to the area where they found Gliniewicz, Covelli said. Officers Shane Campion, Richard Howell and Todd Ebbing met up on a gravel road near a cement plant, then followed a path created by foot traffic north of a swampy area, according to the police report. One saw Gliniewicz lying face down, not moving in tall grass near the tree line and called out \\"officer down, possible shots fired.\\" When they reached Gliniewicz, he was unconscious, not breathing and his \\"hand was empty in a position that would lead to believe he was possibly holding a gun,\\" according to the police report. His gun was missing and his radio was near his feet. Today, we know it was self-inflicted. On Sept. 1, that was not the case. Nov. 12, 2015. (CBS Chicago) Today, we know it was self-inflicted. On Sept. 1, that was not the case. Nov. 12, 2015. (CBS Chicago) SEE MORE VIDEOS One of the officers went back to lead two more officers to the scene. Lt. Mark Schindler and Sgt. Dawn Deservi, the two latest to arrive, called out for a perimeter to be set up. Schindler left to set up a command post and Deservi asked for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, helicopters, Metra police, all Fox Lake afternoon shift officers and surrounding schools to be notified of what had happened, according to the report. Covelli said it's not clear how quickly they found Gliniewicz's body because they did not call it in over the radio, but estimated only five to seven minutes could have passed. Despite the fact officers were on the scene to hear the shot, Covelli said potential suspects would have still had opportunities to flee unnoticed. \\"One of the things they didn't do is call it in on the radio, which would have given us a better timeline, but there were so many escape routes … There was plenty of merit in the fact that there were three suspects,\\" Covelli said. Authorities later determined Gliniewicz wasn't pursuing anyone, but three men were questioned and released. The officers later told investigators that in the emotion and high stress of the moment they didn't think to call in the shot and immediately began searching for Gliniewicz and a trio of possibly armed offenders, Covelli said. Attempts to reach the first-responding officers to the scene were unsuccessful. The newly-released documents also detail some of the initial leads investigators considered, including a police officer from McHenry County passing along information from a \\"reliable\\" informant and others sharing suspicions. In one case, a man who allegedly boasted of having killed a person was believed to have left for Spain. At a news conference last week, authorities announced that Gliniewicz shot himself in a suicide staged to look like a murder. George Filenko, commander of the major crime task force, said Gliniewicz had been stealing money from the village's Explorer youth police training program for seven years and feared his \\"extensive criminal acts\\" could come to light during a review of village finances and practices. The village is also investigating what Covelli deemed an \\"unusual\\" and sizable stockpile of equipment in the building used by the Explorers. Task force officials said the equipment, obtained through a program that distributes surplus military gear to local law enforcement agencies, includes bulletproof vests, ballistic helmets, gas masks, computers and cots. Covelli said text messages recovered from Gliniewicz's phone indicate he forged the police chief's signature to obtain equipment for the Explorers — a group that wouldn't be authorized to request equipment from the Law Enforcement Support Office program. The village is now comparing the list of equipment at the Explorer post to a list of what they received. All weapons and vehicles Fox Lake police received through the program are accounted for and were not among the Explorers' equipment, Covelli said. There's also no evidence Gliniewicz sold equipment obtained through the program, he added. \\"If any additional malfeasance is found, it would go to the appropriate law enforcement agency,\\" he said. While controlled property, including weapons and tactical vehicles, must be accounted for each year and returned when the police department is no longer using it, general equipment becomes the department's property after one year, said Susan Lowe, spokeswoman for the Defense Logistics Agency, which manages the surplus equipment program. The Fox Lake Police Department was suspended from the program in July 2014 for not completing paperwork but was reinstated just one month later, Lowe said.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: What are you gaining in your sexually harassing behaviors? Better understanding why you feel sexual harassment is necessary will help you find a solution for your behavior and refocus your energy in a more productive way. Examine your reasons for sexually harassing women. Do you want to look good in front of your buddies? Perhaps you need new friends, or give your old friends a heads-up about why sexual harassment is wrong. Does it make you feel strong, powerful, in control? Your insecurity is no excuse for sexual harassment. Talk to a therapist if you struggle with the need to feel “manly” or “tough.” Do you feel entitled to touch or talk about a woman's body without her permission? This is a symptom of male privilege, the ability of men to do and say things that women cannot because society judges people of different genders with different yardsticks. Consider how you would feel if someone touched and tried to coerce you into something you did not want to do. Whatever your reason, ask why you think it’s acceptable and find a way to undermine the assumptions upon which you’ve justified sexual harassment. There are consequences for you and consequences for her. There can be emotional, physical, or legal repercussions for sexual harassment depending on the severity and specific circumstances of the situation. Some of these consequences include: You may later feel embarrassed when you realize how rude you’ve been. In addition to negative feelings, you may open yourself up to legal action, especially in the case of ongoing sexual harassment of one individual. Women who experience sexual harassment feel angry, trapped, and frustrated. Victims of sexual harassment will feel less safe and often have to adjust their travel routes and schedules in order to avoid certain times of the day (especially late at night) or certain places (near bars, colleges, and restaurants) where sexual harassment is a frequent occurrence. Cultural acceptance of sexual harassment leads to rape, domestic violence, and other forms of female disempowerment which women around the world have to confront daily. Imagine you are one of the one in four women who experience sexual harassment in the street before the age of 12 (or one of the one in two women harassed on the street by age 17). How would you feel? Victims of sexual harassment often describe the experience as one in which they feel powerless, afraid, angry, and alone. Stop believing the lie that women enjoy harassment. Just because she smiles doesn't mean she likes it; in fact, a smile is most likely a fear response in the hopes that the situation won’t escalate into threats, violence, stalking, rape, or murder. Sexual harassment threatens a woman's sense of safety, and it is never okay. Use the following guiding questions to think carefully about life as a woman under the constant threat of sexual harassment: Would you like to worry about what you are wearing before going out because you might be \\"asking for it?\\" What would it feel like to live according to a \\"rape schedule\\" – leaving bars and other venues early to ensure you are not alone in the parking lot after dark? Do you think your sister, mother, or female friends would appreciate catcalls, staring, or unwanted groping? Would you? Changing habits is hard. Motivate yourself to stop the harassment. Wear a rubber band around your wrist and lightly snap it against your wrist when you feel the urge to harass. Have a stress ball in your pocket to distract yourself when you're feeling the urge to touch someone inappropriately. Conversely, when you go for a week without making a sexual comment or joke which might make women feel awkward or uncomfortable, give yourself a pat on the back and a little reward. As time goes on and you become more sensitive to the reality of sexual harassment, elongate the period of time you wait to reward yourself for speaking and acting free of sexual harassment. Give a detailed verbal apology to any woman you realize you were harassing. Explain that you now realize the error of your ways, and have learned that women deserve respect. A display of penitence will make the women you harassed feel somewhat better, and after a big apology, you will think twice about making lewd comments, gestures, or touches. Summary:","completion":"Sexual harassment can stem from various reasons, such as the need to feel powerful, male privilege, or seeking validation from peers. However, it is crucial to understand that sexual harassment is never acceptable and has severe emotional, physical, and legal consequences for both the harasser and the victim. Victims often feel powerless, afraid, and angry, while harassers may face embarrassment, legal action, or damaged relationships. Cultural acceptance of sexual harassment can lead to more severe forms of violence and disempowerment against women. As an individual, think deeply about the reasons behind your behavior and find ways to undermine your assumptions. Recognize that sexual harassment is a threat to a woman's sense of safety, regardless of her reaction. Empathize with the experiences of women who face constant harassment by putting yourself in their shoes and considering how your own female friends and family members would feel in similar situations. To change your habits, use tactics such as wearing a rubber band on your wrist or carrying a stress ball to redirect your urges to harass. Reward yourself for periods of time free from harassment and continually work on increasing the duration between rewards. If you have harassed someone, offer a heartfelt apology that acknowledges your understanding of the harm caused and your commitment to respecting women. By taking these steps, you work towards ending sexual harassment and fostering a culture of respect and equality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the answer to this question? who dumped the tea in the boston tea party?","completion":"The Boston Tea Party was a significant event in the course of American history that took place on December 16, 1773. This political protest was carried out by a group called the Sons of Liberty, under the leadership of American patriots such as Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and John Hancock, among others. The event was a response to the Tea Act of May 1773, which was enacted by the British Parliament to help the struggling British East India Company. The Tea Act allowed the company to sell its tea directly to the American colonies, bypassing the usual colonial merchants, which led to a significant reduction in the price of tea. However, it also maintained the taxes on tea imposed by the Townshend Acts in 1767. Many American colonists saw this as an attempt by the British government to continue asserting its authority and undermine the independence of colonial merchants. To express their opposition to the British government's perceived encroachment on their rights, the Sons of Liberty, dressed as Mohawk Indians, dumped an estimated 340 chests of British East India Company tea into the Boston Harbor. This was significant not only for the amount of tea that was destroyed (90,000 pounds, or about 45 tons, which would be worth around a million dollars today), but also because it marked a moment of open defiance against the British crown and fueled the tensions that eventually led to the American Revolution. The identities of many of the participants in the Boston Tea Party have remained undisclosed, primarily because they disguised themselves as Mohawk Indians to avoid recognition and subsequent punishment from British authorities. However, several of the most prominent people involved in the event included: 1. Samuel Adams: A founding figure in American history and a leader of the Sons of Liberty, Adams was a driving force behind the Boston Tea Party. 2. Paul Revere: A notable figure in the Sons of Liberty, Revere was a silversmith, engraver, and midnight rider, who is said to have participated in the Boston Tea Party. 3. John Hancock: A merchant, smuggler, and influential figure in the American Revolution, Hancock's involvement in the event is uncertain, but most historians believe he was a key player in orchestrating the protest. In summary, while the identities of all those who dumped tea into the Boston Harbor during the Boston Tea Party may never be known, the event was orchestrated by the Sons of Liberty, with Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and John Hancock being some of the most notable leaders involved in this key moment in American history. The Boston Tea Party played a crucial role in galvanizing the colonial opposition to British rule, setting the stage for the American Revolutionary War and the eventual independence of the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: I read this background article the other day: Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force. I am facing a new situation today: John wanted to invent a machine. To that end, he devised an experiment in which he used three components, comp A, comp B, and comp C. Comp A was a machine that applied force over a shorter distance. Comp B was also a machine, but it applied force over a longer distance. Comp C was not a machine. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would comp A increase or not increase the force applied compared to comp B? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article about machines, we can infer that comp A and comp B are designed to make work easier in different ways. Considering the principles behind the function of these machines, we can provide a well-informed answer to the question of whether comp A would increase or not increase the force applied compared to comp B. As mentioned, machines can make work easier through the increase of the force applied, the increase of distance over which the force is applied, or the change of direction in which the force is applied. It's important to note that machines do not increase the total amount of work done, but rather modify how the work is conducted. This means that if a machine increases one aspect (force or distance), the other aspect must be decreased in order to maintain the same total amount of work. Applying this knowledge to the situation at hand, we can analyze the functions of comp A and comp B. Comp A is a machine that applies force over a shorter distance. In accordance with the principle that when the distance is decreased, the force must be increased, comp A must therefore increase the force applied to make up for the reduced distance. On the other hand, comp B is a machine that applies force over a longer distance. In order to maintain the same total amount of work while increasing the distance, the force applied must be reduced. Consequently, comp B would apply less force than comp A. In conclusion, comp A would indeed increase the force applied compared to comp B. This is due to the nature of both machines in terms of their functions related to force and distance. Understanding the principles that govern the functioning of machines allows us to accurately evaluate the capabilities of comp A and comp B in this situation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer a question about this article: Due to the legitimate role that referees play in wrestling of serving as liaison between the bookers backstage and the wrestlers in the ring (the role of being a final arbitrator is merely kayfabe), the referee is present, even in matches that do not at first glance appear to require a referee (such as a ladder match, as it is no holds barred, and the criteria for victory could theoretically be assessed from afar). Although their actions are also frequently scripted for dramatic effect, referees are subject to certain general rules and requirements in order to maintain the theatrical appearance of unbiased authority. The most basic rule is that an action must be seen by a referee to be declared for a fall or disqualification. This allows for heel characters to gain a scripted advantage by distracting or disabling the referee in order to perform some ostensibly illegal maneuver on their opponent. Most referees are unnamed and essentially anonymous, though the WWE has let their officials reveal their names.

Now, a new smart phone application (app) can help him figure out what colors he's using and how the picture looks to most everyone else. The DanKam app, available for iPhone and Android for 2.99, is an application that turns the vague colors that one percent of the population with color-blindness sees into the \\"true\\" colors as everyone else sees them. In America, an estimated 32 million color-blind Americans--95% are males--can soon have their life improved. \\"DanKam takes the stream of data coming in through the phone's camera and changes the colors slightly so they fall within the range that people who are color-blind see,\\"developer Dan Kaminsky told CNET. He came up with the idea after watching the 2009 film Star Trek with a color-blind friend. It was then that he got to know more about colorblindness like its varying types and degrees. A vast majority, for instance, have trouble seeing red or green due to a genetic defect . Blue-yellow colorblindness, however, is rarer and develops later in life because of aging, illness or head injuries, etc. He started experimenting with one of the most common representations of points in the RGB color model. What the DanKam app attempts to do is to clean up the color space of the image or video signal so that colors can be _ to those suffering from viewing problems. \\"You can adjust the app to fit your needs. There is a range and not everyone who is color-blind sees things the same.\\" Says Kaminsky.

It would not directly affect any of the steps involved in the process of breathing and oxygen exchange. To understand the indirect impact, we need to consider the broader effects of reduced rainfall on the environment. When there is less rain, it may lead to a decrease in the growth and abundance of plants and trees. This reduced plant life may in turn affect the amount of oxygen produced through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose. Oxygen is released as a byproduct, which is essential for supporting life on Earth. As a result of less rain causing a decline in plant life, the amount of oxygen available in the atmosphere may decrease. This lower atmospheric oxygen concentration might make it more difficult for our lungs to extract sufficient amounts of oxygen from the air we breathe. Consequently, the amount of oxygen that can go into the bloodstream could potentially be reduced due to this indirect environmental effect. Hence, the supposed perturbation in this case is indirectly impacting a step of the process, specifically the availability of oxygen in the atmosphere, which could then potentially affect the amount of oxygen entering the bloodstream.

Recommendation: Congressional oversight for intelligence-and counterterrorism-is now dysfunctional. Congress should address this problem. We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this. Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security.

Summarize this article: SAN FRANCISCO (CBS 5) — Days before a San Francisco man was arrested on a US Airways flight over his saggy pants, the same airline allowed a man showing much more skin to fly. Jill Tarlow, who was on the June 9th flight from Fort Lauderdale to Phoenix, told CBS 5 the man wore a woman’s bathing suit, thigh high stockings and high heels. “I just kept thinking to myself. What if I was wearing that outfit?” Tarlow said. “Would US Airways not ask me to cover up? If a woman was in a stripper outfit they’d allow her to just board?” According to Tarlow, many passengers complained about the man’s attire to the gate staff. She telephoned US Airways after the plane landed in Phoenix. Tarlow said an airline spokesperson told her “…As long as he’s not harassing anyone or exposing himself, then we’re fine with it.” Six days later, Deshon Marman of San Francisco was removed from another US Airways flight after he allegedly refused to pull up his sagging pants. Upon hearing the news of Marman’s arrest, Tarlow then turned over the photos of the scantily clad man to Marman’s attorney Joe O’Sullivan. “I think the airline maybe has a market strategy toward drag queens and against young African Americans,” O’Sullivan told CBS 5. O’Sullivan is adamant that since the airline has no explicit dress code and allowed the scantily clad passenger to board suggest it’s not about clothing, but race. “It was racial because he is black. And he had dreadlocks and they jammed him,” O’Sullivan said. “Why would they have stopped him? No passenger complained about him. No police report says he showed he showed any flesh. YouTube and everything else is demonstrable. He was reverent, respectful. I almost felt it was obnoxious he said ‘Sir’ so many times.” A US Airways spokesperson told CBS 5 by phone Tuesday, as long as someone is not showing parts of their anatomy, they are permitted to fly.

Man flies US Airways in women's underwear (Photo) Man flies US Airways in women's underwear (Photo) Six days before a college football player was arrested at San Francisco International Airport in a dispute that began when a US Airways employee asked him to pull up his sagging pants, a man who was wearing little but women's undergarments was allowed to fly the airline, a US Airways spokeswoman conceded Tuesday. A photo of the scantily clad man was provided to The Chronicle by Jill Tarlow, a passenger on the June 9 flight from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to Phoenix. Tarlow said other passengers had complained to airline workers before the plane boarded, but that employees had ignored those complaints. Jill Tarlow US Airways spokeswoman Valerie Wunder confirmed she'd received the photo before last week's incident in San Francisco and had spoken to Tarlow, but said employees had been correct not to ask the man to cover himself. \\"We don't have a dress code policy,\\" Wunder said. \\"Obviously, if their private parts are exposed, that's not appropriate. ... So if they're not exposing their private parts, they're allowed to fly.\\" So, does that mean Deshon Marman, the University of New Mexico player yanked from an Albuquerque-bound flight June 15 at SFO, was displaying his private parts when his pajama pants sagged to mid-thigh level? Wunder declined to comment on the incident directly. Police have said only that Marman's boxer shorts were exposed, and his attorney said surveillance video would prove Marman's skin had not been visible. Police arrested Marman, 20, who grew up in San Francisco, after he allegedly refused an US Airways employee's request to pull up his pants to keep his underwear from showing. Marman's later refusal to comply with the pilot's orders to get up from his seat led to his arrest on suspicion of trespassing, battery and resisting arrest, police said. The San Mateo County district attorney has not determined whether he will charge Marman. Marman's attorney, Joe O'Sullivan, said his client had been stereotyped by US Airways as a thug, and that the airline was guilty of racial discrimination for asking Marman to adjust his clothes. Marman is African American. \\"It just shows the hypocrisy involved,\\" O'Sullivan said after he viewed the photo of the cross-dressing passenger. \\"They let a drag queen board a flight and welcomed him with open arms. Employees didn't ask him to cover up. He didn't have to talk to the pilot. They didn't try to remove him from the plane -- and many people would find his attire repugnant.\\" O'Sullivan added, \\"A white man is allowed to fly in underwear without question, but my client was asked to pull up his pajama pants because they hung below his waist.\\" Tarlow, 40, who was returning home to Phoenix after helping her mother move, said she had been shocked when she noticed the older man in blue underwear and black stockings standing in the Fort Lauderdale terminal. Tarlow said the man had obliged when she asked to take his photo. \\"No one would believe me if I didn't take his picture,\\" Tarlow said. \\"It was unbelievable. ... And he loved it. He posed for me.\\" Wunder reiterated the airline's stance that Marman had not been removed from the US Airways flight last week because of his clothing, but because he had failed to comply with an employee's request. \\"The root of the matter is, if you don't comply with the captain's requests,\\" Wunder said, \\"the captain has the right to handle the issue because it's one of safety.\\" Posted By: Justin Berton (Email, Twitter) | |||||","completion":"A man was allowed on a US Airways flight wearing a woman's bathing suit, stockings, and high heels, even though many passengers complained about his outfit.

With a 1-star rating, I can't emphasize enough how disappointing and frustrating this app is. Firstly, the app consumes a considerable amount of battery life and slows down my phone's performance significantly. Even simple tasks take much longer to perform, making the use of my device a chore rather than an enjoyable experience. Moreover, the app's interface is confusing and counterintuitive. There's a steep learning curve just to navigate through the basic features, and the user manual is hardly helpful. It's clear that little thought was given to usability and user experience design during the app's development. Additionally, I've encountered numerous bugs and crashes that have caused my phone to freeze or restart unexpectedly. It's alarming to see how unstable the app is, given that it's supposed to improve accessibility and ease of use for users with disabilities. Lastly, customer support is virtually non-existent. I tried reaching out to the developers for assistance multiple times, only to be met with silence or unhelpful generic responses. It's disheartening to see that little effort is put into providing proper support for an app designed to make users' lives easier. All in all, I deeply regret downloading com.google.android.marvin.talkback, and I strongly advise others to avoid this app at all costs.

Our intrepid cyclist gets a frosty reception in Georgia – and plumbs new depths with a roadside chicken impersonation. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is a collection of interrelated stories with a central theme focused around Douglas Whitehead, an intrepid cyclist who embarks on challenging journeys and experiences different events as he navigates through various locations, particularly rural Azerbaijan and Georgia. The primary purpose of these stories is to share the unique encounters and challenges faced by the cyclist during his adventures, while highlighting the distinct cultures and landscapes he encounters. The article begins with a story set in rural Azerbaijan, where Douglas feels isolated and worries that he may have to fight for his own safety. This sets the tone of unpredictability and potential danger that comes with undertaking such ventures into unfamiliar territories. The second story centers around an instance where Douglas's passport goes missing after a motel manager in an unspecified location mysteriously disappears. This adds an element of suspense and complication to his journey, as losing important documents like a passport can significantly impact one's ability to travel between countries. In the third and fourth stories, the focus is shifted towards Douglas's time in Georgia, where he faces a series of trials and tribulations that severely test his willpower to continue his cycling journey. At some point, he even debates whether quitting is the best option. This highlights the struggles and internal battles that one might face when undertaking long and arduous expeditions, emphasizing the sheer mental and physical toughness required to persevere. The fifth story presents a lighter moment by posing a question about roller coasters, offering readers a brief respite from the otherwise intense experiences shared by the cyclist. It also allows the audience to engage with the content on a more interactive level, making it more relatable and personal. Lastly, the sixth story brings readers back to Douglas's journey in Georgia, where he receives an unwelcoming reception from the local community and resorts to an improvised roadside chicken impersonation to break the ice. This illustrates the often unorthodox methods travelers might use to connect with others and adjust to new environments while reminding readers that humor can be a powerful tool even in the most unusual circumstances. In conclusion, the article presents the various experiences of the cyclist, Douglas Whitehead, as he encounters unique challenges, navigates through unfamiliar regions, and engages with different cultures. These stories serve to inspire, entertain, and possibly educate readers about the journey and spirit of adventure, as well as the importance of determination and resourcefulness on such endeavors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To answer the question, we first need to clarify that there are multiple stages in the journey to the Stanley Cup, including the regular season, division playoffs, conference playoffs, and finally, the Stanley Cup Finals. While the number of series a team must win to reach the Stanley Cup Finals has varied throughout history, the expansion of the National Hockey League (NHL) has shaped the modern playoff format. Since the 2013–14 season, the current NHL playoff structure consists of 16 teams, with the top three teams from each of the four divisions, plus two wild card teams from each conference. The playoffs consist of four rounds, with each round being a best-of-seven series. Teams must win three series before they reach the final round, where they'll compete for the Stanley Cup.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A noted cinematic phenomenon of the late eighties and early nineties was the number of Oscars which went to actors playing characters who were either physically or mentally handicapped. The first was Marlee Matlin's award for \\"Children of a Lesser God\\" in 1986, and the next ten years were to see another \\"Best Actress\\" award (Holly Hunter for \\"The Piano\\" in 1994) and no fewer than five \\"Best Actor\\" awards (Dustin Hoffman in 1988 for \\"Rain Man\\", Daniel Day-Lewis in 1989 for \\"My Left Foot\\", Al Pacino in 1992 for \\"Scent of a Woman\\", Tom Hanks in 1994 for \\"Forrest Gump\\" and Geoffrey Rush in 1996 for \\"Shine\\") for portrayals of the disabled. Matlin, who played a deaf woman, is herself deaf, but all the others are able-bodied. This phenomenon aroused some adverse comment at the time, with suggestions being made that these awards were given more for political correctness than for the quality of the acting. When Jodie Foster failed to win \\"Best Actress\\" for \\"Nell\\" in 1994 some people saw this as evidence of a backlash against this sort of portrayal. My view, however, is that the majority of these awards were well deserved. I thought the 1992 award should have gone to either Clint Eastwood or Robert Downey rather than Pacino, but apart from that the only one with which I disagreed would have been Hanks', and that was because I preferred Nigel Hawthorne's performance in \\"The Madness of King George\\". In that film, of course, Hawthorne played a character who was mentally ill. \\"My Left Foot\\" was based upon the autobiography of the Irish writer and painter Christy Brown. Brown was born in 1931, one of the thirteen children of a working-class Dublin family. He was born with cerebral palsy and was at first wrongly thought to be mentally handicapped as well. He was for a long time incapable of deliberate movement or speech, but eventually discovered that he could control the movements of one part of his body, his left foot (hence the title). He learned to write and draw by holding a piece of chalk between his toes, and went on to become a painter and a published novelist and poet. Life in working-class Dublin in the thirties and forties could be hard, and the city Jim Sheridan (himself a Dubliner) shows us here is in many ways a grim, grey, cheerless place, very different from our normal idea of the \\"Emerald Isle\\". (Sheridan and Day-Lewis were later to collaborate on another film with an Irish theme, \\"In the Name of the Father\\"). Against this, however, must be set the cheerfulness and spirit of its people, especially the Brown family. Much of Christy's success was due to the support he received from his parents, who refused to allow him to be institutionalised and always believed in the intelligence hidden beneath a crippled exterior, and from his siblings. We see how his brothers used to wheel him round in a specially-made cart and how they helped their bricklayer father to build Christy a room of his own in their back yard. The film could easily have slid into sentimentality and ended up as just another heart-warming \\"triumph over adversity\\" movie. That it does not is due to a number of factors, principally the magnificent acting. In the course of his career, Day-Lewis has given a number of fine performances, but this, together with the recent \\"There Will Be Blood\\", is his best. He is never less than 100% convincing as Christie; his tortured, jerky movements and strained attempts at speech persuade us that we really are watching a disabled person, even though, intellectually, we are well aware that Day-Lewis is able-bodied. The other performances which stand out are from Fiona Shaw as his mentor Dr Eileen Cole, from Hugh O'Conor as the young Christy and from Brenda Fricker as Christy's mother (which won her the \\"Best Supporting Actress\\" award). The other reason why the film escapes sentimentality is that it does not try to sentimentalise its main character. Christy Brown had a difficult life, but he could also be difficult to live with, and the film gives us a \\"warts and all\\" portrait. He was a heavy drinker, given to foul language and prone to outbursts of rage. He could also be selfish and manipulative of those around him, and the film shows us all these aspects of his character. Of course, it also shows us the positive aspects- his courage, his determination and his wicked sense of humour. Day-Lewis's acting is not just physically convincing, in that it persuades us to believe in his character's disability, but also emotionally and intellectually convincing, in that it brings out all these different facets of Christy's character. His Oscar was won in the teeth of some very strong opposition from the likes of Robin Williams and Kenneth Branagh, but it was well deserved. 8/10 How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"I'd say the sentiment of this review is mostly positive. The reviewer praises many of the performances, including that of Daniel Day-Lewis, and feels that most of these roles involving characters with disabilities were worthy of the awards they received. They do make some criticism, for example believing that a few awards should have gone to other actors, but overall they seem to appreciate the films and performances.
