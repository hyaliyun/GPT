Bake for 30 minutes.","completion":"To evaluate if the given sentence is syntactically and semantically acceptable, let's analyze it step by step. Step 1: Identify the sentence structure The sentence structure of \\"Bake for 30 minutes\\" is an imperative sentence, which means it is a command or instruction. Step 2: Evaluate the syntax Syntax deals with the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences. Here, the verb \\"Bake\\" is followed by the prepositional phrase \\"for 30 minutes.\\" The phrase \\"for 30 minutes\\" is an adverbial phrase expressing the duration of the action. The sentence structure is clear and well-formed. Step 3: Evaluate the semantics Semantics is the study of meaning in language. To determine if the sentence is semantically acceptable, the sentence should convey an intelligible message. In this case, the sentence instructs someone to bake something for a duration of 30 minutes. The meaning is clear and understandable.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: There are many different types of tractors on the market with a wide variety of applications and associated accessories. To be sure you properly maintain your specific make and model of tractor, you should read through the manual that came with it. Many tractors require specific types of lubricants and hydraulic fluids that you can identify in the manual. Using the wrong kind could damage your tractor. If you do not have a manual for your tractor, you may be able to find the information on the manufacturer's website. Before you get started with any planned maintenance on your tractor, give the whole thing a good once over to see if anything looks overly worn, broken, or dirty. Many newer model tractors even have plastic windows on fluid reservoirs to check things like hydraulic fluid levels. Give your tractor a visual inspection before and after each use. Make note of any issues you identify to make sure you address them before the next time you use the tractor. Use a tire pressure gauge on each tire and compare it to the tire’s pressure rating written on the sidewall. Tractor tires can last years, but operating a tractor with under-inflated tires can ruin the sidewall and cause the tires to wear faster than they should. Under-inflated tires will also cause the tractor to burn more fuel in normal operations. You may want to adjust tire pressure for different types of jobs. For instance, if you plan on driving your tractor on the road, you might want to add a few more pounds of air. Reducing tire pressure on slick surfaces like mud can help increase traction. Tires lose pressure more quickly when temperatures change from cold to hot, so you may want to check your tire pressure more frequently in the spring and fall. Some tractors may not be equipped with any lights at all, while others could have an extensive lighting system that includes turn signals and interior lighting. Check each of the lights after each use of the tractor so you can address any electrical issues as they arise. If a light fails to work, it may be a blown out bulb or fuse that needs to be replaced. If neither of those solve the problem, your tractor may need to be serviced by a technician. Check your owner’s manual to find the correct type of bulb or fuse needed to fix a bad light. Just like in a car, a tractor’s engine relies on a number of rubber hoses and usually at least one belt. Look all of the rubber components over for signs of wear or damage. Excessively worn rubber components should all be replaced. Look for glazing on the sides and bottom of any belts that may indicate that it’s been slipping. Any rubber that has cracked should be replaced. Depending on the environment you use your tractor in, you may need to change your air filter more or less frequently. Locate the air filter using the tractor’s user manual, then visually inspect it. If it’s really dirty, it should be replaced. There’s no real rule of thumb with air filters; they should just be replaced as they appear dirty. You should check your air filter after 8 hours of use or so. You need specialized tools to check your tractor’s hydraulic system. If you have the correct coupler fitting and a pressure gauge, you can connect it to any of the black ports on the hydraulic system while it’s running, and compare that figure to the correct specifications outlined in the manual. If you don’t have the correct tools, it’s recommended that you have your hydraulic system serviced by a professional after every 500 hours of use. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to properly maintain different types of tractors.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which friend was less likely to have a body mass index 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater? Two friends met after 20 years and compared diets. Paul ate junk food daily and weighed 300 lbs and was 5'8'' in height. Mike was vegan and stayed healthy and thin. Hint: Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. A:","completion":"Mike was less likely to have a body mass index of 30.0 kg/m2 or greater. The paragraph mentions that Paul ate junk food daily and weighed 300 lbs, while Mike was vegan and stayed healthy and thin. Considering that eating excessive food (especially junk food: high in calories and fats) regularly leads to obesity (indicated by a body mass index of 30.0 kg/m2 or greater), Paul is more likely to have a greater body mass index. Also, the fact that Mike is described as thin and healthy (typically associated with a balanced diet) suggests that he is less likely to have a high body mass index indicating obesity. So based on the information provided, Mike is less likely to be obese, hence less likely to have a body mass index 30.0 kg/m2 or greater."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Shad are also valued as a sport fish that exhibit complex and little-understood feeding behavior while spawning. Unlike salmon, shad retain the ability to digest and assimilate food during the anadromous migration. Like other fish, their feeding instinct can be triggered by a variety of factors such as turbidity and water temperature. Anglers use both spinning and fly fishing tackle to pursue shad. Spin fisherman use a shad dartjig or a flutter spoon. Some anglers use a downrigger to place the artificial lure at the desired depth and location. This is usually in the channel, or deepest part of the river. Migrating shad tend to occupy the lower portion of the water column which makes this the typical depth of choice for fishing. In the North, April through June is when shad spawn in coastal rivers and estuaries once water temperatures have reached 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 °C). Fishing conditions typically improve as water temperatures warm and flow decreases. Jeff loves to go shad fishing. He prefers using fly fishing tackle and is planning a fishing trip up North with his buddies. They decided to take their trip in May when everyone can get off work over the Memorial Day holiday. Sam enjoys shad fishing as well, but the only time he and his buddies are able to take off work is during their slow season in March. Who will have worse fishing conditions and likely catch less shad on their fishing trip, Jeff or Sam? A:","completion":"To determine who will have worse fishing conditions and likely catch less shad on their fishing trip, we need to compare the factors mentioned in the text that affect shad feeding behavior and the timing of Jeff's and Sam's trips. 1.

Jeff is planning his trip in May, which falls within the shad spawning season. Sam, however, is planning his trip in March, which is before the prime shad spawning season. 2. Water temperature: Optimal fishing conditions reportedly occur as water temperatures warm. Jeff's trip in May will likely experience warmer water temperatures than Sam's trip in March. 3. Water flow: Fishing conditions typically improve as water flow decreases. Without knowing the specific water flow conditions during their respective trips, we cannot comment on this factor. Based on the available information, Sam will have worse fishing conditions and likely catch less shad on his fishing trip because his trip is outside the optimal shad spawning season and likely to experience colder water temperatures than Jeff's."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Rivers play an essential role in the process of weathering and erosion of rocks, which ultimately contributes to the formation of soil. When a river flows over rocks, it erodes the rocks through various mechanical and chemical processes. The mechanical processes include abrasion, where the force of the water and sediments carried by the river scrape away at the rock surfaces, causing them to break down. The chemical processes include dissolution, where certain minerals within the rocks are dissolved by the water and absorbed into the river. Over time, these processes gradually wear down the rocks into smaller and smaller pieces, producing sediments such as sand, silt, and clay particles. These sediments are then transported by the river and deposited downstream along the riverbank, floodplains, or at the mouth of the river, forming new landforms such as deltas and alluvial fans. As organic matter from plants and decomposed organisms mixes with these sediments, they eventually form soil layers that support plant growth and provide habitats for various living organisms. In summary, rivers erode rocks and contribute to the formation of soil by breaking down rocks through mechanical and chemical processes and depositing the resulting sediments downstream."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I never really thought anything of it as instructors would often pull guys aside for reviews, specific instructions or taskings. I don’t know how much time passed but the candidate walked back in. He gathered his things and left the room. Guys asked if everything was cool but he didn’t say a word. The instructor came in and sat on the desk at the front of the room. We asked if everything was alright, and he told us that the day prior, the The candidate’s wife had gone into labor however there were complications with the baby but the complications were unknown. He was reporting to the commander to let him know whether he wanted to stay in training or leave because the military does not consider a spouse’s pregnancy to be an emergency even though the complication should be. If he were to leave he would have to drop from the TACP pipeline with a possibility of either starting it over from the beginning of quitting all together.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Major General says he blames UK politicians for the 'complete mess' in Iraq. Believes the 2003 invasion of the country was a 'political cock-up' Says the people of Iraq are not better off since the war in the country. Warns against UK forces going back into the country again. Major General led Royal Marines during the 1982 Falklands War.","completion":"Title: \\"Major General Holds UK Politicians Accountable for Iraq's 'Complete Mess'\\" Major General, who led the Royal Marines during the 1982 Falklands War, delivered a harsh criticism of UK politicians regarding the ongoing Iraq crisis. In a recent statement, the veteran military figure openly blamed British political actions for the 'complete mess' in the Middle Eastern country, creating quite a stir in political and military circles alike. The Major General’s powerful assessment comes in the wake of continuing turmoil in Iraq; years of violence and instability that he attributes directly to the 2003 invasion of Iraq under the initiative of the US-UK alliance. He termed the fateful expedition as a 'political cock-up,' suggesting that it was a grave error instigated by political, rather than strategic, considerations. The Major General questioned the effectiveness of the war in improving the quality of life for the people of Iraq. He constructed a fairly damning critique of the UK government's actions, arguing that the Iraqi citizens are not better off since the intervention. The war, which was supposed to bestow democracy and stabilize the region, has - in his view - yielded a legacy of unrest and sectarian violence, further exacerbating the citizens' plight. Continuing his critique of British foreign policy, the Major General warned against the possibility of UK forces re-engaging military action in Iraq. Reflecting on the repercussions of the past intervention, and the warfare's rather disastrous consequences, he strongly discourages further involvement. His admonition to his country is clear: there should be no re-entry of UK troops into Iraq. The Major General, famed for his leadership of the Royal Marines in the 1982 Falklands War, brings a wealth of battlefield experience and understanding to his critique. His leadership during the Falklands conflict, which saw the UK effectively repel Argentine forces from the south Atlantic islands, earned him considerable respect within military and political circles. Thus, his scathing review of the Iraq intervention carries considerable weight. His comments have sparked a much-needed conversation in both defence and political corridors in the UK. Civilian and military leaders alike are now evaluating the UK's past actions in Iraq and contemplating future strategies, his cautionary words resonating deeply. In conclusion, the Major General's critique is indicative of wider frustration within military circles over perceived political decisions that have had significant strategic implications. His frank blame on the UK politicians for the missteps in Iraq voices a strong discontent with how foreign interference - however well-intentioned - can result in further despair, destabilization, and long-term suffering. This stark assessment serves as a reminder that the mission and consequences of intervention should always be thought through thoroughly to avoid further 'political cock-ups.' Amidst global geopolitical complexities, the Major General's candid observations underscore the imperative need to balance political objectives with ground realities. His words thus ring as a cautionary bell, alerting leaders about potential pitfalls of decisions before they turn into historical regrets."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Danger: A study found pregnant women who take antibiotics could be tampering with their child's immune system. Pregnant women who take antibiotics could be putting their unborn children at risk of disease. Researchers have found that drugs used to beat infections can interfere with a baby’s immune system. By contrast mothers can help to kick-start a child’s ability to avoid illness by passing on certain germs. A study by the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in the US showed that bacteria in the gut play a crucial role in fostering the rapid production of infection-fighting white blood cells. They found that, as with humans, mice have a surge of white blood cells around birth, but this response is reduced when their mothers are exposed to antibiotics. This left the creatures much more vulnerable to deadly E. coli infections, especially when they were born prematurely. The researchers showed that signalling mechanisms within the gut’s vast colony of micro-organisms regulate the production of white blood cells in baby mice. Exposing both the mothers and babies to antibiotics reduced the diversity of gut bacteria, many of which are beneficial, and also impaired resistance to infection in the newborn. Critically ill babies are often treated with antibiotics as a precaution, without proof of infection. The study appeared in the journal Nature Medicine. Hitesh Deshmukh, first author of the study, said: 'At birth, newborns move from a largely sterile environment to one full of microorganisms. 'Animals and humans adapt to this new situation by ramping up the production of granulocytes within the first days of life.' Doctors advised unborn babies benefit from bacteria which builds up their strength, rather than medication. A similar procedure in humans, called a fecal transplant, has recently been successful in treating severe bacterial infection in adults. However, such transplants have not been performed in newborns, and the scientists warn that a lot more research is needed before they can determine what implications these animal results may have in guiding human treatment. Despite the findings, babies will continue to be treated with antibiotics as it is very difficult to determine whether newborns are infected with bacteria. But the research urged clinicians to strive to decrease antibiotic use as a long-term goal. Highlights:","completion":"1. Pregnant women taking antibiotics might affect their baby's immune system. 2.

(CNN) -- All eyes will be on Lionel Messi and Arjen Robben when Argentina face the Netherlands in the World Cup semifinal in Sao Paulo to discover who will meet Germany in the final.

Article: Tiny monitoring devices have become an increasingly common way for scientists to study elusive animals that are difficult to track on a day-to-day basis. However, now it seems that smart. seals have caught on to the trick and are using it to their advantage to catch fish! To find out if that is true, a team of researchers from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland selected a group often young grey seals that had neither encountered the ocean nor been exposed to any kind of acoustic tags. The researchers then placed the seals one at a time, inside a pool that contained 20 foraging boxes, only two of which housed fish -- one with tags and the other without. Each seal was allowed to explore the boxes twenty separate times. In order to ensure that mammal was not depending on its memory, the fish were moved to different boxes each time. At first, there was no difference in the amount of time it took the seals to discover the tagged and untagged fish. However, after they had been in the pool a few times, they started locating the tagged fish much faster. To confirm that this indeed was the case, there searchers conducted a second experiment using two boxes -- one with pieces of fish and the other with just acoustic tags. Sure enough, the seals were all attracted to the one that was sending out signals. While this experiment involved only seals, the researchers believe that other marine mammals may also be using the information to catch prey. Sadly, predators like sharks that have been tagged by scientists may be negatively affected, as pings they emit could warn their prey of their presence. Besides potentially messing up nature's food chain, the \\"dinner bell\\" effect of the acoustic tags could also mean that the conclusions reached by previous fish studies may not be correct. Now that the secret is out, scientists will have to come up with another way to conduct their studies -- one that is not detectable by the crafty marine animals. Question: The researchers seem to believe that sharks tagged by scientists _ . - may benefit from the tags - may attract seals by mistake - may find it hard to find prey - may be annoyed by the emitted pings Answer:","completion":"The researchers seem to believe that sharks tagged by scientists may find it hard to find prey."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend studied less about female fish increasing the chances of fertilization?","completion":"Based on the given paragraph, it can be concluded that Dan studied fish reproduction, while Fred focused on bird reproduction. Since the paragraph provides information about fish reproduction and how female fish increase the chances of fertilization, it can be inferred that Dan was the one who studied more about female fish and their reproduction strategies. Therefore, the friend who studied less about female fish increasing the chances of fertilization is Fred.

Hyeon-su leaves and talks to her mother Yoon-hee, a successful and talented plastic surgeon. The two have a good mother-daughter relationship. Meanwhile, Su-kyoung is panicking alone in the operating room. She sees a frightening image of a girl in a dark blue dress and long dark hair. Yoon-hee begins the surgery, telling Su-kyoung that it is time to become pretty. A day later, on Hyeon-su's birthday, she argues with her mother about where to have the party and finally decides to do it in her home. Hyeon-su is later in her art class, making a sculpture of Su-kyoung's face. Many girls in the class comment saying that Su-kyoung looks much more attractive than she did before.

Kamiya was formerly employed by Capcom and Clover Studio, and founded PlatinumGames in 2006, along with other former Capcom staff. Sentence: Hideki Kamiya was born more than 20075 days ago. Select from the following. A). Yes B). It's impossible to say C). No","completion":"Okay, let's figure this out together! Hideki Kamiya was born on December 19, 1970. To find out if he was born more than 20,075 days ago, we need to count the days between his birthday and now. As of September 29, 2022, that would make Hideki Kamiya 51 years, 9 months, and 10 days old. A year has 365 days, and in 51 years, there would be 51 multiplied by 365, which is 18615 days. Then, there are 9 months. Let's count the days in these months: January has 31 days, February usually has 28 days (but every 4 years has 29 for leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, July has 31 days, August has 31 days, and September has about 29 days (since we're reaching the end of the month). Adding up the days in these months, we have 31+28+31+30+31+30+31+31+29 = 272 days. But we also need to add days for leap years. From 1970 to 2022, we have 13 leap years, so that adds 13 more days. Now, let's count the 10 days of the current month, which is September. So far, we've counted 18615 (days from years) + 272 (days from months) + 13 (days from leap years) + 10 (days of the current month) = 18,910 days. Now, let's compare this to 20,075 days in the sentence: 18,910 days < 20,075 days Since 18,910 is less than 20,075, we can say that Hideki Kamiya was born less than 20,075 days ago.

Given those answer options, answer the question: If I tell you that Igneous intrusion creates valuable products, and ask you the question \\"what does igneous intrusion create?\\", is the correct answer \\"adding heat\\"? A:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"adding heat.\\" Instead, the correct answer is that igneous intrusion creates valuable geological products, often in the form of intrusive igneous rocks and economically important minerals. An igneous intrusion occurs when molten rock, known as magma, rises up from the mantle or lower crust and invades pre-existing rock layers in the Earth's crust. This process can lead to the formation of valuable geological products such as intrusive igneous rocks and mineral deposits. Intrusive igneous rocks, like granite and diorite, form as the magma cools and crystallizes slowly beneath the Earth's surface, resulting in coarse-grained rock textures. These rocks can be quarried for construction and decorative purposes. Additionally, igneous intrusions can lead to the formation of mineral deposits. As magma solidifies, it can concentrate certain elements to form rich deposits of valuable minerals, such as copper, gold, and platinum. These are often found near or within the intrusive rocks and are essential for many industrial and manufacturing applications. Overall, while adding heat is a factor in the process of igneous intrusion, it is not the correct answer to the question \\"what does igneous intrusion create?\\" Instead, the answer should focus on the geological products generated by the intrusion, such as intrusive igneous rocks and economically important minerals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are the hottest or the coldest ): Rachel was looking into the night sky. The darkest star is most likely: the hottest or the coldest? Answer:","completion":"The darkest star is most likely the coldest. To understand why, let's examine the relationship between a star's temperature and its brightness. Main sequence stars can be classified based on their temperature, which in turn affects their color and brightness. The temperature of a star dictates the color it emits, following the principle of blackbody radiation. The colors of main sequence stars follow a progression from the hottest to the coldest, which can be remembered by the mnemonic \\"Oh Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me!\\" This corresponds to the stellar classes O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, with O-class stars being the hottest and M-class stars being the coldest. The temperature of O-class stars can exceed 30,000 Kelvin, whereas M-class stars may have temperatures as low as 2,400 Kelvin. Now, considering the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that the total energy emitted by a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature, we can infer that hotter stars emit more energy (or are brighter) compared to colder stars. To put it simply, a star's brightness increases as its temperature increases. Given the passage's statement that \\"the hotter a main sequence star is, the brighter it is,\\" we can conclude that the darkest star (i.e., the least bright) observed by Rachel in the night sky would most likely be the coldest star among the visible stars."},{"prompt":"Combine facts and answer this: Phil Joanou and Rick Ray, are of which nationality?

Backers of Legal Aid services for the poor are pushing a measure that would increase court filing fees in Kentucky to raise money for the program, which faces steep funding cuts. The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would double the portion of the fee that goes to Legal Aid -- in district court to 10 from 5 and in circuit court to 20 from 10. Kentucky's current fee for filing a case in district court is 50.50, and in circuit court 108. The increase still would leave Kentucky's filing fee costs below those of surrounding states and would raise about 1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what Legal Aid is losing from federal and other sources, said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, a state poverty law resource center in Lexington. Geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential source of money for the program, which is being forced to lay off workers and close offices around the state. Geveden said he's concerned because federal funding hasn't increased in recent years, and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money. ''If you don't come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away,'' he said. Hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors, and Legal Aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative session. Hamon said she knows fee increases aren't popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis Legal Aid is facing. ''A lot of poor people are not going to get served,'' she said. The measure has the endorsement of the Kentucky Bar Association. The association's board of governors voted unanimously last month to back the bill, said KBA President Stephen Catron, a Bowling Green lawyer. Legal Aid ''has been a godsend to a great number of people in this state,'' Catron said. ''We simply must find a way to provide those services to the public.'' Larry York, executive director of Appalachian Regional Defense Fund, which provides Legal Aid services in 37 Eastern Kentucky counties and is a KBA board member, said he hopes the measure is approved. ''It would really offset the current cuts,'' he said. After reading the above, is \\"Texas\\" the correct answer to the question \\"The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the equation -162*f = 3*f - 1320 for f, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the 'f' terms on one side of the equation. To do this, we add 162*f to both sides of the equation: -162*f + 162*f = 3*f - 1320 + 162*f This simplifies to: 0 = 165*f - 1320 Step 2: Isolate the 'f' term. Now, we need to isolate the 'f' term by adding 1320 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 1320 = 165*f - 1320 + 1320 This simplifies to: 1320 = 165*f Step 3: Solve for 'f'. To find the value of 'f', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 165: 1320 / 165 = 165*f / 165 This simplifies to: 8 = f The solution to the equation -162*f = 3*f - 1320 is f = 8."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Meredith is not pregnant, but still wants to go to see if her diet is acceptable. Which woman's diet will most likely include more red meat? A:","completion":"A: It is likely that Phyllis, the pregnant woman, would be recommended to include more red meat in her diet. This is because, during pregnancy, women have increased nutritional requirements, particularly for essential nutrients such as iron, protein, and certain vitamins like vitamin B12. Red meat is a rich source of iron, protein, and vitamin B12, and therefore may be suggested in Phyllis' diet to support her pregnancy. On the other hand, Meredith's diet may still include red meat, but as she is not pregnant, her nutritional needs are different and may not necessarily require an increase in red meat consumption.

John Callen, the New Zealand actor portraying the character Oin, has revealed that he and other fellow New Zealand actors will not be attending the London premiere. According to Callen, Warner Bros has cited budgetary constraints as the reason for this exclusion, raising eyebrows in the movie industry. The first two installments of the Hobbit series reeled in a mammoth 1 billion and 958 million respectively, leading many to question the entertainment giant's justifications for this decision. Critics have pointed out that it seems unusual for an event of such magnitude to face budget restrictions, especially given the financial success of the previous movies. Fans of the popular series have voiced their disappointment and anger loud and clear. At least four online petitions have been launched, calling for Warner Bros to reverse its decision and allow the New Zealand actors to attend the London premiere. These petitions have garnered significant attention, with devoted fans slamming the studio for what they see as an unfair exclusion. In response to the mounting pressure, Warner Bros has announced that the New Zealand actors will be flown to the Los Angeles premiere, while their European counterparts will attend the London premiere. The move may appease some fans and mitigate the controversy, but for others, the damage has already been done.

Upon landing, the passenger accidentally drops a thermite charge, which destroys the helicopter and kills the pilot when he tries to retrieve it. The passenger pursues the dog, firing a rifle, until he is shot dead by Garry, the station commander. The Americans send a helicopter pilot, MacReady, and Dr. Copper to the Norwegian camp for answers, but they find only a charred ruin. Inside, they find a corpse with its throat and wrists slashed in the radio room. Outside, they discover the burned remains of a humanoid corpse with two faces, which they bring back along with some video tapes. Their biologist, Blair, performs an autopsy on the corpse, finding a normal set of human internal organs. Clark kennels the Malamute with the station's sled dogs; it soon metamorphoses and attacks them. When he hears the commotion, MacReady pulls the fire alarm, and Childs incinerates the creature. Blair performs another autopsy which leads him to believe the creature perfectly imitates other organisms. The Norwegians' records lead the Americans to a buried flying saucer that the station's geologist, Norris, hypothesizes is likely over 100,000 years old.

All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who appears to come out in support of the current vice-president via videotape? ? Mays Gilliam is the alderman for the 9th Ward in Washington, D.C.. After learning he is likely to lose his job and getting dumped by his girlfriend, Kim, Gilliam is surprisingly chosen as the party candidate for the presidency after his party's original presidential and vice-presidential nominees die in a plane crash and he is lauded as a hero for saving a woman from an explosion. Assuming the election was already lost to sitting vice-president Brian Lewis, the party decided to pick a likable but unwinnable minority candidate to improve their chances in the next presidential election. At first, Gilliam feels he will not be able to succeed as President because he would be representing the entire African-American populace, and does not want to do anything to mess it up. However, Gilliam begins to rise in the polls after his brother persuades him to speak out for what he believes. He begins to talk about issues such as welfare, money, society, etc. After Lewis runs a series of attack ads including one saying Gilliam supports cancer, Gilliam begins to fight back using what he claimed was \\"kissing\\" his opponent (taken from Bugs Bunny–Elmer Fudd cartoons). A part of this strategy includes dubbing a videotape of Osama bin Laden saying he hates America but loves Brian Lewis. This strategy gains Gilliam even more points in the polls. As voting day draws closer, Gilliam eventually learns the reason why he was chosen as the party candidate, fires some disloyal campaign operatives (although they reconciled with him afterwards), and chooses his brother as his running mate. He later has a debate with his opponent in which he manages to win the crowd over by speaking truth about the American life. Finally, Gilliam ends up winning the election and the presidency.

Concernant la politique internationale, le Groupe asiatique et la Chine accordaient une attention croissante à la coopération régionale dans le domaine de l'investissement, à la fois dans un contexte Sud-Sud et avec des pays plus développés tels que le Japon et la République de Corée. Translate to English.","completion":"Regarding international politics, the Asian Group and China have been increasingly focusing on regional cooperation in the field of investment, both in a South-South context and with more developed countries such as Japan and the Republic of Korea. In recent years, we have seen a growing emphasis on regional cooperation within the international political landscape, particularly among the Asian Group and China. This interest in collaboration extends not only to investment within the South-South context (which refers to the exchange of resources, technology, and knowledge between developing countries) but also to partnering with more developed nations such as Japan and the Republic of Korea. The growth of regional cooperation in the field of investment can be attributed to several factors, including the need for economic diversification, a desire for improved regional stability, and the potential for leveraging the unique advantages that each country offers. Economic diversification is a crucial goal for many developing countries, as it can help them reduce their reliance on a single industry or sector and minimize the risk of economic shocks. By fostering regional cooperation, countries can, for example, pool their financial resources and expertise to develop strategic investments in sectors such as infrastructure, energy, and technology. This, in turn, can lead to stronger and more sustainable regional growth and development. Another driver towards increased regional cooperation is the desire for improved stability within the region. Political and economic stability is a vital factor for attracting foreign investment. By working together on shared goals and interests, countries within the Asian Group can help to reduce fractious disputes that could threaten the stable investment environment they seek to create. Additionally, this cooperation can lead to more effective and unified responses to common challenges such as climate change, terrorism, and economic inequality. Lastly, regional cooperation allows countries to leverage the unique and complementary advantages that each nation has to offer. For example, countries with a wealth of natural resources can collaborate with nations that possess advanced technological capabilities to develop those resources more efficiently and sustainably. Combining the strengths of multiple countries can lead to greater regional competitiveness on the global stage and open new opportunities for economic growth and development. In conclusion, the Asian Group and China's increasing focus on regional cooperation in the field of investment showcases the potential benefits that can be achieved from such collaborations. By pooling resources, promoting stability, and leveraging each other's strengths, these countries can work together to create a more prosperous, sustainable, and competitive regional economy."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Addison?\\", is \\"hapy for Addison's uncle\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"No, \\"happy for Addison's uncle\\" is not a valid answer. Justifying the steps taken: 1. The question asks us to describe Addison, meaning we should offer traits, characteristics or behaviors about Addison, not someone else. \\"Happy for Addison's uncle\\" is not about Addison, but about another person's emotional state towards Addison's actions. 2. Even though it's mentioned that Addison visits their uncle's farm every summer to help out, this information tells us about Addison's actions, not necessarily Addison's emotional state, character or personality traits. 3. To validly describe Addison, we could use information such as 'helpful', 'dedicated', or 'family-oriented', based on the action of them visiting and helping out at the farm every summer. Hence, it's clear that \\"happy for Addison's uncle\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"How would you describe Addison?\\" because it describes someone else's emotions, not Addison's characteristics or personality traits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: On a recent flight from Atlanta, I was delayed on the tarmac for an hour and a half. The woman seated behind me played two Adele songs on a loop on her iPad. On speaker. For an hour. No one said anything. At one point the woman took a call. \\"I'm on the plane,\\" I heard her tell the caller. \\"It's Adele on my iPad!\\" Then, \\"I don't have headphones. But everyone likes Adele!\\" Anyone who has ever been on a plane, and is over the age of 10, has probably experienced some form of air rage. Creating it, witnessing it or just making a supreme mental effort not to succumb to it by thumping your seatmate for an outrageous offense such as playing loud music, noisily speaking on the phone or eating food so stinky it might actually be considered a weapon. The good news: you're not alone. The bad news: air rage is becoming routine. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) saw a 29% rise in incidents on board flights between 2009 and 2010. The Transportation Security Administration, however, has seen a decline over the last three years in security-related disturbances the agency has been called to deal with on planes. Air rage: Passengers 'quicker to snap' However you slice it, you don't have to work too hard to notice multiple recent examples of passengers losing their cool in lavish fashion. This year alone we've seen some impressive displays of in-flight fury. January started with an unruly passenger aboard a Reykjavik to New York flight who finished his journey rather inelegantly duct-taped to a seat after an apparent display of screaming, hitting and spitting at fellow passengers. Later that month, a Jetblue flight from New York to San Diego made an unscheduled stop in Denver to remove a woman who allegedly became verbally abusive after another passenger was moved to a neighboring \\"even more legroom\\" seat near her. The source of the woman's rage was apparently that the man had not paid for the extra legroom (65), but had been moved there due to a broken television in his seat. In February, a male passenger on a flight to Atlanta is accused of hitting another passenger's crying baby, uttering a racial slur as he did so. Man accused of slapping toddler will plead not guilty. According to an FBI affidavit, a passenger on a February Hawaiian airlines flight from New York assaulted a flight attendant, spat food at people and bit an air marshal. And another February incident proved that you don't even have to be up in the air to experience air travel-related anger. Yan Linkun, identified by NBC News as an executive and Chinese Communist Party official, became incensed at Kunming Changshui International Airport in Kunming, China. Learning he'd missed not one but two flights, Linkun vented his rage by flinging equipment and smashing windows in an impressive tirade that has since gone viral. Airline squeeze: It's not you, it's the seat. Frustrations on the ground and in the air may seem to invite air rage. Before fliers even reach their allocated metal bird, they've often struggled through security and customs lines and may face delays at the gate or on board. And the United States' recent mandatory government spending cuts could make those slowdowns at airports worse. Airlines, angling to make a profit, are chipping away at legroom or charging extra for a little more room, introducing new fees or bundling and unbundling the existing charges and re-jiggering mileage programs to favor the elite big-spenders. Travelers take aim at kids on a plane. Air travelers are agitated, but it doesn't quite explain why some boil over on planes. Is the altitude getting to them? HLN's Dr. Drew Pinsky points out that fliers can experience mild brain swelling even at low altitudes that can make it harder to keep your cool. Or are enraged passengers just under the influence? \\"If you want to look at one single contributing factor, you would have to point at alcohol,\\" Dr. Drew says. Andrew Thomson, creator of airrage.org and author of several air-travel related books including \\"Air Rage: Crisis in the Skies,\\" agrees. \\"Alcohol,\\" he writes, \\"is the leading driver of air rage.\\" In fact, many of the air rage incidents above were allegedly alcohol-related. Fortunately, no one on my flight was outwardly enraged or inebriated, though I'm sure, like me, many passengers were entertaining extravagant fantasies of how they'd deal with that offending Adele fan and her iPad. What in-flight behaviors push you to the verge of an outburst? Share your stories below.","completion":"- On an Atlanta flight, a woman played Adele songs on loop on her iPad for an hour, causing a disturbance to other passengers. - The International Air Transport Association reported a 29% increase in on-board incidents between 2009 and 2010. - Several examples of air rage have occurred in recent years, such as a passenger being duct-taped to a seat and another smashing windows at an airport. - Airline policies such as reduced legroom and additional fees may contribute to frustrations among travelers. - Alcohol is cited as a leading cause of air rage by experts like Dr. Drew Pinsky and Andrew Thomson."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Johnnie had a set of small volumes of English verse, extensively annotated by his own hand, which Stoddard had brought to her early in their acquaintance, leaving it with her more as a gift than as a loan. She kept these little books after all the others had gone back. She had read and reread them--cullings from Chaucer, from Spenser, from the Elizabethan lyrists, the border balladry, fierce, tender, oh, so human--till she knew pages of them by heart, and their vocabulary influenced her own, their imagery tinged all her leisure thoughts. It seemed to her, whenever she debated returning them, that she could not bear it. She would get them out and sit with one of them open in her hands, not reading, but staring at the pages with unseeing eyes, passing her fingers over it, as one strokes a beloved hand, or turning through each book only to find the pencilled words in the margins. She would be giving up part of herself when she took these back. Yet it had to be done, and one miserable morning she made them all into a neat package, intending to carry them to the mill and place them on Stoddard's desk thus early, when nobody would be in the office. Then the children came in; Deanie was half sick; and in the distress of getting the ailing child comfortably into her own bed, Johnnie forgot the books.

Question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Question: The student felt bad for his failure, he no longer felt what? Options: A. he felt like he lost control B. choice C. worthy D. excellent E. honest Answer:","completion":"C. worthy In light of the given information, it would be most reasonable to infer that the student no longer felt worthy after experiencing failure. Failing can lead to a decline in self-esteem and self-worth, often causing individuals to doubt their capabilities and value. As a result, the student might have been feeling unworthy of success or recognition. Option A - \\"he felt like he lost control\\" could be a plausible answer, as sometimes individuals feel that they have lost control over their abilities or circumstances after experiencing failure. However, this choice is less directly connected to the emotional implications of feeling bad after failing, which makes option C a better fit. Option B - \\"choice\\" is not a relevant or clear response to the question. It does not offer any meaningful insight into how the student might be feeling. Option D - \\"excellent\\" can be ruled out since it's the opposite of feeling bad. If the student felt bad for his failure, it is unlikely that he would feel excellent about it. Option E - \\"honest\\" is not directly related to feeling bad for failing. It's possible that failure might cause someone to doubt their honesty to themselves or wonder if they misrepresented their abilities, but this option doesn't directly address the emotional consequence of failing. Therefore, the most appropriate answer in line with common sense is option C.

For most rock bands, the pursuit of wisdom's a low priority compared to fame, fortune and fornication. Such a band was Strange Fruit.\\" Thus begins the opening dialog of Hughie, (Billy Connolly) as he launches into a brief history of the British band: in the late 1970's Strange Fruit, consisting of guitarist Brian Lovell (Bruce Robinson), his brother and lead singer Keith, keyboard player Tony Costello (Stephen Rea), bassist Les Wickes (Jimmy Nail) and drummer Beano Baggot (Timothy Spall) were HUGE. When Keith died of a drug overdose, he was replaced on vocals by Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Watched over by road-dog Hughie and Girl Friday Karen (Juliet Aubrey), they soldiered on until the disastrous appearance at the open-air Wisbech (U.K.) Rock Festival, when lightning struck the stage during their opening number. The already-contentious band members decided it was a sign and immediately broke up forever (all this in the first five minutes of the film). Forever, that is, until in the present (OK, 1998) Tony is spotted on Ibeza (he now stocks condoms in the restrooms at the resorts there) by the son of the Wisbech promoter, who wants to put together a 20th anniversary reunion concert with all the original acts. Tony seeks out Karen, now a divorced mother who coordinates conferences for a major hotel, suggesting a possible reunion. She is ambivalent, as is Les (now a successful roofer with a family) and Ray (a struggling solo artist with a demanding second wife -- Swedish -- and a mansion he can't afford). Beano, working in a floral nursery and hounded by the Inland Revenue (the U.K.'s IRS) is the only immediately enthusiastic bandmate.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who went with Kirwill to retrieve second head? Renko A:","completion":"Movie Title: \\"Renko and Kirwill: The Second Head\\" Movie Plot: 1. Initial Plot: Our story begins in a small, quiet town in Russia \\"Rostov\\". Here, Senior cop, Arkady Renko (a Russian) and James Kirwill (an American), become unlikely partners after an international murder mystery connects their paths. The mystery revolves around a grotesque series of murders where the victims' second head has been taken as trophies. 2. First Act: Renko, known for his robust ingenuity, cynicism, and inherent charm, is paired with Kirwill who, in contrast, is characterized by his intuitive mind and stubborn, brash American spirit. The tension between them is initially palpable, given the cold war ambiance and their contrasting personalities. Despite this, they resolve to find the second head from a crime scene which leads them through a proverbial maze of deceit, corruption, and violence. 3. Midpoint: The case leads them to a reclusive ex-cosmonaut, Ivan. Ivan confesses to being blackmailed into relinquishing his research on human cloning, hinting towards why the murderer may be taking the victims' heads. 4. Climax: As Renko and Kirwill dig deeper, they discover the gruesome reality - the murderer, a disgraced scientist named Dolokhov, is adopting Ivan's research to conduct unsuccessful cloning experiments resulting in the grotesque second heads. He was using them as means to perfect his cloning technique. 5. Final Resolution: Underneath the cover of the Russian winter, the pair infiltrates Dolokhov's hidden laboratory. Kirwill skillfully distracts Dolokhov, providing Renko with the opportunity to retrieve the second head as evidence. After a deadly battle, Dolokhov is defeated, and Renko and Kirwill, having put their differences aside, hand over the evidence to the authorities. 6. Epilogue: The bond of respect and understanding that forms between Renko and Kirwill bridged the gap between two nations and their ideologies. Our story ends with the pair standing victorious, showcasing their triumph not only over the criminal but the cold war sentiments as well. In summary, Renko went with Kirwill on a quest filled with mystery, danger, and unusual twists to retrieve the second head, forming the basis of our dramatic and thrilling story. The shared experience allowed them to form a bond of trust, respect, and understanding, bridging their initial cultural and ideological differences. Steps: 1. Setting initial plot around the main characters 2. Developing the characters' personalities 3. Introducing the mystery element and the antagonist 4. Planning the climax with an action scene 5.

Each individual ant hardly weigh anything, but put together they weigh roughly the same as all of mankind. They also live nearly everywhere, except on frozen mountain tops and around the poles.Foranimals their size, ants have been astonishingly successful, largely due to their wonderfulsocial behavior. In colonies that range in size from a few hundred to tens of millions, they organize their lives with a clear division of labor. Even more amazing is how they achievethis level of organization. Where we use sound and sight to communicate, ants dependprimarily on pheromone , chemicals sent out by individuals and smelled or tastedby fellow members of their colony. When an ant finds food, it produces a pheromone that will lead others straight to where the food is. When an individual ant comes under attack or is dying, it sends out an alarm pheromone to warn the colony to prepare for a conflict as a defense unit. In fact, when it comes to the art of war, ants have no equal. They are completely fearless and will readily take on a creature much larger than themselves, attacking in large groups and overcoming their target. Such is their devotion to the common good of the colony that not only soldier ants but also worker ants will sacrifice their lives to help defeat an enemy. Behaving in this selfless and devoted manner, these little creatures have survived on Earth, for more than 140 million years, far longer than dinosaurs.

The initial exposé has opened the floodgates, and since then, dozens of women have come forward with their own related stories about the disgraced Hollywood producer. In a new development, the Times reported on Monday that two women have come forward to accuse Weinstein of sexually assaulting them in the 1970s, extending the timeline of allegations against Weinstein by over four decades. Hope Exiner d'Amore, now 62, alleges that Weinstein raped her in a New York City hotel in the late 1970s. Similarly, Cynthia Burr, also 62, claims that Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him in a building hallway during the same period in NYC. Exiner d'Amore told the Times, \\"This has haunted me my entire life.\\" The Times has also uncovered new allegations from two other women. In the aftermath of these ongoing revelations, the future of the Weinstein Company is increasingly uncertain, with what Vulture calls \\"seeds of fresh chaos\\" being sown. As attention shifts to Harvey's brother, Bob Weinstein, he is now facing serious troubles of his own. Two sources close to TWC executives reveal that Bob is increasingly considered a \\"liability\\" by the company's board of directors. While Bob has publicly stated that he is \\"mortified and disgusted\\" by his older brother's behavior, there are rumors suggesting that he is, at heart, an enabler for Harvey.

Given the question: Two villages were situated on different sides of the hill. Each village has its own approach to agriculture. East village decided to clear the land, by felling many trees and bushes, and set up a vast irrigation system. West village too a more natural approach to food production and applied the edible forest method, and all the permaculture principles over the years. Which village had a decreased water table? Hint: Groundwater salinization compromises buffering properties. Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts. The answer is:","completion":"East village. Step 1: Analyze the given information The hint mentions that groundwater salinization compromises buffering properties, and both vegetation clearance and irrigation cause serious issues. It also states that irrigation increases the water table, mobilizes salts, and makes species more prone to high salinity stress. High salinity levels can reduce water uptake in plants, which can lead to forest decline in areas with high salinity and shallow groundwater depths. We also know that East village cleared land and set up an irrigation system, while West village applied permaculture principles with an edible forest method. Step 2: Compare the approaches of East and West villages East village cleared many trees and bushes, which would lead to vegetation clearance, while West village maintained their vegetation through permaculture practices. East village also implemented a vast irrigation system, which can increase the water table and mobilize salts. Step 3: Identify the village with a decreased water table Given the hint and the information about the approaches of each village, it is clear that East village is more likely to have experienced a decrease in water table due to the combination of vegetation clearance and irrigation. This would make the ecosystem in East village more susceptible to high salinity stress, reduced water uptake in plants, and potential forest decline. On the other hand, West village, with its focus on permaculture and forest preservation, would have maintained a more stable water table and experienced fewer negative effects on their ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"Who were the humanist anti-humanists?\\" Context: \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\"\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The humanist anti-humanists, as mentioned by Tony Davies in his book, Humanism (1997), refer to critics who identified the flaws and failures of humanism in its emancipatory ideals but did not offer alternative emancipatory projects themselves.

Another example is German philosopher Heidegger, who considered himself a humanist modeled on the ancient Greeks but believed that humanism only applied to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis. This controversial interpretation of Heidegger's thought led Davies to label him an \\"anti-humanist humanist.\\" The humanist anti-humanists highlight the limitations of humanism, especially in light of the 20th-century wars' horrific experiences, but recognize the importance of humanism as an alternative to bigotry and persecution."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie plot title: Vexille Movie plot: By the 2060s, robotics technology has become extremely advanced, including cybernetics. World opinion begins to turn against robotics, leading to the U.N. declaring a unilateral ban on further research in 2067. Japan, being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage. In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructedÂ â 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field, nullifying all communication with the outside world and making satellite surveillance impossible. Trade and diplomacy continues, but Japan vanishes from the world scene. Ten years later, the United States Navy special warfare unit \\"SWORD\\" is trying to trap a Japanese informant for Daiwa in Colorado. The instigator, Saito, escapes by cutting off his own leg. Analysis shows the leg is made of bio-metal. SWORD suspects that Japan has concealed extensive development of banned technologies. They embark on an unapproved scheme to infiltrate Japan and to find out the frequency of the R.A.C.E. network, enabling SWORD to gather intelligence on the country. Although the agents successfully enter Japan, they are detected by security forces before they can transmit their data. Vexille is the sole SWORD agent to evade capture, and only her lover Leon survives to be taken to Daiwa's headquarters. Vexille awakens to find Tokyo is now a shanty town ruled by Daiwa. A small resistance movement opposes the company, and uses Vexille's transmitter to successfully transmit the distortion frequency. Maria, the head of the resistance, details the 10 years of secrecy while SWORD studies Japan in shocked horror â the islands are a lifeless wasteland. In 2067, an unknown disease struck Japan and was countered by an experimental vaccine.

Other notable songs he contributed to the band were \\"Sit Down, I Think I Love You Stills was involved with the musician Judy Collins from 1968 to 1969 and wrote the song \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" for her. He dated actress and singer-songwriter Nancy Priddy who was the inspiration for his Buffalo Springfield song \\"Pretty Girl Why\\". He also had a short-term relationship with Rita Coolidge, as had Graham Nash, which apparently led to the initial breakup of CSN, in 1970. During a Manassas tour in France, Stills met and married his first wife, the singer-songwriter Veronique Sanson. Their son Christopher was born in 1974. They divorced in 1979. In 1976, Stills told Rolling Stone, \\"My hearing has gotten to be a terrible problem.

His third wife is Kristen Hathaway (Kristen Stills), whom he married in 1996. Stills's son, Justin Stills, was born in 1972 to Harriet Tunis. Justin was critically injured while snowboarding on Mt. Charleston, just outside Las Vegas, in 1997. An episode of Discovery Health's documentary series Trauma: Life in the ER featured his treatment and recovery. Another son, Henry, has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and is profiled in the 2007 documentary Autism: The Musical. Stills's daughter Eleanor is a photographer and graduate of Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. Since Eleanor's graduation, she has been responsible for all recent Crosby, Stills & Nash photography. Stills has another daughter, Alex, who attends Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts. His son Chris and daughter Jennifer are both recording artists. His youngest son, Oliver Ragland, was born in 2004 and named in honor of Neil Young, whose maternal family name is Ragland. Like all four members of CSNY, Stills has long been involved in liberal causes and politics. In 2000, he served as a member of the Democratic credentials committee from Florida during the Democratic National Convention, and was a delegate in previous years. The comic book series Scott Pilgrim features a character by the name of Stephen Stills, referred to as \\"the Talent\\" by the band he shares with the title character. The character also plays an acoustic guitar and sings, and is often portrayed wearing the kind of western shirts that is part of Stills's standard wardrobe.

Where is the island of Montserrat?","completion":"The island of Montserrat is a British Overseas Territory located in the Eastern Caribbean Sea. It is a part of the Lesser Antilles, a collection of islands situated within the eastern boundary of the Caribbean Sea and the western boundary of the Atlantic Ocean. The island is part of the Leeward Islands chain, which forms the Eastern Caribbean archipelago. Montserrat sits approximately 27 miles (43 kilometers) southwest of Antigua, its nearest neighbor, and about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Guadeloupe. The island has a geographical position of roughly 16°45′ N latitude and 62°12′ W longitude. This position places it in the North American region. The island has a total land area of approximately 39 square miles (102 square kilometers), with approximately 98% of this territory being volcanic in origin, dominated by the Soufrière Hills volcano. This volcano has been the most significant feature of Montserrat's geography in recent years. In 1995, a series of volcanic eruptions caused extensive damage to the island's southern portion and led to the establishment of an exclusion zone that covered more than half of the island. Montserrat's capital city, Plymouth, was also devastated in the disaster, forcing the government and residents to move northward. The coastal areas of Montserrat are characterized by rocky and steep shorelines, with some small black sand beaches. The topography of the island includes rolling hills, valleys, and lush tropical vegetation, which create an attractive environment for various flora and fauna. The climate is typically tropical, with an average temperature of about 81°F (27°C) and a rainy season from June to November. Montserrat has a rich history, starting with its initial settlement by the indigenous Arawak and Carib peoples. European colonization began when Christopher Columbus sighted the island in 1493 and named it after the Santa Maria de Montserrat, a famous monastery in Spain. Subsequently, the island was colonized by the British in the early 17th century. Montserrat's culture is a mix of African, British, and indigenous Caribbean influences, with English being the official language. Today, Montserrat is a partially self-governing territory overseen by the British government. It has a small and diverse population of around 5,000 people, with many residents involved in agriculture and tourism. The island is known for its unique volcanic landscape, beautiful scenery, and the Montserrat Oriole, the national bird, which is an endangered species native to the island."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which brother studied less about rocks breaking as a result of stress buildup? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Dan studied less about rocks breaking as a result of stress buildup. While both brothers had a strong passion and interest in geology, their focus areas differed significantly. Bob's area of study centered on sedimentary rocks, which are rocks formed from the accumulation and compression of sediment fragments, mineral particles, and organic materials such as shells, bones, and plant matter. This means he would have explored topics related to lithification, stratification, and the various types of sedimentary rocks, including clastic, chemical, and organic rocks. On the other hand, Dan specialized in the study of earthquakes and their location. Earthquakes involve the sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust, creating seismic waves that cause shaking and often lead to destruction. While this subject matter does relate to rocks and the Earth's crust, Dan's focus would have been more on understanding seismic activity and the factors contributing to the movement of tectonic plates. Earthquakes do involve rock breaking as a result of stress buildup, but this would be a smaller aspect of Dan's overall studies, as he would delve deeper into the mechanisms that trigger earthquakes, the properties of seismic waves, and methods for monitoring and predicting these natural disasters. Therefore, it is safe to say that Dan studied less about rocks breaking as a result of stress buildup compared to Bob, who dedicated his studies to the formation and characteristics of sedimentary rocks.

TEXT:I notice from the comments that most of the people discussing this movie are basing their remarks on the MST3K airing. That's fair enough (that is, after all, how it got its widest exposure), but, having had the misfortune of seeing \\"Final Justice\\" in its original form, I'd just like to share a few thoughts and comments on the uncut version. First off, it must be admitted that the original version is slightly more coherent than the MST3K broadcast, owing primarily to an expository scene between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini (I COULD use the characters' names instead of the actors', but I just love typing the words \\"Venantino Venantini\\"), explaining why Venantini's fugitive character can't just leave Malta right away. (It's not a very CONVINCING plot point, but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it.) Whether this scene was cut just for time or because it didn't provide much fodder for riffs, I don't know. Another plot point missing in the original: The stripper's betrayal of Venantino Venantini to Joe Don Baker, seemingly unmotivated in the MST3K version, is explained by an earlier, extremely unpleasant scene in which Venantini rapes her in the shower. While this does give her a motive for turning against him, the whole scenario is just really...icky. (There's no other word for it.) Some of the MST-worthy moments (the perpetual truncated shouts of \\"Son of a--\\" and the \\"deja vu\\" shooting of the sheriff) were purely the result of the edited-for-TV print they worked with, and were absent from the original movie. One scene I wish had made it into the MST3K version: Before entering the bar to question some people, Joe Don asks the Maltese policewoman accompanying him to stay outside, because \\"they see that uniform, they won't cooperate.\\" However, Joe Don himself is wearing his ridiculous cowboy-slash-sheriff outfit, complete with shiny badge! I can't imagine why they passed on that great opportunity to make fun of him... One final observation on the original, uncut version of \\"Final Justice\\": Why, oh why, did they feel the need to put Venantino Venantini's naked butt up on the screen?","completion":"The sentiment of this text is (A). negative. Although the author discusses some differences between the original and MST3K version of the movie, they mention it as a misfortune to watch the original version and highlight the negative aspects (e.g., \\"extremely unpleasant,\\" \\"ridiculous,\\" \\"icky\\")."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Julie, wife of the famous composer Patrice de Courcy, must cope with the sudden death of her husband and daughter in an automobile accident she herself survives. While recovering in the hospital, Julie attempts suicide by overdose, but cannot swallow the pills. After being released from the hospital, Julie closes up the house she lived in with her family and takes an apartment in Paris without telling anyone, or keeping any clothing or objects from her old life, except for a chandelier of blue beads that presumably belonged to her daughter.For the remainder of the film, Julie disassociates herself from all past memories and distances herself from former friendships, as can be derived from a conversation she has with her mother who suffers from Alzheimer's disease and believes Julie is her own sister Marie-France. She also destroys the score for her late husband's last commissioned, though unfinished, work: a piece celebrating European unity, following the end of the cold war. Snatches of the music haunt her throughout the film.Julie reluctantly befriends Lucille, an exotic dancer who is having an affair with one of the neighbors and helps her when she needs moral support when the tennants in their apartment building want to evit her . Despite her desire to live anonymously and alone, life in Paris forces Julie to confront elements of her past that she would rather not face, including Olivier, a friend of the couple, also a composer and former assistant of Patrice's at the conservatory, who is in love with her, and the fact that she is suspected to be the true author of her late husband's music. Olivier appears in a TV interview announcing that he shall try to complete Patrice's commission, and Julie also discovers that her late husband was having an affair with a younger woman.While both trying to stop Olivier from completing the score and finding out who her husband's mistress was, Julie becomes more engaged despite her own efforts not to be.

Answer:","completion":"\\"Echoes of Blue: A Symphony of Loss and Rediscovery\\" In \\"Echoes of Blue: A Symphony of Loss and Rediscovery\\", we follow Julie's emotional journey as she navigates her own grief and the unfolding mysteries surrounding her late husband Patrice de Courcy and daughter's life. The title highlights the significance of the blue chandelier beads, which serve as a recurring motif throughout the film, representing both Julie's emotional connection to her late daughter and her determined efforts to sever ties with her past. The word \\"echoes\\" in the title signifies the haunting memory of Patrice's unfinished musical composition, which resonates throughout the film as Julie gradually uncovers the truth about her husband's life. Additionally, it represents the familiar patterns that emerge as Julie finds herself inadvertently drawn back into the world she tried to leave behind, including her budding relationship with Olivier and her compassion toward Lucille. The phrase \\"a symphony of loss and rediscovery\\" not only metaphorically portrays the film's central conflict as Julie struggles with grief, rejection, and redemption, but also alludes to the actual music within the storyline. This phrase emphasizes the interconnectedness between Julie's personal journey and her late husband's unfinished work in celebrating European unity post-Cold War. Through navigating her challenging relationships with Olivier and Sandrine, engaging with the mystery of Patrice's mistress, and wrestling with accepting and embracing her own past, Julie ultimately becomes the driving force behind finishing the musical composition that Patrice began. In conclusion, \\"Echoes of Blue: A Symphony of Loss and Rediscovery\\" is a title that encapsulates Julie's complex odyssey of grief, identity, and resolve in the wake of her family's tragedy, as well as the entwining fates of the characters and themes within the film."},{"prompt":"Q:What type of details about thomas bondhus can be gathered from the following bio?

David Webb's journey of losing weight, gaining fitness, and achieving worldwide success with his opera group is nothing short of awe-inspiring. In this article, we will explore how David managed to shed an impressive 6 stones and reduce his body fat from 40% to a super fit 13 stone. We will also touch upon his involvement with the cleft palate charity, Operation Smile. 1. David's Struggle with Comfort Eating As a teenager, David struggled with comfort eating throughout his formative years. He continued his unhealthy habits well into his gap years. As a result, he reached a massive 19 stone in weight, with 40% of it being body fat. At this point, David knew that it was time for a change. He could no longer afford to overlook the risks associated with poor health and severe obesity. 2. Discovering the Caveman Diet and Crossfit as a Dangerous Duo David began researching various diet plans in a desperate attempt to shed some weight. It was not long before he discovered the caveman diet, also known as the Paleo or Paleolithic diet. This diet focuses on consuming whole, nutrient-dense foods, such as vegetables, fruits, meats, and healthy fats, similar to what our ancestors would have eaten thousands of years ago. David adopted the caveman diet and complemented it with a Crossfit exercise regime. Crossfit workouts are high-intensity sessions, typically lasting only 10 to 20 minutes. They consist of a combination of strength and cardio exercises, which are transformative in promoting overall fitness, endurance, and agility. Through a diligent combination of a strict Paleo diet and a dynamic Crossfit routine, David underwent a remarkable transformation. 3. Achieving Worldwide Success David's consistent effort and dedication to improving his physical and mental health did not go unnoticed. He became a part of the opera group Amore, which has since achieved worldwide success. With his newfound confidence, David is now able to perform on the world stage, using opera as a positive outlet to showcase his incredible vocal talent. 4. Giving Back: The 300-mile charity ride for Operation Smile David has decided to take his fitness journey one step further, riding an impressive 300 miles over the course of three days as part of a fundraiser for the cleft palate charity, Operation Smile. This organization works tirelessly to provide essential surgery and treatment for children born with cleft lips and palates around the world. By contributing to this cause, David gets to experience firsthand the impact of his incredible journey on the lives of others, inspiring him to keep pushing his physical boundaries. Conclusion David Webb's amazing body transformation should serve as inspiration to anyone who believes that their current situation is insurmountable. Through a combination of a healthy diet, regular exercise, and unshakable determination, David was able not only to overcome his weight problem but also to achieve international success and give back to a charitable cause.

Write an article based on this summary: As if nothing had changed, Welsh farmers will have risen early this morning to milk their cows or feed their stock. Article:","completion":"Title: A Glimpse Into the Unchanging Routine of Welsh Farmers Introduction In a world that increasingly revolves around technology and novel innovations, it is refreshing to know that some traditions remain intact. Welsh farmers, for instance, continue to follow their age-old, time-tested practices when it comes to tending to their livestock. As if nothing had changed, these hard-working individuals rise early each morning to milk their cows or feed their stock. In this article, we will delve into this world of unchanging routines and the dedication of Welsh farmers. Early Morning Rituals The sun has barely risen as Welsh farmers begin their day. The predawn hours are crucial for these individuals who have dedicated their lives to the age-old profession of farming. Their first responsibility is to milk the cows - a task that requires patience, skill, and a deep understanding of bovine life. The milk, so diligently collected, is then either sold or used to create dairy products such as cheese and yogurt. Ensuring the wellbeing of their livestock is also of the utmost importance. While the cows are being milked, the rest of the stock, such as sheep, pigs, and poultry, are also fed and tended to by the farmers. This ensures that the livestock remains healthy and productive, capable of sustaining the livelihoods of several rural Welsh communities. The Value of Tradition Despite the numerous advances in technology and the availability of modern farming techniques, Welsh farmers choose to adhere to their traditional ways. This decision not only maintains the quality of the produce but also preserves the cultural legacy of the region. In a world where globalization and commercialization have become the norm, this dedication to tradition is both admirable and poignant. Supporting Local Communities These unchanging routines of Welsh farmers serve a greater purpose than just the continuation of age-old practices. Their labor empowers rural communities by providing a steady supply of wholesome, locally sourced food to the people. Furthermore, this fosters a sense of self-sufficiency in rural Wales by reducing reliance on imported goods. In addition to being economically beneficial, this practice promotes a sustainable way of living that is in harmony with the environment. Local produce has a smaller carbon footprint compared to imported goods, making the reliance on Welsh farmers and their livestock a more environmentally friendly choice. Conclusion As the world around them continues to evolve, Welsh farmers remain steadfast in their commitment to time-honored traditions. Rising early each day to care for and nourish their livestock, these individuals prioritize the welfare of their animals and the sustainability of their community. Their dedication to tradition is both a testament to the resilience of rural life in Wales and a source of inspiration for the generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: ParaNorman Context: In the small town of Blithe Hollow, Massachusetts, Norman Babcock (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an 11-year-old boy who speaks with the dead, including his late grandmother (Elaine Stritch) and various ghosts in town. Almost no one believes him and he is isolated emotionally from his family while being ridiculed by his peers. His best friend, Neil Downe (Tucker Albrizzi), is an overweight boy who is bullied himself and finds in Norman a kindred spirit. During rehearsal of a school play commemorating the town's execution of a witch three centuries ago, Norman has a vision of the town's past in which he is pursued through the woods by townsfolk on a witch hunt. Afterward, the boys are confronted by Norman's estranged and seemingly deranged uncle Mr. Prenderghast (John Goodman) who tells his nephew that he soon must take up his regular ritual to protect the town. Soon after this encounter, Prenderghast dies from a sudden stroke. During the official performance of the school play Norman has another vision, creating a public spectacle of himself which leads to his father Perry (Jeff Garlin) grounding him. His mother Sandra (Leslie Mann) tells him that his father's stern manner is because he is afraid for him. The next day, Norman sees Prenderghast's spirit who tells him that the ritual must be performed with a certain book before sundown that day; then making him swear to complete the task, Prenderghast's spirit is set free and crosses over. Norman is at first reluctant to go because he is scared but his grandmother tells him it is all right to be scared as long as he does not let it change who he is. Norman sets off to retrieve the book from Prenderghast's house (having to take it from his corpse). He then goes to the graves of the five men and two women who were cursed by the witch, but finds that the book is merely a series of fairy tales. Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a school bully, arrives and prevents Norman from reading the story before sundown. Norman attempts to continue reading from the book, to no effect. A...","completion":"In the movie ParaNorman, Norman Babcock, an 11-year-old boy with the ability to speak to the dead, is tasked with the responsibility of protecting his small town of Blithe Hollow, Massachusetts. This responsibility comes as a result of a witch's curse that was placed on the town centuries ago, during the time when the witch was executed. In order to lift the curse and protect the town, Norman must perform a ritual with a certain book before sundown as per the instructions of his deceased, deranged uncle Mr. Prenderghast. Protection of the town revolves around Norman's unique ability to communicate with ghosts and his willingness to confront the supernatural. Throughout the film, Norman encounters various challenges and setbacks, including isolation from his own family, ridicule from his peers, a lack of understanding from the townspeople, and even bullying from the school bully, Alvin. However, Norman finds emotional support from his best friend Neil, an overweight boy who is also victim to bullying, and his late grandmother's spirit who encourages him to face his fears. As the story unfolds, Norman attempts to complete the ritual before sundown but is thwarted by Alvin, which leads to a failure in lifting the curse. Nonetheless, Norman doesn't give up and continues to find a way to protect the town, despite the rising supernatural threats from the witch's curse. In a critical moment, Norman comes face-to-face with the spirit of the witch responsible for the town's curse, Aggie Prenderghast, revealing that she was a scared and misunderstood little girl who was wrongfully executed for her abilities. Norman demonstrates courage, empathy, and understanding, connecting with her on a personal level, ultimately helping Aggie accept her mistakes and start on a path of forgiveness. Through this encounter, Norman not only manages to save the town but also teaches the townspeople about the power of compassion and understanding towards those who are different.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years was the Suez canal defended from Ottoman attacks?","completion":"Title: The Defense of the Suez Canal: Countering Ottoman Attacks during World War I Introduction The Suez Canal, a man-made waterway that meanders through Egypt and directly connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea, has played a vital role in global transport and trade since it was completed in 1869. This prime location has made it a target of numerous strategic conflicts, notably between the British Empire and the Ottoman Empire during World War I. In this article, we will delve into the history of the Suez Canal and examine how many years it was defended from Ottoman attacks. A Brief History of the Suez Canal Before addressing the defense of the Suez Canal from attacks, it is essential to understand its significance. The canal was constructed under the supervision of a French-led company between 1859 and 1869, and its completion enabled ships to bypass African Cape of Good Hope, cutting voyage times between Europe and Asia considerably. The Suez Canal quickly became a valuable geostrategic region, and in 1875, Britain acquired a controlling interest in the canal, recognizing its potential as a secure link between the British Isles and their colonial holdings in Asia and Africa. World War I and the British Defense of the Suez Canal Britain officially entered World War I on August 4, 1914, after Germany invaded Belgium. Seeing an opportunity, the Ottoman Empire joined forces with the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria) in late October 1914, seeking to regain their lost territories in Europe, Asia, and Africa. As the war intensified, the strategically positioned Suez Canal became central to the British war effort. It was a crucial supply route to British colonies and facilitated the transport of troops, equipment, and other resources between Britain, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Egypt. Consequently, it was imperative to defend the canal from potential attacks by the Central Powers, specifically the persistent adversary, the Ottoman Empire. Timeline of Ottoman Attacks and British Defense The defense of the Suez Canal from Ottoman attacks spanned a period of approximately two years, from 1914-1916. Over these years, the British and their allies strove to prevent Ottoman forces from capturing the canal, organizing defenses and launching counter-offensives. Below is a detailed timeline of events: 1. December 1914-January 1915: Pre-emptive defense measures were taken by British troops, setting up checkpoints and fortifications along the canal's length. They even sank old ships to block potential access points. This period marked the beginning of the defense against the anticipated Ottoman incursion. 2. January-February 1915: The first major encounter, known as the First Suez Offensive, occurred when Ottoman forces attacked the canal in an attempt to disrupt Allied supply routes. British and international troops stationed along the canal quickly repelled the attack, inflicting heavy casualties on the invaders. 3. July 1915: By mid-1915, British forces had fortified their positions significantly, constructing trenches, laying out barbed wire, and positioning artillery to thwart the advance of enemy troops. During this period, battles erupted in the Sinai Peninsula, where British and Empire troops fought against the Ottoman forces, weakening their ability to launch further attacks on the canal. 4. April 23, 1916: The Second Suez Offensive saw Ottoman forces attempting one more major assault on the canal. However, British forces, bolstered by Indian and Australian troops, displayed exemplary defensive tactics, ultimately repelling the Ottoman attack. Ottoman forces suffered significant losses, and their ambitions to control the Suez Canal collapsed in the face of overwhelming British resistance. Conclusion From the onset of British involvement in World War I in 1914 until the final failed Ottoman offensive in 1916, the Suez Canal was actively defended for approximately two years. British forces, with valuable support from their empire and international allies, effectively secured this vital supply route throughout the conflict, ensuring its continued use and reinforcing its geopolitical importance in the region. Today, the Suez Canal stands as a testament to the enduring strategic value of this critical waterway in the global trade network and serves as a reminder of the fierce battles once fought to protect it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

The Myth Of Free Market Health Care In America ObamaCare is in retreat. That much was clear the moment the president started springing B-grade Hollywood references to \\"blue pills and red pills\\" in its defense during his news conference last week. But before ObamaCare can be beaten back decisively, its critics need to answer this question: How did his plan for a government takeover of roughly a fifth of the U.S. economy get this far in the first place? The answer is not that Democrats have a lock on Washington right now--although they do. Nor that Republicans are intellectually bereft--although they are. The answer is that both ObamaCare's supporters and opponents believe that--unlike Europe--America has something called a free market health care system. So long as this myth holds sway, it will be exceedingly difficult to prescribe free market fixes to America's health care woes--or, conversely, end the lure of big government remedies. The fact of the matter is that America's health care system is like a free market in the same way that Madonna is like a virgin--i.e. in fiction only. If anything, the U.S. system has many more similarities than differences with France and Germany. The only big outlier among European nations is England, which, even in a post-communist world, has managed the impressive feat of hanging on to a socialized, single-payer model. This means that the U.K. government doesn't just pays for medical services but actually owns and operates the hospitals that provide them. English doctors are government employees! But apart from England, most European countries have a public-private blend, not unlike what we have in the U.S. The major difference between America and Europe of course is that America does not guarantee universal health insurance whereas Europe does. But this is not as big a deal as it might seem. Uncle Sam, along with state governments, still picks up nearly half of the country's 2.5 trillion annual health care tab. More importantly, contrary to popular mythology, America does offer public care of sorts. It directly covers about a third of all Americans through Medicare (the public program for the elderly) and Medicaid (the public program for the poor). But it also indirectly covers the uninsured by--at least in part--paying for their emergency care. In effect, anyone in America who does not have private insurance is on the government dole in one way or another. This is not radically different from France, where the government offers everyone basic public coverage, of course--but a whopping 90% of the French also buy supplemental private insurance to help pay for the 20% to 40% of their tab that the public plan doesn't cover. Meanwhile, in Germany, about 12.5% of Germans who are civil employees or above a certain income opt out of the public system altogether and rely solely on private coverage--even though they know it is well nigh impossible to return to the public system once they switch. And more Germans likely would go private if they were not legally banned from doing so. The most striking similarity between America, France and Germany, however, is the model of \\"insurance\\" upon which their health care systems are based. In other insurance markets, the more coverage you want, the more you have to pay for it. Consider auto insurance, for instance. If you want everything--from oil changes to collision protection--you'd have to pay more than someone who wants just basic collision protection. That's not how it works in health care. For the same flat fee--regardless of whether it is paid for primarily through taxes as in France in Germany or through lost wages as in America--patients in all three countries effectively get an ATM card on which they can expense everything (barring co-pays) regardless of what the final tab adds up to. (Catastrophic coverage plans are available in America, but the market is extremely limited for a number of reasons, including the fact that most states have issued Patients Bill of Rights mandating all kinds of fancy benefits even in basic plans.) Thus, in neither country do patients have much incentive to restrain consumption or shop for cheaper providers. In America and Germany, patients don't even know how much most medical services cost. In France, patients know the prices because they have to pay up front and get reimbursed by their insurer later--a lame attempt to ensure some price consciousness. But since there is no cap on the reimbursed amount, the French sometimes shop for doctors based on such things as office decor rather than prices, according to a study by David Green and Benedict Irvine, researchers at Civitas, a London-based think tank. (Green and Irvine reported this as a good thing.) So what are the consequences of this \\"insurance\\" model and how are the three countries coping with it? America, as Obama continuously reminds us, spends 16% of its gross domestic product on health care--the highest percentage in the world. If current trends persist, in 75 years health care will consume about 50% of the GDP--and all of the federal budget. But France is not doing a whole lot better. Its health care system is the third most expensive in the world with over 11% of its GDP going toward health care--nearly three times more than the amount in 1960. The French fork over more than 20% of their income in taxes for public coverage (and another 2.5% to purchase supplemental private coverage)--yet their public program suffers from chronic deficits. Germany, similarly, spends about 11% of its GDP on health care with Germans contributing more than 15% of their income toward buying health care. If France and Germany are not spending even more on health care, one big reason is rationing. Universal health care advocates pretend that there is no rationing in France and Germany because these countries don't have long waiting lines for MRIs, surgical procedures and other medical services as in England and Canada. And patients have more or less unrestricted access to specialists. But it is unclear how long this will last. Struggling with exploding costs, the French government has tried several times--only to back off in the face of a public outcry--to prod doctors into using only standardized treatments. In 1994, it started imposing fines of up to roughly 4,000 on doctors who deviated from \\"mandatory practice guidelines.\\" It switched from this \\"sticks\\" to a \\"carrots\\" approach four years later, and tried handing bonuses to doctors who adhered to the guidelines. Meanwhile, in Germany, \\"sickness funds\\"--the equivalent of insurance companies--have imposed strict budgets on doctors for prescription drugs. Doctors who exceed their cap are simply denied reimbursement, something that forces them to prescribe less effective invasive procedures for problems that would have been better treated with drugs. But the most potent form of rationing in France and Germany--and indeed much of Europeis not overt, but covert: delayed access to cutting-edge drugs and therapies that become available to American patients years in advance. The point is that there is no health care model, whether privately or publicly financed, that can offer unlimited access to medical services while containing costs. Ultimately, such a model arrives at a cross roads where it has to either limit access in an arbitrary way, or face uncontrolled cost increases. France and Germany, which are mostly publicly funded, are increasingly marching down the first road. America, which is half publicly and half privately funded, has so far taken the second path. Should America offer even more people such unlimited access through universal coverage, it too will end up rationing care or facing national bankruptcy. The only sustainable system that avoids this Hobson's choice is one that is based on a genuine free market in which there is some connection between what patients pay for coverage and the services they receive. That is emphatically not what America or any Western country has today. Looking to these countries for solutions as Obama and other advocates of universal health coverage are doing will lead to false diagnoses and false cures.

Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The Myth Of Free Market Health Care In America is an opinion piece that argues the misconception of a free market healthcare system in the U.S. perpetuates ineffective solutions, and only a genuine free market system can provide sustainable healthcare without driving up costs or limiting access arbitrarily."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

During the summer campaign of 1673, Turenne had the thankless task of trying to contain Leopold's troops under the command of Raimondo Montecuccoli. Montecuccoli finally joined with the Dutch troops of William III to besiege and take the city of Bonn from the French. In August 1673, The Habsburg monarchies of Spain and the Holy Roman Empire signed a formal alliance with the Republic that required that France be returned to her boundaries of 1659. This alliance was strengthened in October by Charles IV of Lorraine. Imperial and Dutch troops conquered the town of Naarden from the French on 13 September. The Spanish, who had yet to formally enter the war, declared war on the French on 16 October. At about the same time Frederick William re-entered the war against France. The position of Louis at this stage was bad enough, but it worsened when England made a separate peace, the Treaty of Westminster, with all of the nations arrayed against France on 19 February 1674.

Jordan left my wallet at home after telling him never to forget it. Given the context: How would you describe Jordan? Possible answers: remorseful, bossy, forgetful A:","completion":"Given the context provided, I would describe Jordan as forgetful. Jordan was clearly instructed not to forget your wallet, but he ended up leaving it at home anyway. This shows that he either forgot to pay attention to your instruction or simply forgot to take the wallet with him despite being reminded. This points to forgetfulness as the main trait in this particular situation. However, it is important to note that this single instance may not be enough to fairly judge Jordan's character accurately. People may exhibit different traits in different situations and everyone can have occasional lapses in memory. Therefore, it's crucial to observe Jordan's behavior over a longer period and in different contexts to evaluate other possible traits, such as being remorseful or bossy, which were not evident in this specific scenario. A remorseful person might feel guilty or apologize for their actions, while a bossy person might exhibit a controlling or domineering attitude towards others. Therefore, in the context of this situation, it is more relevant to label Jordan as forgetful, as the other characteristics like remorsefulness or bossiness are not explicitly mentioned or observed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is a call to action for everyone involved in the sport – from the players and staff to the fans and broader rugby community – to prioritize the need for education, support, and clear consequences to ensure that such behavior is eradicated from the game. Additionally, by endorsing Gallop's comments, there is a recognition that it is not just the responsibility of the NRL and its governing body to address these issues, but the responsibility lies with all the stakeholders within the sport. This includes clubs, sponsors, media, and fans, who need to be aware of their potential influence and roles in addressing and preventing such issues from occurring in the future. Moreover, this endorsement emphasizes the importance of fostering a culture change within the sport, where respect for women and the understanding of consent becomes ingrained values among players and staff members. It is through education programs, ongoing support, and transparent communication that the NRL and its stakeholders can truly make a difference and create an environment where everyone feels safe, respected, and included. In conclusion, endorsing David Gallop's comments signifies the necessary commitment to address and combat the serious issue of sexual assault and degradation of women within the National Rugby League.

Answer:","completion":"The currency used in Afghanistan is called the Afghan Afghani, commonly abbreviated as AFN (Afghanistan Afghani). The Afghani is the official form of money within Afghanistan and is regulated by the Central Bank of Afghanistan, known as Da Afghanistan Bank. Historically, the currency has gone through several incarnations, initially inaugurating in 1925 as the Kabuli Rupee, which eventually gave way to the Afghani in 1926. Throughout its history, the Afghan Afghani has faced various fluctuations and reforms. The first Afghani was used from 1926 to 2002 and was denoted by the abbreviation AFA (Afghanistan Afghanis). However, due to economic turbulence and political instability, particularly during the Soviet invasion and the ensuing civil war, the value of the Afghani faced significant depreciation. It was during this time that the value of the Afghani was pegged to multiple currencies, such as the US Dollar and the Soviet Ruble. As part of efforts to stabilize and revive the Afghan economy after the fall of the Taliban regime, the new Afghan Afghani (AFN) was introduced in 2002. This new currency replaced the old Afghani (AFA) at a rate of 1 AFN = 1000 AFA. The overhaul aimed at improving economic stability and regaining public trust in the currency, and since then, the AFN has been relatively stable. The Afghan Afghani is divided into 100 smaller units called pul, although pul coins are not commonly used due to their low value. Currently, Afghan banknotes are available in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 Afghanis, while coins are available in denominations of 1, 2, and 5 Afghanis as well as 25, 50, and 100 pul. Moreover, the banknotes have undergone many designs and security updates, with the latest series released in 2020 featuring enhanced anti-counterfeiting measures. The economy of Afghanistan is primarily driven by agriculture, with the country being a notable producer of fruits, nuts, wool, and opium. Furthermore, the service and construction sectors have experienced significant growth in the past years. However, the nation still struggles with substantial challenges, including political instability, corruption, and inadequate infrastructure. This situation often leads to fluctuations in currency value, making it crucial for the Central Bank of Afghanistan to maintain control and ensure the Afghani's stability."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

People from the north of England consider London to be chaotic, crowded and bad for Britain, according to a study released today. Only 24 per cent of those living outside the capital think London has a positive impact on their local economy, with that figure even lower in northern cities such as Liverpool and Sheffield, where the number drops to just nine per cent and eight per cent respectively. While two thirds of the population agree London has a positive impact on the national economy, the same number argue that the capital unfairly benefits from central government being based there. Divide: While two thirds of the population agree London benefits the national economy (green figures), only 24 per cent of those living outside the capital think it has a positive impact at a local level (red figures) The figures come from a report for Centre for Cities and the Centre for London, with YouGov questioning residents in 16 towns and cities across the UK. The study confirms the suspicion of a growing divide between London and the rest of the country - something that has long been suggested by the capital's property bubble. The results point to something a ripple effect in opinion, with the towns and cities closest to London feeling most positive about the capital's impact, and those further away feeling the least positive. This is magnified in parts of Yorkshire, with just eight per cent of those living in Hull and Sheffield thinking London has a positive impact on their city. The results are not must better in Leeds where the number is 13 per cent. Unfair: Only 24 per cent of non-Londoners think the capital (pictured) has a positive impact on their local economy. Meanwhile two thirds argue London unfairly benefits from central government being based there. Ignored: Only 17 per cent of non-Londoners think Westminster politicians such as Chancellor George Osborne (left) and Prime Minister David Cameron (right) are responsive to local issues. It's not just the capital's economic impact that has been called into question. Three quarters of those asked also felt the media focuses too much on London at the expense of other British cities. Meanwhile 64 per cent of non-Londoners claimed the government paid too much attention to issues in the capital, with only 17 per cent thinking Westminster politicians were responsive to local issues. The only city to buck this trend was Manchester, where a slightly more positive 21 per cent either strongly agreed to tended to agree with the claim that Whitehall was in touch with local issues. But despite feeling unhappy Londoners get a much better deal than those living in other parts of the country, only one in five said they would consider moving to the capital to improve their opportunities. This, it was suggested, is down to a widespread belief that London is not a happy or comfortable place to live. Responding to questions on their opinions of quality of life in the capital, 62 per cent on non-Londoners described it as 'expensive', 59 per cent as 'crowded' and 30 per cent as 'chaotic'. Only 32 per cent thought London was a good place to raise a family.","completion":"This article is about a study that shows how people from the north of England think about London.

An abused foster child, he subconsciously blames himself for his unhappy upbringing and turns this self-loathing into a form of self-sabotage in both his professional and emotional lives. Hence, he is unable to maintain either a steady job or a steady romantic relationship.The first week of classes, Will solves a difficult graduate-level math problem that Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgård), a Fields Medalist and combinatorialist, left on a chalkboard as a challenge to his students, hoping someone might solve it by the semester's end. Everyone wonders who solved it, and Lambeau puts another problem on the board -- one that took him and his colleagues two years to prove. Will is discovered in the act of solving it, and Lambeau initially believes that Will is vandalizing the board and chases him away. When Will turns out to have solved it correctly, Lambeau tries to track Will down.Meanwhile, Will attacks a youth who had bullied him years before in kindergarten, and he now faces imprisonment after attacking a police officer who was responding to the fight. Realizing Will might have the potential to be a great mathematician, such as the genius Évariste Galois, Lambeau goes to Will's trial and intervenes on his behalf, offering him a choice: either Will can go to jail, or he can be released into Lambeau's personal supervision, where he must study mathematics and see a psychotherapist. Will chooses the latter even though he seems to believe that he does not need therapy.Five psychologists fail to connect with Will.

If the annulus fibrosus is torn, how easily does the inner material 'leak out'?\\" Shampoo is making hair soft and thin. Is it better to apply Shikakai to get thick hair? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"To address the first question about spinal discs, I will research the anatomy of spinal discs, focusing on the nucleus pulposus, annulus fibrosus, and their consistency: Step 1: Research the anatomy and structure of spinal discs, focusing on nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus. Step 2: Understand the consistency of nucleus pulposus and its thickness. Step 3: Analyze how easily the nucleus pulposus leaks out if annulus fibrosus is torn. Output: The material inside a spinal disc, specifically the nucleus pulposus, has a jelly-like consistency and it's relatively thick, allowing it to absorb and distribute forces in the spine. If the annulus fibrosus is torn, the nucleus pulposus may protrude through the tear and cause what is commonly known as a disc herniation. The likelihood of the nucleus pulposus leaking out depends on the severity of the tear in the annulus fibrosus. For the second question, I will research the effects of shampoo and Shikakai on hair thickness: Step 1: Research the ingredients and effects of shampoo on hair softness and thinness. Step 2: Research the Shikakai and its effects on hair thickness. Step 3: Compare and contrast the effects of shampoo and Shikakai on hair thickness. Output: Shampoo is typically used for cleaning hair, and it often contains ingredients that can make hair soft. It doesn't necessarily make hair thinner. Shikakai, on the other hand, is a natural ingredient used in hair care products and has been known for promoting hair thickness and strength. If your goal is to achieve thicker hair, then using Shikakai might be a better option compared to regular shampoos that do not specifically target hair thickness. As for whether the two questions are paraphrases of each other: No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question deals with the anatomy and consistency of spinal discs, while the second question is related to the effects of shampoo and Shikakai on hair thickness.

C., ambos comenzaron a construir la ciudad junto al Monte Palatino, cuando, según la leyenda, Rómulo mató a Remo por haber atravesado sacrílegamente el pomerium. Tras la fundación de la urbe, Rómulo invitó a criminales, esclavos huidos y exiliados para darles asilo en la nueva ciudad, llegando así a poblar cinco de las siete colinas de Roma. Para conseguir esposas a sus ciudadanos, Rómulo invitó a los sabinos a un festival, donde raptó a las mujeres sabinas y las llevó a Roma. Luego de la consiguiente guerra con los sabinos, Rómulo unió a los sabinos y a los romanos bajo el gobierno de una diarquía junto con el líder sabino Tito Tacio. QUESTION: ¿Por qué asesinó Rómulo a su hermano? A:","completion":"Rómulo mató a Remo por haber atravesado sacrílegamente el pomerium, un acto que violaba las leyes y costumbres sagradas en ese momento."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was sent out with no name on it, but it is under the heading \\"Standing Committee on Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders,\\" which is scheduled to meet today, November 23, at 4:30 p.m. The agenda has five items on it, four of which have nothing to do with a question of privilege. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"The details of the Committee were sent out anonymously \\"?","completion":"The process to conclude whether \\"The details of the Committee were sent out anonymously\\" based on the information provided in the paragraph is quite straightforward. Firstly, the paragraph specifies that the information \\"was sent out with no name on it,\\" which indicates that the sender did not identify themselves. This creates an immediate base for the belief that the information was indeed dispatched anonymously. Secondly, we determine the nature of the information that was sent out. According to the text, it pertains to the 'Standing Committee on Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders,' revealing that the details in consideration are regarding a committee meeting. The paragraph mentions the meeting's schedule and its agenda, which are substantive and precise details. However, it's important to remember that an anonymous dispatch doesn't necessarily mean there's a lack of confidential sender information. The unidentified sender could be an implied given (e.g., a known secretary of the committee, an automated system), which would not typically 'sign' their emails or notifications. To sum up, concluding just from the details given in the paragraph without additional context, we can infer that the details of the Committee were indeed sent out anonymously as there is no name attached to the message. We must consider, though, there might be additional information not provided that could influence this conclusion."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

It is the most recent branch of the U.S. military to be formed , and is the largest and one of the world 's most technologically advanced air forces . The USAF articulates its core functions as Nuclear Deterrence Operations , Special Operations , Air Superiority , Global Integrated ISR , Space Superiority , Command and Control , Cyberspace Superiority , Personnel Recovery , Global Precision Attack , Building Partnerships , Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support . The U.S. Air Force is a military service organized within the Department of the Air Force , one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense . The Air Force is headed by the civilian Secretary of the Air Force , who reports to the Secretary of Defense , and is appointed by the President with Senate confirmation . The highest - ranking military officer in the Department of the Air Force is the Chief of Staff of the Air Force , who exercises supervision over Air Force units , and serves as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Air Force combat and mobility forces are assigned , as directed by the Secretary of Defense , to the Combatant Commanders , and neither the Secretary of the Air Force nor the Chief of Staff have operational command authority over them . The U.S. Air Force provides air support for surface forces and aids in the recovery of troops in the field .

It has a 140 billion budget with 309,339 active duty personnel , 185,522 civilian personnel , 71,400 Air Force Reserve personnel , and 106,700 Air National Guard personnel . - The First Barbary War (18011805), also known as the Tripolitanian War and the Barbary Coast War, was the first of two Barbary Wars between the United States, Sweden and the four North African states known collectively as the \\"Barbary States\\". Three of these were nominal provinces of the Ottoman Empire, but in practice autonomous: Tripoli, Algiers, and Tunis. The fourth was the independent Sultanate of Morocco. The cause of the war was pirates from the Barbary States seizing American merchant ships and holding the crews for ransom, demanding the U.S. pay tribute to the Barbary rulers. United States President Thomas Jefferson refused to pay this tribute, in addition the Swedes had been at war with the Tripolitans since 1800. - The Congress of the Confederation, or the Confederation Congress, formally referred to as the United States in Congress Assembled, was the governing body of the United States of America that existed from March 1, 1781, to March 4, 1789. It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States fought from 1861 to 1865. The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America. The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history. - The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period (the second half of the 20th century) between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed. - The Army of the United States or Armies of the United States is the legal name of the \\"land forces of the United States\\" (United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001) and has been used in this context since at least 1841, as in the title: \\"General Regulations for the Army of the United States\\". The Army, or Armies of the United States includes: the Regular Army, Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve, (as well as any volunteer or conscripted forces). - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following World War II. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense. - The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also referred to as the American War of Independence and the Revolutionary War in the United States, was an armed conflict between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies that after onset of the war declared independence as the United States of America. - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. - The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the colonies that became the United States of America. Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war. - The Code of Laws of the United States of America (variously abbreviated to Code of Laws of the United States, United States Code, U.S. Code, or U.S.C.) is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes of the United States. It contains 52 titles, and a further three titles have been proposed. The main edition is published every six years by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives, and cumulative supplements are published annually. The official version of those laws not codified in the United States Code can be found in United States Statutes at Large. - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has...

A native of Canton, Ohio, Dierdorf played college football for the University of Michigan from 1968 to 1970 and was selected as a consensus first-team All-American in 1970 and a first-team All-Big Ten Conference player in 1969 and 1970. He was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1996 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2000. Dierdorf played professional football in National Football League (NFL) with the St. Louis Cardinals for 13 seasons from 1971 to 1983. From 1974 to 1976, Dierdorf started every game at right tackle for the Cardinals during a three-year span in which the team compiled records of 10-4, 11-3, and 10-4 under head coach Don Coryell. In 1977, Dierdorf sustained a broken jaw and missed two games to injury as the Cardinals fell to 7-7. In 1978, Dierdorf started all 16 games at right tackle for the Cardinals. During his peak years from 1974 to 1978, Dierdorf was regarded as one of the best offensive lineman in the NFL. He was selected by the National Football League Players Association as the Offensive Lineman of the Year for three consecutive years from 1976 to 1978. The Cardinals' offensive line, led by Dierdorf, Conrad Dobler, and Tom Banks, led the NFL with the fewest sacks allowed for three years (and the National Football Conference for five years) in the mid-1970s. In 1975, the group set an NFL record, allowing only eight sacks in 14 games. Dierdorf did not allow a sack during the entire 1976 and 1977 seasons. His streak ended in the first game of the 1978 season when Chicago Bears defensive end Tommy Hart tallied two sacks against Dierdorf. Dierdorf had not given up a sack since the 1975 NFC Divisional playoff game when Jack Youngblood sacked Jim Hart. Dierdorf was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for five consecutive years from 1974 to 1978. Dierdorf also received first-team All-NFL honors as follows: in 1975 from the Pro Football Writers Association (PFWA); in 1976 from the Associated Press (AP), PFWA, Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), and Pro Football Weekly (PFW); in 1977 from AP, PFWA, NEA, and PFW; and in 1978 from AP, PFWA, NEA, PFW. He was named as the NFC choice for the NFLPA/Coca-Cola Offensive Lineman of the Year Award three straight years (1976-78) and was the Seagram's Seven Crowns of Sports Offensive Lineman of the Year in 1975. He also won the Forrest Gregg Award for NFL Offensive Lineman of the Year in 1975. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: during a three-year span in what?","completion":"During a three-year span from 1974 to 1976, Daniel Lee Dierdorf started every game at right tackle for the St. Louis Cardinals.

The Cardinals' offensive line, which Dierdorf was a key part of, led the NFL with the fewest sacks allowed for three years during this time. The strong performance of the team showcases Dierdorf's substantial contribution and solidifies his position as one of the finest offensive linemen of that era in the NFL. With Dierdorf's participation, the group even set an NFL record in 1975 by allowing only eight sacks in 14 games. During this peak period, Dierdorf was recognized by the National Football League Players Association as the Offensive Lineman of the Year for three consecutive years from 1976 to 1978. Besides these, he showed a remarkable ability by not allowing a sack during the entire 1976 and 1977 seasons. His streak ended in the first game of the 1978 season though. The NFL recognized Dierdorf's talent and he was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for five consecutive years, spanning from 1974 to 1978. Alongside these recognitions, Dierdorf received first-team All-NFL honors multiple times from various associations including the Associated Press (AP), Pro Football Writers Association (PFWA), Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), and Pro Football Weekly (PFW). He was also named as the NFC choice for the NFLPA/Coca-Cola Offensive Lineman of the Year Award three straight years from 1976 to 1978, and won the Seagram's Seven Crowns of Sports Offensive Lineman of the Year in 1975 and the Forrest Gregg Award for NFL Offensive Lineman of the Year in the same year. In summary, Dierdorf's career from 1974 to 1976 was a period of remarkable athletic achievement, during which he demonstrated exceptional skill as an offensive lineman and contributed significantly to the success of the St. Louis Cardinals. His accolades from this period reflect his extraordinary capabilities as an athlete and validate his standing as one of the greatest football players of his time."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: What do you think of black cats? Are they unluckier than cats of other colors? Many people in Western countries think so. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), did a study on cat colours and people's understandings of cat personalities. The study found that people do judge cat personalities by color. Scientists did a survey on the Internet. There were 49 statements matching five cat colorings with 10 personalities. People think orange and bi-coloured cats are friendly, tri-coloured cats are not generous, and white cats are calm, lazy and shy. As for black cats, people think they don't have special personalities. But why do so many people dislike keeping black cats as pets? People think black cats have less special personalities, which might be because of their bad reputation . They think black cats may bring bad luck, especially at Halloween. Movies and television shows also make people believe that. Although people have these ideas, UC Berkeley scientists give another reason: people don't think black cats are pretty enough. After all, nothing can show black cats are unluckier than other cats. \\"You can't judge a cat by its colour, because it's the personality of the cat, not the colour, that will let you know if the cat is right for you,\\" Cathy Marden, a scientist said.

Background: Richard Lester Meyers (born October 2, 1949), better known by his stage name Richard Hell, is an American singer, songwriter, bass guitarist and writer. Richard Hell was an innovator of punk music and fashion. He was one of the first to spike his hair and wear torn, cut and drawn-on shirts, often held together with safety pins. Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, credited Hell as a source of inspiration for the Sex Pistols' look and attitude, as well as the safety-pin and graphics accessorized clothing that McLaren sold in his London shop, Sex. Context: Richard Lester Meyers grew up in Lexington, Kentucky in 1949. His father, a secular Jew, was an experimental psychologist, researching animal behavior. He died when Hell was 7 years old. Hell was then raised by his mother, who came from Methodists of Welsh and English ancestry. After her husband's death, she returned to school and became a professor. Hell attended the Sanford School in Delaware for one year, where he became friends with Tom Miller, who later changed his name to Tom Verlaine. They ran away from school together and a short time later were arrested in Alabama for arson and vandalism. Hell never finished high school, instead moving to New York City to make his way as a poet. In New York he met fellow young poet David Giannini, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico for several months, where Giannini and Meyers co-founded Genesis:Grasp. They used an AM VariTyper with changeable fonts to publish the magazine. They began publishing books and magazines, but decided to go their separate ways in 1971, after which Hell created and published Dot Books. Before he was 21, his own poems were published in numerous periodicals, ranging from Rolling Stone to the New Directions Annuals. In 1971, along with Verlaine, Hell also published under the pseudonym Theresa Stern, a fictional poet whose photo was actually a combination of both his and Verlaine's faces in drag, superimposed over one another to create a new identity. A book of poems credited to \\"Stern\\", Wanna Go Out?, was released by Dot in 1973. Question: What was Hell's early life like? Answer:","completion":"Hell's early life was marked by both challenges and creativity. Born as Richard Lester Meyers in Lexington, Kentucky in 1949, he experienced the loss of his father, an experimental psychologist, at the age of 7. Raised by his mother, who later became a professor, Hell attended the Sanford School in Delaware for a year. It was there that he met Tom Miller (later Tom Verlaine), with whom he formed a strong friendship. Hell's rebellious spirit was evident early on, as he and Verlaine ran away from school together and got arrested for arson and vandalism in Alabama. Choosing not to finish high school, Hell pursued a path as a poet and moved to New York City. In New York, he connected with fellow young poet David Giannini, and together they co-founded Genesis:Grasp, a publication venture based in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Despite parting ways in 1971, Hell continued to develop his creative pursuits by founding and publishing Dot Books. His poetry was published in various periodicals before he turned 21, showing his early dedication to the craft. Additionally, Hell and Verlaine created a fictional poet named Theresa Stern, showcasing their inclination toward experimentation and artistic expression."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If And instead of throwing these questions at Alan Greenspan, Congress should be answering them itself., can we conclude that \\"Congress should answer questions instead of Alan Greenspan.\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the statement provided, one can conclude that \\"Congress should answer questions instead of Alan Greenspan.\\" However, it is important to evaluate the context and reasoning behind such a statement before forming a comprehensive understanding of the intended message. Alan Greenspan served as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve of the United States from 1987 to 2006. As the chief monetary policy maker, Greenspan played a significant role in shaping the U.S. economy. Due to his influential position, it's understandable that he would often be questioned about various economic issues. However, the statement seems to suggest that Congress, as the body responsible for creating legislation and representing the will of the people, should be held accountable for addressing certain questions rather than placing the burden solely on Greenspan. The statement may have stemmed from the idea that Congress, being the legislative branch of the government, is responsible for making laws related to the economy, fiscal policy, and other matters governing the lives of its citizens. As representatives of the people, members of Congress are elected to serve the public interest and make informed decisions addressing their concerns. This places the responsibility on Congress to be accountable for their actions and policies. Meanwhile, Alan Greenspan as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, held a role primarily focused on implementing monetary policies and maintaining economic stability, rather than shaping or answering for the broader legislative decisions made by Congress. Comparing the responsibilities of the two entities, it can be argued that Congress should indeed be responsible for answering questions related to the decisions and policies they have enacted, which ultimately shape the economy and the lives of its citizens. While Greenspan played a crucial role in managing economic stability, the responsibility of enacting policies and being accountable for them ultimately lies with Congress. Therefore, one can conclude that the statement \\"Congress should answer questions instead of Alan Greenspan\\" carries weight. This idea highlights the importance of holding elected representatives accountable for their policy decisions, rather than placing blame or responsibility on individuals like Greenspan working within the constraints of the monetary system established by Congress. In the interest of democracy and ensuring the fair representation of its citizens, it is essential for Congress to answer questions and make decisions that reflect the will of the people it serves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I was about 14 and lived near a large tract of undeveloped land where people would go and park to fool around. There was a dirt road through the tract, but further down, it crossed two huge concrete pipes. The dirt was washed out between them, and the deep gulch made it impossible to cross in a car. Sometimes, eight or ten of us would go looking for parked cars. If we found one or more, we would go move this incredibly heavy stump onto the road and lay a telephone pole across it. It took all of us and it was incredibly heavy. It was impossible to drive around it because of the ditches and there was no way two or three people could move it. We'd go back to the car and set off a big string of fire crackers or shake the cat and slap on it and run like crazy. We'd watch from the woods as they drove like heck and come to a screeching stop at our roadblock. The guy would get out and try to lift the pole. Never happen. Then the car would drive the other way. That wouldn't happen because of the pipes. We'd go home leaving them in there. This was before cell phones, and it was miles to a pay phone. We'd go back the next day and find the stump and pole moved. We thought it was real funny until one night we set it up and beat on the trunk of a car. A couple was inside, getting it on. We hadn't noticed a guy sitting on the hood with a bottle of booze and a pistol. As we ran, he was shooting and we could hear bullets going through the underbrush. No one was hit, thank goodness. That was the end of that stunt. Question: Who engaged in this occasional stunt? Options: A. A group of eight or ten youths B. The man with the gun C.

If I tell you that Cypress produce seeds in cones, and ask you the question \\"how do cypress produce seeds?\\", is the correct answer \\"rings\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"rings.\\" To offer a more detailed explanation of how cypress trees produce seeds, let's take a closer look at the reproduction process of these fascinating plants. Cypress trees are coniferous, which means they are cone-bearing plants. The cones are the reproductive structures for these trees, and they come in two types: male and female cones. Thus, cypress trees can be considered a gymnosperm, meaning they have uncovered or \\"naked\\" seeds, as opposed to angiosperms, which produce seeds enclosed in a fruit. Male cones, known as pollen cones or microstrobili, contain pollen sacs that produce and release pollen. Pollen grains are the male gametophytes, and they carry the sperm cells necessary for fertilization. Male cones typically appear as small and cylindrical structures, often yellow or brown in color, and are usually clustered together on the branches of the tree. Female cones, or seed cones, also known as megastrobili, are the structures that house the seeds. They consist of a number of overlapping, protective scales called sporophylls. Each sporophyll contains an ovule, which will eventually become a seed once fertilization occurs. Female cones are generally larger than male cones and can range in shape from round to elongated, depending on the cypress species. The process of seed production in cypress trees involves the following steps: 1. Pollination: Wind carries pollen from male cones to female cones, resulting in pollination. This process usually occurs during the spring. 2. Fertilization: Once the pollen grain reaches the ovule within the female cone, it forms a pollen tube that allows sperm cells to travel towards the egg and fertilize it. This event may take several months to occur. 3. Seed development: After fertilization, the ovule becomes a seed, and the protective sporophylls of the female cone enclose it. The female cone begins to mature and harden as the seeds develop. 4. Seed dispersal: Mature female cones release their seeds, which are often enclosed within a protective, wing-like structure that aids in their dispersal by wind, water, or animals. This can take anywhere from a few months to several years, depending on the cypress species. 5. Germination and growth: Once the seeds are dispersed and find a suitable environment, they will germinate and begin the process of growing into a new cypress tree. In summary, cypress trees produce seeds through a complex process that involves the formation of male and female cones, pollination, fertilization, seed development, and ultimately seed dispersal and germination. The term \\"rings\\" does not accurately describe this process. Instead, it is essential to understand the different reproductive structures and the steps involved in the life cycle of a cypress tree."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Renegade KGB agents hijack a plutonium shipment inside the United States and use it to plant a nuclear device in the Saudi Arabian Ghawar oilfield. They threaten to detonate it, thereby contaminating 50% of the world's oil reserve, unless Israel withdraws its settlements from the West Bank. The fact that the KGB is behind this threat is unknown, as the culprits are believed by the Israelis and Americans to be Islamic fundamentalist extremists. The American president contemplates starting a war with Israel, in order to save the world from oil crisis. The director of the CIA offers the president an alternative solution. A CIA agent codenamed The Soldier (Ken Wahl), working outside the usual channels, is assigned to the case. After Russian agent Dracha (Klaus Kinski) attempts to terminate him, he contacts the CIA director from the US embassy in Berlin. A KGB agent assassinates the director and frames The Soldier for his murder, leaving no official knowledge of his activities other than the president, who has disavowed any knowledge of his actions. On the run from his own government, he seeks refuge in the Israeli embassy. He and his team cooperate with the Israeli Mossad, represented by their director of covert operations Susan Goodman (Alberta Watson). Meanwhile, the president authorizes military action against Israel. Given the unpleasant options of the KGB destroying a large part of the world's oil supply or the United States having to invoke a military response to force Israel to remove its settlements from the West Bank, the title character decides to take a third option.

Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"Yes, the answer correctly identifies Monopoly as the popular board game that uses the names of many properties near Atlantic City. Monopoly is a classic board game created by the Parker Brothers and later acquired by Hasbro. The game has its roots in the early 20th century and has since become a cultural icon, with multiple versions and editions reflecting various regions, themes, and franchises. In the U.S. version of Monopoly, the game board features a total of 22 colored streets, four railway stations, two utility companies, and numerous other spaces. The properties on the game board are named after actual streets, locations, and landmarks in and around Atlantic City, New Jersey. Some prominent properties named after Atlantic City locations include: 1. Boardwalk: The most expensive property in the game, this represents the Atlantic City Boardwalk, an iconic pedestrian promenade that stretches along the beachfront and is lined with shops, restaurants, amusement parks, and hotels. 2. Park Place: The second most expensive property, it is named after a major street in Atlantic City that runs parallel to the Boardwalk. 3. Ventnor, Marvin Gardens, and Atlantic Avenues: These names are associated with the yellow color group in the game and are all derived from streets in Atlantic City. 4. Baltic and Mediterranean Avenues: The cheapest properties in the game are also named after streets in Atlantic City. Moreover, the four railway stations are named after real-life American railroad companies—Reading Railroad, Pennsylvania Railroad, B&O (Baltimore and Ohio) Railroad, and the Short Line. The utility companies, Water Works and Electric Company, are named after the main utilities that would have been prevalent when the game was first created in the 1930s. Throughout its history, Monopoly has been adapted to reflect various cities, countries, and themes. However, the Atlantic City version remains one of the most recognized and classic editions of the game, as it pays homage to the city's early 20th-century heyday as a bustling tourist destination and provides players with an engaging way to experience the thrill of buying, trading, and developing properties."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is a pretty fast and enjoyable crime thriller based on Ira Levin's play about two gay playwrights (Caine and Reeve) that plot the murder of one's rich wife (Cannon) to get the property and the insurance. The plot succeeds but Christopher Reeve as the younger and less established of the two writers decides to make a play out of the actual murder -- with only slight changes in the details. Reeve allows that Easthampton, Long Island, can become Southampton, Long Island, in the script, for instance. The rest of the play's plot is a dead giveaway and to tell the truth Reeve doesn't mind a little gossip or even an inquiry into Cannon's apparently accidental death. It will boost the revenues and his own Warhol quotient. Michael Caine is Sidney Bruhl, the megabucks-making playwright whose last four productions bombed and who would like nothing more than to quietly get back to working on a new play, perhaps with Reeve's input, that would redeem his reputation. He cannot permit Reeve's scandalous play-a-clef to be produced. So -- what else? -- he tries to murder him. In the end they wind up killing one another, the manuscript is appropriated by their neighbor, the psychic Helga Tensdoorp, and she makes a million bucks selling it to Broadway. It's a lot of fun for a number of reasons. One is the production design. That multi-roomed, multi-storied house with the big windmill atop, situated on nine of what must be the most valuable acres on earth (Easthampton!) would be a splendid set of digs anywhere. You wouldn't be able to afford a pup tent in Easthamptom. The house is not overly large or baroque in its decor. It's just magnificently modest, although it's a little tidy for my tastes, the kind of house that's so clean you're afraid to step on the thick carpet for fear of leaving the imprint of a foot. Next, the acting could hardly be improved upon. Caine, Cannon, and Fred Jones are superb. Dyan Cannon gives a pitch-perfect performance as the anxious wife whose slacks are so tight they look as if they'd been sprayed on, which is okay given her assets. Even Reeve, whose talent was limited, seems to find a comfortable niche in his role of affable but psychopathic murderer. Irene Worth, as the psychic neighbor Helga, was in some way hard to define, a mistake. Granted she -- or someone like her -- was necessary to the plot, but, my God, what an offensive snoop her character is, going around and claiming, \\"I feel pain in zis woom!\\" I suppose in order to make her a little more interesting, she's got up in sweats and a goofy looking cap with bicycle reflectors on it. Still, she's a nuisance from beginning to end. You have to love Ira Levin's bitchy dialog. The distraught Caine begs Reeve to tell him why he wrote the tell-all play. \\"Because it's THERE, Sidney!\\" says Reeve, and Caine shouts, \\"That's MOUNTAINS, not PLAYS! Plays aren't there until some ***hole WRITES them!\\" Great too is Caine's call to the police after his wife drops dead of fright, as planned. He works himself up into a torrent of sobs, barely able to speak, as he reports the incident and implores that an ambulance be sent immediately. When he hangs up, his face assumes its usual placid expression, he blows his nose into his handkerchief, and walks away, all business again. The climax, though suitably ironic, is confusing and noisy and full of artifice, lacking in the wicked charm that Levin and Lumet brought to the earlier scenes.

Ever since this place opened up, the lines have always extended all the way out pass the door. So I was never able to give this place a try. That was true, until a couple of days ago. My siblings and I finally decided to give this place a chance and see what all the hype is about. When we arrived, we were happy to see that the line wasn't long! Before paying, you have to get your drink first which I felt slowed down the line. We grabbed our cups and my sister's cup had a lipstick stain on it!!! That's disgusting and makes me wonder how well they wash their dishes. She told one of the employees about it and the employee had nothing to say. Not even an apology. We reached the cashier and she charged all of us with senior discount by mistake. A mistake we only caught after we had already paid. We were led to our seats, and the first thing we noticed was the foul odor coming from the area where the employees refill drinks for you. The odor made our experience eating here so much more worse. The food here is extremely mediocre and salty. Listen up folks, if you have diabetes, or high blood pressure you better run for the hills because this place puts a whole lot of salt in their food and a lot of sugar in the desserts. And for those who continue to eat here, you better be careful! I am disappointed by the quality of the food. With this buffet, it's quantity over quality. It's not about how good the food tastes, but how many plates you can eat. I honestly could not finish the food on my plate because it was THAT bad. Take my advice, don't waste your time or money here! It is spent better elsewhere. I know, \\"You get what you pay for.\\" but that doesn't mean the food has to taste terrible.

CONTEXT: El ministerio para la Igualdad de Oportunidades va a llevar a cabo una campaña para facilitar que las prostitutas dejen esa actividad, se anunció hoy, viernes. La campaña, que entrará en vigor en el transcurso de este mes, constará de 49 proyectos presentados por instituciones públicas y privadas, con un presupuesto de 16.000 millones de liras (unos ocho millones de dólares). A través de redes de asistencia se intentará dar oportunidades a estas mujeres para que puedan desarrollar otras tareas y que dejen de ser explotadas sexualmente, fenómeno que es creciente en el caso de muchas extranjeras que llegan a Italia procedentes de países del este de Europa. Solamente en Roma hay 3.500 extranjeras que se dedican a la prostitución, seguida de Milán con 2.500 mujeres, según datos del Observatorio del Servicio de Medicina Preventiva del Hospital San Gallicano, de la capital italiana. En su estudio, el Hospital llegó a la conclusión de que más de la mitad de las prostitutas sufría la explotación por parte de terceros y que cerca de un veinte por ciento eran menores de edad. Para facilitar la campaña del Ministerio se pondrá en marcha un número de información, al que podrán llamar las propias prostitutas o quienes deseen ayudarlas y que estará activo las 24 horas del día, según se puso de manifiesto hoy durante un seminario sobre \\"prostitución y criminalidad\\" que se celebra en Roma. En el seminario participó la presidenta de la Comisión sobre la Prostitución del Ministerio, Vittoria Tola, quien explicó que las personas que atenderán el teléfono tendrán una preparación específica para atender a esas mujeres y además hablarán varios idiomas, con objeto de poder dialogar con las extranjeras. En el caso de este segmento, la campaña prevé la posibilidad de facilitarles el regreso a su país de origen o bien intentar proporcionarles en Italia una colocación estable y la obtención de un permiso legal de residencia.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: \\"Inside the Corridors of Dewsbury: An Insight into 'Educating Yorkshire'\\" 'Educating Yorkshire', a British documentary series, provides viewers an unprecedented insight into the day-to-day activities of a traditional comprehensive in Dewsbury. Famed for demystifying the complexity of school life, the series brings raw accounts of students' lives, teacher's challenges and the intricacies of the UK's education system to the fore. The series was filmed at Thornhill Community Academy situated in the heart of Dewsbury, a town that has experienced its fair share of socioeconomic challenges. It subtly reveals these struggles and intricately sketches how the school and the community find a balance. One of the main highlights of 'Educating Yorkshire' is the intriguing blend of stubborn intensity and nurturing compassion exhibited by the protagonists. The staff, led by the charismatic head, Mr. Jonny Mitchell, show an unwavering commitment to raising educational standards and developing confident, responsible young people equipped to face the complexities of the world. The teachers are portrayed as relatable and human, facing frustration when students don't meet expectations, yet also showcasing a fervent determination not to give up on their pupils. This narrative provides a refreshing departure from stereotypical representations, offering insight into the emotional roller-coaster that teaching can often be. 'Educating Yorkshire' does not shy away from addressing the complex issues many students face, both in and out of school. From tackling bullying, behavioural issues, learning difficulties to endeavours of fitting in, it balances moments of heartbreak and triumph. A particular standing achievement of the series is the portrayal of the pupil Musharaf 'Mushy' Asghar. Mushy's monumental struggle and eventual triumph over his speech impediment is a tear-jerking display of perseverance, aptly demonstrating the pivotal role educators play in shaping the lives of their students. Evocatively, the series captures the unsung resilience of students who, in spite of various obstacles, strive for academic success. It showcases the diversity within the student population and demonstrates how pupils - each with unique backgrounds, aspirations, strengths, and struggles - navigate their formative years at Thornhill. Equally, 'Educating Yorkshire' addresses contemporary societal concerns including race, religion, familial complications and more. Regardless of the struggles the students face, the immutable bond between them is palpable. The series expertly portrays how these ties strengthen in the face of adversity, creating an overarching theme of unity and camaraderie. In a nutshell, 'Educating Yorkshire' provides an inevitable look inside modern British comprehensive education. The unfiltered experiences, emotions, and highs and lows of students, teachers and parents in this show offer much food for thought. Most importantly, it underscores the pivotal role of a holistic, understanding approach to education. It showcases the power of patience, perseverance, and nurturing a supportive learning environment. It is not without reason that the series has been extended to its multiple seasons. Wrapped in humour, sorrow, suspense and life lessons, 'Educating Yorkshire' grips the viewer's heart. It makes you smile, cry and most importantly, leaves you with a newfound respect for those who devote their lives to nurturing future generations.

The Washington Supreme Court is asking the Legislature to approve a 90 surcharge on a court filing fee to help provide legal help for the poor in civil cases, Chief Justice Gerry Alexander said Wednesday. \\"Some might say, why should we support this when we face tough financial times?\\" Alexander asked in his State of the Judiciary address to a joint session of the Legislature. \\"It seems to me in America, where we rejoice in the fact that we are a nation devoted to the rule of law, we should not ration access to justice.\\" The recommendation comes from the court's Task Force on Civil Equal Justice Funding, created in 2001 to look for ways to cope with the sparse amount of money available for such cases. As the task force was studying the issue, 900,000 was cut from state support for civil equal justice services. That prompted the state's two main legal services providers - Columbia Legal Services and Northwest Justice Project - to cut their staffs, Alexander said. The change would increase the cost of filing a lawsuit in Superior Court to 200. The total fee would be split, with 54 percent going to counties and 46 percent going to the state for a newly created equal justice account. Alexander also requested money for five additional Superior Court judgeships and one additional District Court judgeships, arguing that increased caseloads require more judges. Two of the Superior Court judges and the District Court judge would be in Clark County, with one Superior Court judge added in the joint district that serves Benton and Franklin counties and one each in Kittitas and Kitsap counties.

The vicious battle over the 300 million estate of late copper heiress Huguette Clark has been settled out of court at the eleventh hour - leaving her faithful nurse with nothing. The 40-page settlement was signed moments before jury selection was to begin on Tuesday and the judge in Surrogate's Court in Lower Manhattan accepted the deal, ruling out a trial. Clark, who was the daughter of former. U.S. Senator William Clark, died aged 104 in May 2011 and 19 of her distant. relatives have been battling over the fortune ever since. Clark had written two wills in 2005 and the relatives claimed she was not lucid when she wrote the second, which cut them out. Today's settlement combines elements from the two contradictory wills. The family - many of whom Clark never even met - came out as the winners, receiving 34 million while her private nurse of 20 years, Hadassah Peri, was left with nothing. Peri, an immigrant from the Philippines who worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week for Clark as she lived in New York hospitals, had originally been given 30 million in Clark's final will. Peri had also been given 30 million in gifts throughout Clark's life. A separate deal ordered her to pay 5 million of these back to the estate after the attorney general's office deemed them excessive. However, the settlement stops Clark's relatives trying to get any more of these gifts, NBC reported. Cut out: Hadassah Peri worked as Clark's nurse for 20 years and was left 30 million in her final will - but the settlement says that she will now receive none of this and must return 5 million worth of gifts. The gifts included. multiple Manhattan apartments and a 1.2 million Stradivarius violin. Her primary doctor also received cash Christmas presents totaling 500,000,. among other gifts. Peri's attorney, Harvey Corn, read a statement after the settlement emerged, reading: 'The Peri family is very happy to. contribute to the settlement of the litigations involving Madame Clark. in the hope that it will allow Madame Clark to retain whatever privacy. that she has left. 'The Peri family was blessed to have met Madame Clark. and she will always be in their thoughts and prayers.' The relatives who were arguing for the money are the great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren of Huguette's father from his first marriage. They do not need to pay legal fees in the case as the estate will cover the 11.5 million cost. Family wealth: Clark hugs her father on a vacation in Connecticut in 1912. The relatives who argued for the fortune are the great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren of Huguette's father from his first marriage. The 40-page settlement that was accepted in Manhattan's Surrogate's Court on Tuesday combines elements from Huguette Clark's two wills from 2005 and includes:. 34.5 million for Clark's relatives - many of whom had never met the heiress. 11.5 million for the relatives' legal fees. 85 million home in Santa Barbara, California and Clark's art collection to be controlled by an arts foundation, the Bellosguardo Foundation, which was set up by the will. 4.5 million cash for the art foundation. 1.7 million doll collection for the art foundation. 3.5 million for Clark's goddaughter, Wanda Styka, who wrote to her throughout her life. 10 million for the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. 1 million for the Beth Israel Medical Center, where Clark lived for 20 years. 0 for Hadassah Peri, the private nurse who had originally been in line for 30 million. She must also pay back 5 million in gifts. 0 for Clark's attorney, Wallace Bock, and her accountant, Irving Kamsler, who had been in line for 500,000. The settlement also sets up an arts foundation. that will control the Clark family's 85 million summer home in Santa Barbara, California - making it the will's largest beneficiary, as Clark had wished. But rather than being set up in California, as she had asked, the foundation will in fact be in New York. Seats are reserved for the. Santa Barbara community and Clark's relatives. Her attorney, Wallace Bock, and her accountant, Irving Kamsler, will also get nothing after originally receiving 500,000 in the will and will no longer be executors of her estate, which would have paid each around 3 million, NBC reported. A criminal investigation of Clark's finances found there was no reason to charge either with a crime but the deal does allow the family to sue the duo, who were suspended from their posts for allegedly wasting her assets, for malpractice. Others will receive the amount dictated by the final will, including Clark's doctor, Henry Singman, who will receive 100,000, her goddaughter, Wanda Styka, who will receive 3.5 million, and Clark's personal assistant, Chris Sattler, who will receive 500,000. Tuesday's settlement drew an appeal. from one group that was cut out of the negotiations, meaning it could. have to be redrawn, but by accepting it, the judge warded off an. eight-week trial. The first. will drawn up in 2005, when she was 98, left 5 million to her nurse and. the rest to her relatives. The second, more detailed will, drawn six. weeks later, cut out her relatives entirely. Estate: 19 fought for a share of Clark's lavish 300 million estate. Pictured, inside her Manhattan home. The relatives had said that. a coterie of hospital executives, medical professionals and Clark's. lawyer and accountant took advantage of their access to the secluded,. aged heiress to manipulate their way into her millions of dollars. But the beneficiaries had argued that Clark was simply a generous woman who wanted to help those who helped her. Clark's. father, U.S. Sen. William A. Clark, was one of the richest Americans of. the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He served as a senator from. Montana, where he initially made his fortune from copper mines. His. business empire later grew to include building a Western rail line and. establishing a Nevada railroad town called Las Vegas. The surrounding. Clark County is named for him. Settled: The settlement was accepted by a judge at Manhattan's Surrogate's Court on Tuesday. Clark owned lavish properties. from New York's Fifth Avenue to the California coast but opted to spend. her last 20 years in a Manhattan hospital. While she stayed at the hospital, her. three fabulous homes sat empty: the 100million Bellosguardo estate, a. 24million country house in Connecticut and a 100million co-op, the. largest apartment on Fifth Avenue overlooking Central Park. When she died two weeks shy of her 105th birthday the only people present at her burial were funeral home employees. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Answer: A:","completion":"Based on the provided review, it can be inferred that the user would likely not wholeheartedly recommend this product to others. The reviewer mentions that the ball is \\"workable,\\" which implies that it may serve its intended purpose to a certain extent. However, this statement alone might not be enough to suggest a positive recommendation. The reviewer goes on to describe the ball as \\"quite deformed,\\" likening its shape to the planet Jupiter bulging out at the equator. This clearly indicates an issue with the product's quality and its ability to meet the user's expectations in terms of appearance and, possibly, functionality. The phrase \\"but not equally in all directions\\" further emphasizes the imperfections in the ball's shape as it points out its uneven and irregular deformities. Taking both the positive and negative aspects of the review into account, it can be concluded that the user finds the product workable but flawed, which may not be a strong selling point for potential buyers. Although the reviewer does not explicitly state whether or not they would recommend the product, their description of its imperfections suggests that they might be hesitant to do so, or at least would likely warn others about the shape issues before suggesting its purchase. In summary, based on this review, the user's recommendation of the product would likely be hesitant or conditional, as they find it workable but are clearly dissatisfied with its deformed shape. This suggests that prospective buyers should consider these factors and weigh the product's functionality against its aesthetic and quality shortcomings before making a purchase decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Frustrated and disheartened, she leaned against a nearby pillar as she closed her eyes and took a few deep breaths, trying to gather her thoughts and figure out what to do next. The hustle and bustle of the train station seemed to mock her failure, with people rushing past her on their way to catch their own trains or waiting patiently for the arrival of loved ones. As much as she wanted to wallow in her misery, she knew that she had to come up with an alternative plan to reach her destination, since there was no point in dwelling on what could have been. Pulling herself together, she walked towards the train station's information desk, where she spoke to a friendly attendant who informed her that the next train headed to her destination would be leaving in an hour. While it was far from ideal, it did provide her with a glimmer of hope – perhaps she could still make it in time for the important meeting she had been so anxious not to miss. However, she knew that merely waiting anxiously for the next train would not do her any good. Instead, she decided to use this unexpected free time to her advantage, searching for a quiet corner in the train station to review the meeting materials that lay securely in her bag. While it was difficult to stay focused amidst the noises and distractions of the busy train station, she managed to find a semi-quiet spot where she could read through her notes, practice her presentation, and ensure that her arguments were crystal clear. By the time the next train arrived, she felt more prepared than ever before – the unfortunate missed train had inadvertently provided her with extra time for memorization and last adjustments. As she boarded the train, she couldn't help but feel a strange sense of gratitude for the missed connection earlier. Certainly, it had been a stressful morning, but in the end, it had led to an unforeseen opportunity to refine her work and boost her confidence. As the train started to pull away from the station, the landscape outside the window began to blur, and her heart raced with equal parts excitement and nervousness. Despite the initial setback, she was now more determined than ever to make the meeting a success and prove that she could turn any adversity into an opportunity for growth. With a newfound sense of confidence, she settled into her train seat, eager to embrace whatever challenges lay ahead."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Burke was not merely presenting a peace agreement to Parliament; rather, he stepped forward with four reasons against using force, carefully reasoned. He laid out his objections in an orderly manner, focusing on one before moving to the next. His first concern was that the use of force would have to be temporary, and that the uprisings and objections to British governance in America would not be. Second, Burke worried about the uncertainty surrounding whether Britain would win a conflict in America. \\"An armament\\", Burke said, \\"is not a victory\\". Third, Burke brought up the issue of impairment; it would do the British Government no good to engage in a scorched earth war and have the object they desired (America) become damaged or even useless. The American colonists could always retreat into the mountains, but the land they left behind would most likely be unusable, whether by accident or design. The fourth and final reason to avoid the use of force was experience; the British had never attempted to rein in an unruly colony by force, and they did not know if it could be done, let alone accomplished thousands of miles away from home. Not only were all of these concerns reasonable, but some turned out to be prophetic – the American colonists did not surrender, even when things looked extremely bleak, and the British were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempts to win a war fought on American soil. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What area could the American colonists retreat to?","completion":"The American colonists could retreat to the Appalachian Mountains. The mountain range offered a natural barrier and provided a strategic advantage for the colonists, as it was difficult for the invading British forces to traverse and maintain supply lines. This terrain allowed the colonists to regroup, engage in guerrilla warfare, and continue their resistance against British rule."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -5 - 5 = 2*l for l.","completion":"Alright, let's solve this step by step, like we are walking through a fun puzzle. We have the math problem: -5 - 5 = 2 * l First, let's do the subtraction on the left side of the equation: -5 - 5 means we have -5 and we take away 5 more. So, think of it like having 5 less than zero and then taking away 5 more. That would leave us with -10. So now, our math problem looks like this: -10 = 2 * l Now, we are trying to find the value of 'l', so we need to \\"undo\\" the multiplication of 2 * l. To do that, we are going to divide both sides of the equation by 2: On the left side: -10 divided by 2 is -5. On the right side: Since we are dividing 2 * l by 2, the 2 will cancel out leaving only 'l': So now, we have: -5 = l That's it! We found the value of 'l'. So, the answer is l = -5.

(born 15 November 1931) is a Kenyan politician who was the third President of Kenya, serving from December 2002 until April 2013. Kibaki was previously Vice-President of Kenya for ten years from 1978 to 1988 under President Daniel arap Moi. He also held cabinet ministerial positions in the Kenyatta and Moi governments, including time as minister for Finance (1969-1981) under Kenyatta, and Minister for Home Affairs (1982-1988) and Minister for Health (1988-1991) under Moi. Kibaki served as an opposition Member of Parliament from 1992 to 2002. The 2005 Kenyan constitutional referendum was held on 21 November 2005. The main issue of contention in the Constitution review process was how much power should be vested in the Kenyan Presidency. In previous drafts, those who feared a concentration of power in the president added provisions for European-style power-sharing between a ceremonial President elected via universal suffrage and an executive Prime Minister elected by Parliament. The draft presented by the Attorney General Amos Wako for the referendum retained sweeping powers for the Presidency. Though Kibaki the proposal, some members of his own cabinet, mainly from the LDP wing led by Raila Odinga, allied with the main opposition party KANU to mobilize a powerful NO campaign that resulted in a majority of 58% of voters rejecting the draft. As a consequence of, and immediately after, the referendum loss, on 23 November 2005, Kibaki dismissed his entire cabinet in the middle of his administration's term, with the aim of purging all Raila-allied ministers from the cabinet. About his decision Kibaki said, \\"Following the results of the Referendum, it has become necessary for me, as the President of the Republic, to re-organize my Government to make it more cohesive and better able to serve the people of Kenya\\". The only members of the cabinet office to be spared a midterm exit were the Vice President and Minister of Home Affairs, Moody Awori, and the Attorney General whose position is constitutionally protected. A new cabinet of Kibaki loyalists, including MP's from the opposition, termed the Government of National Unity (GNU), was thereafter appointed, but some MP's who were offered ministerial positions declined to take up posts. A report by a Kenyan Commission of Inquiry, the Waki Commission, contextualises some issues. They reported that Kibaki, after agreeing to an informal Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to create the post of Prime Minister, reneged on this pact after being elected. They cite criticism of Kibaki neglecting his pre-election agreement, leaving the public to identify it as an attempt by the Kibaki Government to \\"keep power to itself rather than share it.\\" What was his role in the constitutional referendum?","completion":"Mwai Kibaki played a significant role in the 2005 Kenyan constitutional referendum as the then President of Kenya. The main issue of contention in the Constitution review process was the concentration of power in the Kenyan Presidency. Kibaki supported the draft constitution presented by Attorney General Amos Wako, which maintained the sweeping powers of the Presidency. However, some members of his cabinet, mainly from the LDP wing led by Raila Odinga, allied with the main opposition party KANU to mobilize a powerful NO campaign. The proposal faced resistance from Kenyans, as 58% of them voted against the draft constitution in the referendum. This resulted in Kibaki dismissing his entire cabinet on 23 November 2005, intending to purge all ministers allied with Raila Odinga. Kibaki then formed a new cabinet of loyalists, including some opposition MPs, which was termed the Government of National Unity (GNU). It is important to note that Kibaki had previously agreed to an informal Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to create the post of Prime Minister, but he reneged on this pact after being elected. Critics argue this was an attempt by the Kibaki Government to maintain power rather than share it. In summary, Kibaki's role in the constitutional referendum was that of a key figure advocating for the retention of presidential powers, but ultimately facing a defeat that led to the dismissal of the cabinet and the formation of a new government."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It includes 4,000 fixed seats and a 95,000-square-foot (8,800 m2) Great Lawn that can accommodate an additional 7,000 people. The pavilion was built above and behind the Harris Theater, which has the benefit that Millennium Park's indoor and outdoor performance venues share a loading dock, rehearsal rooms and other backstage facilities.The bandshell's brushed stainless steel headdress frames the 120-foot (37 m) proscenium theatre; the main stage can accommodate a full orchestra and chorus of 150 members. The bandshell is connected to a trellis of interlocking crisscrossing steel pipes that support the innovative sound system, which mimics indoor concert hall acoustics. The pavilion has restrooms on both its east and west sides. It is one of two features in the park to include accessible restrooms; the other is McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. The majority of the park's 123 toilet fixtures (78 for women, 45 for men) are located in underground arcades to the east and west of the pavilion, with the ones on the east being heated for winter use.Millennium Park is built on top of a large underground parking garage.

Please answer the following question: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness. Doctors studied Dan, a normal patient, whit a normal number of red blood cells, and Jim, a patient that had sickle-cell anemia. The differences were remarkable in terms of overall well-being and health. Which patient had fewer red blood cells, Dan or Jim? A:","completion":"Jim, the patient with sickle-cell anemia, had fewer red blood cells compared to Dan, who is a normal patient with a normal number of red blood cells.

Article: What does the word iceberg make you think of ? Do you think of a large block of ice in a cold northern ocean? Or do you think of something that ships can crash into? While these are both correct, in truth there's far more to icebergs than meets the eye. According to scientists, only the largest blocks of ice count as icebergs. They must rise at least 5 meters above the water and be 15 meters wide at the water line. But only about 10 percent of an iceberg can be seen. The rest lie beneath the water. Icebergs begin froming when layers of snow fall year after year without melting. The snow is pressed together into large blocks of ice called glaciers. When chunks of ice break off these glaciers, icebergs are born. In Greenland alone, about 40,000 icebergs are formed each year. Since they began as snow, icebergs are made of fresh water, not salty ocean water. Tidy bubbles of air inside the ice give them their white color1. While most icebergs are white, some are blue because they have melted and frozen again. This action allows the air bubbles to escape. Other icebergs have brown, black or yellow parts because of dirt mixed with the ice. Algae can also get trapped in the underwater parts of an iceberg. If the iceberg turns over, all or part of it is green! Icebergs can be flat, cube-shaped, round like a turtle shell or U-shaped. Some even look like mountains. The large underwater parts of icebergs are hard for ships to avoid. They have destroyed and sunk many ships, including the Titanic. As a result, the International Ice Patrol now monitors icebergs in areas with heavy ship traffic. But there's yet another side to icebergs. Many microscopic animals live inside icebergs and in the water around them. These creatures feed on minerals that the icebergs store and release as they melt. Scientists are still studying all the ways icebergs affect sea life. Question: Why does the passage begin with questions? Options: A: To attract readers' interest in icebergs.

I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it?

In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

But that's not the case with Ray Dearlove. He's a a statuesque slab of fellow, built like a prop forward with the weathered features of somebody who's spent most of his life under the sun in South Africa and Australia. When he speaks, you listen. Snapping around his ankles at his home in suburban Sydney is a somewhat yappy little terrier. They make an unlikely pair that pours water on the pet theory. Yet \\"Rhino Ray\\" does bear some resemblance to the beast he loves more than any other. \\"I have a deep passion for rhinos,\\" the 67-year-old tells me. \\"The rhino is the closest thing you will ever see to the dinosaur. They're incredible animals.\\" Now Mr Dearlove wants to bring rhinos on the same long journey to Australia that he made three decades ago He's leading an ambitious project to airlift 80 white rhinoceroses from Southern Africa to Australia in order to protect the animals from poaching. \\"Some would say it's far-fetched, just the idea of another dumb South African,\\" he admits with a smile. \\"But with rhinos we're close to a tipping point right now. We need to start thinking laterally.\\" Mr Dearlove's love of the rhinoceros can be traced to his childhood. He was born and raised in the north-east of South Africa, close to the border with Mozambique. \\"The Kruger National Park was on our doorstep so most of our holidays as kids were spent there,\\" he says, referring to one of Africa's biggest game reserves. \\"It was pretty wild at those times when we were little people. I grew up loving animals.\\" It's estimated that poachers killed about 1,300 rhinos for their horns last year in Africa. The reason is that rhino horn is literally worth more than its weight in gold. It sells for about US60,000 (Â£41,000) a kilo, sometimes more, with much of it ending up in China and Vietnam where it's believed - most would say wrongly - to have medicinal properties. Mr Dearlove says there have been numerous attempts to slow down the poaching trade. \\"They've tried dehorning the rhinos but it didn't work. The poachers would still shoot the animals just to dig out a couple of inches of the stump of the horn from their skulls,\\" he says. Conservationists have also tried injecting dye into the horns to devalue them, but with limited success. \\"The Australian Rhino Project is about spreading the risk,\\" Mr Dearlove says. The plan is to airlift 80 white rhinos to Australia over the next four years, with the first batch of 20 to be brought over by the end of 2016. \\"They will go to an environment as close to the African climate as we can find and as close to the African vegetation as we can find,\\" he says. \\"They need to be in a secure environment where they can breed.\\" Mr Dearlove is keeping the exact location close to his chest for now, but says his dream is to one day to have a smaller version of the Kruger National Park somewhere in Australia. The target is to increase the size of the herd from 80 rhinos to about 130 before eventually repatriating them to Africa, if and when the poaching situation improves. But rhinos take time to breed. They have a gestation period of about 16 months and only have one calf at a time. Usually they will wait three to four years before having more offspring. \\"With such a high rate of poaching, it's going to take time to catch up,\\" says Mr Dearlove. And he acknowledges the project has been bureaucratically challenging. \\"We started this whole thing three years ago and I had no idea it was going to take this long,\\" he says. But he says the governments in both Australia and South Africa have been supportive. \\"Australia's main concern is bio-security. They take the pristine nature of the country very seriously,\\" he says, referring to Australia's notoriously strict quarantine controls. Initially there was some concern about the animals potentially bringing in foot-and-mouth disease, but those fears have now been addressed. \\"They don't want a situation like they've had with rabbits, cane toads and camels,\\" he says, referring to species whose populations spiralled out of control after being introduced from overseas. With a raised eyebrow and a chuckle, Mr Dearlove admits he wouldn't see it as a problem if rhinos were breeding like rabbits. But could the poaching problem find its way to Australia? He says it's possible but unlikely. \\"Nowhere is totally safe. But I do think Australia is safer than pretty much anywhere else,\\" he says. \\"Border security is a major focus for both state and federal governments. There is no poaching in Australia today, thank God, and there is no comparable poverty. \\"I really believe that if one rhino got poached in this country all hell would break lose. The Australians would just find it unacceptable.\\" So what of the logistics of getting them here? A white rhino weighs about 2500kg. \\"When we first started I thought you could just stick them in the hold of a Qantas jet,\\" he says. \\"But they're too tall to fit through the doors of the hold.\\" Special cargo planes will need to be used for the 11,000km journey from Johannesburg to Sydney, at an estimated cost of about US60,000 per rhino. But Mr Dearlove believes it's worth it. \\"What price do you put on saving a species from extinction?\\" he asks.

An important class of sugar substitutes is known as high-intensity sweeteners. These are compounds with many times the sweetness of sucrose, common table sugar. As a result, much less sweetener is required and energy contribution is often negligible. The sensation of sweetness caused by these compounds is sometimes notably different from sucrose, so they are often used in complex mixtures that achieve the most natural sweet sensation. If the sucrose that is replaced has contributed to the texture of the product, then a bulking agent is often also needed.

In fact, Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in cinematography. When the Lumière brothers of France premiered their first motion picture footage in Paris on December 28, 1895, little did they know how rapidly it would ignite a new age of photographic documentation. These brothers invented an apparatus, patented in February 1895, which they called the \\"Cinématographe\\" (from which the word \\"cinematography\\" is derived). It is not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in Baku at the turn of the 19th century, this bay town on the Caspian was producing more than 50 percent of the world's supply of oil. Just like today, the oil industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to work. A Frenchman by the name of Alexandre Michon was among the first entrepreneurs who came and settled in Baku. A photographer and cameraman by profession, he is believed to have lived in Baku for more than 25 years where he set up a photo studio. Mishon became active in forming a scientific photo circle in Baku and became its secretary. From 1879 to 1905, he documented landscapes, episodes from oil extraction, the refining process, as well as the oil gushers and terrifying fires that broke out in the oil fields. In 1898, Mishon began shooting motion pictures that depicted everyday life in Baku. It was his intention to exhibit them in Paris. - Kutaisi (; ancient names: \\"Aea\\"/\\"Aia\\", \\"Kotais\\", \\"Kutatisi\\", \\"Kutaïsi\\") is the legislative capital of Georgia, and its 3rd most populous city.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the place that was closed in 1970? from the following article ? Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers.

Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed. Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce.

The seeds are affected by the radiation and low gravity in space. When they are brought back to the earth, these seeds produce vegetables that are bigger and healthier than normal vegetables. However, some people worry about eating space vegetables. They think that space vegetables might not be good for us and could make us get sick because of the radiation in space. However, people should not be frightened because space vegetables are very healthy. Here are some facts that you should know about space vegetables. Space vegetables are grown from seeds that are carefully chosen. When seeds are brought back from space, they are tested to make sure that they will be safe to eat. Space vegetables are better for you than normal vegetables. For example, space tomatoes stay fresh for twenty days, which is one week longer than normal tomatoes. After genetically modified food appeared in the market, people worried that they were eating unknown things. For example, if nut genes are put inside potatoes, people allergic to nuts might get sick from eating these potatoes because they do not know they are also eating nuts.

We'll start by moving all the terms containing l to one side of the equation and all the constants to the other side. To do this, let's subtract 29600*l from both sides of the equation. 29600*l - 29600*l + 32888 = 30460*l - 29600*l - 4092 This simplifies to: 32888 = 860*l - 4092 Now, we'll add 4092 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term containing l. 32888 + 4092 = 860*l This simplifies to: 36980 = 860*l Step 2: Solve for l. Now we need to isolate l by dividing both sides of the equation by 860. 36980 / 860 = 860*l / 860 This simplifies to: l ≈ 43 So the answer is l ≈ 43."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: - Body temperature rises - The brain tells blood vessels to dilate - The sweat glands become active - Moisture is released from the pores - The moisture evaporates What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process after moisture evaporates is the body cooling down and returning to its normal temperature. To elaborate further, when the body temperature rises due to external factors, physical activity, or illness, the brain's temperature regulation center, the hypothalamus, recognizes this change and responds to restore the body's temperature to an optimal level. It does this by sending signals to the blood vessels, particularly those near the skin's surface, causing them to dilate or widen. This dilation process, also known as vasodilation, enables the release of excess heat from the body, as the blood vessels expand and the blood flow increases, leading to the dissipation of heat through the skin. Next, the hypothalamus activates the sweat glands distributed across our skin, which begin to produce sweat. Sweat is a mixture of water, minerals, and other substances that the body must eliminate to maintain its proper balance. The moisture, or sweat, is released from our pores, tiny openings on the skin's surface, and spreads across the skin. Subsequently, the moisture on the skin evaporates into the surrounding air, absorbing energy from the body (in the form of heat) during the process. This results in a net loss of heat from the body, helping to cool it down. Finally, once the moisture has evaporated and the body has successfully cooled down, the hypothalamus detects this change and adjusts its response accordingly to maintain the body's optimal temperature, which is approximately 98.6°F (37°C) for most humans. The blood vessels constrict, reducing blood flow near the skin's surface, and the activity of the sweat glands decreases. This marks the end of the body's response to increased temperature, and the return to a state of thermal equilibrium—the last step of the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.\\"?

Together, she and Sam wrote Opening Hearts, which tells Sam's experience of living with a chronic illness. \\"I wrote the book to teach people to be kinder to people,\\" Sam says. Moreover, Sam wanted to send pillows to sick children staying in hospitals around the country to make their stay more comfortable, an idea that came from a time when he was in the hospital. \\"A few kind boys came in with pillows and they gave me one and it meant a lot to me that someone cared about kids in the hospital,\\" says Sam. Angie thought of starting a nonprofit organization to provide a way for people to contribute money to realize Sam's ideas. She named the nonprofit Kindness for Kids. Since then, Sam has taken pillows to children staying at Providence Hospital in Anchorage. Sam's father, Scott Allred, owns a small business that contracts shipping services with FedEx Ground.

Her college friends Sudha Mathur (Sabeeha) and Sunil (Javed Jaffrey) try to help her sort through her visions but to little avail. Devi is relieved after she talks to her sister and finds that she is alive. However, just some time later, Rama is murdered in the same way as Devi had pictured. The murderer hides Rama's body in a mansion's wall. Rama is reported missing. Devi firmly believes Rama is dead. Five years later, Devi moves to her uncle (Ajit Vachani)'s home where she eventually meets and is courted by millionaire businessman Ram Kumar (Jackie Shroff). Sunil, who was secretly in love with Devi, is deeply disappointed. Devi and Ram marry and enter his family mansion, which he has re-earned after a legal battle. Little known to anybody, this is the same mansion where Rama was buried. When Devi starts having the visions again, Rama's skeleton is not the only thing that will come tumbling out. Devi sees a wall in the mansion being torn down. Devi tears down the wall, only to find a skeleton tumbling out of it. Devi knows whose skeleton it is: it's Rama's, since she had a necklace similar to Devi's. Also, the dead woman's skeleton is roughly same height as that of Rama. The Inspector (Shivaji Satam) quickly points out that since the mansion was closed when Rama disappeared, anyone could have hidden a dead body in there and nobody would know the truth. However, he doubts that the dead woman is Rama: Several such necklaces are available. Devi now gets another vision of another woman getting murdered. She also pinpoints two details: a magazine named Priya with a horse on it's cover page and a video cassette labelled 100 Days. Sunil and Devi visit the weekly magazine office.

Paul Davis Ryan Jr. (born January 29, 1970) is an American politician serving as the 54th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives since 2015. He was the Republican Party nominee for Vice President of the United States, running alongside former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. Ryan also has been the U.S. Representative for Wisconsin's 1st congressional district since 1999. He was previously chair of the House Ways and Means Committee from January 3 to October 29, 2015, and, before that, chair of the House Budget Committee from 2011 to 2015. Ryan was first elected to the House in 1998, winning the 1st District seat of Republican Mark Neumann, a two-term incumbent who had vacated his seat to make an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate. Ryan won the Republican primary over 29-year-old pianist Michael J. Logan of Twin Lakes, and the general election against Democrat Lydia Spottswood. This made him the second-youngest member of the House. Reelected eight times, Ryan has never received less than 55 percent of the vote. He defeated Democratic challenger Jeffrey C. Thomas in the 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006 elections. In the 2008 election, Ryan defeated Democrat Marge Krupp. In the 2010 general election, he defeated Democrat John Heckenlively and Libertarian Joseph Kexel. In 2012, under Wisconsin election law, Ryan was allowed to run concurrently for vice president and for Congress and was not allowed to remove his name from the Congressional ballot after being nominated for the vice presidency. He faced Democratic nominee Rob Zerban. As of July 25, 2012, Ryan had over 5.4 million in his congressional campaign account, more than any other House member. He was reelected with 55 percent of his district's vote and 44 percent of the vote in his hometown, Janesville. Zerban again challenged Ryan in the 2014 House election. Ryan won with 63 percent of his district's vote. In the 2016 Republican primary election, Ryan faced businessman Paul Nehlen, who had been endorsed by Sarah Palin. Because of Nehlen's support for Trump, Trump publicly thanked him on Twitter and later told The Washington Post that Nehlen was \\"running a very good campaign\\", even though he did not endorse him. On August 5, 2016, Trump endorsed Ryan's re-election after pressure from fellow Republican leaders. In the August 9, 2016 primary election, Ryan overwhelmingly defeated Nehlen, taking over 84 percent of the vote. In the November general election, Ryan faced Democrat Ryan Solen and won with 65 percent of his district's vote.

Herr Präsident! Zum Bericht McCarthy. Which language is this?","completion":"The text \\"Herr Präsident! Zum Bericht McCarthy\\" is in German. In English, this translates to \\"Mr. President! Regarding the McCarthy report.\\" Let me provide some more information about the German language below. German is a West Germanic language belonging to the Indo-European language family, and it is one of the world's most widely spoken languages with around 100 million native speakers. It is the official language of Germany, Austria, and Liechtenstein and is one of the official languages of Switzerland, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The German language has a rich linguistic history, and its origins can be traced back to the early Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. Old High German, spoken from the 6th to the 11th centuries, was the earliest documented form of the German language. The Middle High German period followed, lasting from the 11th to the 14th centuries, and Early New High German covered the 14th to 17th centuries. The present-day standard German language is primarily based on the Early New High German period. German is an inflected language, meaning that its words change their forms based on grammatical functions such as tense, case, and gender. The language has three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), four cases (nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive), and six verb tenses (present, past, perfect, past perfect, future, and future perfect). The German vocabulary, like many other languages, has been influenced by various historical events, technological advancements, and cultural exchanges. Latin, Greek, and French loanwords, for example, have left a significant impact on the German language over the years. German is written using the Latin script and includes a few additional characters specific to the language, such as the umlaut (ä, ö, ü) and the Eszett or sharp S (ß). The umlaut signifies a change in vowel sound, and the Eszett represents a voiceless 's' sound.

Denmark is still neutral, but (Danish) Captain Andersen (Conrad Veidt) and his freighter Helvig are stopped in the English Channel by Lt. Commanders Ashton (Joss Ambler) and Ellis (Harold Warrender) for a cargo inspection in a British Contraband Control Port. He receives two shore passes for himself and his First Officer Axel Skold (Hay Petrie) to dine with Ashton and Ellis, but the passes (and Helvig's motorboat) are stolen by passengers Mrs. Sorensen (Valerie Hobson) and talent scout Mr. Pidgeon (Esmond Knight). From a cut-out newspaper train schedule, Andersen is able to figure out they are taking a train to London and catches up with them; but, when the train arrives in the blacked-out metropolis, he is only able to hold on to Sorensen. He invites her to dine at the restaurant of Skold's brother Erik (also Hay Petrie). Then she takes him to the home of her aunt, where they are captured by a Nazi spy ring led by Van Dyne (Raymond Lovell), a man Sorensen has already had unpleasant dealings with in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. Van Dyne knows Sorensen and Pidgeon are British agents. Van Dyne finds a message hidden on one of Sorensen's cigarette papers, identifying her as \\"M47\\" and listing the names of neutral ships which two German vessels are traveling. He decides to replace one of the names with that of an American ship to cause trouble, the United States being neutral at this time. Sorensen and Andersen are tied up, but the captain manages to escape. He brings back reinforcements in the form of Erik Skold's staff and is able to free Sorensen and knock out Van Dyne. With everything cleared up, Andersen and Sorensen resume their sea voyage.

Read this: However, early Christian writers who speak of the shape of the particular gibbet on which Jesus died invariably describe it as having a cross-beam. For instance, the Epistle of Barnabas, which was certainly earlier than 135, and may have been of the 1st century AD, the time when the gospel accounts of the death of Jesus were written, likened it to the letter T (the Greek letter tau, which had the numeric value of 300), and to the position assumed by Moses in Exodus 17:11–12. Justin Martyr (100–165) explicitly says the cross of Christ was of two-beam shape: \\"That lamb which was commanded to be wholly roasted was a symbol of the suffering of the cross which Christ would undergo. For the lamb, which is roasted, is roasted and dressed up in the form of the cross. For one spit is transfixed right through from the lower parts up to the head, and one across the back, to which are attached the legs of the lamb.\\" Irenaeus, who died around the end of the 2nd century, speaks of the cross as having \\"five extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails.\\" What numeric value did the significance of the lamb have?

Step 2: Analyze the given statement The statement given is: \\"Auditors will need to exercise professional judgment in assessing the significance of audit results or findings.\\" This statement suggests that auditors must use their professional judgment to evaluate the importance and relevance of the audit results, which includes analyzing the findings, determining the implications of these findings, and forming an opinion about the organization's financial condition and overall compliance. Step 3: Evaluate the conclusion The conclusion is: \\"Auditors are not responsible for the assessment of audit results.\\" This conclusion contradicts the information in the given statement. If auditors are required to exercise professional judgment in assessing the significance of audit results or findings, it means they do have a responsibility to assess the audit results. Step 4: Formulate the correct conclusion Based on the given statement and our understanding of the auditor's role, a more accurate conclusion would be: \\"Auditors are responsible for the assessment of audit results, as they must exercise professional judgment in determining the significance of their findings and evaluating the implications for the organization.\\" In summary, after analyzing the given statement and the role of auditors, I have determined that the original conclusion is incorrect.

The reviewer, first of all, states that they went to the establishment twice, and both times turned out to be a disaster, which already sets a negative tone. Then, their critique of the food offered further underlines the negative response, as they describe the siu-mai to have tasted weird, even comparing it to a rubber band.

The fact that the reviewer states they would not come back to the place again is another indication of their dissatisfaction and a clear sign of a negative review. Lastly, the fact that the reviewer recommends another establishment (Great Wall at 35th and Camelback in Phoenix) to try the best dim-sum, suggests that they do not consider the reviewed place a good destination for the dish.

Context: The night when she thought she would finally be a star, Maria Isabella du'l Cielo struggled to calm the trembling of her hands, reached over to cut the tether that tied her to the ground, and thought of that morning many years before when she'd first caught a glimpse of Lorenzo du Vicenzio ei Salvadore: tall, thick-browed and handsome, his eyes closed, oblivious to the cacophony of the accident waiting to occur around him. Maria Isabella had just turned sixteen then, and each set of her padrinos had given her (along with the sequined brida du caballo, the dresses of rare tulle, organza, and seda, and the diadema floral du'l dama -- the requisite floral circlet of young womanhood) a purse filled with coins to spend on anything she wanted. And so she'd gone past the Calle du Leones (where sleek cats of various pedigrees sometimes allowed themselves to be purchased, though if so, only until they tired of their new owners), walked through the Avenida du'l Conquistadores (where the statues of the conquerors of Ciudad Meiora lined the entirety of the broad promenade) and made her way to the Encantu lu Caminata (that maze-like series of interconnected streets, each leading to some wonder or marvel for sale), where little musical conch shells from the islets near Palao'an could be found. Those she liked very much. In the vicinity of the Plaza Emperyal, she saw a young man dressed in a coat embroidered with stars walk almost surely to his death. In that instant, Maria Isabella knew two things with the conviction reserved only for the very young: first, that she almost certainly loved this reckless man; and second, that if she simply stepped on a dog's tail -- the very dog watching the same scene unfold right next to her -- she could avert the man's seemingly senseless death. Question: How long after the event is the story being probably told by Maria? Answer: A:","completion":"The story does not provide explicit information about how long after the event it is being told by Maria.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: When the United Nations Security Council passed its latest sanctions resolution on Iran, on June 9, President Barack Obama hailed it as \\"the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government.\\" This resolution, he said, \\"sends an unmistakable message about the international community's commitment to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.\\" Not yet, it doesn't. On such matters as money, weapons and terror, the so-called international community, whatever its U.N. trappings, is a snake pit in which the 192 member states are most reliably committed to first serving themselves. For some, that has already entailed a certain tolerance for the spread of nuclear weapons, if it means they might either hope to get some of their own, or profit from the nuclear quests of others. The U.N. is a place where one man's sanctions are another man's ticket to sanctions-busting profits--no matter how lofty the stack of resolutions. If Obama now wants to bet on sanctions as the tool of choice for stopping Iran's nuclear program, it is the U.S., not the U.N., that will have to provide the real leadership and heavy lifting--for the simple reason that the U.N. won't. That's why Obama should lose no time in signing the new Iran sanctions legislation that Congress has finally sent to his desk, approved this week with votes of 99-0 in the Senate, and 408-8 in the House. This bill aims to close loopholes that have allowed Iran to press on toward the bomb, bragging up increased uranium enrichment despite a patchwork of longstanding U.S. sanctions, plus three previous U.N. sanctions resolutions in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The weakness of U.N. sanctions is that the U.N. itself lacks both the integrity and the functional policing mechanisms to back them up. Whatever the \\"binding\\" words issued by the Security Council, the U.N. relies on member states to formulate their own rules for domestic compliance. They are then supposed to police and report back on themselves. At best, the U.N. appoints a multilateral panel of experts to monitor this process. Beyond naming and shaming (which they are usually pressured by the U.N. to avoid) they have no power to penalize, or even to compel uncooperative counties to let them in. In the case of North Korea sanctions, for instance, the U.N. panel of experts has yet to be allowed to poke around inside North Korea's mainstay and chief trading partner, China. And though all U.N. members are supposed to submit reports on what they are doing to comply with sanctions, in the case of Iran the U.N. website shows that more than one-third of the U.N.'s member states have yet to report in at all. Among the absentees are such major Iranian partners as Syria and Lebanon. Turkey, which voted against the latest sanctions, appears to have last clocked in on its own compliance with prior resolutions back in 2007. For a taste of how wrong things can go when the U.N. is trusted to take the lead, recall the previous push via sanctions to defang a predatory oil-rich Middle East regime. That would be the case of Saddam Hussein's Iraq, where the U.N. in theory had far tighter controls than anything currently on the table for Iran. All Saddam Hussein's oil sales, and all goods bought with the proceeds, were supposed to be handled and overseen via the U.N. That plan ran from 1996-2003, and was known as Oil-for-Food. What ensued was a bonanza of sanctions busting, in which many member states did nothing to police violations on their own turf, and some governments were themselves complicit. It was only the U.S.-led overthrow of Saddam in 2003 that finally brought to light a hoard of Baghdad records so incriminating that the U.N. was finally forced into mandating a special inquiry from 2004-05, led at a cost of more than 35 million by Paul Volcker. What lessons did sanctions busters learn from that experience? In the U.S., thanks more to congressional and federal investigators than to the U.N. inquiry, a parade of private players faced prosecutions, resulting in an assortment of fines, plea bargains, convictions and jail time. But among some of the worst violators, in places such as Russia, China, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon, there were no signs of any penalties at all. Among the buyers of oil, the U.N. committee identified 139 companies worldwide whose purchases were associated with a \\"surcharge,\\" or sanctions-busting kickback, to the government of Iraq. The committee sent letters to 127 of these companies, asking them what they had to say about this. Only 26 even bothered to respond. Among sellers of \\"humanitarian\\" goods to Iraq, the scene was even more outrageous. Based on its findings, the U.N. inquiry sent letters, alleging illicit activity, to 2,253 companies worldwide. Only 293 replied.

The band has been targeted by internet trolls following their first public performance which earned them an award. The trolls went to the extent of suggesting that the teenage girls be raped and thrown in a river for their musical pursuits. Amid the controversy, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has come out in support of the trio, expressing hope that a \\"handful of morons won't silence them.\\" Body Pragaash's musical journey took an unexpected turn when they were awarded at their very first public performance. This monumental moment for the band elicited hateful and threatening messages from internet trolls. The severity of the threats — particularly those suggesting that the members should be raped and thrown in a river — sparked outrage and concern among netizens. Fortunately, Pragaash has found a strong support system in Jammu and Kashmir's Chief Minister, Omar Abdullah. Voicing his support for the band, Abdullah denounced the trolls, referring to them as a \\"handful of morons\\" and encouraging the band to continue despite the negativity. The Chief Minister hopes that these disheartening words will not succeed in silencing the voices and dreams of the young girls. Conclusion Pragaash's story has quickly become an example of courage and resilience in the face of adversity. Their unwavering passion for music continues to drive them forward, despite being threatened and harassed. With a growing number of supporters, including a backing from the Chief Minister himself, Pragaash stands as a symbol of strength and defiance against those who attempt to hold them back. The band's journey not only highlights the power of music and its capacity to evoke emotion but also reinforces the importance of perseverance. By staying true to themselves and their beliefs, Pragaash continues to challenge the status quo and to serve as an inspiration to others who face similar struggles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise only provides information about the speaker's brother-in-law and his experience with achieving a hole-in-one. However, there are several factors to consider before dissecting the details further. First, let's analyze the premise given: \\"Well uh you know the only person I've ever known that had a hole in one was my brother-in-law, but uh and he he said he got his luckily, so I don't know that's that's but I mean.\\" The speaker mentions that the only person they know who achieved a hole-in-one is their brother-in-law. They then go on to say that the brother-in-law considers his hole-in-one to be obtained through luck. The information provided is limited to the brother-in-law and his experience. Now, let's look at the hypothesis we want to conclude: \\"My sister-in-law got a hole in one without even trying.\\" This hypothesis is about the speaker's sister-in-law; however, the premise does not discuss her or her golfing abilities at all. To support or refute the hypothesis, we would need direct evidence or information about the sister-in-law's experience with a hole-in-one. Additionally, it's crucial to differentiate between luck and not even trying when evaluating the hypothesis. The brother-in-law claimed that his hole-in-one was due to luck. Generally, golf is a skill-based sport, and even if luck plays a role, players must still exhibit some competence to perform well. Therefore, achieving a hole-in-one without even trying is unlikely. However, as we have no information about the sister-in-law, we cannot draw any conclusions about her experience. In conclusion, the given premise provides insufficient information to support or refute the hypothesis \\"My sister-in-law got a hole in one without even trying.\\" The premise only discusses the brother-in-law's hole-in-one experience and does not provide any details about the sister-in-law. To evaluate the hypothesis properly, more relevant information about the sister-in-law's golfing experiences would be necessary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Chayefsky was born in The Bronx, New York City to Russian Jewish immigrants Harry and Gussie Stuchevsky Chayefsky who came from Moscow to New York in 1907. He had two older brothers, William and Isidor. He spent part of his youth in Mount Vernon, New York. Context: Returning to the United States, Chayefsky worked in his uncle's print shop, Regal Press, an experience which provided a background for his later teleplay, Printer's Measure (1953), as well as his story for the movie As Young as You Feel (1951). Kanin enabled Chayefsky to spend time working on his second play, Put Them All Together (later known as M is for Mother), but it was never produced. Producers Mike Gordon and Jerry Bressler gave him a junior writer's contract. He wrote a story, The Great American Hoax, which sold to Good Housekeeping but was never published. He relocated to Hollywood, where he met his future wife Susan Sackler, and the couple married in February 1949. Failing to find work on the West Coast, Chayefsky returned to New York. During the late 1940s, he began working full-time on short stories and radio scripts, and during that period, he was a gagwriter for radio host Robert Q. Lewis. Chayefsky later recalled, \\"I sold some plays to men who had an uncanny ability not to raise money.\\" During 1951-52, Chayefsky wrote adaptations for radio's Theater Guild on the Air: The Meanest Man in the World (with James Stewart), Cavalcade of America, Tommy (with Van Heflin and Ruth Gordon) and Over 21 (with Wally Cox). His play The Man Who Made the Mountain Shake was noticed by Elia Kazan, and his wife, Molly Kazan, helped Chayefsky with revisions. It was retitled Fifth From Garibaldi but was never produced. In 1951, the movie As Young as You Feel was adapted from a Chayefsky story. Question: Where was Paddy after the war.

Standing barely 1.7 meters, the 22-year-old with black-frame glasses might pass more for a Chinese Harry Potter. Yet Shen Huigang is now getting recognition for his bravery in fighting off a cougar on Vancouver Island, Canada, during a family outing. Shen, also known as Ian, was then an exchange student. With him was a friend, Myles Hagar, and Hagar's two grandchildren. Silently and suddenly a cougar appeared out of nowhere. By the time they spotted the cat, it already had the head of 18-month-old Julien in its mouth. \\"At first, my brain was nothing but blank,\\" Shen recalled. \\"But I believed I could get the child back.\\" He gestured as if he were ready for a fight, and tried to scare the beast off with his bag. Hearing the noise Shen made, the animal dropped the baby and Hagar rushed to grab his grandson. But the animal didn't run, instead turned toward 3-year-old Iris standing beside Shen. \\"Had Ian not been there, shouting at the cougar, remaining calm and standing firm, it would certainly have attacked Iris.\\" Hagar recalled. They chased the animal back into the woods. \\"We moved slowly to our vehicle as we waved our fists and bags, pretending to wrestle it,\\" Shen said. \\"The vehicle wasn't far away but it felt like it took us a century to travel the short journey.\\" As Hagar drove for help, Shen held the heavily-bleeding boy in the passenger seat and calmly kept him awake by hugging and kissing him in case he would go into a coma . The boy was flown to a hospital nearby. Doctors later said his little skull had been punctured through to his brain in two places. Luckily, Julien made a full recovery. \\"Any hesitation, even a second delay, would have resulted in certain death for Julien, but Ian was there...\\" Hagar said.

Nola is the girlfriend of Chloe's only brother Tom, and his parents Alec and Eleanor (Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton) disapprove of her. Nola acknowledges that, but she knows that the Hewett parents are keen on Chris, especially because some time ago, Chloe was about to run away with a young squatter, so they think that Chris is a safe option. In a conversation after Nola has auditioned for a theatre part - albeit disastrously, once again - Nola says that the only problem which could prevent Chris marrying into the Hewetts' money is if he made a pass at her.In spite of the fact that Chris knows it's true, he can't resist Nola.

The Angevin kings had three main sources of income available to them, namely revenue from their personal lands, or demesne; money raised through their rights as a feudal lord; and revenue from taxation. Revenue from the royal demesne was inflexible and had been diminishing slowly since the Norman conquest. Matters were not helped by Richard's sale of many royal properties in 1189, and taxation played a much smaller role in royal income than in later centuries. English kings had widespread feudal rights which could be used to generate income, including the scutage system, in which feudal military service was avoided by a cash payment to the king. He derived income from fines, court fees and the sale of charters and other privileges. John intensified his efforts to maximise all possible sources of income, to the extent that he has been described as \\"avaricious, miserly, extortionate and moneyminded\\". John also used revenue generation as a way of exerting political control over the barons: debts owed to the crown by the king's favoured supporters might be forgiven; collection of those owed by enemies was more stringently enforced.

They made bad clothes. Once upon a time in a land filled with pretty things, there were many stores that sold clothes for women. These stores wanted to make people happy and make lots of money, but they started to have a problem. Their sales were going down, which means they were not selling enough clothes. People began to wonder why this was happening, and the answer was quite simple: they made bad clothes. Now, you might think, \\"What makes clothes bad?\\" Well, let's talk about it. First, the stores were not paying attention to what their customers, the women, really wanted. They only focused on what they thought would make money. Sometimes, that meant the clothes were very pretty but not very comfortable. Imagine wearing a dress that looks like a princess gown but is very itchy and tight. You wouldn't want to wear it for very long, would you? Second, these stores made clothes that looked the same as many other stores. It was like they all had the same ideas and didn't want to try anything new. This made their customers, the women, feel bored and not very excited about shopping. Imagine looking for a new toy but all the toys in the store are almost the same. You would not want to pick any of them, right? Third, sometimes the stores did not make clothes that were made to last. This meant that after only a few times of wearing them, the clothes would start to look old and worn out. It's like having a toy that breaks almost as soon as you start playing with it. Nobody wants that! Lastly, the stores sometimes made clothes that were not the right size for many women. Just like our hands and feet can be many different sizes, so can our bodies. Some stores only had clothes that fit women who were very thin or very tall, and that left many women feeling left out and sad. So, because the stores didn't listen to their customers and didn't think about how their clothes would be worn, they made bad clothes. This made the women not want to shop there anymore, and the stores lost money. The lesson here is that it's important to pay attention to those who use something and to create things that are both beautiful and helpful. That way, people will love what you made, and everyone will be happy. The End."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Choices: - basement - guest room - horseradish - bathroom - living room The rationale to choose \\"horseradish\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice in this context is \\"horseradish.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"horseradish\\" as the answer lies in understanding the question and its available choices. The question describes a situation where someone made a mess while eating. The mess is created by dripping a tangy sauce all over a sofa bed. Amongst the given options, we need to identify which one is most relevant to the concept of a tangy sauce. Let's evaluate the choices one by one: 1. Basement - This choice is related to a location or part of a house, and it has no relation to a sauce that could create a mess. Therefore, this option does not fit the context. 2. Guest room - Similar to the basement, a guest room is a place within a house. This choice also has no connection to the idea of a tangy sauce, so it is not the correct answer. 3. Horseradish - This option refers to a type of sauce or condiment that is often tangy and has the potential to create a mess if dripped onto a surface, like a sofa bed. Horseradish is made from the roots of the horseradish plant and has a strong, pungent aroma. Its taste is sharp, and it is often used as a condiment for various dishes, especially meat dishes, sandwiches, and salads. In this case, horseradish is the only choice that corresponds to the provided context. 4. Bathroom - Once again, this choice refers to a location within a house. It does not relate to the main context of the question, which is about a tangy sauce that caused a mess on a sofa bed. 5. Living room - Similar to the aforementioned choices, the living room is also a specific area within a house. Since the context of the question is focused on the sauce that caused the mess, this choice is not relevant. In conclusion, based on the available options, \\"horseradish\\" is the most appropriate answer. It is the only sauce among the choices, and its tangy properties align with the description provided in the question. While the other options are all locations within a house, horseradish is a condiment that could potentially cause the mess that was described, making it the clear winner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the original video I thought I thought we were very constrained in what I could and couldn’t say because of the Department of Justice investigation that was held above my head. I feel that now is the perfect time to speak my mind without fear of retaliation by the president, the attorney general, the federal government etc. Q. What was the first thing that went through your mind when you heard the news that the charges were abandoned? A. Initially I was extremely alleviated. Quickly that turned into realization that the Department of Justice finding that there was no basis to pursue charges was just the beginning of a journey my personal journey to correct the wrongs that the federal government did. To ensure that it never happens to any innocent American ever again. Q. You mentioned injustice by the federal government. Is there any sort of feeling you have after this whole journey – event that there has been unfairness toward you? A. Absolutely the federal government the FBI under the Department of Justice and Eric Holder they had gone to Sanford interviewed in particular a Sanford sergeant who stated in very clear terms that he did not care whether it was legal or not that I should be prosecuted because of the fear of a civil unrest in the city of Sanford. Knowing that the Department of Justice did not investigate further to see if my civil rights were violated. They opened an investigation and reopened it to see if I had violated his civil rights. And again they had various numerous examples of bounties place on my head, credible threats placed against myself and my family. Against from whom they know to be domestic terrorists and the president and the attorney general and the federal government declined to do anything about it. Q. Now that we are talking about this let me just ask you going back to the actual event that evening in Sanford. Did you do anything wrong? A. No sir Q. Do you have clean conscience at this point? A. Yes sir Q. And, do you wish you had turned out differently? A. I believe that the American judicial system failed in the sense that I should not even gone to trial but I do believe that the jury process succeeded and ultimately justice was served and I was acquitted and I am a free man. I don’t see obviously if there was a different outcome then I would feel differently but right now the way things turned out I, I’m satisfied. And with again the news of the Department of Justice definitively concluding there is no charge to be levied against me I feel like the department of justice process worked. Q. George how about the actual event itself. Do you wish you had turned different? A. I answered that question in my initial interview with Sean Hannity. On different perspectives with me as a Christian I believe that God does everything for a purpose, and he had his plans and for me to second guess them would be hypocritical and almost blasphemous. However as an individual I’ve done a lot of soul-searching and the conclusion that many professionals and, have conveyed to me and I have come to adopt is that it only in a true life or death scenario can you have mental clearness to know that you cannot feel guilty for surviving. Had I had a fraction of the thought that I could have done something differently, acted differently so that both of us who survived then I would have heavier weight on my shoulders. That sense in the back of my mind but in all fairness you cannot as a human feel guilty for living, for surviving Q. Do you feel you were treated different from someone else who may have been in the same situation? A. That’s hard to tell. I think that there are a lot of characteristics, aspects, personality traits, personal history that was used against me erroneously. For example my last name carrying a Caucasian German connotation definitely helped them portray me as a racist white man when in reality I am you know my mother’s Peruvian my father is American and I was raised by my mother and my grandmother both fully Hispanic. So I’m by no means was I ever portrayed as a white racist prior to this but they used certain aspects of character, characteristics of my personality against me. Q. What was the position of the Hispanic community during all of this? A. I tell you; personally my Hispanic community from home Northern Virginia was extremely supportive. I was tremendously disappointed and let down by the Hispanic Congressional Caucus. They aligned themselves with the Black Congressional Caucus and did everything that they could to in essence throw me under the bus. They identified with the Black Congressional Caucus and viewing me as a white racist and a, doing something negligent or racist and without even knowing anything about my character. Q. George you mentioned unfairness and if you had to point to a government agency or official, who do you think the highest level of fairness to your personal situation? A. By far, the President of the United States, Barack Hussein Obama. He had the most authority and in that sense I would hold him in the highest regard believing that he would hold that position and do his absolute hardest to not inflame racial tensions in America. Unfortunately after even after Jay Carney, his press secretary stated in the White House briefing that the White House will not interject in a local law enforcement matter and at most a state criminal matter, President Obama held his Rose Garden speech stating if I had a son he would look like Trayvon. To me that was clearly a dereliction of duty pitting Americans against each other solely based on race. He took what should have been a clear-cut self-defense matter and still to this day on the anniversary of incident he held a ceremony at the White House inviting the Martin-Fulton family and stating that they should take the day to reflect upon the fact that all children’s lives matter. Unfortunately for the president I’m also my parent’s child and my life matters as well. And for him to make incendiary comments as he did and direct the Department of Justice to pursue a baseless prosecution he by far overstretched, overreached, even broke the law in certain aspects to where you have an innocent American being prosecuted by the federal government which should never happen. Q. What would you have had the president do, what would you have considered the proper response throughout the entire situation and at the end? A. I think that throughout the process the president should done when he said he was going to do and not interject himself in a local law enforcement matter or a state matter and waited until the facts came out. Instead of rushing to judgment, making racially charged comments and pitting American against American. I believe that he should of taken the higher road given his position and said, been an example, been a leader as the president should be and say lets not rush to judgment. As I’m sure he would want that same luxury afforded to him if he was accused of something, and asked for a calm, ask for peace. Ask for the Martin-Fulton family and their attorneys not to incite violence and asked for calm from the entire community. Q. There are a lot of people who point to the fact that you’ve had repeated trouble after this incident and that gives proof right there that you were wrong in what you did. How would you respond to those people? A. I would ask them to put themselves in my shoes and again when you have a speeding ticket or a speeding infraction, any traffic citation and it makes international news appearing all the way to the UK you have to sit back and ask what is the media’s agenda. Q. Are you the same person right now that you were five years ago? A. Absolutely not. I have to have my guard up significantly. I have to look over my shoulder on a daily basis several times a day. I don’t get to spend time with my family, .… my mentor. I do try and keep my ideals the same. I do try and remain pragmatic because despite it all I still believe that people are truly good at heart as Anne Frank has said and I will put myself in any position to help another human in any way I can ,as evidenced by the helping me family the SUV. Q. Do you think you will be the person again from five years ago? A. I don’t know. I truly, it’s up to God and I put it all in his hands and I do have faith that whatever he has planned out for me is what’s best for me. So whatever he’s determined whatever he has planned out for me I am along for the ride and I just hope to be strong enough to see his will be done Thank you George Thank you ||||| In his first public comments since the U.S. Department of Justice announced it would not prosecute him for violating Trayvon Martin's civil rights, George Zimmerman says he was victimized by President Obama. The president should never have allowed the DOJ investigation and is guilty of ramping up racial tension when he said, \\"If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon,\\" Zimmerman said. Zimmerman is the Neighborhood Watch volunteer who killed Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black 17-year-old, in Sanford on Feb. 26, 2012, setting off civil rights demonstrations across the country and beyond. A Seminole County jury acquitted Zimmerman of manslaughter in 2013. Zimmerman went into hiding after the shooting and still tightly guards his privacy. He has rejected most media requests for an interview but on March 8 video-recorded an interview with his Tampa divorce lawyer, Howard Iken of Ayo and Iken PLC. The appearance of George Zimmerman, who fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, has changed over the years, and dramatically since the case began. Complete coverage of the case (Orlando Sentinel/Reuters) In it, he faulted the media for portraying him as a racist and the criminal justice system for bringing him to trial but saved his harshest criticism for Obama, whom he accused of trying to prosecute \\"an innocent American.\\" \\"For him to make incendiary comments as he did and direct the Department of Justice to pursue a baseless prosecution, he by far over-stretched, over-reached,\\" Zimmerman said. The president, whom he referred to as \\"Barack Hussein Obama,\\" should have told the public, \\" 'Let's not rush to judgment,' \\" Zimmerman said. On Feb. 24, the Department of Justice announced that it would file no charges against Zimmerman and was closing its three-year-old investigation. According to Iken, federal authorities have not returned to Zimmerman the Kel-Tec 9mm semiautomatic pistol that he used to kill Trayvon. Iken interviewed Zimmerman in Orlando. \\"Do you have a clean conscience at this point?\\" the lawyer asked about the shooting. \\"Yes, sir.\\" \\"Do you wish (it) … had turned out differently?\\" \\"I believe that the American judicial system failed in the sense that I should not even (have) gone to trial, but I do believe that the jury process succeeded,\\" Zimmerman said. He said he's convinced there's nothing he could have done differently that would have allowed both him and Trayvon to survive their confrontation that night. \\"In all fairness, you cannot as a human feel guilty for living, for surviving,\\" he said. \\"Are you the same person right now that you were five years ago?\\" Iken asked. \\"Absolutely not,\\" Zimmerman said. \\"I have to have my guard up. … I still believe that people are truly good at heart, as Anne Frank has said, and I will put myself in any position to help another human in any way I can.\\" You can watch the interview here. rstutzman@tribpub.com ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In a recent video interview, George Zimmerman, the former Neighborhood Watch volunteer who fatally shot unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, claimed he was victimized by President Barack Obama.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Rob is experimenting with how air pressure works. To that end, he has designed two tests. In the first test the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing. He labels it as case A. In the second test the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. He labels it as case B. He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations. But I can use this background: Bernoulli’s law explains how the wings of both airplanes and birds create lift that allows flight (see Figure below ). The shape of the wings causes air to flow more quickly — and air pressure to be lower — above the wings than below them. This allows the wings to lift the plane or bird above the ground against the pull of gravity. A spoiler on a race car, like the one in Figure below , works in the opposite way. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly — and air pressure to be greater — above the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, giving its wheels better traction on the track. What is an answer for this question: Would case A have faster or slower air flow above it than case B? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's go through the information provided step-by-step and analyze both cases. Step 1: Identify the air flow behavior in Case A - In Case A, the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing. - According to the background information, the shape of the wing causes air to flow more quickly above it and creates lower air pressure above the wings. Step 2: Identify the air flow behavior in Case B - In Case B, the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. - The background information states that the shape of the spoiler causes air to flow more slowly above it and creates greater air pressure above the spoiler. Step 3: Compare air flow speed in both cases - In Case A, the air flow above the object (airplane wing) is faster. - In Case B, the air flow above the object (race car spoiler) is slower.

The 63 year reign of Queen Victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in British history. On the one hand, her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes, and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human. Taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the German Prince Albert was taking forefront, director Jean-Marc Vallée who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes Victoria's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy. It's a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background, and yet that's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare. Taking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to Albert, The Young Victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer. Instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure's entire life, Vallée instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of Victoria's early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades. The result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like, yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story, writer Julian Fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal. Vallée takes this and runs, making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching. A major part in the joy of watching The Young Victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800's Regal Britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films. Everything from the costume designs, sets, hair styles, lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to Victoria's story without ever over-encumbering it. Indeed, while watching Vallée's interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element; and then there's the film's score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate Fellowes' script. Entwining the works of Schubert and Strauss into Victoria and Albert's story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with, but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer Ilan Eshkeri's original work just as well. Yet for all the poignant compositions, lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene, the single most important factor hereand indeed to most period dramasare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life. Thankfully The Young Victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that. Between the sweet, budding romance of Victoria (Emily Blunt) and Albert (Rupert Friend) and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like (spearheaded by a terrific Mark Strong and Paul Bettany), the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to Fellowe's screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic \\"nice to look at but dim underneath\\" affair so common with these outings. In the end, it's hard to fault a work such as The Young Victoria. It's got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance, plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details. Of course, it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama; yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable. Vallée never seems to be striving for grandeur, nor does he seem content at making a run-of-the-mill escapist piece for aficionados. Somewhere within this gray middle-ground lies The Young Victoria, sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions; beautiful, memorable but most of all, human. - A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net) Choose your answer.

Eliot, 'The Love Song Of J. Alfred........'?","completion":"The complete title of the poem by T.S. Eliot is 'The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock'. The poem was one of T.S. Eliot's earliest major works, and was published in 1915. Often labeled as a dramatic monologue, it's a piece of writing that uses a speaking character to reveal his or her mind in depth. The character here is J. Alfred Prufrock, an intellectual, neurotic individual who leads the reader through a flowing, stream-of-consciousness depiction of his thoughts as he considers a proposal, an encounter, and finally, his own failings. This poem is characterized by its unusual and intricate structure, deeply philosophical tone and extreme use of metaphor and imagery. Eliot uses Prufrock to portray the insecurity and fear that many people feel when confronting the possibilities of life and love in a modern, constantly changing world. The interior monologue of Prufrock allows Eliot to explore complex issues of time and human responsibility, of aspiration and ethical ennui. The poem is considered a notable and representative example of the Modernist literary movement of the early 20th century, characterized by use of stream-of-consciousness technique, novel perspectives and shifts in time and space, depicting the overwhelming nature of sexual and social anxiety, and the alienation from a mechanizing, impersonal society. In 'The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,' T.S. Eliot obliquely exhibits the thoughts and decisions of the poem's subject, Prufrock, as he struggles with feelings of insecurity, aging, and missed opportunities, and he gradually reveals himself as a character who is silencing and burying his desires rather than acting on them. In other words, it's a beautifully crafted exploration of the mind's inner working, illustrating how our thoughts, fears, doubts and desires can keep us prisoner, preventing us from taking the actions that we need to, to progress in life."},{"prompt":"Given this review: \\"Sucks Does not let me do my hack.\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Robinson beat Lito Sheppard and Brian Dawkins missed the tackle as the Seahawks jumped out to a 7-0 lead. Donovan McNabb had another ugly start, firing incompletions on his first seven pass attempts. However, in the second quarter, the Eagles began to move the ball and McNabb found Reggie Brown for a 22-yard touchdown. On the next drive, with first and goal, the Eagles ran a play-action fake and McNabb threw it to offensive guard Todd Herremans (who was lined up as a tight end) for a 1-yard touchdown and a 14-7 lead. Philadelphia's next four drives led to David Akers field goals as they sailed to a 26-7 win. The Eagles' defense forced Seattle to punt on their final ten possessions and Darren Howard had two sacks. McNabb finished with 349 yards passing, two touchdowns, and an interception. Backup tight end Brent Celek had the game of his life - finishing with six catches and 131 receiving yards.

The verbs are the same, but the sequence is different. Step 3: Analyze the potential impact of the change in verb sequence on the meaning of the sentences: In the first sentence, \\"begin to live\\" suggests that they start living with him first, and then they \\"migrate\\" illegally. In the second sentence, \\"begin to migrate\\" indicates that they start migrating with him first, and then they \\"live\\" with him illegally. However, both actions seem to happen simultaneously or in a very close time frame, which means that the change in verb sequence does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentences. Step 4: Compare the outcomes in both sentences: In both sentences, \\"the small world in which he operates is destroyed\\" is the outcome.

Why didn't they just give the money to the poor?\\" The question about cathedrals was asked by a student to Mr. Harvey during a school field trip to Salisbury Cathedral. \\"That's a good question,\\" he replied. \\"Partly to inspire them - to get them to look up with awe.\\" I'm not sure that cathedrals have that impact on everyone, but this movie certainly had that impact on me. It was awesome! It didn't start out that way. For a while it seemed to be little more than a depiction of - well - a school field trip to Salisbury Cathedral. If you've ever been on a high school field trip to anywhere this is basically it. You have a group of largely disinterested kids just happy to be out of school for a day, the bus driver who's driven crazy by them and some teachers trying desperately to keep it all under control. Been there, done that, got the t-shirt was my initial reaction. I figured that in the end this was going to be a typical story of a teacher managing to inspire a group of disinterested students. YAWN! But it turns out to be so much more! Timothy Spall was brilliant as Mr. Harvey - a sombre, unsmiling teacher with a strange fascination for cathedrals. Over the course of the movie, his story slowly comes out and becomes the focal point of the story. We also get introduced to some of the troubled students - most notably Helen, also brilliantly played by Nathalie Press, who's into self-mutilation. This isn't a religious movie, but it includes some powerful reflections on religious themes. When Harvey's colleague Jonathon (played by Ben Miles) says \\"I don't care what anyone believes as long as they don't try to force it on anyone else\\" Harvey replies, \\"that isn't tolerance - it's indifference!\\" - which is, in fact (in my opinion) what often passes for religious tolerance in our society. There are scenes of reconciliation between various characters, and the final scene of the movie was brilliant. As Harvey climbs back on the bus, director Susanna White has the camera slowly pan upwards, so that the final shot is simply of the sky - hearkening back to Harvey's comment that the purpose of the cathedral is to get people to look up in awe. The cathedral accomplishes its goal. We look up into the universe in awe, seeking something greater than ourselves, however we choose to define it. This is a very powerful and very inspiring movie. 9/10 What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly positive. The reviewer was impressed with the movie and found it inspiring, describing it as \\"awesome\\" and praising the performances of the actors.

The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456. Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Who was the first emperor to notice the commercial potential to Melaka?\\" is \\"Cheng Ho\\"? Choose from: A). no B). yes","completion":"A). no The correct answer is \\"no\\" as it was not Emperor Cheng Ho who first noticed the commercial potential of Melaka, but Emperor Chu Ti. As stated in the passage, \\"In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka.\\" This shows that Emperor Chu Ti was the one directing trade efforts and recognized the potential in Melaka, while Cheng Ho was the admiral leading the fleet to this destination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Adoption is where a child is legally placed with guardians or parents (or perhaps a single parent) other than the birth mother or father. Once an adoption is finalized, all parental rights are turned over to the adoptive parents and there is no legal difference between adoptive parents and natural birth parents. There are generally two types of adoption, which are closed adoption and open adoption. When an adopted person has access to his or her adoption file and original records, it is referred to as an open adoption. The term is also used to describe any contact that may be between the adoptive family, the birth parents, and the adopted child. The level of openness can change greatly in such contact depending on each individual relationship. There can be indirect contact between the natural birth parents and the child through the form of letters and photographs, or there can be actual physical contact. A semi-open adoption is where the birth parents may have contact with the adoptive parents before the birth of the child, either once or several times. After the birth there is no more contact. A semi-open adoption may remain as it is or it can become either open or closed. A closed adoption is where only the medical and historical information about the biological parents is given to the adoptive family. Typically, the birth and adoptive parents do not know each other's identities. The record of the birth parents is kept sealed . A closed adoption is usually only effective in the adoption of babies.

A later tradition recorded his entry into Jerusalem: according to Josephus, Alexander was shown the Book of Daniel's prophecy, presumably chapter 8, which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire. He spared Jerusalem and pushed south into Egypt. However, Alexander met with resistance at Gaza. The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill, requiring a siege. When \\"his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible... this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the attempt\\". After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold fell, but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound. As in Tyre, men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery. Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332 BC, where he was regarded as a liberator. He was pronounced son of the deity Amun at the Oracle of Siwa Oasis in the Libyan desert. Henceforth, Alexander often referred to Zeus-Ammon as his true father, and after his death, currency depicted him adorned with rams horn as a symbol of his divinity.

Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk. and a hint : Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

What was going on in that conversation?","completion":"In the provided conversation, three individuals - Tom, Barack, and John - are discussing whether they should join a team gathering for the night. It seems that there is an event or a meet-up arranged by a group they belong to – which could be a co-worker meeting, a club gathering, or any social event related to a group they are members of. Despite their stated obligation to attend the event, all three express reluctance regarding their participation. From Barack and John’s response to Tom's initial query, it's apparent they feel an obligation to attend the event, despite predicting that it will likely be a monotonous affair. Their consensus on its potential tedium, signaled by terms like \\"boring\\" and \\"extremely boring\\", suggests past experience with such occasions that were underwhelming. The statement “They're already talking we don't want to integrate with the team” suggests rumors or criticisms about their perceived lack of enthusiasm or participation within the group. This makes it even more important for them to attend and show their compatibility and commitment. Tom's proposition of consuming alcohol before attending aims to make the event more bearable, suggesting that they’d feel more at ease or tolerant towards the situation when influenced by alcohol. This implies that all three men may prefer relaxed, informal social settings and they find such serious or formal group events uncomfortable or draining. Barack's agreement with Tom's suggestion further reflects their mutual sentiments towards the gathering. Therefore, what we observe is a deliberation between friends or colleagues who feel obliged to attend a group event due to societal or professional pressures, despite their personal lack of interest or enthusiasm. They are trying to find alternative means, such as consuming alcohol in this instance, to make the experience more palatable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

On 17 April 1414, Henry and other enemies of Louis VII founded the Parakeet Society. On 8 July 1415, the society was changed into the League of Constance, an alliance for mutual defense against Louis VII. In 1417 in Constance, Louis insulted Henry by calling him \\"the son of a cook\\". When Louis then accused Henry of having shed human blood, Henry and fifteen of his followers physically attacked Louis and injured him severely. After this attack, Louis described Henry as a pluethunt , which did little to defuse the conflict. Henry XVI evaded punishment for the attack on Louis VII only through the intercession of Frederick of Brandenburg and his cousins Dukes Ernest and William III in Munich and especially by paying 6000 guilders to King Sigismund. Henry XVI wanted revenge. The conflict escalated into a war when an army from Bavaria-Ingolstadt burned down the castle of the Burgrave of Nuremberg. John III, who had succeeded his brother William II as Duke of Bavaria-Straubing in 1418, remained neutral. When was the League of Constance originally formed?","completion":"The League of Constance was originally formed on 8 July 1415, as an alliance for mutual defense against Louis VII, following the foundation of the Parakeet Society on 17 April 1414."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Traditionally youngsters have been sent to after-school classes run at madrassas, where they learn to read and write Arabic and recite verses from the Koran. The madrassas are sometimes attached to mosques or Islamic centres but can also be in a person's home. An estimated 250,000 Muslim children attend about 2,000 of these religious education establishments in the UK. But increasingly parents are turning to online service providers who teach children how to recite the Koran using Skype. Listen to Rahila Bano's report on learning the Koran online on the BBC Asian Network Reports at 13:00 BST and 17:00 BST on Wednesday 6 June. BBC Asian Network Reports Humza Rana, who is eight, eagerly logs on to the computer in his living room, closely watched by his mother. He enrolled on a course run by the Faiz-e-Quran Online Academy, three years ago. He receives three 30-minute sessions a week of one-to-one tuition with a qualified Islamic scholar based at a centre in Pakistan. The lesson is conducted over Skype but without the video and using software that displays pages of the Quran. He reads the verse and is corrected by his tutor if he makes a mistake. His father, Fawad, says it is an excellent service and, as they live on the outskirts of Birmingham several miles from their nearest Islamic educational institution, it is the best way for his son to learn. Mr Rana says: \\"If we took him to a madrassa it would take two hours in the traffic and when he got home, it would be time to eat and then go to bed. It's a quality service at a premium price and we can monitor him at the same time. My five-year-old son is now also a pupil.\\" He says his son has made excellent progress. He has almost completed reading, in Arabic, the 30 books of the Koran. Saima Bibi, from Sheffield, chose the same route for her 10-year-old daughter. She says: \\"It's very time consuming, you have to bring the child home from school and then take them out again and it's hard. I also work and I prefer her to be taught in the comfort of her own home, it is much safer.\\" News of the online service providers spreads by word of mouth and relatives or friends can often vouch for the quality of the education provided. But there is concern that some of the hundreds of online teachers, who are often based in Pakistan, Syria, Egypt and elsewhere, hold radical views and could indoctrinate their pupils. One online service, Easy Qur'an Memorising, is run by a former member of a banned terrorist organisation. Mian Shahzib was a student activist for Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) in Pakistan, an organisation proscribed by the UN. But, speaking to me on the phone from Lahore, he denied he was still involved with them. Mr Shahzib says: \\"I don't talk about jihad, I don't talk about any organisation. I just teach the Koran and nothing else. I am a simple preacher man.\\" He says he had been a student activist but no longer had any contact with JuD. There is no evidence he was ever involved in criminal activity. Imam Salim Ghisa, from the Iqra Education Centre in Preston, is worried about some of the online providers. The Iqra centre is a modern madrassa with desks and chairs, interactive whiteboards and other up-to-date teaching aids. It aims to recreate the schooling experience a child has in the classroom. Mr Ghisa says: \\"Largely, with Islamic teachings and statements, a lot of it is up to interpretation. That is why we have different interpretations by extremists, they throw a different slant on to a verse from the Koran, so the same verse can be interpreted by a modernist or a traditionalist and have a different meaning.\\" Sultan Chaudhri, the owner of one online service, Faiz-e-Quran, believes the onus must be on parents to research education providers. He is a former army colonel and has 47 British children on his books. Mr Chaudhri says:\\" Anything which is said by our teachers is recorded by our IT server and we sometimes monitor this. Also, our tutors are all in one small room and are supervised so whatever is said is said in front of everyone. We also encourage parents to take a keener interest in what their child is learning. We find it helps them to complete the course faster.\\" The Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board (MINAB) is a self-regulatory body for about 500 madrassas and mosques in the UK. Director, Mustafa Field, said:\\"At this stage, there is little evidence to suggest that Muslim pupils are in danger of being radicalised. What we would say is that children should get a holistic education. They must be able to critically analyse what they are reading and what they are taught.\\" It is not known if any British youngsters have been led astray through online services run by radicals but it is clear there is concern among some Muslims that it could happen.","completion":"In the United Kingdom, more parents are turning to online services providers to teach their children how to recite the Quran, as a convenient alternative to traditional after-school classes or madrassas. With an estimated 250,000 Muslim children attending about 2,000 religious educational establishments in the UK, the option to use video calls and software displaying pages of the Quran has gained popularity for its ease and lower time commitment. However, there is growing concern about the potential for online teachers, often based in countries like Pakistan, Syria, and Egypt, to hold radical views and indoctrinate their pupils. While there is no evidence suggesting British students have been radicalized through these services, it is a point of concern among some Muslims. The onus is placed on parents to research education providers and ensure their children receive a well-rounded education."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Entailment in the linguistic or logical context refers to the situation where the truth of one sentence (the first sentence) necessarily guarantees the truth of another sentence (the second sentence). In other words, it's impossible for the first sentence to be true and the second one to be false. For entailment to hold, every situation in which the first sentence is true would be a situation where the second sentence is also true. In the case of these two sentences, the first one outlines a cost of compliance that ranges between 1 and 1 annually. If we simply look at numbers, the value stated here is not clear and seems to be somewhat nonsensical as both ends of the range are the same. It could possibly imply that the annualized cost of compliance will always be 1. The second sentence, on the other hand, mentions a total estimate of 17. There is no specific context attached to this figure (e.g., we don't know what, exactly, this estimate refers to, whether it's the cost of compliance or something else). So it's unclear whether these 17 are part of, included in, or have any relation to the cost of compliance mentioned in the first sentence. Even if both sentences were to involve the same context (cost of compliance), there would still be no entailment. Because the range of 1 to 1 given in the first sentence does not necessarily ensure the total amount would ever reach 17. Therefore, the second sentence is not entailed by the first; the truth of the first sentence does not guarantee the truth of the second."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Just within the past week, a disturbing video released by the hacktivist group Knight Sec exposed details surrounding the alleged sexual assault of a teenage girl in Steubenville, Ohio; more protests erupted over the horrific gang rape of a young woman in India; and the final sessions of the 112th Congress did not reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Whether it's here in the United States, or in other parts of the world, violence against women persists and justice often falls through the cracks. The Steubenville rape case has come back into the spotlight due in large part to online activists who felt that it wasn't being taken seriously. While the case against two teenage football players is being investigated, with a trial set for February, we as a society must do all we can to end sexual violence against women. The video footage and messages that surfaced on social media, which appear to depict the sexual abuse of a girl, highlight horrible attitudes and unacceptable behaviors toward women. One thing is clear: Those \\"bystanders\\" who were present on the night of the alleged rape bear a responsibility. Why didn't any one of them assist her or respond to what was happening? And while three members of the football team have come forward to testify in the case, more should have. The \\"code of silence\\" that is often found among athletes, fraternities and other similar groups must be addressed. We call upon our athletic teams and coaches to speak up because they can play an important role in prevention. Coaches can educate young men about the need to treat women with respect, encourage healthy relationships with the opposite sex, and promote non-misogynist behavior. We must ensure that young men see sexual violence against women as despicable and do all they can to stop it. According to a recent national survey, 1 in 5 women in the U.S. reported having been raped. Most rapes are perpetrated by someone the victim knows. Victimization can start early in life. We still live in a culture where young women are not given a voice and victims of sexual violence are sometimes not believed. Opinion: Why don't some boys see it as rape? The Ohio incident has sparked outrage since it first was reported. Advocates and community members were glad that the case was turned over to special prosecutors in the Office of Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine to avoid potential conflicts of interest. When Cleveland Plain Dealer reporter Rachel Dissell took up the story in September, it inspired people who had been sexually assaulted to come forward about their own experiences. These people know that they were no longer alone. Fewer than half of Ohio's 88 counties have rape crisis services available for individuals who have been sexually assaulted, and many existing programs lack the adequate resources to provide needed prevention and community outreach to address the myths about sexual violence and promote a culture that supports rape survivors. In Steubenville, there is no prevention funding to address sexual violence. As for survivors, how can they seek justice and healing if they have little support and resources available? We call upon House Speaker John Boehner -- who's from Ohio -- to help us end sexual violence. Opinion: End culture of rape in 2013. The Violence Against Women Act includes provisions for engaging men and boys as allies to ending sexual violence, providing bystander intervention and prevention in high schools and on college campuses.

The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had higher range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940.\\"?","completion":"Question: How did the use of aircraft carriers change naval combat and demonstrate their effectiveness during World War II, as illustrated by examples in the passage?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to determine whether the organism in question is a plant or an animal, Claudia should focus on the characteristic that differentiates the two groups most fundamentally. Let us have a look at each option and see why (IV) is the best choice: (I). Does the organism have cells? Both plants and animals are composed of cells, so this question will not help Claudia in distinguishing between the two. All living organisms, including plants and animals, are made up of cells, so this characteristic is shared by both groups. (II). Does the organism reproduce? Both plants and animals reproduce; they just do so in different ways. Plants can reproduce both sexually (with the help of pollinators, such as bees) and asexually (through budding or vegetative reproduction). Animals reproduce by laying eggs or giving birth to live young, depending on the specific species. Reproduction is an essential part of life for all organisms, so this option isn't helpful in identifying whether the organism is a plant or an animal. (III). Does the organism live in the forest? While many plants and animals live in forests, not all of them do. Some plants grow in the desert, while others grow in or near bodies of water. Similarly, animals can be found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, oceans, and mountains. The habitat of an organism isn't enough to determine whether it is a plant or an animal. (IV). Does the organism make its own food? This characteristic helps differentiate between plants and animals. Plants are called \\"autotrophs\\" because they produce their own food through a process called photosynthesis. In this process, plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose, which is then used as an energy source for growth, reproduction, and other plant functions. On the other hand, animals are \\"heterotrophs,\\" meaning they must consume other organisms (plants or other animals) in order to obtain their energy. This fundamental difference in acquiring energy makes option (IV) the best question for Claudia to ask to determine whether the organism in the photograph is a plant or an animal. By focusing on the organism's ability to make its own food, Claudia can effectively determine if it is a plant (autotrophic) or an animal (heterotrophic)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Thousands of teenagers will be able to move to a new wave of \\"studio schools\\" at the age of 14 to improve their chances of finding a job in UK. Twelve new-style schools are open to act as a bridge to the workplace and cut the number of NEETs. Under plans, schools will operate longer days and work outside standard school terms. Each teenager will be expected to spend between four hours and two days a week on work placements with business related to the school and a personal coach will be sent to the teenagers to act as a school \\"line manager\\". The reforms are put forward because of the fears that too many teenagers are finishing full-time education at present but they are short of the skills needed to succeed in the workplace. According to a recent report, more than two thirds of employers believe school and college leavers have less important employability skills, while 55% say they are unable to manage their time or daily routine. And the number of NEETs who are not in education has hit a record high, with almost one-in-five young people being left without a job or a training place. The Department for Education will tell the public the building of 12 studio schools - providing for around 3,600 teenagers - in areas such as Liverpool, Stevenage, Stock-on-Trent and Fulham, west London. Each one will be connected to the local employers. Under plans, teenagers will be able to move out of ordinary schools to attend them between the ages of 14 and 19. The government said all subjects would be taught \\"through projects, often prepared with employers\\" - with rules such as science being connected directly to local engineering companies or hospitals. Schools will operate a longer day to give teenagers a better understanding of the needs of the workplace. Along with their studies, students will carry out work placements for four hours a week, rising to two days a week of paid work for those aged 16 to 19. They will also get the chance to take professional qualifications connected directly to the needs of local employers. Question: What can be the best title for the passage? Options: A: Studio schools are popular in UK at present. B: More NEETs will find jobs from Studio schools. C: Teenagers will get jobs without full-time education. D: Studio schools are built to improve teens' employability skills. Answer:","completion":"D: Studio schools are built to improve teens' employability skills.

While on a tour of works at Cardiff, he caught a chill and returned to London, half-paralysed, where he lay dying for some three weeks. Among his last visitors were Oscar Wilde and James Whistler. He was buried in the tomb he designed for his mother at West Norwood, London. On his death, John Starling Chapple, Burges's office manager and close associate for more than twenty years, wrote \\"a constant relationship ... with one of the brightest ornaments of the profession has rendered the parting most severe. Thank God his work will live and ... be the admiration of future students. I have hardly got to realize my lonely position yet.

Viet Minh commander Nguyen Huu An orders his soldiers to \\"kill all they send, and they will stop coming\\". Eleven years later, the U.S. is fighting the Vietnam War. U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) is chosen to train and lead a battalion. After arriving in Vietnam, he learns that an American base has been attacked, and is ordered to take his 400 men after the enemy and eliminate the North Vietnamese attackers, despite the fact that intelligence has no idea of the number of enemy troops. As the haunting lament \\"Sgt. MacKenzie\\" plays, Moore leads a newly created air cavalry unit into the Ia Drang Valley. After landing in the \\"Valley of Death\\", the soldiers learn that the location they were sent to is actually the base camp for a veteran North Vietnamese army division of 4,000 men. Upon arrival in the area with a platoon of soldiers, 2nd Lt. Henry Herrick spots an enemy scout, runs after him, and orders reluctant soldiers to follow. The North Vietnamese scout lures them into an ambush, resulting in several men being killed, including Lt. Herrick and his subordinates.

Syntactic analysis: In terms of syntax, a sentence is considered well-formed if it follows the rules of grammar. The sentence in question consists of a subject, a verb, an object, and a prepositional phrase, all of which are arranged in a proper syntactic order. Let's break it down: Subject: \\"I\\" (the person performing the action, a pronoun) Verb: \\"put\\" (the action being performed, a transitive verb) Object: \\"the book\\" (the object being acted upon by 'put', a noun phrase) Prepositional phrase: \\"in the box\\" (providing more information about the action, containing a preposition \\"in\\" and the noun \\"the box\\") The sentence follows the conventional Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure, which is typical for English sentences. The prepositional phrase adds more context to the action. 2. Semantic analysis: Semantically, the sentence is meaningful and easy to understand. Each word conveys a clear meaning, and they together form a complete thought: \\"I\\" - Refers to the speaker or the person taking the action. \\"put\\" - Indicates the action of placing something somewhere or arranging it in a certain way. \\"the book\\" - Specifies the object that the speaker is placing, a singular book. \\"in the box\\" - Describes the location or destination where the book is being placed, inside a box.

The understory crops are shade tolerant or the overstory trees have fairly open canopies. A conspicuous example is shade-grown coffee. This practice reduces weeding costs and improves coffee quality and taste. The shade does not necessarily translate into lost or reduced yields. This is because the rate of photosynthesis hardly increases once the light intensity is over about one tenth that of direct overhead sunlight and declines with increasing light intensity. This means that shaded plants can grow well. Planting more than one level of vegetation can increase total photosynthesis and overall yields.

These orphan diseases are ones that involve fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States, or larger populations in certain circumstances. The Orphan Drug Act aims to encourage medical research and development for these rare diseases, as it can be financially disadvantageous for companies to invest in treatments for such limited patient populations. As a result, companies that choose to undertake the research and development for drugs to treat orphan diseases are rewarded with several incentives. These include tax reductions, fee waivers, and most importantly, market exclusivity on that specific drug for a limited time, which is typically seven years. This market exclusivity applies regardless of whether the drug is protected by patents or not.

They’re meant to be shared and gifted to family and friends, so have plenty! Picture pastries, also known as mooncake biscuits or “kung chai peng” in Cantonese, aren’t as well known as mooncakes but can still be a tasty dessert for the Moon Festival. They’re cookies made from the same dough that you used to form the outside of the mooncakes, and will need 1-2 days before they’re ready to eat. To make them: Make mooncake dough by combining flour and baking soda in a bowl, then making a small well in the center and stirring in golden syrup, oil, and baking soda solution. Knead the mix into a dough, then let it sit for 3 hours. Use cookie molds or cutters to make 10-20 cookies, then place them on a greased baking sheet. Bake them at 400 °F (204 °C) for 6 minutes. Remove the cookies, brush them with a beaten egg mixture, then bake them for another six minutes. Let them cool, then store them in an airtight container for 1-2 days so the golden syrup can soften the pastry.

Through its Corps of Cadets ROTC program, Virginia Tech is also designated as a one of six senior military colleges in the country. As the commonwealth's third-largest university, Virginia Tech offers 225 undergraduate and graduate degree programs to some 30,600 students and manages a research portfolio of 513 million, the largest of any university in Virginia. The university fulfills its land-grant mission of transforming knowledge to practice through technological leadership and by fueling economic growth and job creation locally, regionally, and across Virginia. - Blacksburg is an incorporated town in Montgomery County, Virginia, United States, with a population of 42,620 at the 2010 census. Blacksburg is dominated economically and demographically by the presence of Virginia Tech (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University). - John Redd Hutcheson ( January 13 , 1886 -- January 13 , 1962 ) was the ninth President of Virginia Tech. He served from January 12 , 1945 to August 12 , 1947 . VPI alumnus John Redd Hutcheson , known as Dr. Jack , agreed to take the job as president of VPI only for a few years . A former school teacher , high school principal , and university instructor , Hutcheson started working for the Virginia Agricultural Extension Service in 1914 as a livestock specialist and became its director in 1919 , developing a national reputation as an agricultural leader . Shortly after the affable Hutcheson took over the presidency on August 14 , 1945 , Japan surrendered to end World War II , and a two - day celebration ensued . When the fall quarter began soon thereafter , enrollment nearly doubled that of the previous quarter . The new president worked to prepare the campus for the influx of returning veterans as the college moved from wartime to peacetime conditions . The veterans generally had no interest in joining the corps of cadets , and for the first time , during winter quarter 1946 , civilians outnumbered cadets on campus . With the explosion in civilian students , 3,100 living on campus and another 900 day students came a need for housing . To help resolve the problem for married veterans , the college installed a trailer court that students called Vetsville surrounding the Solitude House , which was converted into a community center to serve the trailer court residents . Two additional trailer courts that students called Cassell Heights after financial and business manager Stuart K. Cassell followed in the area east of present - day Cassell Coliseum . The college also rented dormitory space at the Radford Arsenal to house other students and converted several buildings there into classrooms ; the new location became known as Rad - Tech.

Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents.

It is most often found in the form of sweetened condensed milk (SCM), with sugar added, and the two terms \\"condensed milk\\" and \\"sweetened condensed milk\\" are often used synonymously today. Sweetened condensed milk is a very thick, sweet product which when canned can last for years without refrigeration if not opened. Condensed milk is used in numerous dessert dishes in many countries. - Theobroma is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae, that is sometimes classified as a member of Sterculiaceae. It contains roughly 20 species of small understory trees native to the tropical forests of Central and South America. The generic name is derived from the Greek words (\\"theos\\"), meaning \\"god,\\" and (\\"broma\\"), meaning \\"food\\".

A representative democracy, Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as Guatemala City. - Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - The Aztec people were certain ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 14th to 16th centuries. The Nahuatl words \\"aztecatl\\" (singular) and \\"aztecah\\" (plural) mean \\"people from Aztlan\\", a mythological place for the Nahuatl-speaking culture of the time, and later adopted as the word to define the Mexica people. Often the term \\"Aztec\\" refers exclusively to the Mexica people of Tenochtitlan (now the location of Mexico City), situated on an island in Lake Texcoco, who referred to themselves as \\"Mxihcah Tenochcah\\" or \\"Clhuah Mexihcah\\" . - Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus \\"Vanilla\\", primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (\\"V. planifolia\\"). The word \\"vanilla\\", derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word (\\"vaina\\" itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as \\"little pod\\". Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called \\"tlilxochitl\\" by the Aztecs. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s. - Theobroma cacao is the taxonomic classification for the plant also called the cacao tree and the cocoa tree, which is a small (tall) evergreen tree in the family Malvaceae, native to the deep tropical regions of Central and South America. Its seeds, cocoa beans, are used to make cocoa mass, cocoa powder, confectionery, ganache and chocolate. - Mesoamerica was a region and cultural area in the Americas, extending approximately from central Mexico to Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and northern Costa Rica, within which pre-Columbian societies flourished before the Spanish colonization of the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries. It is one of six areas in the world where ancient civilization arose independently, and the second in the Americas along with Norte Chico (Caral-Supe) in present-day northern coastal Peru. - Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of \\"Theobroma cacao\\" seeds, roasted and ground, and often flavored with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BCE. In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as \\"xocoltl\\" , a Nahuatl word meaning \\"bitter water\\". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. - Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners.

Choices: - roof - sky - grieve - poop - molt The rationale to choose \\"poop\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"\\"Bird poop\\" is the most logical and reasonable choice among the given options. This is based on our understanding of the physical and natural behaviors of birds. Let's evaluate all the options to understand this conclusion: - \\"Roof\\": The term \\"roof\\" would rather protect Sarah from anything falling on her, including birds flying overhead. However, the context of the question establishes that something indeed lands on her when birds fly overhead. So, \\"roof\\" can be ruled out. - \\"Sky\\": In metaphorical terms, one could be 'covered' by the sky, meaning they are simply underneath it. But typically we wouldn't describe the sky as 'covering' a person in the context implied by the question. Normally, being covered implies something tangible is physically landing on the person, not something ethereal like the sky. - \\"Grieve\\": This term is emotionally oriented. Meaning deep sorrow, it would not make sense to correlate this with the action of birds flying overhead. Unless Sarah has trauma or a phobia associated with birds, which is not suggested in the context provided, this option can also be ruled out. - \\"Molt\\": Birds do molt, or lose their feathers, but the frequency of this event is not typically frequent enough to 'cover' Sarah every time birds flew overhead. Also, it's not mentioned whether she's underneath a nest or a place where birds frequently molt, so logically this option is far less likely than \\"poop\\". - \\"Poop\\": Finally, birds, like all living creatures, excrete waste, which is colloquially referred to as 'poop'. It is entirely common and biologically necessary for birds to poop while they fly. So, if Sarah is underneath their flight path, it would make sense for her to be covered in bird poop over time. Given these considerations, one can safely deduce that if Sarah loves birds and often sees them flying overhead, yet something from them falls on her, it would be most naturally and logically their \\"poop\\". So, the answer to the question: \\"Sarah loved birds, but when they flew overhead she was covered with what?\\" would be \\"poop\\"."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A cultivated and wealthy man, Coke made the Grand Tour in his youth and was away from England for six years between 1712 and 1718. It is likely he met both Burlington—the aristocratic architect at the forefront of the Palladian revival movement in England—and William Kent in Italy in 1715, and that in the home of Palladianism the idea of the mansion at Holkham was conceived. Coke returned to England, not only with a newly acquired library, but also an art and sculpture collection with which to furnish his planned new mansion. However, after his return, he lived a feckless life, preoccupying himself with drinking, gambling and hunting, and being a leading supporter of cockfighting. He made a disastrous investment in the South Sea Company and when the South Sea Bubble burst in 1720, the resultant losses delayed the building of Coke's planned new country estate for over ten years. Coke, who had been made Earl of Leicester in 1744, died in 1759—five years before the completion of Holkham—having never fully recovered his financial losses. Thomas's wife, Lady Margaret Tufton, Countess of Leicester (1700–1775), would oversee the finishing and furnishing of the house.Although Colen Campbell was employed by Thomas Coke in the early 1720s, the oldest existing working and construction plans for Holkham were drawn by Matthew Brettingham, under the supervision of Thomas Coke, in 1726. These followed the guidelines and ideals for the house as defined by Kent and Burlington. The Palladian revival style chosen was at this time making its return in England. The style made a brief appearance in England before the Civil War, when it was introduced by Inigo Jones. However, following the Restoration it was replaced in popular favour by the Baroque style. The \\"Palladian revival\\", popular in the 18th century, was loosely based on the appearance of the works of the 16th-century Italian architect Andrea Palladio.

His social worker assured me that he would be a good, reliable busboy. But I had never had a mentally handicapped employee. He was short, a little fat, with the smooth facial features and thick-togued speech of Down's Syndrome . I thought most of my customers would be uncomfortable around Stevie, so I closely watched him for the first few weeks. I shouldn't have worried. After the first week, Stevie had my staff wrapped around his stubby little finger, and within a month my regular trucker customers had adopted him as their official truck stop mascot. After that, I really didn't care what the rest of the customers thought of him. He was like a 21-year-old in blue jeans and Nikes, eager to laugh and eager to please, but fierce in his attention to his duties. Every salt and pepper shaker was exactly in its place, not a bread crumb or coffee spill was visible when Stevie got done with the table. Our only problem was persuading him to wait to clean a table until after the customers were finished. Over time, we learned that he lived with his mother, a widow who was disabled. Money was tight, and _ . That's why the restaurant was a gloomy place that morning last August, the first morning in three years that Stevie missed work. He was at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester getting a heart surgery. His social worker said that people with Downs Syndrome often had heart problems at an early age and there was a good chance he would come through the surgery in good shape and be back at work in a few months. A ripple of excitement ran through the staff later that morning when word came that he was out of surgery, in recovery, and doing fine.

B). positive.).","completion":"A) Negative movie review: Title: The Downward Spiral Director: James Harison Cast: Samuel Cooper, Lily Walters, David McDonald, Sarah Williams The Downward Spiral, directed by James Harison and starring an ensemble cast, including Samuel Cooper, Lily Walters, David McDonald, and Sarah Williams, is a prime example of how a film with great potential can be doomed by poor execution and disregard for the nuances of storytelling. The film's premise revolves around the lives of four friends who share a dark secret that threatens to tear them apart. The potential for a gripping psychological thriller is present, but the plot quickly devolves into a series of poorly directed scenes filled with clichéd dialogue, inconsistent pacing, and a lack of depth in the exploration of the characters' motivations. One of the most glaring issues in The Downward Spiral is the lack of dynamic and emotional range exhibited by the lead actors. Samuel Cooper's portrayal of Charlie, the troubled artist, is utterly stagnant, lacking vulnerability and authenticity. Lily Walters as Amanda, the ambitious career woman, is similarly unconvincing and unable to convey the nuances of her character's journey from determined and driven to emotionally unhinged. Furthermore, the cinematography and editing in the film are equally underwhelming. A series of disjointed shots and dizzying jump-cuts further detract from an already weak storyline. There is a palpable sense that the filmmakers were trying to create a sense of unease and tension through visual chaos, but these efforts only served to disorient and frustrate the viewer. Moreover, the narrative structure suffers from numerous plot holes and inconsistencies, ultimately creating confusion and diluting the film's emotional impact. The flashbacks meant to flesh out the characters' pasts only contribute to a muddled sense of chronology, taking away from the urgency and danger that should be present throughout the movie. As if the poor acting, cinematography, and storytelling were not enough, the film is further marred by a resounding lack of subtlety in its dialogue and symbolism. Characters frequently deliver on-the-nose lines devoid of any dramatic tension or weight, robbing the audience of any investment in the story's outcome. The clumsy use of symbolism, such as the recurring image of a broken mirror, fails to provide any profound insights, instead coming across as contrived and disingenuous. Despite moments of intrigue and the occasional glimmer of potential, The Downward Spiral is ultimately a disappointing and frustrating experience that fails to capitalize on its promising premise. With underwhelming performances, poor technical execution, and a convoluted narrative, this film will leave audiences feeling unfulfilled and longing for the truly thrilling and thought-provoking story that could have been."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The band has, since 1970, consisted of bassist and lead vocalist Dusty Hill, guitarist and lead vocalist Billy Gibbons (the band's leader, main lyricist and musical arranger), and drummer Frank Beard. \\"As genuine roots musicians, they have few peers\\", according to former musician, critic and collector Michael \\"Cub\\" Koda. \\"Gibbons is one of America's finest blues guitarists working in the arena rock idiom [...] while Hill and Beard provide the ultimate rhythm section support.\\" The original line-up was formed in Houston and consisted of Gibbons, organist Lanier Greig (died February 2013) and drummer Dan Mitchell. The name of the band was Gibbons' idea. The band had a little apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers' names utilized initials. Gibbons particularly noticed B.B. King and Z.Z. Hill and thought of combining the two into \\"ZZ King\\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \\"king is going at the top\\" which brought him to \\"ZZ Top\\". ZZ Top was managed by Bill Ham, a Waxahachie, Texas native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \\"Salt Lick\\", in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \\"Miller's Farm\\". Both songs were credited to Gibbons. Immediately after the recording of \\"Salt Lick\\", Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a band-mate of Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Mitchell was replaced by Frank Beard of the American Blues. Due to lack of interest from U.S. record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from London Records. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and Dusty Hill was selected as his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Beaumont on February 10. In addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ZZ Top's First Album (1971) was released and exhibited the band's humour, with \\"barrelhouse\\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released Rio Grande Mud (1972), which failed commercially and the promotional tour consisted of mostly empty auditoriums.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"ZZ Top is a cool rock band with three members: Billy, Dusty, and Frank, who have been playing music together since 1970.

King and Z.Z. Hill. When they first started, they had a different band name and different members, but later they changed their name to ZZ Top and found the perfect mix of people to create their special sound.

Q: Which company made Spectre? A: With a budget around 245 million, it is the most expensive Bond film and one of the most expensive films ever made. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: Spectre, the twenty-fourth installment in the James Bond film series, was produced by Eon Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), and Columbia Pictures. Directed by Sam Mendes, the movie continued the story of British secret agent James Bond, played by Daniel Craig. The film was released in 2015 and featured a star-studded cast including Christoph Waltz, Léa Seydoux, and Ralph Fiennes. Spectre was made on a massive budget of around 245 million, making it not only the most expensive Bond film in the series but also one of the most costly films in the history of cinema. The film was a global success at the box office, generating over 880 million in revenue. Eon Productions is a British film production company that has been responsible for producing the James Bond film series since its inception in 1962 with the release of Dr. No. It was founded by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, who initially obtained the rights to produce adaptations of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels. Over the years, the production of Bond films has continued to be a family affair, with Broccoli's daughter, Barbara Broccoli, and his stepson, Michael G. Wilson, taking over the reins as producers following his passing. To summarize, Spectre was produced by Eon Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Columbia Pictures.

Answer the following question: Here's a question: James hated getting in line. The time spent brought him only what feeling? Here are possible answers to this question: - linearity - have to wait for - long wait - anger - irritation I believe the correct choice is \\"irritation\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice is \\"irritation,\\" and here's why: Step 1: Understand the context The question states that James hated getting in line and that the time spent in line brought him a particular feeling. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options - \\"Linearity\\" doesn't relate to emotions. Linearity may describe the nature of a line, but it does not express how James feels about it. - \\"Have to wait for\\" is not a feeling but rather a description of the action James has to perform. - \\"Long wait\\" is also not a feeling, but a characterization of the time spent in line. Now, we have two options left: anger and irritation. Step 3: Analyze the remaining options Between \\"anger\\" and irritation,\\" irritation is the more appropriate choice in this context. Anger implies a stronger and more hostile emotion, while irritation describes a more moderate level of annoyance or discomfort. Given the context of the question, it would be more reasonable for James to feel irritation due to the time spent waiting in line rather than outright anger. Therefore, the correct choice is \\"irritation\\" as it best captures the feeling James experiences while in line."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The answer is:","completion":"Yes, \\"make sure she's ok\\" is a valid answer to the question, \\"What does Skylar need to do before this?\\" When someone slips and falls, especially on a wet surface, there is always an inherent risk of injury. To ensure that Skylar is not seriously hurt, it is crucial to assess her condition first and prioritize her well-being. Immediate actions after a fall include: 1. Encouraging Skylar to stay down for a moment and take a few breaths, as there might be an adrenaline rush or shock in response to the fall. This step can help in calming her down and assessing any pain or discomfort she might be experiencing. 2. Asking Skylar if she feels any pain, particularly in her head, neck, or back, as such injuries can sometimes be severe. In case she complains of severe discomfort, it is better to call for medical help rather than attempt to move or stand up. 3. Examining for any visible signs of injury like cuts, bruises, swelling, or dislocation, which might require appropriate first aid or professional medical assistance. 4. Depending on her responses and the assessment, Skylar can try to move her limbs slowly and cautiously, while carefully sitting and eventually standing if there are no intense sensations of pain or dizziness. 5. If everything appears to be well and Skylar feels comfortable to stand and walk, someone should assist her as she gets up to ensure she has adequate support, in case she feels unsteady or requires additional help. Before resuming any activities, it is essential to ensure that Skylar takes some time to regain her composure, monitor any potential symptoms that arise, and possibly clean and dry the wet floor to avoid any further incidents. In conclusion, making sure Skylar is okay is a valid and necessary step to address her well-being and immediate needs after falling on the wet floor, as it allows for proper assessment and intervention in the case of any injuries, pain, or discomfort."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Alexander's body was laid in a gold anthropoid sarcophagus that was filled with honey, which was in turn placed in a gold casket. According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest \\"would be happy and unvanquishable forever\\". Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative. While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis. His successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least late Antiquity. Ptolemy IX Lathyros, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage. The recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece, at Amphipolis, dating from the time of Alexander the Great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege. Pompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all visited the tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. Caligula was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. Around AD 200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy. The so-called \\"Alexander Sarcophagus\\", discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of Abdalonymus (died 311 BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the battle of Issus in 331. However, more recently, it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymus' death.

Finally, \\"Jerry Bruckheimer productions\\" might create positive or negative emotions depending on one's familiarity with and appreciation of his work. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is known for creating high-energy, action-packed movies and television shows. For a fan of his work, this mention could evoke a positive feeling, as they expect to experience remarkable visuals and thrilling stories.

The first question is about setting up a Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP) which is like creating your own mini-internet service for people close to you to use. The person is saying they have everything ready but they're missing a packet switch or circuit switch. These are like traffic controllers for internet information. A packet switch separates information into little parcels to send them over the internet, and a circuit switch sets up a direct link between sender and receiver for the duration of the communication. Both are necessary for managing how information travels over the internet. The second question is about getting an IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) connection from an Internet Service Provider (ISP). IPv6 is the latest way to give devices an address on the internet, so they can send and receive information. The person is asking if it's guaranteed to work anywhere in the world, regardless of which ISP you get it from, which means they're asking about global internet compatibility or connectivity.

Because we are making an inference from this user's review, it is essential to note that people have different tastes and preferences. What one person may love, another may not.

Who is the central businessman character in the film It's a Wonderful Life?","completion":"The central businessman character in the film \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is George Bailey, portrayed by the iconic actor James Stewart. Released in 1946 and directed by Frank Capra, \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is a classic American film that tells the heartwarming story of George Bailey, who is a kind-hearted, selfless, and hardworking businessman in the fictional town of Bedford Falls. George Bailey is the son of Peter Bailey, the owner of the Bailey Building and Loan Association. This small, family-owned financial institution helps the community members of Bedford Falls buy their own homes, serving as an integral part of the town's economic life. After the death of his father, George has to sacrifice his own dreams of traveling and going to college to take over the family business, as he recognizes its importance to the town's prosperity. Throughout the film, George faces immense business-related challenges due to the influence of the antagonist, Mr. Henry F. Potter, who is the wealthiest and the most powerful businessman in Bedford Falls. Mr. Potter, who despises the Bailey family's generosity and sense of community, consistently attempts to undermine George and the Bailey Building and Loan Association to monopolize the financial market in Bedford Falls. On the brink of disaster, when his uncle misplaces a large sum of money, George contemplates suicide, believing his life and business endeavors to be a failure. However, his guardian angel, Clarence, appears and shows George an alternate reality – what Bedford Falls would be like if George had never been born. In this alternate reality, the town's name has been changed to Pottersville, and it is plagued by decay, crime, and misery. The residents who George had helped throughout his life are in various dire situations, all resulting from the absence of George's impact. Through this supernatural intervention, George realizes that his life has indeed been of enormous significance not just to his family but also to his community. Reinvigorated by this newfound appreciation of his life and accomplishments, George returns to his real timeline, ready to face the consequences of the misplaced money. However, in a heartwarming and community-driven resolution, the townspeople, who learned about George's predicament and remembering all the good things he has done for them throughout the years, collectively donate enough money to make up for the missing funds, thus saving the Bailey Building and Loan from bankruptcy. George's journey showcases the profound impact one person's life can make on an entire community and the importance of genuine connections, kindness, and empathy. In conclusion, the central businessman character in \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is none other than George Bailey, a morally-upright, selfless, and deeply caring man who learns the true value of his life after overcoming emotional and professional challenges. His story transcends time and continues to resonate with audiences even today, serving as a testament to the power of human connection and compassion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Work slowly. Keep your hands in contact with the skin at all times. Communicate. Pay attention to knots. Avoid the spine and any bones.\\"","completion":"Title: The Art of Slow, Intuitive Touch: Enhancing Wellness through Effective Bodywork Techniques Introduction: The power of touch has been widely acknowledged for its capacity to provide relief, comfort, and promote overall wellness. In the realm of bodywork, various massage techniques have been developed to target different therapeutic goals. As practitioners, it is essential to create a nurturing and effective environment for our clients. This article will explore the importance of working slowly, maintaining contact, communicating, recognizing knots, and avoiding specific areas during massage and bodywork sessions. 1. The Importance of Working Slowly In our fast-paced world, there is an increasing need for slowing down and taking the time to truly connect with our bodies. By working slowly during a massage, therapists can facilitate a deeper level of relaxation and heighten the client's awareness of their physical and emotional state. This deliberate pace allows the therapist to accurately interpret the body's subtle cues while enabling the client to develop greater trust and comfort. 2. Maintaining Constant Hand Contact Practitioners should always aim to keep their hands in contact with the client's skin whenever possible. This continuous connection not only enhances the client's sense of security but also fosters a more profound, immersive experience. Additionally, it allows the therapist to maintain their focus and build an intuitive understanding of the body's needs and responses, ultimately leading to more effective results. 3. Embracing Communication Effective communication is a critical component of any successful bodywork session. Encouraging clients to express their needs, preferences, and discomforts during treatment enables the therapist to adjust their technique accordingly and personalize the experience. Open dialogue also builds rapport and trust, establishing a deeper connection between therapist and client. 4. Paying Attention to Knots Knots, or areas of tense, contracted muscle fibers, are common pain points in the body. When discovered during bodywork, it is essential to address these knots with care and precision. Applying slow, sustained pressure can help release tension and alleviate discomfort. As therapists, recognizing and addressing these areas demonstrates a higher level of skill and attunement to the client's needs and concerns. 5. Avoiding the Spine and Bones During a massage or bodywork session, it is crucial to avoid applying direct pressure to the spine and bones. These delicate structures can be easily injured and cause discomfort if handled inappropriately. Instead, focus should be directed towards the surrounding muscles and soft tissues. By avoiding these sensitive areas and exercising care in their approach, practitioners can prevent potential harm and ensure a safe, enjoyable experience for their clients. Conclusion: The core principles outlined in this article emphasize the value of slow, intuitive touch, and effective communication during bodywork sessions. By adhering to these guidelines, therapists can foster a more meaningful connection with their clients, provide tailored treatments, and promote enhanced wellness through the power of touch."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both countries were significant lumber exporters. But I can use this background: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. What is an answer for this question: Which country had a longer growing season?

Minogue's efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not \\"paid her dues\\" and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on Neighbours. Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, \\"If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product.

Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism. Throughout her career, Minogue has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new \\"look\\" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people.

Possible answers: (A). no (B). yes","completion":"The difficulty of obtaining a score of 200 or 400 in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) depends on various factors such as individual preparation, understanding of the concepts, time management during the examination, and the level of competition. I will give you a brief analysis of how difficult it might be to achieve both of these scores in NEET before answering your last question regarding whether these questions have the same meaning. Achieving a score of 200 in NEET: The maximum score a candidate can achieve in NEET is 720 points. The test consists of three sections: Physics (180 points), Chemistry (180 points), and Biology (360 points). To achieve a score of 200, one needs to secure just over 27% of the total possible score. With appropriate preparation and dedication, it is feasible for an average student to score 200 points. However, achieving this score may not guarantee a spot in a medical or dental college, as the cutoffs tend to be much higher depending on the category of the student and the college. Achieving a score of 400 in NEET: To secure a score of 400, one needs to obtain approximately 56% of the total possible marks. This would definitely require more effort, a deeper understanding of the subjects, and better time management during the examination. Candidates who consistently practice and analyze their progress can achieve this target with determination. A score of 400 puts students in a better position to get admitted to government or private medical and dental colleges. Nonetheless, the competition is still high, and candidates pursuing top colleges might need to secure even higher marks. Do these questions have the same meaning? Given the context, the phrasing of these questions do not have the same meaning. The first question pertains to the difficulty level of obtaining a score of 200 in NEET, while the second question is about the challenge of scoring 400 in NEET. The required effort, dedication, and competency are different in both situations, with securing a score of 400 demanding a higher level of preparation. Thus, the correct answer is (A).

Process: - Waves hit the coast - Waves have energy that pushes the water and sediment - The sediment can help erode land like sandpaper - Water washes the sediment back - Some sediment is left as sand. Question: suppose a tsunami occurs and creates huge waves happens, how will it affect more sediment is eroded from the land. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","completion":"A: more When a tsunami with huge waves occurs, its impact on the coastal sediment erosion is significant and generally results in more sediment being eroded from the land. To understand this process, let's take a closer look at the phenomenon and analyze its effects on sediment erosion in more detail. A tsunami is a series of large, powerful waves that are usually caused by major geological disturbances, such as earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic eruptions. These waves can have various heights and travel at high speeds across the ocean, ultimately crashing into the coastlines with great force and energy. As waves hit the coast, they have the energy to move and push the water and any sediment that is present along the shore. The sediment (such as sand, rocks, and other materials) is subjected to the power and strength of the waves, resulting in coastal erosion as the sediment is displaced and moved away from its original location. During a tsunami, the waves are significantly larger and more powerful than typical waves, leading to a greater force with which the waves make contact with the coast. This heightened force and energy push a higher volume of sediment with increased intensity, effectively acting like a giant sandpaper to scrape and erode the land more quickly and extensively. After the waves have crashed into the coast and receded, the process of sediment deposition begins. As the water washes back into the ocean, it takes some of the sediment with it. However, not all the sediment is carried away, and some of it is left behind to accumulate as sand on the shore. In the case of a tsunami, the rapid and powerful movement of water contributes to a larger volume of sediment being displaced from the original location. This often results in more significant erosion and deposition of sediment on the coast, as compared to that caused by regular waves. To sum up, a tsunami and the huge waves associated with it have a considerable effect on the erosion of sediment from the land. The increased power and force of the waves during a tsunami lead to more significant erosion and sediment displacement, causing more sediment to be eroded from the land (Option A)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Giants got a break early as Texans place-kicker Kris Brown missed a 42-yard field goal. The Giants responded with a methodical 68-yard drive. RB Tiki Barber scored his first touchdown of the season on a 16-yard scamper. He finished the game with 115 rushing yards and 155 total yards from scrimmage. Houston fought back in the second quarter with a long drive culminating in a Brown field goal. The Giants put together an excellent drive at the end of the first half, but a holding penalty and two sacks forced them to punt. In the third quarter, Houston continued its fine play, putting together an 18-play scoring drive finished by a David Carr quarterback draw. Carr was outstanding on the day completing 21 of 30 passes for 176 yards. He was not pressured all day, due to injuries to Osi Umenyiora, Justin Tuck, and Michael Strahan (the star defensive ends). Trailing 10-7 in the fourth, the Giants offense finally came alive as QB Eli Manning led an outstanding 66-yard scoring drive utilizing the two-minute offense. Tight end Jeremy Shockey finished the drive on a three yard play-action toss from Manning putting New York ahead 14-10. The defense preserved the lead by forcing a Houston fumble late in the game. The running game then gained two first downs and WR Amani Toomer caught an Eli Manning third down pass to end the game. Jeremy Shockey led the Giants with eight receptions for 66 yards and Manning threw for 179 yards and one touchdown, along with an interception (at the end of the first half).

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the full name of the person who declared amnesty on 11 October? The 1740 Batavia massacre (Dutch: Chinezenmoord, literally \\"Murder of the Chinese\\"; Indonesian: Geger Pacinan, meaning \\"Chinatown Tumult\\") was a pogrom in which Dutch East Indies soldiers and native collaborators killed ethnic Chinese residents of the port city of Batavia (present-day Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies. The violence in the city lasted from 9 October 1740 until 22 October, with minor skirmishes outside the walls continuing late into November that year. Historians have estimated that at least 10,000 ethnic Chinese were massacred; just 600 to 3,000 are believed to have survived. In September 1740, as unrest rose among the Chinese population, spurred by government repression and declining sugar prices, Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier declared that any uprising would be met with deadly force. On 7 October, hundreds of ethnic Chinese, many of them sugar mill workers, killed 50 Dutch soldiers, leading Dutch troops to confiscate all weapons from the Chinese populace and to place the Chinese under a curfew. Two days later, rumours of Chinese atrocities led other Batavian ethnic groups to burn Chinese houses along Besar River and Dutch soldiers to fire cannon at Chinese homes. The violence soon spread throughout Batavia, killing more Chinese. Although Valckenier declared an amnesty on 11 October, gangs of irregulars continued to hunt and kill Chinese until 22 October, when the governor-general called more forcefully for a cessation of hostilities. Outside the city walls, clashes continued between Dutch troops and rioting sugar mill workers. After several weeks of minor skirmishes, Dutch-led troops assaulted Chinese strongholds in sugar mills throughout the area. The following year, attacks on ethnic Chinese throughout Java sparked the two-year Java War that pitted ethnic Chinese and Javanese forces against Dutch troops. Valckenier was later recalled to the Netherlands and charged with crimes related to the massacre. The massacre figures heavily in Dutch literature, and is also cited as a possible...

The Bertin portrait has been hugely influential. At first it served as a model for depictions of energetic and intellectual 19th-century men, and later as a more universal type. Several 1890s works closely echo its form and motifs. Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant's monochrome and severe 1896 Portrait of Alfred Chauchard is heavily indebted, while Léon Bonnat's stern 1892 portrait of the aging Ernest Renan has been described as a \\"direct citation\\" of Ingres' portrait. Its influence can be seen in the dismissive stare and overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in Pablo Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein. Picasso admired Ingres and referred to him throughout his career. His invoking of Bertin can be read as a humorous reference to, according to Robert Rosenblum, \\"Stein's ponderous bulk and sexual preference\\". Stein does not possess Bertin's ironic stare, but is similarly dressed in black, and leans forward in an imposing manner, the painting emphasising her \\"massive, monumental presence\\". In 1907 the Swiss artist Félix Vallotton depicted Stein, in response to Picasso, making an even more direct reference to Ingres' portrait, prompting Édouard Vuillard to exclaim, \\"That's Madame Bertin!\\"The influence continued through the 20th century.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: I'm a blind teenager girl, but I am ashamed of it if it is known. I refuse to use a white stick and hate asking for help, and I couldn't bear people to look at me and think I am not like them. I must be a terrible danger on the roads. Coming across me wandering through the traffic, motorists probably would have to step rapidly on their brakes. Apart from that, there are all sorts of disasters that used to occur on the way to and from work. One evening, I got off the bus about halfway home where I had to change buses, and as usual I ran into something. \\"I'm awfully sorry,\\" I said and stepped forward only to run into it again. When it happened a third time, I realized I had been apologizing to a lamppost. This was just one of the stupid things that constantly happened to me. So I carried on and found the bus stop, which was a request stop, where the bus wouldn't stop unless passengers wanted to get on or off. No one else was there and I had to try to guess if the bus had arrived. Generally in this situation, because I hated showing I was blind by asking for help, I tried to guess at the sound. Sometimes I would stop a big lorry and stand there feeling stupid as it drew away. In the end, I usually managed to swallow my pride and ask someone at the stop for help. But on this particular evening no one joined me at the stop; it seemed that everyone had suddenly decided not to travel by bus. Of course I heard plenty of buses pass, or I thought I did. But because I had given up stopping them for fear of making a fool of myself, I let them all go by. I stood there alone for half an hour without stopping one. Then I gave up. I decided to walk on to the next stop. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Which of the following incidents happened to the blind teenage girl mentioned in the article? A. She accidentally apologized to a lamppost. B. She refused to use a white cane. C. She had difficulty identifying the arrival of her bus. D. She had to walk to the next bus stop after not stopping any bus at her current stop. The correct answer is: A. She accidentally apologized to a lamppost."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Make sure they're cold so they have an easier time getting crushed in the food processor. Pour 1 cup (. 2 liters) of the cold peanuts into a food processor.","completion":"After pouring 1 cup of the cold peanuts into a food processor, you will need to follow these steps to crush them: 1. Put the lid on the food processor: Make sure to close the food processor tightly with its lid, so the peanuts don't fly out when you start crushing them. 2. Turn on the food processor: Press the power button or turn the dial, whichever way your food processor starts. This will make the blades inside spin really fast and chop up the peanuts. You might hear a loud sound as the peanuts are being crushed. 3. Pulse the food processor: Instead of keeping the food processor running, use short bursts called 'pulses'. This will help you control how much you crush the peanuts. If you want bigger chunks, pulse just a few times. If you want smaller pieces, pulse more times. 4. Check the consistency: After a few pulses, carefully open the food processor and take a look at the peanuts. Use a spoon to mix them around a bit, so they get evenly crushed. If they're not crushed enough for you, put the lid back on and pulse some more. 5. Stop when you're happy: Once the peanuts are crushed to the size you want, turn off the food processor. Carefully remove the lid and pour the crushed peanuts into a bowl or container. You can use them to sprinkle on top of ice cream, mix into cookies, or add to a salad for some crunch! Remember to always have an adult help you when using a food processor, as the blades can be very sharp and dangerous for little hands."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It has been nearly one year since Steve's older brother, Allen (Ethan Embry), committed suicide, which traumatized the family. Steve's parents tell him that they have relocated from Chicago to Cradle Bay as a fresh start to move on with their lives. During Steve's first day at his new high school, he meets and befriends three outcast students, Gavin Strick (Nick Stahl), U.V. (Chad E. Donella), and Rachel \\"Rae\\" Wagner (Katie Holmes). Gavin tries to tell Steve that he believes there is something evil about the \\"Blue Ribbons\\"âa clique of students taking part in a \\"special program\\" led by the school psychologist, Dr. Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood).

Soon after, Dickey reappears at school, now one of the Blue Ribbons, and having donated his once-prized car to a demolition fundraiser. Steve goes to a local yogurt shoppe where the Blue Ribbons congregate. Steve comments about seeing Dickey and his recent adversary sitting together, to which Dickey replies \\"We made peace\\".

Write an article based on this \\"Campaigners trying to stop the felling of \\"healthy\\" trees have announced they will not appeal against an injunction banning them from taking direct action.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Campaigners Halt Appeal Against Injunction, Continue Fight to Save Healthy Trees Introduction Environmental campaigners, striving to prevent the felling of healthy trees, have recently announced their decision not to appeal against the injunction that prevents them from engaging in direct action. Despite facing legal obstacles, these activists remain committed to their cause and continue to search for alternative ways to protect the greenery that contributes significantly to the quality of our environment. Background In recent years, concerns have been growing regarding the rapid deforestation and destruction of healthy trees. These trees play a pivotal role in absorbing carbon dioxide and providing clean air, while also enriching ecosystems and wildlife habitats. Numerous organizations and activists have been working tirelessly to raise awareness and implement conservation strategies to maintain the fragile balance of our environment. The Legal Battle Campaigners had been engaging in direct action to protest and prevent the felling of healthy trees in their local communities. However, they were met with opposition in the form of an injunction that essentially prohibited them from taking any direct action to save the trees. In response, activists considered legal channels and originally planned to appeal against the injunction. The Decision to Halt the Appeal After careful consideration, the campaigners announced their decision not to appeal against the injunction. This choice stemmed from a combination of factors, including the potential financial and legal risks involved in pursuing an appeal. It is essential to acknowledge that this withdrawal does not signify an end to their dedication to the cause. On the contrary, it represents a strategic move to minimize potential losses while exploring alternative ways to save the environment. Alternative Strategies to Protect the Trees In the face of legal constraints, the campaigners continue to devise innovative methods and strategies to further their cause and prevent the loss of more healthy trees. Some potential routes include: 1. Increasing Public Awareness: A well-informed public can be a powerful tool in the fight for environmental conservation. Campaigners can focus on educating people about the importance of healthy trees, encouraging them to take action and support the cause. 2. Collaborating with Local Governments: Working with local governments and elected representatives can help achieve shared goals. Encouraging the implementation of stricter regulations and guidelines against unnecessary tree-felling can be an effective way to protect trees in the community. 3. Supporting Sustainable Forestry Practices: By promoting and supporting sustainable forestry policies, campaigners can help ensure that a balance is maintained between the need for timber and the health of the environment. Conclusion Though the recent decision not to appeal against the injunction may seem like a setback for the campaigners fighting to save healthy trees, the truth is far from it. The environmental activists continue to explore alternative measures and strategies to influence policy, mobilize public support, and preserve the precious natural resources that we all rely on. It is through dedication, resilience, and adaptability that we can overcome current challenges and preserve the environment for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Fratellis capture Chunk and interrogate him, learning nothing until a pack of bats burst out of the cavern beneath the restaurant.

Whether your cat eats canned food, dry food, raw food, or a combination of these, its diet should be high in proteins and fats. Your cat should also always have plenty of clean, fresh water to drink. Talk to your veterinarian for specific advice about selecting the right foods for your particular cat. Commercial cat foods can vary in quality. To ensure that your cat’s coat stays healthy-looking, check the food’s nutritional content (listed on the label) and make sure it matches your cat’s current needs. To ensure quality, you can look for a cat food with a label showing that it has been certified by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). Raw meat diets are recommended by some experts as a way of making it easy for a cat to get the nutrients it needs. Your cat’s dietary needs will vary throughout its lifetime; foods that are designed for kittens are not suitable for older cats, and vice versa. The nutrition your cat needs also depends on its individual factors, like health and activity level. If your cat is not receiving the right kind of food for its age and activity level, its coat may look coarse and dull. If you are feeding and grooming your cat according to its needs, and its coat still seems dull, brittle, or coarse, talk to your veterinarian about the problem.

The steps are as follows: 1. Interpret the question: We need to find out which choice provides the correct number of dandelions required to make a jar of honey. 2. Evaluate the choices: We need to decide between 200-300 dandelion heads (choice (i)) and 2-3 dandelion heads (choice (ii)). 3. Draw a conclusion based on common knowledge and context: Dandelions are relatively small, and the honey-making process would require a larger quantity of them to produce a substantial amount of honey, i.e., enough for a jar. Given these steps and the logical conclusion: The better solution should therefore be (i). You need about 200 large dandelion heads, or 300 small dandelion heads. This choice seems more plausible considering the size of dandelions relative to a jar of honey, and the amount of plant material that would typically be needed for such a process.

Movie title: Coast to Coast Movie plot: Madie Levrington (Dyan Cannon), a wealthy neurotic woman is committed to a New York mental institution by her unethical husband, Benjamin, in order to keep her from divorcing him and taking his money. She manages to escape by taking hostage her doctor (Michael Lerner) and leaving him behind in an open field, and flees into the night. As it begins to rain, Madie hitches a ride on a livestock truck.The truck is driven by Charles Callahan (Robert Blake), a moody cowboy who is reluctant to help her out. However, he hears over his CB radio about her escape and a substantial reward for her return. This gets his attention as he is so in debt that he has a repo man after him to repossess his truck. Upon arrivng at his home, Callahan is met by the repo man as well as his estranged wife which forces him to flee with Madie tagging along. She insists that he drive her back to California so she can confront her husband for abandoning her.The neurotic and unpredictiable Madie soon proves a handful to Callahan as she cannot stop talking about her unhappy life and gets him into trouble at times. The next day at a local road stop diner, she orders a large meal despite that she and Callahan have no money to pay for it and she is forced to wash dishes to make up for the tab. Next, Madie gets some money by hiring Callahan to transport a herd of cattle to Oklahoma without his permission.Behind her back, Callahan meets up with people who are out to get Madie, and gets part of the reward money from the woman bounty hunter Sam Klinger (Maxine Stuart) who leads them. At the same time, he is also slowly falling in love with her. He even teaches her to drive the truck (frantically, after he was hit in the crotch and sent flying by a bull).After camping out in an open field somewhere in Texas, Madie eventually finds the money he was given and she wonders how he got it. He then reluctantly explains how, trying to explain that he took it unwillingly. She doesn't believe him and ends up getting in the truck and driving off without... Answer:","completion":"Yes, in the movie \\"Coast to Coast,\\" Madie Levrington and Charles Callahan do finally find the truck.

Gina found a great jacket at the thrift shop. Gina began shopping at the thrift shop for all her clothes. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Gina wanted an old jacket.\\"?","completion":"Based on the paragraph provided, it is not directly indicated or can be conclusively stated that \\"Gina wanted an old jacket.\\" The paragraph details an instance where Gina needed a new jacket, and due to her financial constraints, she decided to seek out a jacket at a thrift shop. The decision to shop at a thrift store can be attributed to several reasons. Thrift stores typically sell second-hand or pre-owned items, often at lower prices than new items in conventional stores. Gina's decision to shop at a thrift store was informed by her lack of funds, signifying that it was a budgetary consideration rather than a preference for old clothes. Her friend's suggestion to look at the thrift store was probably because it's an affordable option compared to regular retail shops. Thrift shops often have a vast array of clothing, including jackets, often donated or sold by people who no longer need or want them. The items in thrift stores aren't necessarily old; they can range from nearly new to vintage. The jacket Gina found could be a relatively new jacket sold or donated by someone who no longer had a use for it. The notion of old or new is subjective when it comes to thrift shopping, as it usually depends on the condition or age of the item. Given this, the claim that Gina wanted an \\"old\\" jacket is at best speculative and not supported by the information presented in the paragraph. All we can infer decisively from the paragraph is that Gina needed a more affordable way to obtain a jacket and that the thrift shop was a viable solution for her. After her successful experience finding a jacket, Gina started shopping at the thrift shop for all her clothes. It could be inferred that she found value and satisfaction from her thrift shopping experience, prompting her to continue shopping there for all her clothes. This decision, too, could be more of an economical choice than a preference for old or used clothes. She realized that thrift shopping can yield savings and offer a variety of clothing options well within her budget. In conclusion, the statements in the paragraph have not conveyed any specific preferences Gina might have for old clothes. Her shopping habits are rather aligned towards spending less and finding unexpected value.

Premise: The premise describes a father who can show his feelings but is unable to express them verbally or through physical means. This lack of expression is observed in comparison with other fathers who engage in physical affection with their children. Hypothesis: The hypothesis focuses on the father's inability to express displeasure, suggesting that he cannot even express negative emotions. Analysis: On examining both the premise and the hypothesis, it is clear that they both deal with the father's inability to express certain emotions or feelings. The premise specifically states that this inability makes the situation \\"kind of sad\\" as it may prevent him from forming close and genuine connections with his children. However, it is essential to examine the link between the father's inability to express affection and the assumption that he also cannot express displeasure. While the premise provides a basis for understanding that the father has difficulties with expressing his emotions, it is not clear whether this extends to all aspects of his emotional repertoire, including expressing negative emotions such as displeasure. Conclusion: Based purely on the premise provided, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is also true. The premise discusses the father's inability to express affection, but it does not provide evidence supporting or refuting the idea that he cannot express displeasure. To make a clear connection between the premise and the hypothesis, additional information about the father's emotional capabilities is required. If, for example, the premise mentioned that the father struggles with expressing all emotions, including displeasure, then we could conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise. In summary, although the premise and the hypothesis are connected in terms of the father's emotional expression difficulties, it is not possible to conclusively accept the hypothesis based solely on the premise provided.

(Associated Press) FILE - In this Jan. 16, 1998 file picture the 5,000-year-old body of Iceman Oetzi, discovered in 1991 on the Similaun glacier is inspected by scientists in Innsbruck, Scientists say Oetzi wore clothes... (Associated Press) BERLIN (AP) — Scientists say Oetzi the Iceman wore clothes made of brown bear pelt and roe deer when he died in the Alps 5,300 years ago. Researchers in Italy used genetic analysis to determine that the two materials were used for Oetzi's fur hat and his leather quiver respectively. Niall O'Sullivan, a researcher at the European Academy of Bolzano, Italy, said the study published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports also showed that other pieces of Oetzi's clothing came from domesticated animals. The mix of materials suggests the Iceman was adept at using material from domesticated sheep, cattle and goat as well as wild animals to fashion clothes. Oetzi's mummified body has been studied extensively since it was discovered on a glacier near the Italian-Austrian border in 1991. ||||| An outfit can tell a lot about somebody – particularly if that person died 5,300 years ago. Ötzi the Iceman, a natural mummy discovered frozen in the Ötztal Alps in Italy, has offered scientists a broad variety of clues into the lives of Copper Age Europeans since its discovery a quarter century ago. And now researchers know what leathers and furs the mysterious man wore. But the investigation wasn't just to see if the famous mummy was fashion-forward. Knowing which animal skins Ötzi wore is another way to fill in the blanks in pre-historians' picture of Copper Age Europe. \\"Most of the clothes were composed of cattle, sheep, and goat,\\" says study lead author Niall J. O’Sullivan, a PhD candidate at University College Dublin and the EURAC-Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Italy. \\"This affirms previous observations about the Iceman,\\" he tells The Christian Science Monitor, \\"that he was indeed an agro-pastoralist.\\" But not all of Ötzi's clothes were from domesticated animals. He also used brown bear furs and roe deer hide. \\"The choices that Copper Age people made with respect to animals exploitation were likely dependent on availability, necessity, functionality and symbolism,\\" the researchers write in a paper published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. The mix of domestic and wild animals used illustrate that diversity of utility and dynamics in Ötzi's society. Although farming would have been the dominant way of life, the Iceman and his peers also hunted for food and supplies. This \\"gives insight into their daily life,\\" writes Johannes A. Lenstra, editor-in-chief of Animal Genetics and a professor at Utrecht University, who was not part of the study, in an email to the Monitor. \\"They had to cope!\\" Scientists have poked and prodded Ötzi since he was discovered by two hikers in 1991. They know what his last meal was, how he was murdered, and who his living relatives are. But previous analysis of his clothing was limited because the tanning process, preservation, and subsequent scientific analyses had made the source animals for the leathers and furs difficult to identify. So Mr. O'Sullivan and his colleagues turned to DNA to identify the species covering Ötzi's body. Ötzi wore a full outfit when he died, likely to keep him warm in the chilly mountains. A furry hat sat atop his head, straw-stuffed shoes were on his feet, and he wore leggings, a loincloth, and a coat. The team found that the Iceman's shoes were laced up with strings made of cattle leather, while his loincloth and much of his coat were made of sheep leather. But his overcoat was a bit of a patchwork. The genetic analysis revealed that this article of clothing was made of both goat and sheep leather. The combination suggests that the Iceman pieced together whatever hides he had available, which would have been necessary as the ancient leather likely deteriorated quickly, the researchers write in the new paper. Ötzi's leggings, however, seem to be a more deliberate choice. Made of the more supple goat leather, they would have been relatively flexible for walking. Or perhaps goat leather was chosen for its \\"insulating potential,\\" the researchers write. A set of 4,500-year-old leggings found in the Swiss Alps were also made of goatskin, so perhaps this was a common use for that material. The Iceman's hat was made from the skin of a brown bear, which Dr. Lenstra suggests could have had symbolic meaning as well as keeping Ötzi's head warm. \\"It is imaginable that with a hat of a skin of an intimidating animal you become more intimidating yourself,\\" he suggests. And perhaps the quiver Ötzi carried his arrows in also had important symbolic meaning, Lenstra says. The quiver was made from the hide of roe deer, an animal known to be swift. \\"If survival depended on hunting with arrows and individual status on your success as marksman, the belief may have been crept in that a quiver made of a fast-running species increases your chance of hitting well the next time,\\" Lenstra says. The use of roe deer skin has more concrete implications too. Researchers had found that Ötzi's diet included venison, from a different species: red deer. They had previously assumed the deer leather was that species too, so finding that the quiver was made from a roe deer suggests a more diverse use of wild species. The leathers Ötzi wore were not from extinct wild animals, but \\"animals which are all typically observed in alpine Europe today,\\" O'Sullivan says. Furthermore, \\"the domestic species, the cattle, sheep, and goat, had the same haplogroups of the modern haplogroups of cattle, sheep, and goats which are observed in Europe today.\\" In other words, these leathers came from well-established populations of domestic animals, not just wild relatives of today's domestic animals, he says.

So what will archaeologists thousands of years from now think of life in 2016, based on our fashion sense? ||||| Here we present a comprehensive targeted enrichment and species identification of 5,300-year-old leather from the Iceman’s clothes and quiver (Table 1). Of the nine samples taken, all produced libraries with sufficient data to identify the source species of the material. These were cattle, sheep, goat, brown bear and roe deer. Six libraries had sufficient coverage to fully reconstruct the mitogenome and confidently identify mtDNA haplotypes and reconstruct phylogeny (Fig. 1). Three libraries were of reduced coverage, thereby only partially reconstructing the mitogenomes and allowing for an approximated phylogeny (Fig. 2). Nonetheless, the identified cattle, sheep and goats sequences all fall within the range of mitochondrial genetic variability observed today in modern European domestic populations36,37,38. The mitogenomic genetic variability recovered shows that the sheep and goat leather fragments came from multiple hides. The genetic haplotypes of the wild species both roe deer and brown bear are consistent with present day phylogeography in the Alpine region39,40. The Mitochondrial capture analysis allowed for an effective increase in coverage (between a four and 620-fold increase in coverage) and highlighted the effectiveness of NGS assisted with mitochondrial targeted enrichment to retrieve residual endogenous DNA from suboptimal sources such as skin or tanned leather10,41. Furthermore, our shotgun analysis is the first NGS quantification of the residual endogenous DNA present in archaeological leather. These data show that the endogenous content was highly variable and considerably lower than that of tissue sampled from the Iceman for genomic reconstruction3. This result lends support to the theory that tanning, the restoration processes, or both can remove endogenous markers10,11 and furthermore that the tanning may have exposed the material to a greater degree of bacterial and chemical degradation7. Equally, these results could support the hypothesis that soft tissue has a generally weaker retention of endogenous DNA compared to calcified remains41. Interestingly, enriched libraries displayed neither co-enrichment from other mammalian species or cross contamination from other animals in the mapped data (Supplementary Figs 2–10, Table 1). Hence, there is little genetic evidence from these samples to suggest that leathers and furs were treated with fat and oil extracted from other animals during the ancient tanning process11. Previous studies have however observed residual plant-based oils and fats in ancient leather indicating their use in leather manufacturing. Such as the identification of plant lipids in Neolithic leathers from the contemporaneous Schnidejoch Pass site in Switzerland7. The Iceman’s garments and quiver are from an assemblage of at least five different species of animal. The coat alone was a combination of at least four hides and two species: goat and sheep. This result may indicate a haphazard stitching together of clothing based upon materials that were available to the Iceman, as ancient rudimentary leather is posited to rapidly deteriorate after manufacture6,12. However, the leggings were composed of goat leather, which was also used in the manufacture of a 4,500-year-old leggings from Schnidejoch, Switzerland. This result lends support to the idea that Copper Age individuals in the Alpine region selected species for specific attributes when manufacturing clothing8. This may also indicate a functional choice of material based on flexibility or insulating potential. Previous microscopic and proteomic analyses of the Iceman’s clothes could not resolve beyond genus taxonomy or surpass the technical challenges caused by absence of species specific markers4,5. Hollemeyer et al.5 noted that many domestic and wild species germane to the study were too closely related to distinguish PMFs (Peptide mass fingerprints) or that adequate reference databases did not exist. There are inconsistencies between the species identification of our study and Hollemeyer et al.5, contrary to our results they observed chamois and red deer PMFs in parts of the coat, Canid PMFs in the leggings, and cattle PMFs in the quiver. Different sampling locations on the same clothing may explain this disparity, as highlighted by our results from the coat analysis above. The haplogroups identified in these samples from sheep, goat and cattle all fall within the domestic variability of the source animal in modern Europe, novel SNPs have been recovered that may have been lost from contemporary domestic haplogroups (Supplementary Table 3). In this study, the goat mitogenomes were identified as haplogroup A, yet a goat B1 haplogroup was observed in a study of 4,500-year-old swiss leggings8. The ancient distribution of domestic goat haplogroups are unknown, yet B1’s modern European distribution is restricted to Greece and Turkey8,42. Goat haplogroup B1 is more widespread in western Asia, but is closely related to haplogroup A. The Iceman and his leggings predate the Swiss find by c. 800 years, suggesting an overlap in the distribution of goat haplogroups that is no longer present in Europe. The sheep leather and fur were identified within haplogroup B1 from the three coat fragments and the loincloth. One sheep (coat 10304) mitogenome has the same distinct mutations at loci 16147 and 16440 reported by Olivieri et al.13 in a PCR analysis of fibres from a later excavation the Iceman’s find site. However, other mutations reported by Olivieri et al.13 were not present indicating that they identified sequences from yet another sheep used in the garment assemblage and recovered from the find site. The shoelace mitogenome closely resembled the cattle reference sequence of haplogroup T3, which is the predominant mitochondrial haplotype in European domestic cattle and is observed in high frequency throughout the Neolithic of Europe43. The quiver was identified as roe deer, clustering near the contemporary central European clade. This is the first time this species has been identified as being part of the Iceman’s leather attire. Notably, red deer (Cervus elaphus) was identified from PCR of hair shafts at the finding site14 and contents of the Iceman’s stomach44, and from PMFs of the quiver5. The evidence that the Iceman utilised at least two deer species shows the variety of wild materials from which he subsisted. The hat sequence clusters inside the Western lineage of brown bears, suggesting regional continuity of this genetic marker. Previous studies of brown bears report complex phylogeography across its range, typified by overlapping ranges of divergent clades of brown bear and introgression with polar bears (Ursus maritimus) due to convoluted gene flow caused by Pleistocene climatic changes40,45. The assignment of the hat to brown bear is important given that previous studies could not resolve its taxonomy beyond Carnivora5, and secondly that it is unambiguously a wild species that was used for clothing manufacture. Despite the Iceman being established as an agro-pastoralist2,3, the hat and quiver provide evidence of hunting and trapping of wild animals. Other studies have proposed parts of the diet, clothing and equipment as belonging to wild species such as wild canid (for the hat, species previously unresolved), red deer and chamois5,14. Rollo et al.44 demonstrated that the Iceman consumed red deer and alpine ibex (Capra ibex). The choices that Copper Age people made with respect to animals exploitation were likely dependent on availability, necessity, functionality and symbolism46. Given the diversity of the analysed material (each analysed fragment comes from a different animal), the lack of any obvious symbolism and the rapid degradation rate of ancient leather11 it would appear that the Iceman’s leathers and furs were first chosen haphazardly for subsistence as rudimentary leather pieces rapidly disintegrated and required replacement with strips of new hide. There is however likely to be a regional variation in the selection of wild and domestic populations throughout the Copper Age and the Iceman provides a window into the alpine region which may have been unlike other locations46. These results are based on uni-parental maternal genetic markers, hence the authors cannot exclude the possibility that the analysed domestic species were sourced from herds that were re-stocked with wild males as occurred between cattle and aurochsen populations as is postulated in ancient Britain31. Whole genome sequencing of the Iceman’s attire in the future may increase our knowledge to the degree of introgression with local populations or breeding selection for functional genes. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Scientists have discovered that Ötzi the Iceman, who lived 5,300 years ago, wore clothes made from brown bear pelt and roe deer when he died. The mummified body, which was discovered in the Alps in 1991, has provided researchers with insight into the lives of Copper Age Europeans. Most of the clothes were composed of cattle, sheep and goats, reinforcing the beliefs that the man wearing them was a farmer, or agro-pastoralist."},{"prompt":"Options: [i] make car run better; [ii] go to the mechanic; [iii] sabotage car; Cameron greased the wheels so the car would run smoothly.

Article:The book, set 20 years after the events of Mockingbird, is guaranteed to be a summer bestseller. The discovery of the novel was announced in February and hailed as the literary sensation of the decade. One of the revelations in the new book is that the much-loved character of Atticus Finch is painted a racist \\"bigot\\". Here is a round-up of reviews from the past few days. \\"Go Set a Watchman\\" is a distressing book, one that delivers a startling rebuttal to the shining idealism of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" This story is of the toppling of idols; its major theme is disillusion. Teachers of American literature have been handed a fascinating potential course comparing and contrasting the pair, while there is clearly opportunity for a new movie of To Kill a Mockingbird combining the two genres most beloved by modern Hollywood - remake and sequel - within a structure of interlocking flashbacks that are the most fashionable form of movie narrative. Until then, Go Set a Watchman shakes the settled view of both an author and her novel. And, unless another surprise for readers lies somewhere in her files, this publication intensifies the regret that Harper Lee published so little. Because the action takes place 20 years later than the story of To Kill a Mockingbird, it feels like a sequel. But really, it's more like a ghost: The spectre of Lee's restless, ardent thoughts in progress. The main source of shock will be the transformation of Atticus, now 72, into a racist. This is not an easy book. It is a story about coming of age, brutally, into a changing world. It is a story about putting aside childish beliefs and certainties. It is a story of acceptance â€” self-acceptance most of all. But reading it, we can begin to see how far we have already come towards Scout's dream of equality and how far we still have to go. Even with its weaknesses, Go Set a Watchman's voice is, at its best, beguiling and distinctive, and reminiscent of Mockingbird, and its similarity in style might finally end the speculation that Lee's childhood friend, Truman Capote, \\"helped\\" to write Mockingbird... Whatever its failings, Go Set a Watchman can't be dismissed as literary scraps from Lee's imagination. It has too much integrity for that. Go Set a Watchman is also a song of experience. It's unmerciful to both Atticus and to Jean Louise, whose childish fractiousness has calcified into a rigid judgmentalism closer to her much-loathed Aunt Alexandra than she'd like to admit. She's a work in progress. And it's this evolution, her realization that the loss of innocence is as much something to be grieved and overcome as the loss of a brother, that lies at the heart of Go Set a Watchman. One of the emotional through-lines in both Mockingbird and Watchman is a plea for empathy - as Atticus puts it in Mockingbird to Scout: \\"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view.\\" The difference is that Mockingbird suggested that we should have compassion for outsiders like Boo and Tom Robinson, while Watchman asks us to have understanding for a bigot named Atticus. A deep disappointment runs through the heart of the novel as the Finch family struggles with personal conflicts brought on by the social upheaval of the 1950s South. If Atticus is not willing to accept desegregation, Jean Louise also is resistant to change and anxious about it, even as she knows it must occur. A significant aspect of this novel is that it asks us to see Atticus now not merely as a hero, a god, but as a flesh-and-blood man with shortcomings and moral failing, enabling us to see ourselves for all our complexities and contradictions. Whether feelings of disillusionment with Atticus or Watchman's technical flaws will tarnish the prowess of Mockingbird, only time will tell. Separating the two novels intellectually is easily done; but to invest in this emotionally is a harder task. While Mockingbird undoubtedly remains the literary superstar, as Atticus remains its hero, Watchman presents a more nuanced study of racial prejudice. In light of recent tensions in America - despite the passing of what we often assume is 60-odd years of progress - this is perhaps a more timely and important portrait than we would like to admit. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"1.

When questioning other local prostitutes, Hebert meets Sherry, and discovers from her that the man whom Shirley had left with the night she died wore an unusual gold ring. Meanwhile, John continues to stalk local strip clubs and bars for further female victims, performing the same evisceration and sacrificial murders on them. Hebert eventually comes upon a delivery man who helps lead police to the apartment belonging to John, where he has three women held hostage for a ritual sacrifice planned for the Mardi Gras celebration.

Summarize the following: Multiply the total width of the accent wall by the height of your ceiling. This tells you the square footage of the accent wall. Typically, 1 gallon (3.8 L) of paint covers around 350 to 400 square feet. Divide your total square footage by 350 or 400 to figure out how many gallons of paint you’ll need to cover the wall. A single gallon is enough for most walls, but keep in mind you’ll probably need to do 2 coats. If there are windows on the accent wall, subtract 15 square feet from your total square footage. Then divide that number by 350 or 400. If there's a door, subtract 21 square feet before dividing by 350 or 400. Take off the outlet covers, fixtures, switch plates, and window coverings before you get started. Use painter’s tape to mask off the window sills, door hinges, baseboards, etc. Protect the floor with a tarp and cover any furniture in the room. Crack a window or get a fan so that the room stays ventilated. Since the color of the accent wall will contrast quite a bit with the ceiling and other adjoining walls, it’s important to get a straight, clean line where the accent wall meets them. Crooked or smudged lines will be very noticeable. Apply the tape slowly and be precise for best results. Dirt and debris will prevent the paint from adhering well to the wall, so always clean interior walls before you paint them. Create a mild cleaning solution with warm water and a few drops of dish detergent. Wipe the wall down with a sponge or cloth, working from floor to ceiling and in small sections. Let the wall dry completely before moving on. Primer isn’t required, but it’s recommended. It will help the paint adhere to the wall, allow for better coverage, and help the paint wear better over time. Buy an indoor paint primer and apply one coat to the accent wall with a roller or paintbrush. Let it dry completely before you start painting. Use a latex-based interior paint for this job. Start applying paint in one of the top corners, working from the ceiling to the floor in small sections. Use an angled brush to get into the corners, then switch to a roller to cover the main wall space faster. Use the angled brush anywhere you need to do detail work. Wait for the first coat to dry, then apply a second coat the exact same way. Let the last coat of paint dry completely before removing the painter’s tape and replacing fixtures.

In New York City, the neighborhoods of Borough Park, Midwood, Williamsburg, and Crown Heights, located in the borough of Brooklyn, have particularly large Orthodox communities. The most rapidly growing community of American Orthodox Jews is located in Rockland County and the Hudson Valley of New York, including the communities of Monsey, Monroe, New Square, and Kiryas Joel. There are also sizable and rapidly growing Orthodox communities throughout New Jersey, particularly in Lakewood, Teaneck, Englewood, Passaic, and Fair Lawn. Question: Where is a sizeable and rapidly growing Orthodox community currently located besides New York State?","completion":"Besides New York State, a sizable and rapidly growing Orthodox Jewish community is currently located in New Jersey. In particular, towns such as Lakewood, Teaneck, Englewood, Passaic, and Fair Lawn have experienced significant growth in their Orthodox populations over the years. Each of these communities offers unique characteristics and amenities that appeal to Orthodox residents, contributing to their ongoing growth and development. Lakewood is perhaps the most prominent example of a thriving Orthodox community in New Jersey, with a population that has skyrocketed in recent years. The town's growth has been driven in large part by the presence of Beth Medrash Govoha (BMG), one of the largest and most influential yeshivas (Jewish educational institutions) in the world. The yeshiva's reputation draws thousands of students and their families to the area, leading to a booming local economy and the expansion of Orthodox infrastructure, including synagogues, schools, and kosher establishments. Lakewood's Orthodox community is highly diverse, with residents hailing from various backgrounds and traditions within Orthodox Judaism.

Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying. Now, I have a new situation: Environmental scientists are trying to find a solution to reducing the harmful effects of chemicals on the environment. To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B. They need to figure out which case is safer for the environment. Answer this question please: In which case the Bt toxin is in an active state, case A or case B?

News article: How Germany First Marked Jan. 27 On the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz on Jan. 27, 1995, many in Germany used the occasion to remember the horrors of the Holocaust. But the day itself had no official name or sanction. That changed the following year—exactly 20 years ago Wednesday—when Germany became the first European country to declare the date as an official day of remembrance for the victims of Naziism. In her book History, Memory, and Trans-European Identity, Aline Sierp suggests that the timing of Germany’s decision to make the day official was linked to its recent reunification. With the Cold War still fresh, the newly joined East and West aimed to show the world that it was a modern nation willing to reckon with its dark history under both Naziism and Communism. Sierp notes that it’s unusual for a nation to establish an official day of remembrance for a negative part of its history, but then-President Roman Herzog said, in proclaiming the observance, that the day “must continue to remind future generations to be vigilante” and to “find a form of memory that reaches towards the future.” Not everyone was satisfied that the day of remembrance did enough to honor the victims—as Reuters reported at the time, some German Jews were upset that Parliament observed the day during a session on Jan. 19 rather than convening specially on Jan. 27. But Germany’s move to commemorate the day did help inspire others to do the same. About a decade after Germany’s first Tag des Gedekens an die Opfer des Nationalsozialismus, the United Nations designated that same day as an International Day of Commemoration to remember the victims of the Holocaust. The event was first marked at U.N. headquarters in 2006. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: Civilities: What’s so upsetting about a gay couple kissing in public? Imagine you and your sweetie in a bar, enjoying a beer or two, listening to music. You put your arms around each other, you hug; maybe you give each other a quick kiss. No big deal, right? Unfortunately, when it comes to same-sex couples, that’s too often not the case, because even a simple kiss may be viewed as provocative or flaunting. When did a kiss stop being a kiss? Case in point: Dustin Baker and Andrew Deras got themselves into a peck o’ trouble recently at Louie’s Sports Bar & Tiki Bar in Fayetteville, N.C., where they had gone to hear a band. About 11 p.m. on a late summer night, Deras put his arm around his boyfriend and gave him a “very minor” kiss, as he told WRAL-TV, that led to a nationwide news story. Baker continued their narrative in a lengthy post on Yelp: “Out of no where this woman [who it turned out was the bar owner] comes up to us in a combatively demanding manor & tells Andrew he needs to back up off of me this very second. ‘Do what you’d like on your own time, but not here. This is NOT right!’ ” Steven Petrow, the author of “Steven Petrow’s Complete Gay & Lesbian Manners,” addresses questions about LGBT and straight etiquette in his column, Civilities. From there, let’s just say it went downhill, although the precise chronology is hazy. From published reports, Baker and Deras kissed again, claiming their right to do so. Bar owner Pam Griffin reportedly told them to leave because “you’re making people feel uncomfortable,” adding, “This is a straight bar.” The guys paid their tab and left. End of story? Not quite. (Civilities reached out to the couple and the bar owner, but interview requests were not immediately returned.) The case of the kissing gays might seem like an anomaly or much ado about not very much. But I’m reminded of what Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. — the renowned physician, poet and father of the Supreme Court justice — once said: “The sound of a kiss is not so loud as that of a cannon, but its echo lasts a great deal longer.” Although same-sex marriage is legal in all 50 states, 28 of them, including the Tar Heel state, “lack a public accommodations statute inclusive of sexual orientation and gender identity,” said Christopher Brook, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina. In other words, the bar owner was within her legal right to ask the gay couple to leave for their alleged public-display-of-affection infraction. Apparently, public displays of LGBT affection strike a straight nerve. Just last month, a same-sex couple were asked to leave a Texas public pool when a lifeguard told them kissing was not permitted, although straight swimmers apparently kiss without fear of being thrown out. A few years ago, “L-Word” actress Leisha Hailey was ejected from a Southwest flight after kissing her girlfriend. She tweeted: “Flt. attendant said that it was a ‘family’ airline and kissing was not ok.” Southwest responded that the incident was “based solely on behavior and not gender.” If only. “I think everything gay people do is politicized,” said Shannon Gilreath, a professor of law at Wake Forest University. “Every normal, tender moment is politicized as a provocation — a confrontation. To religious conservatives . . . there’s no such thing as a ‘small’ display of homosexuality. It’s always a big deal to them.” To this point, a study published in the American Sociological Review reported that although a solid majority of Americans support insurance coverage and inheritance rights for same-sex couples, we are far less comfortable with same-sex public displays of affection. Among heterosexuals, only 55 percent approve of gay men kissing on the cheek in public, compared with a whopping 95 percent who say that it’s okay for straight couples. Even among gay and lesbian couples there is some discomfort with the idea of same-sex kissing in public, whether it’s because of fear of violence or internalized homophobia. So what’s going on here? “There’s a huge double standard that goes well beyond public displays of affection,” Gilreath says. “The reality is that straight people talk about and display their sexual orientation so frequently that they don’t even realize they are doing it.” You might not realize it, but in-your-face displays of heterosexuality are everywhere — the family photo on a desk, the man and woman holding hands on the beach, or an opposite-sex couple kissing in a bar. No one accuses these couples of “flaunting” their sexuality, but make it two men or two women in the photo holding hands or smooching, then we’ve crossed the line. That’s the double standard. Some might argue that context — or where you are — matters. Agreed. But Louie’s is a bar. Not a church. Not a family restaurant. A bar — where people watch TV, drink, listen to music, drink, hook up and drink some more. Talking about context, one local posted on the bar’s Yelp page: “I’ve seen straight couples damn near having sex in here.” To that I say “ick” — just as I would if it were a gay couple. It may be that the furor surrounding kissing means we need to raise the bar, so to speak, on public displays of affection. Could the kiss be the next big milestone in LGBT rights?

Hold your breath.","completion":"No, the word \\"hold\\" does not have the same meaning in the two sentences provided. The word \\"hold\\" has several meanings, and its interpretation depends on the context in which it is used. In these two sentences, \\"hold\\" is used metaphorically in the first case, and literally in the second case. Let me explain each meaning in more detail: 1. In the sentence \\"She can hold an audience spellbound,\\" the word \\"hold\\" is used metaphorically. In this context, \\"hold\\" refers to the ability to capture or maintain someone's attention or interest. The subject, she, is so good at engaging the audience that they remain captivated and unable to break away from her words or performance. This use of \\"hold\\" implies a sense of influence or power, as if the speaker is keeping the audience frozen in place and unable to look away. 2. In the sentence \\"Hold your breath,\\" the word \\"hold\\" is used literally. Here, \\"hold\\" means to physically retain or prevent something (in this case, air) from being released. When you hold your breath, you stop breathing by preventing the air from leaving your lungs through your nose or mouth. This act is often done in anticipation of something unpleasant, such as a strong smell, or as a momentary coping mechanism during a stressful situation. In summary, the word \\"hold\\" has different meanings in the two sentences provided. The first sentence uses \\"hold\\" metaphorically to convey the idea of capturing someone's interest or attention, while the second sentence uses \\"hold\\" literally to describe the physical act of retaining one's breath. Knowing the context in which \\"hold\\" is used and understanding the nuance behind its meaning can help clarify the intended message in various sentences."},{"prompt":"Facts: - sport: track and field - event: shot put , discus throw - weight: 110 kg lb 0 on - pb: 21.21 m - height: 1.89 - medaltemplates: world student games 2003 - birth date: 24 march 1981 - name: pavel lyzhyn - nationality: belarusian - birth place: russia Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of pavel lyzhyn .

Use this fact to answer the question: natural gas is a source of heat by burning Burning natural gas can Options: (A). keep you cozy on a frigid night (B). conserve valuable planetary resources (C). aid in cooling down the planet (D). keep a car running in the cold The answer is:","completion":"(A). keep you cozy on a frigid night Burning natural gas, which primarily consists of methane, is a common source of heat for various applications, including residential and commercial heating. This fact is due to the chemical reactions that occur when natural gas is burnt in the presence of oxygen. The combustion process leads to the release of energy in the form of heat and light, making it a valuable resource for generating warmth. On a frigid night, when temperatures drop significantly, the need for a reliable and efficient source of heat becomes crucial. Natural gas can provide that warmth through various systems, like gas furnaces, boilers, space heaters, and fireplaces, to make indoor spaces comfortably warm. Option (A) is correct because burning natural gas efficiently generates heat to create cozy, warm environments on cold nights. However, it is important to note that the other options may not necessarily align with the given fact: (B) Conserve valuable planetary resources: While natural gas is often considered a cleaner alternative compared to coal and oil, it is still a non-renewable fossil fuel. The extraction, production, and distribution processes of natural gas have environmental impacts, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and resource depletion. Therefore, relying on natural gas alone is not enough to conserve valuable planetary resources; sustainable practices and renewable energy sources are necessary as well. (C) Aid in cooling down the planet: Although burning natural gas results in fewer greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to coal and oil, it still contributes to global warming and cannot be considered a cooling solution by itself. As a fossil fuel, it also produces carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases during combustion, which contribute to the greenhouse effect and, ultimately, to climate change. To curb these issues, it is ideal to focus on the development and adoption of cleaner and renewable energy sources. (D) Keep a car running in the cold: While some vehicles, such as buses and trucks, can utilize natural gas as a fuel for their engines, it is not a common fuel choice for personal passenger cars. For most vehicles, gasoline or diesel engines provide the power regardless of the cold. However, certain components (e.g., the battery, oil, and coolant) may be affected by colder temperatures, resulting in reduced performance or difficulty starting if not appropriately maintained."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The three main principles of Jainism are \\"ahimsa\\" ('non-violence'), \\"anekantavada\\" ('non-absolutism'), and \\"aparigraha\\" ('non-attachment'); it is also characterized by \\"asceticism\\". Followers of Jainism take five main vows: \\"ahimsa\\" ('non-violence'), \\"satya\\" ('truth'), \\"asteya\\" ('not stealing'), \\"brahmacharya\\" ('celibacy', 'chastity'), and \\"aparigraha\\" ('non-attachment'). These principles have impacted Jain culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle that avoids harm to animals and their life cycles. \\"Parasparopagraho Jivanam\\" ('the function of souls is to help one another') is the motto of Jainism. Namokar Mantra is the most common and basic prayer in Jainism. Followers of Jainism are called \\"Jains\\", a word derived from the Sanskrit word \\"jina\\" ('victor') and connoting the path of victory in crossing over life's stream of rebirths through an ethical and spiritual life. Jains trace their history through a succession of twenty-four victorious saviors and teachers known as Tirthankaras, with the first being Rishabhanatha, who is believed to have lived millions of years ago, and twenty-fourth being the Mahavira around 500 BCE. Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal \\"dharma\\" with the Tirthankaras guiding every cycle of the Jain cosmology. Jainism has two major ancient sub-traditions, Digambaras and Svetambaras; and several smaller sub-traditions that emerged in the 2nd millennium CE. The Digambaras and Svetambaras have different views on ascetic practices, gender and which Jain texts can be considered canonical.

He is considered to be both the prototypical and the archetypal vampire in subsequent works of fiction. He is also depicted in the novel to be the origin of werewolf legends. Some aspects of the character are believed to have been inspired by the 15th-century Wallachian Prince Vlad the Impaler, who was also known as Dracula. Count Dracula is portrayed in the novel using many different supernatural abilities, and is believed to have gained his abilities through dealings with the Devil. Chapter 18 of the novel describes many of the abilities, limitations and weaknesses of vampires and Dracula in particular. Dracula has superhuman strength which, according to Van Helsing, is equivalent to that of 20 strong men. He does not cast a shadow or have a reflection from mirrors. He is immune to conventional means of attack; a sailor tries to stab him in the back with a knife, but the blade goes through his body as though it is air. Why Harker's and Morris' physical attacks are able to harm him in other parts of the book is never explained although it is noteworthy that the failed stabbing by the sailor occurred at night and the successful attacks were during daylight hours. The Count can defy gravity to a certain extent and possesses superhuman agility, able to climb vertical surfaces upside down in a reptilian manner. He can travel onto \\"unhallowed\\" ground such as the graves of suicides and those of his victims. He has powerful hypnotic, telepathic and illusionary abilities. He also has the ability to \\"within limitations\\" vanish and reappear elsewhere at will. If he knows the path, he can come out from anything or into anything regardless of how close it is bound even if it is fused with fire. He has amassed cunning and wisdom throughout centuries, and he is unable to die by the mere passing of time alone. He can command animals such as rats, owls, bats, moths, foxes and wolves. However, his control over these animals is limited, as seen when the party first enters his house in London. Although Dracula is able to summon thousands of rats to swarm and attack the group, Holmwood summons his trio of terriers to do battle with the rats. The dogs prove very efficient rat killers, suggesting they are Manchester terriers trained for that purpose. Terrified by the dogs' onslaught, the rats flee and any control which Dracula had over them is gone. Dracula can also manipulate the weather and, within his range, is able to direct the elements, such as storms, fog and mist. Entity:","completion":"Count Dracula"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the first sentence, the information is presented in a logical, hierarchical order: 1. Võhma is a village 2. It is located in Lääneranna Parish 3. The parish is in Pärnu County 4. Pärnu County is in western Estonia. This structure allows readers to get a clear understanding of the levels of organization, from the village level all the way up to the regional level. It is easier to follow the order of locations from a smaller entity going up to a larger entity. For readers familiar with the geography, they can easily identify the location of Võhma. The second sentence rearranges some of these elements: 1. Võhma is a village 2. It is located in the Lääneranna parish 3. The village and parish are in Estonia 4. Estonia is in western Pärnu County. While this sentence covers the same points as the first sentence, it breaks the hierarchical order, which may confuse some readers. This structure can be slightly more challenging for readers to understand since it disrupts the logical hierarchy of locations to describe the national level (Estonia) before continuing with the regional level (Pärnu County). In summary, both sentences convey the same essential information about Võhma's location, but the first sentence provides the information in a clearer, more logically structured manner. While the second sentence ultimately conveys the same message, it is less straightforward because it breaks the hierarchical order of information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Among these is a handful of ladies (and no, copy editors, you may not change “ladies” to “women”) who strive daily to keep Washington’s name and legacy in the dimming lights of history. Unheralded and largely unknown, they deserve recognition for their valiant and extravagant efforts to preserve one of America’s most valuable assets, including the original ruminations of its greatest thinkers. These would be the members of the Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association, who volunteer their time and talents — and open their wallets — to maintain Washington’s home on the Potomac. These efforts have been shepherded the past 30 years by one brave and hearty James Rees (think of having a couple dozen powerful women as your boss), who, like Washington, is also reserved and humble of spirit. To everyone’s dismay, Rees, 60, recently retired as CEO, owing to a debilitating illness that has taken him too soon from his venerable toils. During his 30 years at Mount Vernon, Rees helped lead its transformation from a historic house to a major national attraction, increasing its endowment from just 4 million in 1984 to more than 125 million today, and recently oversaw the groundbreaking for the estate’s newest project — a presidential library that will offer fellowships to scholars in residence as well as safeguard Washington’s books and papers. Latest to the collection is Washington’s original copy of the “Acts of Congress,” a 106-page volume that contains his personal copy of the Constitution, a draft of the Bill of Rights, and other documents pertaining to early acts of the new Congress. Washington’s own handwritten scribbles are penciled in the margins. The Mount Vernon ladies captured the book in a Christie’s bidding war using private funds. Unbeknown to most visitors to Mount Vernon — and certainly the millions who don’t know it exists — Washington’s home was saved and is maintained without a penny of public funds. (Disclosure: I serve on the Mount Vernon advisory board, a collection of private citizens who meet twice a year to offer advice, which the ladies are utterly free to ignore.) The ladies’ association is a lesson in volunteerism worthy of its own chapter. The association was formed in 1853 by South Carolina native Ann Pamela Cunningham, whose mother had noticed a large, dilapidated house perched on a hill along the Potomac River and was outraged to learn it was Washington’s home. Inspired by her mother, Cunningham reached out to Southern women to raise funds to buy the estate and, in 1860, open it to the public, thus beginning a 152-year-old tradition. Since then, more than 80 million have visited the house and grounds, which include an underground museum (so as not to mar the landscape), gardens, a slave burial ground, and the final resting place of George and Martha Washington. Even the opposite shore of the Potomac has been preserved so that visitors can enjoy the same view that Washington did. The Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington, named for its most generous donor, is an overdue addition to Washington’s home. In a time of self-reverential politicians and presidential libraries erected as monuments to ego, it is odd, if also characteristic, that the first president had none. Just as he resisted becoming the nation’s first president, feeling himself unworthy, he would have found a library in his honor, indulging today’s vernacular, “over the top.” Washington no doubt would be disappointed by the boastful tenor and dishonest content of today’s political debate, though he was surely familiar with the rowdy passions that drive it. Thanks to the ladies of Mount Vernon — and to the lovely James Rees — Americans can revisit those passions on the very grounds Washington paced, and perhaps find inspiration there to engage in a more civil discourse, surely not the least among Washington’s legacies.","completion":"Title: The Unsung Heroines: Preserving Washington's Legacy through the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association"},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Context: QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

Slender mint is native to Tasmania, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.","completion":"Based on the information you provided, the inference that 'Slender mint is native to Tasmania, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia' is indeed correct. From this provided information, we understand that Slender mint (Mentha diemenica) is a mint species that originates from certain regions in Australia. Specifically, it has been stated to be native to five regions: Tasmania, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. Tasmania, specifically, has a unique connection with Slender mint. The mint species is named after Van Diemen's Land, which is the historical name for Tasmania. This main idea conveys that the natural distribution of Slender mint is throughout these regions, where it presumably has evolved and proliferated over many years. Being 'native' to these parts of Australia means it is integral to the biodiversity of these regions. It contributes to the ecosystems of these regions by providing resources for pollinators and potentially other types of wildlife. Additionally, native plants like Slender mint are especially well-adapted to the climates and soils of these areas. Hence, when we talk about a plant being native to a location, we’re referring to the concept of it originating from that place naturally, without human intervention. The term is closely linked with matters of biodiversity, conservation, and ecology. The assertion that the Slender mint is \\"native\\" to Tasmania, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia holds significant ecological validity and suggests the plant's importance to the various ecosystems within these regions. In conclusion, yes, the stated inference aligns with the available information correctly and reflects an accurate understanding of the Slender mint's native distribution within Australia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: NASA’s Orion spacecraft returns safely to Earth, splashes down in the Pacific Ocean NASA’s Orion spacecraft has returned safely to Earth after its historic test flight, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean 275 miles west of Baja California at 11:29 a.m. ET. The splashdown, which was streamed live from a NASA drone, sparked scenes of celebration at the space agency’s Mission Control in Houston. The unmanned spacecraft successfully blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., at 7:05 a.m. ET., Friday, carried into space by a Delta IV Heavy Rocket. NASA had initially planned to launch Orion on Thursday, but was forced to scrub the liftoff following a series of delays and technical glitches. NASA lauded the mission as a \\"textbook\\" maiden flight. \\"Today was a great day for America - we challenge our best and brightest to continue to lead in space,\\" said Orion's Lead Flight Director Mike Sarafin. \\"While this was an unmanned mission, we were all on board Orion.\\" The successor to the now-retired Space Shuttles re-entered Earth’s atmosphere at 11:19 a.m. ET, reaching a speed of around 20,000 mph and generating temperatures around 4,000 degrees on the spacecraft’s heat shield. A series of parachutes successfully slowed the Orion crew module, with its three main parachutes deploying at 11:26 a.m. ET. The module was travelling at about 20 mph when it splashed down. Orion remained “powered up” for an hour after splashdown, enabling contractor Lockheed Martin to get as much data as possible about the spacecraft’s performance. After recovery teams from NASA and the U.S. Navy retrieve the module, it will be transported to San Diego aboard the USS Anchorage. Friday’s 4 hour and 24 minute orbital mission took Orion deeper into space than any spacecraft built for humans has traveled in more than 40 years. Orion, which orbited the Earth twice, hit a maximum altitude of 3,604 miles shortly after 10 a.m. ET. The crew module successfully separated from its service module at 10:28 a.m ET. Orion passed through the Van Allen radiation belt twice during its journey, with its systems performing perfectly, according to NASA. Friday's flight, dubbed Exploration Flight Test-1, will provide NASA with vital information on the spacecraft’s performance. NASA plans to eventually use Orion on ambitious manned missions to Mars and an asteroid. Chris Carberry, executive director of Explore Mars, a non-profit organization that aims to advance the goal of sending humans to Mars within the next two decades, told FoxNews.com that Friday's test flight is an important step forward. \\"While Mars could be as many as 20 years off and we don't know exactly what hardware and vehicles will be used, the Orion test starts us on the path toward sending humans beyond Low Earth Orbit,\\" he said. \\"NASA plans to start going to intermediate destinations in the early 2020s, including the Asteroid Redirect mission - if we are going to accomplish that mission or go to any other destinations in the next few years, it is essential that we start testing hardware - as with EFT-1.\\" Carberry, however, warned that \\"sufficient and consistent\\" budgets should be made available to support the goal of landing humans on Mars by the 2030s. Orion was rigged with 1,200 sensors to gauge its durability for the day when astronauts climb aboard during the decade ahead. The 370 million test flight was managed by Lockheed Martin. The Delta IV Heavy Rocket was built by United Launch Alliance. Future Orion launches will use the mega rocket still under development by NASA, known as SLS or Space Launch System. The first Orion-SLS launch is targeted for 2018, unmanned, followed by the first piloted mission in 2021. Friday's test flight came at a crucial time for U.S. spaceflight, which has recently suffered some high-profile setbacks. On Oct. 28 an unmanned Antares rocket exploded in a fireball shortly after liftoff from a NASA launchpad in Wallops Island, Virginia. Just three days later Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo space tourism rocket crashed during a test flight over the Mojave Desert, killing one of the two pilots aboard and seriously injuring the other.

Jennifer stores her bread in the cupboard when she gets home from the grocery store since she thinks it tastes better that way. Martha grew up in a household that always kept their bread in the freezer so that's what she does with her bread. Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ). Both food frying and food spoiling are chemical reactions that happen faster at higher temperatures.

A retired civil servant strangled his long-term partner before hanging himself over the Christmas holiday. Judith Brierley, 67, was found dead in the bedroom of the home she had shared with Kim Matthews, 62, by concerned relatives. The body of Mr Matthews, who ran a local allotment association, was hanging from the bannister in their terraced house Ealing, West London. The horror was uncovered by Mr Matthews’ brother who broke into the £550,000 property when he could not reach the devoted couple by phone. Concern: Police were called to this leafy Ealing cul de sac after concerned relatives failed to hear from the couple over Christmas. Detectives said there is no evidence. that anyone else was involved in the murder of Mrs Brierley at the home. the couple had shared for more than 30 years. It is understood that the childless. couple both suffered from depression and the tragedy may have taken. place shortly before Christmas. Neighbours in the quiet residential. street described the couple, both retired civil servants, as ‘joined at. the hip’ and said they ‘lived for each other’. One said they always handed out Christmas cards on December 24 but came around early this year for the first time. She said: ‘We got our Christmas cards. from Kim and Judith early this year. Usually they deliver it on. Christmas Eve but this year they delivered it around the first week of. December. ‘A lot of the neighbours remarked upon. it. Now I wonder what that meant.

He said: ‘I went over and spoke to the. nephew who had come with his dad. I asked if they were OK and he said,. 'No, it is a suicide.’ Grim discovery: Police found the bodies of Judith Ann Brierley, 67, and Kim Matthews, 62, in the home they shared in Ealing, west London. ‘I said are you sure and he said yes,. he is hanging from the banisters. I asked where Judith was and he said. she was in the house too. They were absolutely devastated. ‘Kim's brother said he hadn't been able to contact them for two days before Christmas Eve, he was quite concerned about them. ‘He was adamant they were in the house, he wasn't going to go away until he had got into that house. ‘It was dreadful to hear that door break and know what happened. I can't take my eyes off the house, it is so sad.’ Residents said the couple were extremely private but always said hello when were often seen out walking together. Another neighbour said: ‘They were. just a lovely couple, they were obviously very devoted to each other. They were a bit like loners – they lived for each other. ‘It is so sad to hear about their deaths, I haven't slept since I heard the news.’ A post mortem examination found Mrs. Brierley was strangled with a ligature. There were no suspicious. circumstances around Mr Matthews death. Det Chief Insp Matt Bonner, who is leading the inquiry, said there is no evidence that anyone else was involved.

Article:","completion":"Title: Train Drivers in Stockholm Choose Skirts Over Shorts Did you know that sometimes people who drive trains, called train drivers, have rules about what they can wear to work? Just like how you have to wear your school uniform, they have their own uniform too. In a place called Stockholm, which is in a country named Sweden, there were some rules about train drivers' uniforms. They weren't allowed to wear shorts, but they could wear trousers (which are like long pants) and skirts. One day, a group of twelve male train drivers decided that since they couldn't wear shorts, but skirts were allowed, they would wear skirts instead. They might have felt that it's more comfortable to wear skirts when working, especially during warm days. The company they work for, which is called Arriva, said that was just fine. Arriva thinks that as long as the train drivers are following the rules and wearing their uniforms, everything is good. These train drivers in Stockholm show that sometimes if you think about a problem in a clever way, you can come up with a fun and different solution.

Summarize this article: Kelsey Osborne and her kids, Madyson and Ryker (Photo: Kelsey Osborne) GOODING - It's a topic that has sparked debate across the nation over the last few years - legalizing marijuana. In Idaho, recreational and medical marijuana is still illegal. Last month, Kelsey Osborne, a Gooding mother of two, had her children taken from her after she gave her daughter a smoothie with marijuana in it as an attempt to stop her seizures. A month later, the two children - Madyson and Ryker - are still living with their father and Osborne is still trying to get them back. \\"I didn't ever think it would come down to this, but it did,\\" Osborne told KTVB. \\"It tore me apart.\\" She says her 3-year-old daughter has a history of seizures, but one morning early October, it was worse than ever before. \\"They would stop and come back, stop and come back with the hallucinations and everything else,\\" Osborne said. At the time of her seizure, Madyson was withdrawing from a medication called Risperdal, which is used to treat schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder. Osborne says when she couldn't calm her daughter down, she gave Madyson a smoothie with a tablespoon of marijuana-infused butter. \\"Everything stopped 30 minutes later,\\" said Osborne. A couple of hours later, Osborne took Madyson to the doctor. That's where she tested positive for marijuana and the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare was called. She was charged with misdemeanor injury to a child, and has pleaded not guilty. \\"To me I felt like it was my last resort,\\" said Osborne, who maintains that she did the right thing. \\"I've seen it for my own eyes with people out of state who have used it and it's helped them or their children.\\" Tom Shanahan with the Department of Health and Welfare says in any case dealing with marijuana, there is one bottom line. \\"Marijuana is illegal, period,\\" said Shanahan. States that border Idaho, including Montana, Oregon, and Washington have legalized medical or recreational marijuana, and in some cases both. But Idaho isn't one of them and Shanahan says the two drugs aren't interchangeable. \\"Even in states that have legalized it it's not legal to give to children,\\" said Shanahan. \\"The cannabis that is used for children with epilepsy is called cannabidiol oil and it has had THC removed from it.\\" Without THC, there aren't any psychoactive properties found in the drug. \\"It can cause brain development issues with a child, so we view that as unsafe or illegal,\\" said Shanahan. \\"We want children to be in a safe place.\\" Meanwhile Osborne says she will continue trying to get her children back, who are currently with staying with their father. \\"I'm not going to stop,\\" she said. While cannabidiol oil (CBD) is still illegal in Idaho, Shanahan says there is a program in Boise through the FDA that uses CBD as an experimental treatment for 34 children with severe epilepsy. According to Shanahan, there are strict guidelines for those who qualify, one being that the child has to have tried several other treatments that have failed to work. \\"It's a totally different substance and I think people confuse that,\\" he said.

Kelsey Osborne and the Idaho Mom’s for Marijuana group rallied outside of the department of Health and Welfare in Boise Thursday afternoon, calling for medical marijuana reform. (KBOI photo) Kelsey Osborne and the Idaho Mom’s for Marijuana group rallied outside of the Department of Health and Welfare in Boise Thursday afternoon, calling for medical marijuana reform. \\"Hopefully it'll open everybody's eyes on cannabis,” Osborne said. The Department of Health and Welfare placed Osborne’s two children – Madyson, 3, and Ryker, 2, with her ex-husband in Jerome, leaving her with only supervised visitation rights. \\"It tore me apart,” Osborne said, choking back tears. “I didn't ever think that it would come down to this but it did.\\" It all started in early October when her daughter, Madyson, was suffering from seizures and hallucinations after coming off a prescription anti-psychotic medication. Osborne said she did what she thought was right as a mother; she made Madyson a smoothie with marijuana butter. She has since been charged with a misdemeanor count of injury to a child. But says she will continue to protest Child Protection Services until she regains custody. \\"It's something that I'm going to fight for and I'm not going to give up until I have them back home where they have been begging me to be,\\" Osborne said. \\"I'm not going to stop. I won't stop. If it takes me two years, then it's going to take me two years.\\" Tom Shanahan, spokesman for the Department of Health and Welfare, responded to the protesters, saying CPS simply follows the laws currently in place. At the end of the day, the department’s main concern is the safety of the children involved. “Marijuana is illegal. Even in states that have legalized it, it is not legal to use on children,\\" Shanahan said. In Idaho, medicinal marijuana is only legal for a small group of children with epilepsy. The 34 children enrolled have to go through a series of tests before getting approved, and even then it is a different form of cannabis than that of recreational marijuana, according to Shanahan. “There’s two different kinds of substances. The one they use for epilepsy doesn’t have THC, it doesn’t appear to have any kind of brain development issues. Recreational marijuana does cause that so it’s not safe for these children.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"A mother in Idaho had her children taken from her after she gave her daughter a smoothie with marijuana in it, in an attempt to stop her seizures.

So when my friends were in town shopping for presents for their fathers, I decided since my mother was both Mother and Father, no one else was like her, who better deserved(be worth) a present on Father's Day than her? I bought her a little set of tools, just a few things, hammer, pliers and screwdriver and a box to put all these things in. I got some ideas from my grandfather and named it Mother's Tool Box. She was excited, more at the thought of being cared for on Father's Day than of the present. She always said she liked her Father's Day memories better than the Mother's Day ones. It made her feel special -- and she was. I have noticed in the past few years, greeting cards are even made for \\"Mother on Father's Day\\". Ever since then, my mother has got cards on Father's Day.

It begins with five clowns, each getting a cut of the spoils. They suggest that a sixth member of the gang - nicknamed 'The Joker' - who did the planning, but sat out the robbery, doesn't deserve a cut. As the robbery goes on, the clowns begin to kill each other in order to get a larger cut, until a school bus crashes through the wall of the bank, killing another clown. A mob bank manager, who was himself shot with an automatic weapon after he tried to take out the clowns with a shotgun, tells the remaining clown that he doesn't know who he is dealing with.

My wedding experiences were both very different, even though I cried at both ceremonies. At my first wedding, I had been doing a lot of manual labor in the day prior to the wedding. Unfortunately, I did not have any gloves, and I ended up getting a lot of blisters on my hands. By the evening of the wedding, these blisters were very painful to touch. My bride was wearing what I thought to be an elaborate wedding dress. It was pretty, and it had a lot of buttons on it. Little, white, cloth covered buttons. These buttons were also a part of her sleeves and gloves. During the ceremony, she was holding my hands very tightly, and it hurt. I mean, it really really hurt! I didn’t want to pull my hands away, as the gesture could be misconstrued, and I might hurt her feelings. So, I stood and held hands with her, enduring the pain. Although I managed to remain silent, I couldn’t keep the tears from falling down my face. The more I cried, the harder she squeezed and the more painful it was. She always thought that I was crying due to emotion on our wedding day, and I never told her any differently — I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. Some years after that lengthy incarceration ended, I was fortunate to wed again. I had not done any manual labor before our wedding day. My hands were fine. Also, my bride did not have a lot of intricate buttons on her dress, nor did she wear gloves or even have sleeves. We were wed on a beach, just the two of us. No one else was in attendance. We had written our own vows, in fact, our own ceremony, including our own rituals. And yes, I cried, because I was / am so in love with my bride.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: During sexual reproduction, mating with a close relative (inbreeding) often leads to inbreeding depression. Inbreeding depression is considered to be largely due to expression of deleterious recessive mutations. The effects of inbreeding have been studied in many vertebrate species. Now, I have a new situation: Keith is a zoologist. He studies large predators. Last year, he was studying different species of lions. First, he visited the Gir forest in India. There he found the Asiatic Lions. Unfortunately, only few Asiatic Lions are left in the wild, and they have to mate with their close relatives. He then visited the Serengeti reserve in Tanzania. There he found that the African Lions were not forced to mate with close relatives due to their large number. Answer this question please: Which lion species would be less prone to inbreeding, Asiatic or African? Answer:","completion":"The African Lion species would be less prone to inbreeding as compared to the Asiatic Lion species. This conclusion is based on the situation described in which Keith, the zoologist, observed key differences in the two species and their environments. In the Gir Forest in India, the Asiatic Lion population is severely limited, causing the lions to mate with their close relatives out of necessity. This leads to an increased likelihood of inbreeding depression due to the expression of deleterious recessive mutations. When there are fewer individuals in a population, as in the case of Asiatic Lions, the gene pool becomes restricted, and finding a mate outside of close family becomes more difficult. As a consequence, inbreeding rates increase, and so do the risks associated with deleterious gene expression. On the contrary, the Serengeti reserve in Tanzania is home to a larger population of African Lions. These lions have a greater number of potential mates, reducing the need to mate with close relatives. This helps maintain a diverse gene pool, minimizing the risk of inbreeding depression due to deleterious recessive mutations. A larger population size is more conducive to genetic diversity, which not only lowers the likelihood of inbreeding but also contributes to the overall health, fitness, and adaptability of the species. In conclusion, the African Lion species in the Serengeti reserve is less prone to inbreeding compared to the Asiatic Lion species in the Gir Forest. The larger population of African Lions allows for a broader gene pool and better opportunities to find unrelated mates, therefore reducing the probability of inbreeding depression and associated negative consequences on the health of the species. Meanwhile, the dwindling number of Asiatic Lions in the wild and their restrictive living conditions lead to a higher chance of inbreeding, ultimately making them more susceptible to inbreeding depression and its negative effects."},{"prompt":"Q: Is this product review positive?

Answer:","completion":"Yes, both Julia Alvarez and Raymond Queneau were novelists. Julia Alvarez is a Dominican-American novelist, poet, and essayist, born on March 27, 1950, in New York City. Raised in the Dominican Republic, her family moved back to the United States when she was ten years old. Alvarez's writing often explores themes related to her bicultural upbringing, such as identity, assimilation, and the immigrant experience. Her best-known works include the novels \\"How the García Girls Lost Their Accents\\" (1991), \\"In the Time of the Butterflies\\" (1994), and \\"Yo!\\" (1997). In addition to novels, she has published poetry, children's books, and essays. Raymond Queneau, born in Le Havre, France, on February 21, 1903, was a French novelist, poet, and literary theorist. He is best known for his experimental style and playful use of language. His works are marked by a keen interest in the possibilities and boundaries of fiction, often employing wordplay, humor, and mathematical structures. Queneau's most famous novels include \\"Zazie in the Metro\\" (1959) – which was later adapted into a film – and \\"Exercises in Style\\" (1947), a collection of 99 retellings of the same story, each in a different style. He was also a co-founder of the influential literary group Oulipo, which encouraged the use of formal constraints in literature. Raymond Queneau passed away on October 25, 1976. Both Julia Alvarez and Raymond Queneau were successful novelists in their own right, exploring different themes and stylistic approaches in their works.

The Great Ocean Conveyer is a global system of ocean currents that carry warm surface water from the equator toward the poles and return cooler, deep water from the poles back toward the equator. This circulation plays a vital role in regulating the Earth's climate, particularly in North America and Europe, which are warmed by the transport of warm surface water near their coastlines. The potential disruption of the Great Ocean Conveyer could be caused by various factors such as an increase in freshwater from melting glaciers, increased precipitation or other climate-related shifts. The effect of slowing or stopping the Great Ocean Conveyer would be to reduce the transportation of warm surface water northwards toward high latitudes. Step by step reasoning: 1. Warm water from equatorial regions is carried north through the Atlantic Ocean by the Great Ocean Conveyer. 2. This warm water helps regulate and moderate the climate in North America and Europe by keeping it warmer than it would be otherwise. 3.

Kimberley Ann \\"Kim\\" Deal (born June 10, 1961) is an American singer, songwriter and musician, best known as the former bassist and backing vocalist of the alternative rock band Pixies, and the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for The Breeders. Deal joined Pixies in January 1986 as the band's bassist, adopting the stage name Mrs. John Murphy for the albums Come on Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa. Following Doolittle and The Pixies' hiatus, she formed The Breeders with Tanya Donelly, Josephine Wiggs and later introduced her identical twin sister Kelley Deal. The Pixies broke up in early 1993, and Deal returned her focus to The Breeders, who released the platinum-selling album Last Splash in 1993. Deal became the bassist and backing vocalist for Pixies in January 1986, after answering an advertisement in the Boston Phoenix that said, \\"\\"Band seeks bassist into Husker Du and Peter, Paul and Mary. Please - no chops.\\" Deal was the only person to call them, even though her main instrument was guitar. She borrowed her sister Kelley's bass guitar to use in the band. To complete the lineup, she suggested they hire David Lovering as drummer, a friend of her husband, whom she met at her wedding reception. For the release of the band's first recording Come on Pilgrim (1987), Deal used the nom de disque \\"Mrs. John Murphy\\" in the liner notes. She chose the name as an ironic feminist joke, after conversing with a lady who wished to be called only by her husband's name as a form of respect. For Surfer Rosa (1988), Deal sang lead vocals on the album's only single, \\"Gigantic\\" ( sample ), which she co-wrote with Black Francis. Doolittle followed a year later, with Deal contributing the song \\"Silver\\" and appearing on slide guitar. By this time, however, tensions began to develop between her and Francis, with bickering and standoffs between the two marring the album's recording sessions. This led to increased stress between the band members. Murphy commented that during the sessions, it \\"went from just all fun to work\\". Exhaustion, from releasing three records in two years and constant touring, contributed to the friction, particularly between Francis and Deal. The tension and exhaustion culminated at the end of the US \\"Fuck or Fight\\" tour, where they were too tired to attend the end-of-tour party. The band soon announced a hiatus.

(September 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The movie begins with Eugene (Zach Cregger) and his best friend Tucker (Trevor Moore) as kids. They sneak into the bedroom closet of Eugene's brother, as he recently acquired a valuable Michael Jordan rookie card. Upon opening the box the card was in, Tucker notices that Eugene's brother has an issue of Playboy. Tucker opens the magazine, instantly becoming obsessed with it. Three weeks later, Tucker's demeanor has changed to that of a hormone driven teenager, despite that he is only 8 years old. Fast forward ten years later, Eugene and Tucker are seniors in high school. Tucker is still a huge fan of the Playboy franchise, while Eugene and his girlfriend of two years, Cindi Whitehall (Raquel Alessi) are public speakers on the subject of abstinence for younger teens. Despite this, in reality, Cindi has other plans, stating that since they have been together for two years, if she is not Eugene's first then they have big problems. They decide to go through with it at the after prom party that Tucker had invited them to. On the day of prom, Tucker tells Eugene that he has the limo booked, which when pulls up, has already picked up Tucker's high school drop-out friend, Phil, who now goes by the MC name of Horsedick.MPEG (Craig Robinson). At the After Prom party, Cindi goes upstairs to prepare, while Tucker takes Eugene into the kitchen and gives him several shots of hard alcohol. As Eugene leaves to go upstairs to meet Cindi, he walks through the wrong door, and falls down the steps into the basement. He is hurt so bad, that he falls into a coma for four years. After Tucker wakes Eugene with a baseball bat, he tells him that Cindi stuck around for a little while, but disappeared shortly thereafter because Eugene was \\"a vegetable.\\" Tucker left Eugene to continue his recovery as Tucker went to...

The plot is a cheap rehash of the first, which is weird, since it's supposed to be a prequel, not a sequel. Pretty much the entire movie seems like a cheap remake of the first, with scenes mimicking the things that happened in the first, only a lot more ridiculous and unlikely. Where the first had a great cast, this one consist of B-list actors and rejects. The acting is mostly horrendously bad. Half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first, as is nearly every major character, including the ones who weren't in the first movie. I realize this was made up by a TV series pilot episode, but that's no excuse. They didn't have to turn the (bad) footage into a movie. Only one thing is marginally good, and that's the erotic sequences. However, as these are nowhere near as good as the ones in the first, even this isn't raising it above a rating of 1. If you have a chance to see it for free, and you're a straight guy, it could be worth checking out, if you want something erotic that isn't porn. If not, avoid at all costs. 1/10 Choose your answer.

We have the equation -6 * b + 3 * b = -9. First, we need to combine the terms with 'b'. So, let's add -6 * b and 3 * b together: -6 * b + 3 * b = (-6 + 3) * b = -3 * b Now, our new equation is -3 * b = -9. To find the value of 'b', we need to get it all by itself on one side of the equation. So, we will divide both sides of the equation by -3: (-3 * b) / -3 = -9 / -3 Since the equation is now simplified, we can see that: b = -9 / -3 Now we just need to calculate the value: b = -9 / -3 = 3 So, the value of 'b' is 3!

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What are the last names of the French critics who promoted the painter who had only a few copies of his works produced? is inside the article: El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th-century Mannerism. El Greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers. Only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works. Late 17th- and early 18th-century Spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his antinaturalistic style and his complex iconography. Some of these commentators, such as Antonio Palomino and Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez, described his mature work as \\"contemptible\\", \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"worthy of scorn\\". The views of Palomino and Bermúdez were frequently repeated in Spanish historiography, adorned with terms such as \\"strange\\", \\"queer\\", \\"original\\", \\"eccentric\\" and \\"odd\\". The phrase \\"sunk in eccentricity\\", often encountered in such texts, in time developed into \\"madness\\".With the arrival of Romantic sentiments in the late 18th century, El Greco's works were examined anew. To French writer Théophile Gautier, El Greco was the precursor of the European Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme. Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal romantic hero (the \\"gifted\\", the \\"misunderstood\\", the \\"mad\\"), and was the first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco's later technique. French art critics Zacharie Astruc and Paul Lefort helped to promote a widespread revival of interest in his painting. In the 1890s, Spanish painters living in Paris adopted him as their guide and mentor. However, in the popular English-speaking imagination he remained the man who \\"painted horrors in the Escorial\\" in the words of Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia in 1899.In 1908, Spanish art historian Manuel Bartolomé Cossío published the first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco's works; in this book El Greco was presented as the founder of the Spanish School. The same year..., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"The last names of the French critics who promoted the painter (El Greco) are Astruc and Lefort.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a premise: Come back when you change your mind.' Here is a hypothesis: Return to this place when you've decided not to do that. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"In order to assess whether the given hypothesis follows the given premise, we first need to unpack the meaning and context of both statements. Premise: \\"Come back when you change your mind.\\" This statement assumes that the person being addressed has made up their mind about a specific matter or decision. The speaker is telling that person to return when they have changed their mind, which implies that there would be further discussion or actions to take place upon their return. This premise reflects the idea that the person should only return if they reconsider their position on the matter at hand. Hypothesis: \\"Return to this place when you've decided not to do that.\\" This statement suggests that the person being addressed has made a decision to do something, and the speaker is telling them to return to the present location once they have decided against carrying out that particular action. Like the premise, this statement involves reconsideration of a decision. However, it goes a step further, in that the hypothesis explicitly refers to a negative decision (\\"not to do that\\") as the condition for returning. To gauge whether the hypothesis follows the premise, we should analyze the similarities and differences between the two statements. Both statements require the person being addressed to reconsider their stance on a matter or decision before returning. They essentially ask for a change of mind before engaging further in a situation. In this respect, there is a clear similarity. However, there is a subtle difference. The premise focuses on a change of mind in general, while the hypothesis specifically asks for reversing a decision related to committing an action. The hypothesis is a more specific condition as compared to the premise. The premise does not provide any context or clarity as to which specific decision the person needs to change their mind about. Given these similarities and differences, we cannot conclusively state that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The hypothesis might be true in certain situations that align with the premise, but it is not guaranteed to be true in every situation where the premise holds. The hypothesis is a specific condition that may or may not be relevant to the broader context of the premise. In summary, though there are similarities between the given premise and hypothesis, they are not equivalent statements. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true as well."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These words are critical to understanding the core meaning and subject matter of the sentence. 1. \\"Batter\\": The batter is the key participant in this sentence because the action revolves around him. The batter is an offensive player in a baseball game who tries to hit the ball thrown by the pitcher. Without the batter, there would be no central subject matter of the sentence. 2. \\"Bat\\": The bat is the crucial instrument utilized by the batter in the scenario described in the sentence. It is the tool that the batter holds and with which he interacts with the ball. The bat is essential to understanding the actions and intentions of the batter as he tries to hit the ball. 3. \\"Catcher\\": The catcher is another essential player mentioned in the sentence. He plays a central role in defense, positioned behind home plate, receiving pitches from the pitcher and trying to prevent the batter from hitting the ball or scoring runs. The importance of the catcher in this sentence is due to his spatial relationship with the batter, which helps to visualize the scene during a game. 4. \\"Umpire\\": The umpire is an essential figure in regulating and overseeing the game. The sentence implies that the batter's holding of the bat is not only relevant to the success rate of his swings but also to the functioning of the game, as it is played within the bounds of the rules, which the umpire enforces. The umpire's role is crucial in maintaining fairness and order during the game. 5. \\"Game\\": The game provides the context for the events described in the sentence. The game of baseball (or softball) is the setting in which the actions of the batter, catcher, and umpire occur. Understanding the rules, principles, and objectives of the game is necessary for interpreting the relations and intentions of the other key words in the sentence.

But the \\"cure\\" is broken when Cruella hears the toll of Big Ben, and she once again goes on a mad quest to make herself the perfect coat out of dalmation hides. This movie is bad on so many levels, starting with the fact that it's a \\"Thanksgiving family schlock\\" movie designed to suck every last available dime out of the Disney marketing machine. Glenn Close over-over-over-over-acts as Cruella. With all that she had to put up with in this movie -- the lame script, the endless makeup, getting baked in a cake at the end -- I hope they gave her an extremely-large paycheck. (Speaking of which, where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory, a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line, and a candlelight restaurant all located within the same building -- as you do in the climax of this film?) Of course, the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs. They serve as the \\"Macaulay Culkin's\\" of this movie, pulling all the stupid \\"Home Alone\\" gags on the villains. (Biting them in the crotch, running over their hands with luggage carts, squirting them with icing, etc., etc., etc., ad nauseum.) I have to admit, the dogs were fairly good actors -- much better than the humans. Gerard Depardieu is completely wasted in this movie as a freaked-out French furrier. The two human \\"dog lovers\\" -- rehashed from the earlier film, but with different actors -- are completely boring. When they have a spaghetti dinner at an Italian restaurant, the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers, and their dogs at home, watching the dinner scene from \\"Lady and the Tramp.\\" I thought to myself, \\"Oh please, don't go there!\\" I half-expected the humans to do a satire on the \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" dinner scene -- as Charlie Sheen did in \\"Hot Shots: Part Deux\\" -- doing the \\"spaghetti strand kiss,\\" pushing the meatball with his nose, etc. And don't get me started on the annoying parrot with Eric Idle's voice.

Mike Nichols, the award-winning director and pioneering comedian who was one of the few people to win an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony award, died Wednesday evening, according to a note from ABC News' president to its staff. Nichols, 83, who directed \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\\" and \\"The Graduate,\\" was the husband of former \\"ABC World News\\" anchor Diane Sawyer. Nichols' influence looms large in entertainment. He was among the founders of the Compass Players, the predecessor to the Chicago-based comedy troupe Second City, which has been a proving ground for comic talent for more than four decades. Share your memories of Mike Nichols. As a performer with Elaine May in the late '50s and early '60s, he took comedy into places it had seldom gone before, bringing an improvisational swagger and intellectual edge to a field that had been dominated by joke-telling standups. \\"Nichols and May combined the political and social satire of (Mort) Sahl and (Lenny) Bruce with the inspired comic skits of (Sid) Caesar and (Imogene) Coca,\\" wrote Sam Kashner in a 2013 Vanity Fair profile. Nichols was also an outstanding theater director. At one point in 1967, he had four plays running on Broadway -- including two by Neil Simon, \\"Barefoot in the Park\\" and \\"The Odd Couple\\" -- and he was a go-to guy for stage works until the end of his life, helming Tom Stoppard's \\"The Real Thing\\" (1984), \\"Monty Python's Spamalot\\" (2005) and a 2012 revival of \\"Death of a Salesman\\" starring Philip Seymour Hoffman. But he's probably best known for his movies, including the groundbreaking \\"The Graduate\\" (1967), the Oscar-nominated \\"Silkwood\\" (1983) and box-office smash \\"The Birdcage\\" (1996). He was known as an \\"actor's director,\\" one able to pull strong performances from his ensemble and capable of seeing things others didn't. Dustin Hoffman remembered Nichols' ability at an American Film Institute tribute. Hoffman observed that Benjamin Braddock, the character he played in \\"The Graduate,\\" was a tall, blond, WASP-y type in the novel. (Indeed, among the actors considered for the role was Robert Redford.) But Nichols saw the character as uncertain and neurotic, qualities Hoffman brought to life on screen. \\"And so I thank you for casting this short, 29-year-old, unknown actor with a prominent nose to play Benjamin Braddock,\\" Hoffman said. \\"God bless you, sir. You're more than a great director. You're a real artist down to your toes, because you're insanely courageous.\\" Starting with two phrases. Nichols was born Michael Igor Peschkowsky in Berlin in 1931. With war clouds looming and Nazi persecution of Jews rising, he immigrated to the United States in 1939. As recounted in the book \\"Faces of America,\\" a young Nichols arrived in the United States knowing only two phrases: \\"I don't speak English\\" and \\"Please, don't kiss me.\\" The family changed its last name to Nichols after settling in New York City, where the family patriarch established a medical practice. Nichols attended college in Chicago and later headed back to New York, where he studied acting under famed teacher Lee Strasberg. He returned to Chicago, where he started up a comedy troupe and met Elaine May. The pair would go on to form a partnership that would later take Broadway by storm. Nichols said he took to the stage. \\"I liked doing the stand-up,\\" Nichols told The Hollywood Reporter in 2012. \\"I only stopped because Elaine wanted to stop. I've never understood it. I thought: 'Why? It's not a very long show. It doesn't cost us anything emotionally.' \\" He moved behind the scenes and directed Robert Redford and Elizabeth Ashley in \\"Barefoot in the Park,\\" which won him his first Tony in 1964. For a time he was Broadway's golden boy, with success following success: \\"Luv\\" (1964), \\"The Odd Couple\\" (1965), \\"The Apple Tree\\" (1966, featuring a young Alan Alda), \\"Plaza Suite\\" (1968) and \\"The Prisoner of Second Avenue\\" (1971). \\"Barefoot,\\" \\"Odd Couple,\\" \\"Plaza Suite\\" and \\"Second Avenue\\" were all written by Neil Simon. He was also the director of the musical \\"Annie\\" (1977), which was one of Broadway's longest-running musicals when it closed almost six years later. Notable movies. More acclaim would follow for his work on the big screen. His first film was a biggie: \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\\" (1966), starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. It was nominated for 13 Oscars and won five, including a best actress trophy for Taylor. His next film, however, was in many ways even more impressive: \\"The Graduate,\\" which made innovative use of pop music (thanks to Simon and Garfunkel's songs), featured a terrific script by Buck Henry and Calder Willlingham and became a blockbuster sign of the New Hollywood -- one led by youthful moviegoers and antihero protagonists. \\"Nichols and veteran cinematographer Robert Surtees threw out the (Directors Guild) playbook for 'The Graduate,' experimenting wildly with lighting and lenses, lending the film a sense of freewheeling freshness, a sheen of visual inventiveness that hasn't dimmed over the years,\\" wrote Slant magazine's Budd Wilkins in a 2012 look back. Nichols won best director for his work. His movies never quite caught lightning in a bottle again -- few movies do -- but still contained stirring scenes and fine performances: the launch of the planes in \\"Catch-22\\" (1970), the sour Jack Nicholson in \\"Carnal Knowledge\\" (1971), the lives of blue-collar nuclear plant workers in \\"Silkwood\\" (1983), the unrestrained glee of the plotting Melanie Griffith in \\"Working Girl\\" (1988). He also directed the TV production of \\"Angels in America\\" (2003), which won a then record-setting 11 Emmys. His last film as director was 2007's \\"Charlie Wilson's War.\\" \\"No one was more passionate about his craft than Mike,\\" James Goldston, president of ABC News, said in a note to the staff. \\"He had recently been immersed in a new project for HBO to adapt 'Master Class,' Terrence McNally's Tony Award-winning play about opera legend Maria Callas. The project reunited him with Meryl Streep, one of his most frequent collaborators.\\" Nichols occupied that rare air in the industry of those who have won the EGOT -- an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony. In 2012 he earned his record sixth Tony for best direction of a play for \\"Death of a Salesmen.\\" He met Sawyer later in life (he was 54 at the time) and she became his fourth wife. He told The Hollywood Reporter that he first spotted the then-\\"60 Minutes\\" correspondent on a flight and later struck up a conversation with her. \\"I found her and said, 'You're my hero.' And she said: 'No, you're my hero. Do you ever have lunch?' She wanted to interview me for '60 Minutes.' I pretended that I was up for it, and we had about 14 lunches.\\" The couple was married for 26 years. In addition to Sawyer, Nichols is survived by his three children -- Daisy, Max and Jenny -- and four grandchildren. Photos: People we've lost in 2014.

What is the reason that it was \\" somehow \\" 1 a.m. ?","completion":"The reason it was \\"somehow\\" 1 a.m. can be attributed to the series of activities and events that unfolded during the day and night, making time pass quickly and almost unnoticed. The individual spent time enjoying various leisure activities, which might have had an engrossing and immersive impact, resulting in the loss of track of time. The day began with spending three hours at the beach. This activity alone accounted for a significant chunk of time, during which the individual might not have paid attention to the clock. The sun, sand, and water probably captured their attention, and in the process, time slipped away. After the beach visit, the individual picked up snacks and beer and hung out on the balcony until late-ish. The phrase \\"late-ish\\" suggests that time continued to escape their notice while socializing and relaxing. This further indicates that they were not strictly monitoring the progression of time and were mainly focused on enjoying the moment in the pleasant company of others. Next, wandering down the main street involved an exploratory element, with the person being accosted by maitre d' types, likely entailing conversations with various restaurant staff, and eventually choosing one of them for dinner. The food and atmosphere were good enough to keep them satisfied, which can also make time pass quickly while engaging in conversation or simply enjoying the ambiance. After the restaurant visit, more time was spent at a café, indulging in beer and ice cream, followed by even more beer. This additional socializing and indulgence in food and beverages contributed further to the sense of losing track of time. Lastly, a combination of the relaxed pace of the day and the absence of significant time markers resulted in time passing more rapidly and almost imperceptibly. The enjoyment of multiple different activities, coupled with a focus on pleasure and relaxation, caused the individual to lose their awareness of how late it had gotten. Thus, it was \\"somehow\\" 1 a.m., an outcome of the day's engrossing and immersive leisurely experiences. The individual might have been struck by the realization of how late it was due to the busy nature and duration of the day's events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. According to the above context, answer the following question. How does Pres Trump feel about the tariffs? The answer is:","completion":"President Trump feels that the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies and believes in asserting this position.

Read this article and answer this question After a few years of peace, the Ottoman Empire attacked the Habsburg Empire. The Turks almost captured Vienna, but John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna , stalling the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Venetian Republic in 1684, joined by Russia in 1686. The second Battle of Mohács was a crushing defeat for the Sultan. The Turks were more successful on the Polish front and were able to retain Podolia during their battles with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Russia's involvement marked the first time the country formally joined an alliance of European powers. This was the beginning of a series of Russo-Turkish Wars, which continued into the 20th century. As a result of the Crimean campaigns and Azov campaigns, Russia captured the key Ottoman fortress of Azov. Following the decisive Battle of Zenta in 1697 and lesser skirmishes , the League won the war in 1699 and forced the Ottoman Empire to sign the Treaty of Karlowitz. The Ottomans ceded most of Hungary, Transylvania and Slavonia, as well as parts of Croatia, to the Habsburg Empire while Podolia returned to Poland.

Goal: To attach el wire to the structural wire of Bionic El Wire Mask. Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"To determine the most reasonable method for attaching the EL wire to the structural wire of a Bionic EL Wire Mask, let's compare two widely recognized methods: using a transparent adhesive and using zip ties or cable ties. Method 1: Using a Transparent Adhesive This method involves using a transparent adhesive, such as clear epoxy, super glue, or hot glue, to bond the EL wire to the structural wire of the mask. The benefits of this method include: 1. A seamless finish: A transparent adhesive helps create an inconspicuous bond between the EL wire and the structural wire, making the attachment appear clean and smooth. 2. Strong bond: Clear epoxy and super glue provide a strong bond between the EL wire and the structural wire, ensuring that the EL wire remains attached and functional for an extended period. 3. Flexible connection: Transparent adhesive allows for some flexibility, which is advantageous when wearing the mask or if the mask's shape needs to be readjusted. However, there are some disadvantages as well: 1. Difficult to adjust or repair: Removing or repositioning the EL wire after it has been adhered can be challenging, sometimes causing damage to the structural wire or the EL wire itself. 2. Drying time: Some adhesives, like epoxy, require a significant amount of time to dry and cure completely, which may not be convenient if you require the mask for immediate use. Method 2: Using Zip Ties or Cable Ties This method involves using zip ties or cable ties to attach the EL wire to the structural wire. These ties are flexible, easy to use, and readily available. The advantages of this method include: 1. Reversible and adjustable: Zip ties allow you to easily reposition or adjust the EL wire without causing damage. If you want to change the design or repair any part of the mask, this method makes it simple and straightforward. 2. Quick and easy to use: Zip ties are easy to use and don't require additional tools, which makes this method more user-friendly. Additionally, there is no drying time involved, so you can use your mask immediately after attaching the EL wire. 3. Cost-effective: Cable ties are generally inexpensive, making this an affordable choice for attaching the EL wire to the mask. But there are some disadvantages as well: 1. Less discreet: Zip ties tend to be more noticeable compared to the transparent adhesive, potentially impacting the mask's overall aesthetics. 2. Less secure fit: While zip ties provide reasonable stability, they might not offer the same level of strong bonding as transparent adhesives, which could lead to the EL wire becoming loose over time. In conclusion, choosing the most reasonable method depends on your priorities. If you value a seamless finish and a strong bond, using a transparent adhesive might be the better choice. However, if you prefer a more flexible and adjustable attachment that allows for easy changes and repairs, using zip ties or cable ties would be a more reasonable option."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1 and Question 2 are not asking the same thing, as there are two distinct parts in Question 1, while question 2 focuses on only one aspect. Therefore, let me provide detailed answers to both questions separately. Question 1: What does an IAS exactly do and what is his or her salary? An IAS officer, or Indian Administrative Service officer, is a part of the All India Services, which is a prestigious group of civil servants that serves the Government of India as well as the individual states. IAS officers handle the administrative functions at various levels, including central, state, and district levels. Here's an overview of the roles and responsibilities of an IAS officer: 1. Policymaking and Implementation: IAS officers play a crucial role in formulating and implementing government policies and developmental programs. They work closely with elected representatives and help in decision-making in various sectors such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and agriculture. 2. Revenue and Law and Order Administration: At the district level, IAS officers act as District Collectors or District Magistrates. They are responsible for maintenance of law and order, revenue administration, natural resources management, and supervision of other departments and offices in their jurisdiction. 3. Public Welfare and Social Development: IAS officers are involved in designing and executing public welfare schemes and programs to uplift the standard of living of the society, particularly of underprivileged and marginalized communities. 4. Crisis and Disaster Management: In times of natural disasters and emergencies, IAS officers are responsible for coordinating relief and rescue operations, distribution of essential resources, and rehabilitation efforts to minimize the impact on public life. Now, coming to the salary aspect, the monthly salary of an IAS officer varies according to their rank and service experience. As of 2021, the pay scale of an IAS officer starts from the Junior Time Scale and goes up to the Apex Scale. Here's an approximate breakdown: 1. Junior Time Scale (entry-level): INR 56,100 2. Senior Time Scale (after 4 years of service): INR 67,700 3. Junior Administrative Grade (after 9 years of service): INR 78,800 4. Selection Grade (after 12-15 years of service): INR 1,18,500 5.

Article: In 1937 over 100 people died after ingesting \\"Elixir Sulfanilamide\\" manufactured by S.E. Massengill Company of Tennessee. The product was formulated in diethylene glycol, a highly toxic solvent that is now widely used as antifreeze. Under the laws extant at that time, prosecution of the manufacturer was possible only under the technicality that the product had been called an \\"elixir\\", which literally implied a solution in ethanol. In response to this episode, the U.S. Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, which for the first time required pre-market demonstration of safety before a drug could be sold, and explicitly prohibited false therapeutic claims. Now answer this question: What law did Congress pass following the Elixir Sulfanilamide incident?","completion":"After the Elixir Sulfanilamide incident, Congress passed a law called the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938.

The actress joked about having a baby bump as she lounged in the pool DANNIELLA Westbrook admitted she was “looking very pregnant” in her recent holiday snap – after making no secret about wanting a baby with toyboy lover George Arnold. In a snap which showed the bikini-clad ex EastEnders star lounging out on an inflatable flamingo, she wrote: “So chilled out. Looking very pregnant,” followed by cheeky monkey and love heart Emoji icons. The actress showed off her tanned tummy in the sun-soaked snap as she relaxed in matching swimwear. Yet her pool antics in Portugal came second to her comment as fans flocked to respond to her cheeky suggestion she could be expecting. One was quick to celebrate and wrote: “Congratulations beautiful!!” while one simply put: “Congrats xx.” Another added: “You don’t look pregnant but if you are congrats hun, deserve it all.” Many others quizzed as to whether her words were just meant as tongue-in-cheek and uploaded the question: “Are you pregnant?” One took her comments as pure banter and added: “I think she’s probably just tormenting everyone little moo.” She later uploaded another shot showing her sliding into the water and sporting a headscarf to protect her blonde locks from the water. Yet the star of the small screen, who looked blissfully happy as she topped up her tan on the inflatable, could just as well have been channelling the mood of fellow actress Jennifer Aniston. The Friends star this week spoke out to set the record straight about “absurd” pregnancy rumours. She has insisted she is not expecting a child with husband Justin Theroux and urged fans to stop speculating about her baby status every time she has a “burger for lunch”. They came just hours before Danniella, already a mum-of-two, posted a super-cute snap of her date night with George. The Celebrity Big Brother star showed off her toned legs in a thigh-skimming denim dress which she paired with strappy black sandals and a hat. Danniella, 42, stood sandwiched next to George, 24, as they posed with a huge yacht in the background. She captioned the sweet snap: “Dinner with the one I love,” and hashtags including #mylove #mygeorge. Earlier this year, she revealed she was trying for a baby with George and would even fork out for costly IVF treatment if she struggled to conceive naturally. She told Closer magazine: “I’d love to be a mum again. I feel like this could be my happy ending. “George and I have just bought a house together and I’m excited to get married to him this year. “We’re also going to start trying for a baby, and if it doesn’t work within two months, I’ll have IVF.” She added: “The past two years have been awful but I’ve softened now and let my guard down because I’ve met George. Since I met him I’ve had a smile on my face every day and we would love to get married, so once my divorce has gone through, we’ll do that.” Meanwhile a spokesperson for Danniella denied she was pregnant. They told The Sun Online: \\"She's 100% not pregnant. She was just making fun of an unflattering photo.\\" Summary:","completion":"Actress Danniella Westbrook shared a picture of herself on holiday looking a little bigger than usual. She joked about looking pregnant in the picture, and some fans thought she might actually be expecting a baby.

Given the context: How would you describe Sasha?","completion":"Sasha can be described as a passionate and enthusiastic home cook who loves to create delicious dishes for her family and friends, but at the same time, she seems to be somewhat careless or prone to accidents in the kitchen. Her frequent mishaps, such as burning her hand again this week, indicate that she might not be taking the necessary safety precautions when handling hot pots, pans, or other kitchen tools and appliances. Being a good cook implies that Sasha possesses the necessary creative and culinary skills to produce appetizing meals. She likely has a keen sense of taste and a proficiency in combining various flavors, textures, and ingredients. Additionally, she probably knows how to follow and adapt recipes, as well as to plan and execute meals successfully. However, Sasha's repeated accidents suggest that she could improve her safety measures and attentiveness in the kitchen. Despite her culinary talents, her lack of caution might put her at risk for more severe injuries or could even compromise the outcome of her dishes. Some key traits of Sasha based on the given context can be summarized as follows: 1. Passionate – Sasha's love for cooking drives her to spend time in the kitchen, indicating that she is dedicated to her culinary pursuits and finds joy in the process. 2. Skillful – As a good cook, Sasha possesses the necessary abilities to prepare various dishes, which may consist of diverse techniques, ingredients, and styles. Her knowledge likely extends beyond the basics, making her an accomplished culinary enthusiast. 3. Careless – Despite her passion and skills, Sasha frequently encounters accidents in the kitchen. This carelessness could stem from inadequate safety procedures or a tendency to rush, potentially putting her and others at risk. 4. Accident-prone – Sasha's recurrent mishaps suggest that she may be more susceptible to accidents than others, possibly due to a lack of focus, impatience, or a simple predisposition. In conclusion, Sasha embodies the qualities of an ardent and proficient home cook with a flair for creating delightful meals. However, her propensity for accidents highlights the need for increased attentiveness and safety precautions in the kitchen. By improving these aspects, Sasha can further excel in her culinary journey, reducing hazards and ensuring the well-being of both herself and her loved ones."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a \\"2).\\" movie review (Options are: 1). negative; 2). positive;).","completion":"2) Positive Movie Review: Title: The Shawshank Redemption (1994) Directed by Frank Darabont, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is a timeless masterpiece that has repeatedly proven itself to be one of the most outstanding movies in cinematic history. This stirring adaptation of Stephen King's novella, \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,\\" eloquently showcases the resilience of the human spirit, the power of friendship, and the pursuit of justice while offering a riveting narrative that captivates the viewers from start to finish. Set in the late 1940s through the 1960s, the movie primarily revolves around the life of its protagonist Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is wrongfully accused and convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. This dark turn of events lands him in the brutal, unforgiving environment of Shawshank State Penitentiary, where he befriends Ellis Boyd \\"Red\\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), among other inmates. The struggles, friendships, and hardships encountered within the prison walls provide the backdrop for this engrossing story that spans the course of two decades. The exceptional performances of the lead actors Robbins and Freeman, along with the supporting cast including Bob Gunton (Warden Norton) and Clancy Brown (Captain Hadley), display the gamut of human emotion through their powerful portrayals of love, despair, hope, and triumph. Robbins effectively embodies the undeterred spirit of Andy Dufresne, while Freeman masterfully plays the role of a wise and grounded mentor to Tim Robbins' character. Their remarkable chemistry adds texture to their characters' bond, strengthening the impact of the movie on its audience. The direction by Frank Darabont is meticulous, capturing the raw emotions and unsettling atmosphere prevalent within the prison setting. Through his skilful storytelling, Darabont navigates effortlessly between the poignant and the heart-wrenching, punctuating the narrative with unexpected moments of levity. This balance ensures that the film remains enthralling while provoking introspection about the human condition and the moral dilemmas one can face in the most adverse circumstances. Cinematography plays a crucial role in this epic drama, with Roger Deakins's lens artfully capturing the stark, unforgiving landscapes of Shawshank and the surrounding Maine countryside. These images provide a vivid visual rendering of the confinement and despair experienced by the inmates, juxtaposed against the vastness of the world beyond the prison walls. Seamlessly accompanied by Thomas Newman's haunting score, the cinematography intensifies the emotional impact of the film, transporting viewers into the core of its narrative. \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is ultimately a testament to the indomitability of the human spirit, exploring themes of justice, redemption, and companionship. True to its title, the movie provides a glimpse into the redeeming power of hope and the unfaltering human desire for freedom. With the mesmerizing performances of its actors, ingenious direction, poignant storytelling, and breathtaking cinematography, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" continues to capture the hearts and minds of audiences globally, earning its place as one of the greatest cinematic gems of all time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He offers her a monthly payment to stop working as a prostitute and move in with him. After receiving threats from two Turkish Muslims for the work she does, she decides to accept his offer. Ali's son, Nejat Aksu (Baki Davrak), a professor of German literature, does not have time to respond to the prospect of living with a woman of \\"easy virtue\\" before Ali is stricken with a heart attack. He softens to her: he learns that she has told her 27-year-old daughter she is a shoe saleswoman, sending shoes to her in Turkey to support that story, and wishes her daughter could receive an education like his. Back home from the hospital, Ali suspects Yeter and his son may have had a liaison. When his drunken demands of Yeter cause her to threaten to leave, he strikes her and she dies from the blow. Ali is sent to prison. Nejat travels to Istanbul to search for Yeter's daughter, Ayten (NurgÃ¼l YeÅilÃ§ay), and assumes responsibility for her education.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last of the person who worked closely with a singer to match her songwriting to the most appropriate sound? American singer Prudencesa Renfro, professionally known as Pru, was signed through Warner/Chappell Music Publishing by Capitol Records' executive Roy Lott, who said that he was \\"drawn to\\" her songwriting and voice. Jack Ponti, of Cazzy Dog Management, had helped Pru produce a demo tape to secure the record deal. Lott had noted Pru's potential as an artist through her lyrics. He worked closely with her to match her songwriting to the most appropriate sound, serving as the executive producer for her debut studio album Pru.Prior to securing a record deal, Pru had found inspiration for her music in artists such as Cassandra Wilson and Dianne Reeves. She wrote song lyrics and poetry while attending high school and then Texas Southern University, coupling her lyrics with the music of other artists such as Michael Jackson, Rachelle Ferrell, Sade, Naughty by Nature, the Isley Brothers, and Miles Davis. While discussing her approach to songwriting, Pru elaborated: \\"From a word, I can get a whole picture, a visual. The song becomes a poem, almost like a thesis.\\" She considered her music as a form of poetry, citing the album track \\"Hazy Shades\\" as an example of a poem turned into a song.Pru stated that she wanted her songs to bring variety to contemporary R&B, and described the material as the opposite of the formulaic music typically found on radio. On her official website, the singer identified her style as connected with the soul. Though AllMusic gives the singer songwriting credit on twelve of the tracks, Pru is only credited for co-writing \\"Aaroma\\" on the album's liner notes. The record was completed at Studio 57 and Weight Room in New York City, with mixing handled by Mike Shipley and Tony Maserati. Following release of the album, Pru spoke highly of her experiences with the producers and felt that they \\"la[id] a good bed around the lyrics and the melodies\\". The answer is:","completion":"Roy Lott. Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the paragraph. The relevant information is: \\"...Capitol Records' executive Roy Lott...He worked closely with her to match her songwriting to the most appropriate sound...\\" Step 2: Extract the last name of the person who worked closely with the singer. The person is identified as \\"Roy Lott.\\" Step 3: Justify the answer. Roy Lott is mentioned as the person who worked closely with Pru to match her songwriting to the most appropriate sound.

Sentence: \\"There is believed to be a dragon in the wood.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically? Select from: *unacceptable. *acceptable.","completion":"To provide a detailed interpretation of whether the sentence, \\"There is believed to be a dragon in the wood,\\" is linguistically acceptable, we should first analyze its various grammatical and syntactical components. 1. Structure: The sentence mainly follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) order, which is common in the English language and provides a clear structure for the listener or reader. 2. Verb: The verb in the sentence is \\"is believed,\\" which takes a passive construction. By using the passive voice, the sentence emphasizes the action (believing) rather than the subject (people or an individual) who believes in the existence of a dragon. This construction also implies that the belief is more general and not specific to a person or a group. 3. Noun Phrases: There are two main noun phrases in the sentence: \\"a dragon\\" and \\"the wood.\\" Both phrases provide the necessary information to understand the context of the sentence. The indefinite article \\"a\\" indicates that multiple dragons might exist, whereas \\"the wood\\" specifies the location where the dragon might be found. 4. Prepositional Phrase: The prepositional phrase \\"in the wood\\" provides additional information about the presence of the dragon. It acts as an adjunct, enriching the meaning of the sentence without altering its main sense. 5. Vocabulary: The vocabulary used in the sentence is relatively simple and well-known, allowing the readers or listeners to easily grasp the meaning of the sentence. Considering the above points, from a linguistic perspective, the sentence \\"There is believed to be a dragon in the wood\\" is *acceptable*. The sentence follows standard English grammatical and syntactical rules, and its structure, verb construction, noun phrases, prepositional phrase, and vocabulary are all within the norms of the language.

If I remember right, after some folks left, there was one couple, a couple girls (maybe 3?), and myself who stayed over.

The couple took one bed, the girls took the other, and I took the floor at the foot of the girls’ bed.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person whose father died in 1819? Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti).

Her mother was consigned to a remote apartment in Buckingham Palace, and Victoria often refused to see her. When Victoria complained to Melbourne that her mother's close proximity promised \\"torment for many years\\", Melbourne sympathised but said it could be avoided by marriage, which Victoria called a \\"schocking [sic] alternative\\". She showed interest in Albert's education for the future role he would have to play as her husband, but she resisted attempts to rush her into wedlock. What did Victoria and her mother disagree on?","completion":"Victoria and her mother, the Duchess of Kent, disagreed on the Kensington System, a strict set of rules and protocols devised by her mother and Sir John Conroy. The Kensington System was designed to control Victoria's upbringing, isolate her from external influences, and shape her character in a manner that would make her more reliant on her mother and Conroy for decision-making when she became queen. The ultimate goal of the system was to secure a regency for the Duchess of Kent in the event that Victoria became queen before she was eighteen, allowing the Duchess and Conroy to wield power through their proximity to the young queen. The system included restrictions on Victoria's social life, heavy surveillance, limiting her contact with people, and a rigorous educational program. Victoria felt oppressed by the confinement and overbearing control the Kensington System imposed on her life and developed a deep resentment for both her mother and Sir John Conroy. She believed these restrictions affected her personal freedom and ability to make independent decisions. When Victoria became queen at the age of eighteen, she quickly dismissed the rules of the Kensington System and took control of her life. This created tension between her and her mother, as the Duchess still believed in the value of the system and continued to rely on Conroy's counsel. This difference in perspectives and decisions led to further disagreements and strained their already-fragile relationship. Victoria's unwillingness to follow the Kensington System was one of the primary reasons behind their disagreements. Despite their rocky relationship, the two maintained close proximity due to social conventions, adding to Victoria's frustration. The distance she placed between herself and her mother showed the degree to which Victoria disagreed and rebelled against the oppressive system her mother tried to enforce on her."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
