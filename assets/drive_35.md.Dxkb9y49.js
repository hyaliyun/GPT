This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae. He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)—whom he had left in charge of Britain—has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne. Arthur returns to Britain and defeats and kills Modredus on the river Camblam in Cornwall, but he is mortally wounded. He hands the crown to his kinsman Constantine and is taken to the isle of Avalon to be healed of his wounds, never to be seen again. Guess a valid title for it!

Okay, okay, the transparent TV was neat, but will it actually change the way we watch television? Not likely -- not any time soon, at least. And while the mind-controlled set we saw last year was certainly cool, it didn't offer much in the way of accuracy. This Eye-Control TV, on the other hand, certainly takes a step in the right direction. To use the set, you sit in front of a black rectangular sensor positioned at chest height. There's some calibration involved when moving from person to person, chasing a circle around the screen with your eyes. Once calibrated, you're good to go. You use your eyes for basic TV controls -- changing channels, adjusting the volume, things like that. Switching involves looking at an element of the screen and giving a big blink to select -- the display seems adjusted in such a way that normal blinks won't trigger it, so you're less likely to accidentally set something off. You look down to adjust the volume. A control panel will show up, and from there, you can move the slider left or right by looking at the volume up and volume down icons -- you can also select mute from here. To change channels, look at the top left-hand corner of the screen and blink. That'll bring up a UI featuring large pictures of videos. Look at one and blink at it to select it. The system can also be used to view and toggle between still images. The use of pictures certainly seems the most intuitive method for navigating around videos -- there's a definite learning curve here, and it's hard enough to select pictures -- we couldn't really imagine toggling through small text. As with the transparent television, this doesn't feel quite ready for market -- it's a compelling concept, none the less. And using the human eye to control a display that you're already staring at anyway does seem to have some merits. Check out an eyes-on video, after the jump. %Gallery-163806% ||||| Blink and you'll miss it: Eye-control TV arrives which lets couch potatoes change the channel without lifting a finger Couch potatoes just found another excuse not to get off the sofa - a TV which can monitor your eyes and change the channel if you give it the nod. The Eye Control TV, by Chinese manufacturer Haier, comes with an admittedly bulky device that you place in front of your TV, and with a determined blink of your eyes you can change channels, change the volume, or power your television off. The eye-sensing technology relies on a Kinect-style sensor sat on your table, and Haier says your standard blinks will not interrupt your scheduled viewing. Scroll down for video No more lost remotes: The prototype sensor sits in front of the television, responding to blinks from the couch potato Blinks can bring up a menu bar, with a slide of your head allowing you to adjust the volume The sensor sits in front of you and needs calibration the first time you run it, which involves chasing a circle around the screen with your eyes. After that, long blinks activate the sensor, bringing up an on-screen display. Looking downwards brings up the volume controls, which you can then adjust by looking at the plus and minus signs. Meanwhile, other menus allow you to switch channels and glide between still images. Engadget tested the equipment at the IFA technology conference in Berlin this week and called it a 'compelling concept', although not quite ready for market, partly for the slight learning curve and the coffee-table-dominating sensor. The sensor is not likely to improve the appearance of your coffee table, but it might make a good talking point ... unless there's something worth watching instead New ways of controlling the TV are beginning to overtake the old infra-red remotes that currently dominate the coffee table. Many TVs are not 'Smart-enabled', meaning they have in-built Freeview and Apps which can allow streaming from services such as Sky TV. A range of accessories also allow you to control your television from a smartphone. For those of a more active disposition, a Doctor Who-themed 'Sonic Screwdriver' TV remote is released this weekend, allowing you to gesticulate wildly at the television in the style of your favourite Doctor. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Chinese manufacturer Haier has introduced an Eye-Control TV that allows users to switch channels, adjust volume, and power the television off with their eyes.

Choosing in-season fruits and vegetables, local produce, less meat and foods that are grown with fewer pesticides can make your impact on the Earth a bit lighter. Keeping track of all the information you need to make the right choices can be a bit overwhelming, but these seven mobile apps store all you need to know in your pocket. Be sure to let us know in the comments which apps you found most helpful or what you plan to do start eating environmentally friendly. Nobody wants to destroy ecosystems when they go out for sushi, but trying to factor in where each species of fish was caught, what region it comes from, or how it was farmed can seem like a full-time job when picking where to eat. The people who do, in fact, dedicate themselves to full-time study of the planet’s water systems have mercifully created an iPhone app and mobile site to provide a guide for your seafood decisions. Search fish by name for the best choice (salmon, for instance, should be wild-caught in Alaska), good alternatives (wild-caught in Washington), and what to avoid (farmed, Atlantic-caught or wild-caught in California), and reference a best practice guide for your region. On Tuesday, the aquarium also added a new “Project FishMap” component to the app that helps you share restaurants and markets you’ve found that sell sustainable seafood. Eventually, the crowdsourced map will be a resource for finding ocean-friendly seafood wherever you are. The modern-day grocery store has created a problem that would have been absurd to our ancestors. With produce being shipped from all over the world, it’s difficult to tell what is actually in season near you. Locavore (2.99) tells you what is currently in season in your region so that you can make purchasing decisions that reduce your carbon footprint. It also provides recipes that use all in-season ingredients and shows you nearby farmers markets where you can buy those ingredients. If you connect the app to your FacebookFacebook account, you can share where you came across especially stellar local produce and read what other people near you have discovered. The jury is still out on the health and environmental impact of genetically modified food like the “botox apple,” but genetically modified (GMO) foods still go unlabeled and are difficult to avoid. The Center for Food Safety, which runs campaigns to halt the approval of GMO foods, has iPhoneiPhone and AndroidAndroid apps that help shoppers identify genetically modified food. The app gives the low-down on the approval statuses of GMO items in major food groups and highlights tips for avoiding GMO foods in general. As the title indicates, this app from the Pesticide Action Network helps you figure out what pesticides are on your food before you buy it. According to the app, an apple has a potential 42 residues, for instance. The app comes with a helpful chart if you want to know which ones are neurotoxins, hormone disruptors, carcinogens, or developmental or reproductive toxins. Though by that point, you might already be standing in the organic section. Like the Locavore app, Seasons (1.99) helps consumers buy products that are in-season in their region. In addition to fruits and vegetables, it also keeps track of herbs, nuts and mushrooms broken down by whether they’re in-season, at the start of their season, at the end of their season or produced year-round in your area. Each food includes a graph that shows both import and local seasons. Because many consumers prefer environmentally conscious options when available, companies are eager to label their products as such. In some cases, however, the labels are more indicative of greenwashing than of reduced environmental impact. Shoppers can use Label Lookup to understand what 169 different green labels mean and how reliable they are. “GMO-Free,” for instance, is too vague to be reliable. “American Grassfed,” however, is thirdy-party verified and meets detailed standards. Whether or not you’re a vegetarian, reducing the amount of meat that you eat can reduce the impact your diet has on the environment. And it doesn’t need to be painful; you can easily find great vegan, vegetarian and vegetarian-friendly restaurants using mobile app VegOut (2.99). The app is powered by happycow.net, a vegetarian-friendly restaurant search engine with more than 13,000 listings around the world. It uses your location to show you the restaurants nearest you, but you can also search by zipcode if you’re planning to dine elsewhere. - 10 Free iPhone Apps to Help You Go Green for Earth Day - 10 Great iPhone Apps for Growing a Garden - 6 Essential Android Apps for Business Travel - 5 Excellent E-Card iPhone Apps - 10 Mobile Apps for Movie Addicts Image courtesy of iStockphotoiStockphoto, Jasmina007 What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This article talks about 7 mobile apps that can help you make environmentally friendly eating choices.

Article: Though there are about 400 languages from all over the world that are in danger of disappearing completely, Zoque-Ayapaneco, a native Mexican language is considered the most likely to become extinct, because the only two people in the world that speak it fluently do not talk to each other! And, it's not because they live in different countries, states or even villages. In fact, Manuel Segovia and Isidro Velazquez, both in their 70s, live within 500 yards of each other, in the village of Ayapa in the Southern Mexican State of Tabasco. They, however, refuse to communicate because they simply don't have much in common. Segovia is apparently a little flank in nature while Velazquez is described as shy. Segovia was at least able to talk in Zoque-Ayapanece with his brother until he passed away about 12 years ago, and still manages to practice it with his family, especially his son Manuel, who for the last five years has been trying to learn it and hopes to become fluent enough to teach it to the next generation. Velazquez on the other hand, has not been heard speaking in the language with anybody. The two men say the language used to be widely spoken in the village, but the younger generation _ it for fear of being laughed at, and it therefore began to die a slow death, as the elders passed away. Unless the two men get their acts together, the only way to hear the language will be to either listen to Manuel's not-so-fluent statement or see them talk in a documentary entitled \\"Lengua Muerta\\" (Dead Language) that is being filmed to capture Zoque Ayapaneco and 364 other native Mexican languages that are in a similar state. We sure hope Segovia and Velazquez soon find something common to talk about. Maybe the fact is that the language is dying and that they should start encouraging and teaching the next generation together.

We have the equation: -2271 * x + 88004 = -6151 * x - 51457 - 70059 First, let's combine the numbers on the right side of the equation (the -51457 and -70059). When you subtract 51457 and then subtract 70059 more, you get: -51457 - 70059 = -121516 Now our equation looks like this: -2271 * x + 88004 = -6151 * x - 121516 Next, we want to move the -6151 * x to the left side so that all the \\"x\\" terms are on one side. To do that, we'll add 6151 * x to both sides of the equation. So, -2271 * x + 6151 * x + 88004 = -121516 Combining the x terms on the left side, we get: 3880 * x + 88004 = -121516 Now, we need to get the \\"x\\" term all by itself. We'll start by getting rid of the 88004 on the left side. To do this, we'll subtract 88004 from both sides of the equation: 3880 * x = -121516 - 88004 Subtracting 88004 from -121516, we get: -121516 - 88004 = -209520 Now our equation is: 3880 * x = -209520 Last step! We need to find out what number x is. To do that, let's divide both sides of the equation by 3880: x = -209520 / 3880 Doing the division, we find out that: x = -54 So the answer to the problem is x = -54.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: When the news flitted across my screen that Alaskan newscaster Charlo Greene quit her job by saying “fuck it” on live TV, I winced in recognition. As someone who’s quit in a flamboyant way – and then compounded the drama by writing about quitting in both memoir and in fiction – I’ve spent a lot of time thinking: what might drive someone to that moment? Is it ever the right thing to do? The logical answer to the latter question seems pretty obvious: probably not. Not only did Greene hang all her co-workers out to dry, forcing them to scramble to cover for her as she got her moment of satisfaction, but she’s also marked herself as a loose cannon. She’s now someone who, in the most fundamental way, can’t be trusted as a teammate. It’s fun to quit, certainly, but would you ever want to be the next person to hire a quitter? On the other hand, sometimes quitting is the only appropriate response: when an employer’s in the wrong, say, or when you have a valid point to make and you need to make it in a very public way. Other times, it’s the right thing to do for more complicated reasons. Quitting can show coworkers or colleagues who don’t quite have the gumption to get out of obviously bad situations that it can be done; it can inspire others to have the courage to change their lot, maybe in less brazen, more incremental ways. Maybe that’s why we’re so fascinated by people who say “fuck it”: they speak to the tiny part of all of us that wishes we could say be so honest and so irresponsible in any number of situations, any number of times a day. But refusing to give in to those impulses is what keeps society functioning, and what makes us – as individuals – adults. In 2007, I quit my job at Gawker – which was then a New York-specific media gossip site – by essentially saying “fuck it”. I said it far less succinctly than Greene did, though, in a long, digressive blog post in which I echoed concerns raised by a piece that had recently run in the magazine n+1: that Gawker, once a useful gadfly that irritated the powerful, had become a bully more powerful than the institutions it mocked. I then compounded the faux pas of quitting that way by running my mouth off to anyone who asked: media reporters whose work I’d been in the business of shredding were only too willing to mock my hasty, immature decision. (It’s taken my former boss, the site co-founder Nick Denton, many years to forgive me – though, actually, I’m still not quite sure he has. But then, I’ve also never quite apologized, and I’m not exactly apologizing now.) Looking back, it’s easy for me to view my fuck-it moment as a rookie mistake – the kind of thing only a 26-year-old who doesn’t understand that actions have consequences would do. I wanted to make a big ideological point, and I had but one weapon in my arsenal: a pulpit that I could use to denounce the very thing that had given me a voice. Unfortunately, I lost that weapon as soon as I used it, like a bee that dies in the act of stinging. I don’t know that I would have quit if I’d understood then how much it would deform the next few years of my life. I succeeded on my own terms as a freelancer and an author, but I also failed to secure any of the steady, full-time, paycheck-y gigs that every writer (save maybe Edward St Aubyn) needs. The reason? Well, if I had to guess, it was that no one was quite prepared to trust me. It took years before I worked another full-time job. I hope that Charlo Greene is enjoying her new, more self-determined career path, and that she isn’t listening to the people who are questioning her decision, after her on-air performance inevitably went as viral as it did on Monday. We don’t know exactly what Greene’s workplace was like, or the other choices that were available to her. We can guess at her motivations, but it’s probably good to recognize that we’re inevitably projecting our own workplace neuroses onto someone we really don’t know much about at all. Hopefully, she’s listening to the people who find her inspiring and liberating, and not to the people who put her down for being “unprofessional”. The satisfaction of quitting is real, but it’s fleeting. More lasting satisfaction comes from slowly, painstakingly creating a career path that lets you be true to yourself, whether you’re a pot-loving activist or a writer with various axes to grind. But I also hope that she’ll find her way, as I’ve tried to do, towards a different kind of future – one where she gets the kind of work that doesn’t make her want to say “fuck it” every day. Because we all want to say it; we just shouldn’t have to. ||||| Early in the evening of the day I became Facebook friends with James Frey, Choire and I found ourselves standing on Chrystie Street, unloading boxes of n+1's Winter 2008 issue (\\"Mainstream\\") from a very large Budget rental truck. We did this in a fit of perversity. n+1 editor Keith Gessen had driven the truck from the Ingram warehouse in Pennsylvania earlier in the day, accompanied by an n+1 intern that he'd been \\"mentoring.\\" There were six pallets. As usual, the issue's contributors had been invited to the box-unloading party, and so we staggered, box-laden, past the likes of little Ben Kunkel, wearing his noticeably-heeled boots even for this athletic activity. Probably more people came later for the beer-drinking part of the evening. But we missed that part because, when the truck was fully unloaded, we hopped into it with Keith to return it to the Budget lot in Brooklyn. On the way there, Keith turned up a narrow street and smashed a taillight and a bit of the back end of a minivan that would turn out to belong to an Orthodox Jewish lawyer. Keith handled himself remarkably well in this crisis, though he did later blame the accident on me: \\"You make me nervous,\\" he said, his voice getting high-pitched and muppety for a second. At the time of the accident we'd been talking about Keith's book \\"All The Sad Young Literary Men,\\" which Viking will publish in April. Jonathan Franzen had said that reading Keith's book made him wish to be a young man again. And last night, Choire quoted a friend of his who's reading a galley of the book as saying that the book was a cautionary tale. [The friend had written: \\"I just started reading Keith Gessen's novel — irritating of course, it's the n+1 world, where women are mere accessories, but not bad! But SUCH a cautionary tale.... To me it's screaming *Get out of NY before it's too late*!!! Or, shrink your life in NY... stop going to all those lame competitive parties. Look, I always liked Sloane Crosley too, but when the fact that she is *nice* is the subject of an Observer article, that is a culture in deep, deep decline.\\"] Keith didn't understand how the book could be a cautionary tale. Not having read the book, it's impossible to say with any certainty whether it would make me want to be a young man or whether it would make me want to leave New York. While Keith was writing a note for the minivan's owner, I had time to flip through n+1 issue 8. In it, Wesley Yang writes about Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho, and of other \\"essentially unlovable\\" people, including himself: Jasper once told me that I was \\"essentially unloveable.\\" I've always held that observation close to my heart, turning to it often. It's true of some people—that there's no reason anyone should love or care about them, because they aren't appealing on the outside, and that once you dig into the real person beneath the shell (if, for some obscure if not actively perverse reason, you bother), you find the real inner ugliness. Identifying with a serial killer is uncomfortable, maybe as uncomfortable as identifying with the pretty girls who rejected his advances. The essay puts its reader in both roles. Wesley's refusal to shy away from the kind of \\"rude question\\" that \\"affects to inquire into what everyone gets to know at the cost of forever leaving it unspoken\\" makes 'The Face of Seung-Hui Cho' an exercise in revolutionary honesty. In the Budget truck, I also had time to read most of Carla Blumenkranz's review, 'In Search of Gawker.' Carla went back into the Gawker archives to trace the site's evolution from Elizabeth Spiers' first post in 2002 to the decadent Gawker of today. \\"Reading through the early Gawker archives means watching Spiers receive and record her New York education,\\" Carla writes, also observing that \\"her persona was part of her appeal,\\" while the site's next editor Choire Sicha's appeal was that he was \\"almost impersonally sharp and cruel and correct.\\" \\"Sicha's persona did not change much during his time at Gawker, but he did reveal himself to be invested, in a strange way, in the integrity of Gawker as an institution,\\" Carla goes on to say. It's hard not to be invested in the integrity of an institution that you are, to some extent, the public face of. Yes, also it's just a job, it's just a business. Right now, it's a business that is fairly hell-bent on increasing pageviews in light of the allegedly coming internet advertising downturn—whether that means that content is a tertiary concern after pageview-boosting commenter-friending features and sponsored contests. And still when you work here, Gawker is, to some extent, you. Carla also wrote: No one ever said Nick Denton was an altruist. But it's important to note that Gawker Media was designed to compete with the corporations that Gawker abused from the sidelines, because this is what created the dissonance of the site's later years....It was the writers, from Elizabeth Spiers to Emily Gould, who sold Denton's cynical project to his cynical audience, on the strength of their authentic interest in the material.... The old (and also accurately self-parodied) idea of Gawker as a necessary corrective to the reams of fawning, vapid, toothless celebrity profiles and trend pieces published every day has faded also as many of the media outlets Gawker used to mock have adopted its jaded style, if not its substance. \\"The status of Gawker rose as the overall status of its subjects declined, and it was this that made Gawker appear at times a reprehensible bully,\\" she wrote. And finally: In early 2007, Choire Sicha—the outsider, the non-careerist, the one who had known restraint, whose parody of journalism had retained some memory of journalism's ethics—returned from the Observer to save Gawker. But it was too late. That is, at least, overblown. Didn't he do it for the money, actually? Yes. Yes he did. Keith finished his note to the minivan-owner and, with Choire behind the truck waving his arms in an impersonation of usefulness, backed the truck out of the too-narrow street. Later Keith asked me what I thought about Carla's essay and I said that I didn't really think she was wrong about anything, except that Jessica Coen had not \\"grown up in Los Angeles.\\" By then we were standing high on the F train elevated platform at Smith and 9th Streets. The Statue of Liberty looked like a little dashboard adornment beyond the B.Q.E. I took a phone call and when I got back, Choire had told Keith he was quitting Gawker. \\"Yup, we're quitting!\\" I said. \\"Because of this?\\" Keith asked. \\"Sort of. Well, not because it was written. But because it's not untrue.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"This news article talks about a lady named Charlo Greene, who used to be a news person on TV.

Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs. Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.\\"?

What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"A: The first step of the process is known as Inhalation or Breathing In. Here is a detailed explanation of the entire process: 1. Inhalation (Breathing In): This is the first step in the process of respiration. Inhalation occurs when we take in fresh air containing oxygen from the environment into our body. It starts with the diaphragm muscle (located below the lungs) and the intercostal muscles (located between the ribs) contracting, which results in the expansion of the chest cavity and a decrease in pressure. This pressure difference causes air to move into the lungs through the nose or mouth, passing through the pharynx and larynx. 2. Air travels down the trachea: Once the air enters the respiratory system, it travels down the trachea (windpipe) which is a tube that connects the upper respiratory system to the lower respiratory system. The trachea is lined with mucus and tiny hair-like structures called cilia that help filter out dust, bacteria, and other unwanted particles. 3. Air goes down the bronchi and bronchioles: The trachea splits into two main branches known as the left and right bronchi, which further divide into smaller tubes called bronchioles. These bronchioles continue to branch and become smaller until they finally end in tiny air sacs called alveoli. 4. Gas exchange in the alveoli: Inside the alveoli, oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses through the thin walls of the alveoli and capillaries and enters the red blood cells in the bloodstream. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide (a waste product of cellular respiration) diffuses from the bloodstream into the alveoli. 5. Oxygen transport by the circulatory system: The oxygenated blood is then transported by the red blood cells throughout the body via the circulatory system. It reaches cells and tissues where the oxygen is used for cellular respiration – a process that generates energy for the cells to function. 6. Exhalation (Breathing Out): After the oxygen is used by the cells, the carbon dioxide produced as a waste product needs to be removed from the body. The carbon dioxide-rich blood returns to the lungs, where it releases the carbon dioxide into the alveoli. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, which in turn causes the chest cavity to shrink and increase the pressure inside the lungs. This pressure difference forces the air containing the carbon dioxide to be expelled from the body through the mouth or nose during exhalation. In summary, the first step of the process is inhalation, where fresh air containing oxygen is taken in from the environment. This is followed by the air traveling through the respiratory system, gas exchange occurring in the alveoli, and oxygen being transported to the cells. Finally, the process ends with exhalation, where carbon dioxide is expelled from the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Can you imagine a world without the Internet?It's surprising to think about it Now,China has more than 162 million Internet users,according to the China Internet Network Information Center. This is the second highest number of user in the world after the United States. Today,66% of Chinese \\"netizens \\"are teenagers. \\"They spend about thirteen hours every week online,\\"said Qian Hulin,an Internet expert . Doctor Song in Beijing Xuanwu Hospital said about 14% of Chinese netizens who are teens often lasted over ten hours to play online games. The main reasons why teenagers surf the Web are to search for information,to communicate with others and to have fun. On the Internet,teenagers can find out almost everything. And surfing the Web can help students with their homework and widen their knowledge. Li Dong,a teacher at No. 41 Middle School in Shijiazhuang,likes her students to use the Internet. \\"When we talk in class,students who surf the Net usually know more background information than the others,\\"she said.

B) Going to see them. C) Writing a letter to them. D) Sending emails to them. Answer:","completion":"D) Sending emails to them. In a world without the Internet, the way we communicate, find information, and entertain ourselves would be vastly different. Before the advent of the Internet, people relied on traditional means of communication such as face-to-face conversations, phone calls, and handwritten letters to stay in touch with friends and family. The exchange of information was much slower and less convenient compared to today's digital age. Considering the statistics provided on China's Internet users, it is clear that a significant portion of the population relies on the World Wide Web for various activities. Today’s generation of Chinese teenagers, who are actively using the Internet, spends an average of thirteen hours a week online. This clearly shows the role the Internet plays in their lives, allowing them to search for information, communicate with others, and have fun. Dr. Song's observation of teenagers spending more than ten hours playing online games highlights the Internet's function as an entertainment platform. Moreover, the benefits of the Internet also extend to educational arenas. Teacher Li Dong's statement about how students who surf the Net have more background knowledge indicates that the Internet can be an invaluable learning tool. In addition to its educational benefits, the Internet also enables cheap and quick communication with friends far away. Among the various ways to stay in touch with friends, such as making a phone call, visiting in person, or writing a letter, sending emails stands out as the most cost-effective and efficient method. This virtual form of communication not only saves time and money on phone bills and postage stamps but also provides instantaneous connections allowing users to send and receive messages almost instantly. In conclusion, if we were to imagine a world without the Internet, our communication would be slower, and the process of obtaining information would be much less efficient. The traditional ways of staying in touch with friends and learning about them, like phone calls or writing letters, are more time-consuming and expensive than sending emails. Therefore, in a world with the Internet, sending emails is the cheapest and quickest way to learn about friends far away."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The left side of the equation has two terms with the variable u: -139*u and 142*u. -139*u + 142*u = (142 - 139)*u = 3*u Now the equation is: 3*u = -15 Step 2: Solve for u by isolating the variable. To isolate u, we need to get rid of the coefficient (3) that is multiplying the variable. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3. (3*u) / 3 = (-15) / 3 The left side simplifies to u since (3*u) / 3 = u: u = -15 / 3 Step 3: Simplify the right side of the equation.

Initially it was known as Bodhisattvayāna (the \\"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas\\"). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools.

Given the below context: On hearing that her husband, the Emperor Claudius, has died in a storm at sea, Agrippina plots to secure the throne for Nero, her son by a previous marriage. Nero is unenthusiastic about this project, but consents to his mother's wishes (\\"Con saggio tuo consiglio\\"). Agrippina obtains the support of her two freedmen, Pallas and Narcissus, who hail Nero as the new Emperor before the Senate. With the Senate's assent, Agrippina and Nero begin to ascend the throne, but the ceremony is interrupted by the entrance of Claudius's servant Lesbus. He announces that his master is alive (\\"Allegrezza! Claudio giunge!\\"), saved from death by Otho, the commander of the army. Otho himself confirms this and reveals that Claudius has promised him the throne as a mark of gratitude. Agrippina is frustrated, until Otho secretly confides to her that he loves the beautiful Poppaea more than he desires the throne. Agrippina, aware that Claudius also loves Poppaea, sees a new opportunity of furthering her ambitions for Nero. She goes to Poppaea and tells her, falsely, that Otho has struck a bargain with Claudius whereby he, Otho, gains the throne but gives Poppaea to Claudius. Agrippina advises Poppaea to turn the tables on Otho by telling the Emperor that Otho has ordered her to refuse Claudius's attentions. This, Agrippina believes, will make Claudius revoke his promise to Otho of the throne. Poppaea believes Agrippina. When Claudius arrives at Poppaea's house she denounces what she believes is Otho's treachery.

Since no options were provided, I will evaluate two common ingredients: baby-safe soap and an essential oil. Option 1: Baby-safe soap Step 1: Assess the purpose of adding baby-safe soap to reusable baby wipes - Baby-safe soap is gentle on a baby's sensitive skin while providing a cleaning effect. - It helps remove dirt, grime, and any remnants on the baby's skin. Step 2: Evaluate safety concerns - Baby-safe soap is specially formulated with a mild balance of ingredients to make sure it doesn't cause any issues for the baby's skin. - It is typically free from harsh chemicals and fragrances, reducing the risk of irritation. Step 3: Consider the convenience - Baby-safe soap is readily available in stores and can be easily mixed with water. Option 2: Essential oil Step 1: Assess the purpose of adding essential oil to reusable baby wipes - Essential oils can provide a pleasant smell and have some known antibacterial properties. - However, not all essential oils are safe for use on baby's skin. Step 2: Evaluate safety concerns - Some essential oils can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in babies, even when diluted. - It is important to research and choose baby-safe oils and dilute them properly before adding them to the baby wipes. Step 3: Consider the convenience - Essential oils need to be used with caution, and care must be taken to acquire baby-safe oils and understand the proper dilution ratios. After evaluating both options: Option 1: Baby-safe soap appears to be the better solution because it is designed specifically for a baby's sensitive skin, provides a cleaning effect, and is readily available. Option 2: Essential oil might be a good addition for its scent and antibacterial properties; however, it requires more caution and research to ensure proper use and safety for the baby. In conclusion, adding baby-safe soap to your reusable baby wipes is a safer and more convenient solution to achieve your goal of providing a gentle cleaning effect for your baby's skin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What part of the church did Nikolova consider unsuitable for the baptism? The rectangular narthex constitutes the middle part of the building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the lobby of the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.Together with the north and south wall, the entrance of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.Measuring 5 m × 9.50 m (16.4 ft × 31.2 ft), the narthex is the part of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach 3 m (9.8 ft). Its two turrets have a diameter of 3.20 m (10.5 ft); each has an entrance facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret. There are two pairs of columns inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is accessible from the north tower. The columns divide the narthex into three naves and mark the way from the narthex entrance to the gates of the rotunda.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: \\"If you run for more than five minutes at any time, you might need a pair of running shoes.\\" Advises Stephen Pribut, a US sports expert. Running shoes are highly technical footwear. The provide stability while bearing up to three times the wearer's body weight. But it's not easy to find the right pair. Finding the right running shoes is something of an art, or a science and a feel. The science part begins with the shape of the arch of your foot, which anyone can find out at home with this quick experiment: Put your foot in water and place it on a piece of brown paper. If you see a \\"C\\" shape on the paper when you remove your foot, you have a rare high arch. If the shape looks more like a rectangle, that means you have flat feet. See something in between? That's a normal arch. Conveniently for shoppers, shoe companies nowadays divide their shoes in three categories: neutral ( for high arches), stability ( for normal or low arches) and motion control (for flat arches). So you'll know which type suits you. At this point, most people would just grab an appealing shoe and try it on, But professionals would do a few quality-control tests. First, you bend the shoe toe to heel to see where it bends. If it's not at the forefoot---where the foot actually be bends, be afraid. Then you grip both ends and twist in opposite directions. If you can twist it like a tower, it means there's zero support. Finally, you squeeze he heel in both directions. A stable heel won't _ . Now you need to check the mold that shapes the inside of the shoe: whether its wide or narrow in the mid-foot, how it sits on the heel and how roomy the toe box is. It's wise to make the shoe purchase in the late afternoon, to allow for any swelling that your feet do throughout the day. Toes also decide sizing choices. The rule is that you need a finger's width from your longest toe (whether that's your big one or not) to the end of the shoe.

Article: Today, home-ownership has reached extremely high levels. Modern generations tend to believe there is something wrong with them if they rent. However, is high home-ownership really as rosy as people imagine? Staring at data first, we realize that the most successful, stable, attractive country in the Western world is Switzerland. It has tiny unemployment; wealth; high happiness and mental-health scores. Does it have high home-ownership rates? Absolutely not. In Switzerland, about seven in ten of the population are renters. Yet, with Europe's lowest home-ownership rate, the nation thrives. Now go to the other end of the misery distribution. Spain has approximately the highest home-ownership rate in Europe (at more than 80%). But one-quarter of its population are unemployed. A likely reason is that high levels of home-ownership mess up the labour market. In a sensibly functioning economy it is easy for people to move around to drop into the vibrant job slots thrown up by technological change. With a high degree of owner-occupation, everything slows. Folk get stuck. Renters can go to new jobs. In that way they do the economy a favour. As Friedman said, the rate of unemployment depends on the flexibility of the housing market. Next we come to economic breakdown. Most analysts accept that at heart it was the housing market--obsessive pursuit of homes, the engendered mortgage lending and an unavoidable house-price crash--that sank the Western world.

Let's begin with Venezuela. Step 1: Find the main imports and exports of Venezuela After researching, I found that Venezuela's main exports are petroleum, refined petroleum products, and gold. Its main imports include medicine, vehicles, machinery, electronics, and food. Now let's compare Venezuela's industry with Haiti's and Peru's: Step 2: Compare the industries of Venezuela and Haiti Venezuela has vast oil reserves and relies heavily on its oil exports. In contrast, Haiti has a weaker economy and limited natural resources. Haiti's main industries include agriculture, textiles, and construction materials. Thus, there is a significant difference between the industries of Venezuela and Haiti. Step 3: Compare the industries of Venezuela and Peru Peru's main industries include mining (such as copper, silver, gold, and zinc), agriculture, and textiles. Although both Venezuela and Peru have natural resources, their industries differ since Peru has a more varied economy and does not rely solely on oil exports. Now to determine if the two questions are the same: Question 1: What are the main imports and exports of Venezuela, and how does Venezuela's industry compare to Haiti's? Question 2: What are the main imports and exports of Venezuela, and how does Venezuela's industry compare to Peru's? These questions are similar, as they both ask about Venezuela's main imports and exports and compare its industry with another country.

Jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis, but he is unsure what can be done about it. Just then, the gods see a swarm of mortals ascending the mountain and withdraw to observe them from a distance. Thespis's acting company enters for a picnic celebrating the marriage of two of its members, Sparkeion and Nicemis.

In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with her old suitor, Thespis, but he declines to flirt back. Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages, or he will lose his authority. Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter. All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis. Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did the Republican National Committee set up the website lyincomey.com?

In mid-2012, The Wiggles announced that Page, Fatt, and Cook would be retiring from touring with the group; Emma Watkins, the first female member of The Wiggles, replaced Page, Lachlan Gillespie replaced Fatt, and Simon Pryce, who was initially supposed to replace Page in August, replaced Cook. Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children. According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\". Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter. Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed. Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce. The new members, like Moran, who was not approached to return, were salaried employees.The group, for their farewell tour, visited 8 countries and 141 cities, for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640,000 people.

They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft. The next morning, Stacy sees a tendril of vine has crept into a wound on her leg. The vines have also wrapped themselves around Mathias's lower legs and eaten them down to the bone. Eric and Jeff are barely able to remove the vines from Stacy but cannot get them off of Mathias.

Young undocumented immigrants seeking permanent status in the United States received an unexpected boost Thursday on Capitol Hill as a small group of House Republicans mounted a last-minute effort to bring up an immigration vote in Congress. The group of eight Republicans — some freed from political considerations by upcoming retirements and others facing tough re-elections races — defied their own party leadership, quickly persuading 10 more Republicans to sign on to a petition that would force debate on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. With all 193 Democrats expected to sign on, Republicans will have to persuade just seven more members of their own party to join the petition to trigger a vote on several immigration bills on the House floor. But Republican leadership said the effort would be wasted if the end result is a presidential veto. \\"I think it's important for us to come up with a solution that the president can support,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday. These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action. \\"It's better to use the legislative process,\\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. But that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year. The growing group of House Republicans are joining Democratic colleagues who have long criticized Ryan for not bringing immigration bills up for a vote. \\"This is about making sure we're not consolidating power in the White House,\\" said Representative Mia Love, a Republican from Utah and one of the first lawmakers to sign petition. The immigration issue had all but died after an effort to pass a DACA fix collapsed in the U.S. Senate earlier this year. The program has been the focus of fierce negotiations on Capitol Hill since last September, when President Donald Trump announced he was ending the 2012 Obama-era program and called for a legislative fix.

Information: - Modern rock is an umbrella term describing rock made from the 1980s to present day. Some radio stations use the term to distinguish themselves from classic rock, which tend more towards 1960s-1980s rock music. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - \`\` Through the Iris '' is a single released by alternative rock / metal band 10 Years in 2006 . It is the second single released and track 8 from their first major release , The Autumn Effect . It was released for radio only , as there was no CD single . Like the previous single , the song was also originally released on Killing All That Holds You , the band 's second independent album , produced by Travis Wyrick . The album was eventually reissued with four acoustic tracks . The acoustic tracks were recorded live by Mike D. for Lakeside Studios . It was track 2 and clocked in at 3:23 . - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - The Autumn Effect is the third studio album by the Tennessee rock band 10 Years. Produced by Josh Abraham, released on August 16, 2005 through Universal Records and Republic Records. Featured on the album is the popular modern rock track \\"Wasteland\\" and two other singles, \\"Through the Iris\\" and \\"Waking Up\\". - Josh Abraham is an American record producer, songwriter, and music executive. Having worked with some of the music industry's most successful artists over the past 15 years including P!nk, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Kelly Clarkson, Shakira, Weezer, Linkin Park, Velvet Revolver, Carly Rae Jepsen, Adam Lambert, and Slayer, he has produced and co-written songs accounting for sales of more than 40 million albums worldwide. - Independent music (often shortened to indie music or indie) is music produced independently from major commercial record labels or their subsidiaries, a process that may include an autonomous, do-it-yourself approach to recording and publishing. The term \\"indie\\" is sometimes also used to describe a genre (such as indie rock and indie pop); as a genre term, \\"indie\\" may include music that is not independently produced, and most independent music artists do not fall into a single, defined musical style or genre, and usually create music that can be categorized into other genres. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Republic Records is an American record company that operates as a division of Universal Music Group. The label was endowed by Monte Lipman and Avery Lipman in 1995; it was later paired into the Universal Motown Republic Group in 1999. After the separation of Motown Records from Universal Motown Records, the Universal Motown Republic Group was shuttered, the label was temporarily reincarnated as Universal Republic Records in 2006, until it was revived in late 2012. The label's main offices are located in New York City, New York, United States, other offices of the record label are located at the Interscope Center in Santa Monica, California, U.S. - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.

Known for their nutritional value and versatility, beans are an excellent source of protein, fiber, and other essential minerals. From salads and stews to casseroles and dips, beans can be incorporated into countless dishes. However, the key to turning beans into a rich and tantalizing meal lies in how you cook and flavor them. In this article, we'll explore some simple, yet effective ways to add flavor to your beans, and create diverse bean dishes you'll keep coming back to. Step 1: Boil the beans with flavorful additions To truly elevate the taste of your beans, it is essential to add some extra flavors to the pot during the boiling phase. Consider adding ingredients like garlic cloves, onion quarters, bay leaves, or even a few dashes of your favorite spices such as cumin or paprika. These aromatic ingredients infuse the beans with flavor as they cook, resulting in a richer, more nuanced dish. Step 2: Incorporate additional vegetables Adding vegetables to your bean dish not only enhances the flavor but also boosts the nutritional value of the meal. Vegetables like bell peppers, carrots, celery, tomatoes, and zucchini perfectly complement beans in dishes like chili, bean salads, and casseroles, creating a well-balanced and satisfying meal. Be sure to saute or roast the vegetables before adding them to the pot to release their natural flavors and maximize their contribution to the dish. Step 3: Substitute stock for bean liquid While traditional bean recipes often call for water or the bean cooking liquid, using chicken, vegetable, or beef stock can significantly enhance the overall flavor of the dish. The stock provides a rich, savory base for your beans, and infuses them with depth and complexity. Consider using homemade stock or a quality store-bought alternative to fully capitalize on this flavor booster. Step 4: Experiment with international variations One of the unique qualities of beans is their adaptability to a wide range of cuisines and flavor profiles. For instance, try giving your refried beans an Italian twist by using white beans like cannellini or Great Northern beans. Mash the beans and mix them with garlic, olive oil, and finely chopped fresh sage for a delicious and unique side dish or spread. Step 5: Utilize a slow cooker A slow cooker is an exceptional appliance for creating flavorful bean dishes. Not only does it tenderize the beans and meld the flavors over an extended period, but it also allows for a hands-off approach to cooking. Simply add ingredients to the slow cooker, turn it on, and let it do its magic while you go about your day. When dinner time rolls around, you'll have a delectable bean dish ready to serve. Conclusion Transforming beans from a bland, monotonous ingredient to a scrumptious, mouthwatering dish is all about introducing flavors and techniques that enhance and complement the beans. By following these simple tips and experimenting with different flavor profiles and cooking methods, you can create bean dishes that are anything but boring. So, go ahead and start enriching your meals with flavorful, versatile bean creations that you and your family will undoubtedly love."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: - USATODAY.com Next time you're inching your way through the line at the airport security checkpoint, take a look around. Do the plastic bins where people plop their laptops, carry-on bags and shoes look worn and industrial gray or do they look crisp, white and new? At the majority of the more than 400 U.S. airports, the checkpoints are stocked with the generic, government-issued gray bins. They're boring, yes, but they do what the TSA needs them to do: contain your stuff as it sits on the belt that passes through the x-ray machine. But the checkpoints at more than two dozen airports have those crisp, white bins. In those airports the bins do not only what the TSA needs them to do, they also save the TSA time and money. And because there are advertisements inside these bins, they generate income for the airports. Not bad for a bunch of recyclable plastic. The advertisement-bearing bins are the brainchild of Joe Ambrefe, CEO of Security Point Media (SPM), who came up with the idea not long after 9/11 while standing in a long line at an airport security checkpoint. He realized everyone had to grab a bin and that an advertisement inside each bin was a sure-fire way for a company to reach the desirable demographic of business and leisure travelers. 1.

Houston Bush Intercontinental Airport25. Houston Hobby Airport26. Miami International Airport Ambrefe worked up a plan to provide free bins (and carts to move those bins around) in exchange for the right to sell advertisements on the bins. He chose white bins because \\"color is an emotive issue and white is a happier color than industrial gray.\\" He also promised to replace the bins every 90 days with brand new units so that \\"the components are opening-day fresh all the time.\\" Testing began in 2007 and now the Bin Advertising Program is in operation at Orlando, San Diego, Seattle-Tacoma, JFK, LaGuardia and 21 other airports nationwide and is approved by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for all airports. The TSA likes the program because it saves the agency money: The free bins represent an overall savings of between 200,000 and 700,000 on the costs of replacing bins. And TSA spokesperson Greg Soule said the program also \\"reduced injuries associated with lifting bins and improved durability and aesthetics of the checkpoint equipment.\\" Airports like the program because it generates a bit of extra money and helps improve the checkpoint experience for passengers. At Los Angeles International Airport, one of the program's first test sites, spokesperson Nancy Castles says ad revenues helped purchase \\"the long tables, seating, floor mats, wheeled bin carriers, stanchions and other equipment that helps streamline the TSA passenger security screening process.\\" The airport also gets to place its own advertising in some of the bins and is currently promoting its LAX FlyAway bus service. At Nashville International, an early test airport which officially signed up with the program in 2010, spokesperson Emily Richard said, \\"We have experienced significant and consistent improvement of the appearance of the checkpoint since SPM started managing the process.\\" She added that year-to-date income from the program is 7,500. And in Houston, where the Hobby and George Bush Intercontinental airports joined the program in June, Houston Airport System's concessions manager Randy Goodman described the benefits as \\"bright new bins and a streamlined process,\\" and a share of the advertising income that should net the airport about 26,000 for the first six months. Ambrefe hopes to expand the bin advertising program to other airports and continues to tweak the system. He said that while the company has not considered providing separate bins for shoes - a suggestion put forth by some groups concerned about checkpoint health risks - \\"antimicrobial products for use at the checkpoints are in research.\\" In the meantime, both Ambrefe and the TSA might make note of the checkpoint procedures in place at Canada's Prince Rupert Airport, in northern British Columbia. The airport has color-coded bins for boots and shoes and, for the past 18 years, the security team has cleaned all the bins after each of the six daily flights. \\"It's nice to know that when you lay down your suit jacket or coat that the bin has not previously contained any dirty boots or other contaminated item,\\" said airport manager Richard Reed. \\"The bins are cleaned to protect the health of the screening agents and the traveling public,\\" said team leader Virginia Toro. \\"We treat the checkpoint as we do our home: clean is the rule of the day.\\" Harriet Baskas writes about travel etiquette for MSNBC.com and is the author of the airport guidebook Stuck at the Airport and a blog of the same name.

[+] The mother comforted the child.","completion":"The mother, upon hearing her child's painful cry, rushed to the living room with great concern. She saw her young toddler lying on the floor, tears streaming down his red cheeks. Immediately, she assessed the situation and realized that he had fallen from the chair. Her maternal instincts kicked in, and she knew she must comfort her precious child. She kneeled down beside him, scooping him up gently in her loving arms. As she held him, she started to soothingly pat his back, whispering calming words into his tiny ear. \\"It's okay, sweetheart. Mommy's here. You're going to be just fine,\\" she reassured him, trying to ease his pain and fear. As her comforting words and touch started to lessen the toddler's tears, she began to inspect his body for any injuries he might have sustained from the fall. Thankfully, there were no signs of any severe harm, but she knew that he might be feeling sore for a while. She decided that this presented an opportunity to teach her child about safety and responsibility. Holding him close, she took a moment to explain why it was important to be careful while climbing on furniture. \\"You know, my love, it's not safe to climb on chairs like that. We can easily hurt ourselves if we're not careful. We must always ask for help when we want to reach something,\\" she said in a gentle tone. The little boy, still snuggling in his mother's caring embrace, seemed to understand the message. His tears had subsided, and he appeared more at ease now. His mother gave him a tender kiss on his forehead and decided it was best to take a break from the kitchen to spend some quality time with her son. Together, they went to his playroom where they spent the next hour engaging in fun and educational activities, tailored to instill a sense of safety and responsibility in the little boy. With each lesson and game, the toddler gradually became more aware of the importance of taking precautions and asking for assistance when necessary. As the day went by, both the mother and her young son grew more in-sync, developing a stronger bond and understanding of one another. The experience of the fall and the lessons learned brought them closer, ensuring that the once seemingly traumatic event had become a teachable moment that positively impacted both their lives. In the end, the young toddler's fall from the chair wasn't just a fleeting moment of pain and distress; it was an opportunity for growth, understanding, and a reminder that sometimes, life's challenging moments can lead to precious lessons and deeper connections with those we love."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the missing first step of the following process: - The star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star - The star goes through a change in its core and bonds helium to carbon and oxygen - The star becomes a red giant - A mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star - The star sheds its outside layers and becomes a nebula - The star leaves behind the core which becomes a dwarf star. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the given process is: The star starts its life as a protostar, forming from a dense cloud of dust and gas in a nebula. To provide a more detailed explanation, let's go through the entire process with the missing step included: 1. The star begins its life as a protostar, forming from a dense cloud of dust and gas in a nebula. This cloud, mainly composed of hydrogen, starts contracting under its own gravity, becoming hotter and denser over time. As the temperature and pressure rise, nuclear reactions begin at the core of the protostar, marking the beginning of its life as a main-sequence (hydrogen-burning) star. 2. The star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star. This means that it is a low- to medium-mass star, typically less than 8 solar masses. Stars in this category do not undergo supernova explosions and instead follow a different evolutionary path leading to the formation of a white dwarf star. 3. The star goes through a change in its core and bonds helium to carbon and oxygen. This occurs when the hydrogen in the core is almost fully converted into helium, causing the core to contract and heat up. In turn, helium starts fusing into heavier elements like carbon and oxygen in a process known as helium burning. This phase marks the beginning of the star's ascent along the red giant branch. 4. The star becomes a red giant. As helium burning occurs in the core, the outer layers of the star expand and cool off, giving it a red appearance. This phase is characterized by the star's significant increase in size, which can reach as much as several hundred times its original diameter. 5. A mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star. With time, the core becomes richer in carbon and oxygen as the helium fusion continues. For stars with masses lower than about 4 solar masses, the fusion process stops at carbon and oxygen, as the core never becomes hot and dense enough to ignite carbon fusion. 6. The star sheds its outside layers and becomes a planetary nebula. As the red giant's core continues to contract, the outer layers of the star are gradually expelled into space, forming an expanding gas cloud known as a planetary nebula. This occurs due to intense stellar winds caused by the increased radiation pressure from the core. 7. The star leaves behind the core which becomes a white dwarf star. After shedding its outer layers, the exposed hot core is now a white dwarf star, mostly composed of carbon and oxygen. These compact, dense remnants are incredibly hot, but they gradually cool down and emit light over billions of years, eventually fading to black as black dwarfs. However, this cooling process takes such a long time that there are currently no known black dwarfs in the Universe. To summarize, the missing first step in the process is the formation of a star from a protostar in a nebula. This crucial step sets the stage for the entire subsequent stellar evolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - the ground - outside - park - ground - uzbekistan I believe the correct choice is \\"ground\\", here's why: A:","completion":"Apple trees drop their fruit primarily to the ground. This is because of the force of gravity that pulls objects downwards towards the surface of the Earth. When apples ripen, they often fall off the tree naturally, even without any external force like wind or human intervention. As the fruit matures, the cells in its stem weaken, and eventually, the weight of the apples causes the stem to break, dropping the apples to the ground. This is a part of the tree's reproductive process, as apple trees rely on the dispersal of seeds contained within the fruit to propagate. It is worth noting that the other options provided don't really make sense as answers to the question. \\"Outside,\\" \\"park,\\" and \\"Uzbekistan\\" are not direct explanations for where the fruit falls in relation to the tree itself.

Please write a short summary for the following article: NASA art exhibit surrounds you with the sounds of space Imagine what life is like for Earth-gazing satellites, which study the planet from above. They gather data on everything from the moisture of our soil to the intensity of mighty hurricanes. Day after day they orbit the planet, watching, recording and transmitting. These spacecraft lead a lonely, desolate life, with one major perk: the gorgeous view. NASA, a composer and an architect are trying to bring the Earth-orbiting satellite's experience down to the planet's surface with an art installation in New York City this weekend as part of the World Science Festival. The shell-shaped piece of art they created — made out of aluminum and called the NASA Orbit Pavilion — is designed to be acoustically ideal for groups of kids and adults standing in the middle of it for a five-minute sound show. The show is engineered to take listeners on a journey with the 20 NASA satellites studying Earth today. These kinds of art and education pieces provide an important source of inspiration for people who may not know much about NASA otherwise, Ellen Stofan, NASA's chief scientist, said. \\"Apollo inspired a whole generation of kids to go into engineering, math, science,\\" Stofan told Mashable in an interview at the exhibit. \\"They didn't end up all working for NASA, but I think NASA plays a really important inspirational role in getting kids to go into STEM subjects.\\" The exhibit starts with a rocket launch (as any proper space mission does). The dome of the shell shakes, and you can feel the reverberation of the sound in your bones, just like a real launch. The sound design then moves into a composition written by composer Shane Myrbeck that uses different kinds of sounds to represent the 20 satellites and the International Space Station as they orbit the planet. NASA's Orbit Pavilion from the outside. Image: Greg Kessler/World Science Festival Myrbeck used instruments like the piano and cello for land-studying satellites, while he used a blend of sounds from wind and glass instruments for atmosphere-observing probes, and water-derived noises for ocean-observing satellites The Space Station, which is an international project, is represented by vocal harmony. The vocals change throughout the composition because the people on the station change, Myrbeck said. \\"It sounds like an echo of a memory,\\" StudioKCA architect Jason Klimoski told Mashable. He designed the overall installation. \\"It's very lonely. The sounds are getting more and more space-like because they're more and more lonely. You think about these things way out in space listening — always listening — listening to the Earth, listening to the land.\\" After the musical interpretation of the satellites, the soundscape pivots again. People in the dome can then hear a voice call out the various names of NASA satellites — SMAP, Aqua, etc. — as they fly overhead and in every direction. Myrbeck, NASA's David Delgado and Dan Goods gather real-time data to sonically demonstrate where the satellites are in space at any given moment. The installation comes at a time when NASA's Earth science objectives have come under fire from members of Congress. Some congressional officials have said that NASA should focus on human and robotic exploration goals instead of Earth research because other government agencies, like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, are tasked with learning more about our home planet. But Stofan thinks that NASA is in a particularly unique position to observe Earth on a planet-wide scale, allowing them to focus on complex processes like global climate. \\"The Earth is a planet, and only NASA has the unique ability to study planets. The Earth needs to be studied as a planet because it's a very complex system. Other agencies focus on doing research here on the planet. NASA focuses on using the techniques, the tools and pushing the technology for studying our planet from space.\\" Perhaps NASA should erect the installation in Congress as an experiential lobbying project, because it certainly drives home the fact that the agency has a lot of assets in space that beam back data about Earth everyday. The exhibit is open in New York through Sunday, and might \\"resurface\\" again locally sometime this summer, according to the World Science Festival.

She accidentally causes all sorts of havoc with her Kryptonian-like powers until the Dark Knight exposes her to a piece of Kryptonite. With Superman's help, they discover that the girl is Kara Zor-El, the niece of Jor-El and Superman's biological cousin. While Superman welcomes Kara, teaches her English, and helps her adjust to Earth society, Batman remains suspicious. Tipped off by Batman, Wonder Woman and Lyla ambush Clark Kent and Kara in a park and take Kara to Themyscira, on the basis that only there can she learn to control her powers.

Here is a premise: What I'd like to know is how them bushwhackers knew jus' where to lay down an' wait for Oliveri.\\" Here is a hypothesis: It surprises me they were able to take down Oliveri. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis could also be true. If we break it down, we can analyze the components of the premise and the hypothesis to better understand this connection. Premise: \\"What I'd like to know is how them bushwhackers knew jus' where to lay down an' wait for Oliveri.\\" Hypothesis: \\"It surprises me they were able to take down Oliveri.\\" In the premise, the speaker is wondering how the bushwhackers were able to determine the precise location where they could lay an ambush for Oliveri. This implies that the bushwhackers had some knowledge or information about Oliveri's whereabouts, which they used strategically to carry out their plan. The premise suggests that the bushwhackers were successful at least in setting up an ambush, but it doesn't explicitly state whether they managed to take down Oliveri or not. The hypothesis involves the speaker's reaction to the bushwhackers' ability to take down Oliveri. It shows that the speaker is surprised by the outcome of the event. This could be because of multiple reasons, such as the speaker underestimating the bushwhackers' abilities, overestimating Oliveri's strength or protection, or simply not understanding how the bushwhackers managed to plan and execute their attack so well. Considering the premise and hypothesis, if we assume that the bushwhackers were able to lay the perfect ambush, which is directly implied in the premise, then it becomes more plausible that they could have successfully taken down Oliveri. The perfect ambush would give them a tactical advantage, allowing them to take their target by surprise and potentially leaving Oliveri with little chance to defend himself or escape the situation. However, it is important to note that the connection between the premise and the hypothesis is not a definitive one. While a well-executed ambush increases the likelihood of successfully taking down Oliveri, it does not guarantee it. There might be other factors, such as Oliveri's ability to defend himself, help from others, or even sheer luck, that could have helped Oliveri to survive the situation. So, even if the premise is true, it doesn't undeniably confirm the hypothesis. In conclusion, if the premise is true and the bushwhackers were indeed able to lay a perfect ambush for Oliveri, then it seems more likely that the hypothesis is true as well. While there is a connection between the two statements, it is not an absolute one. Instead, it merely increases the probability that if one statement is true, the other might be true as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Baby Leonidas is then inspected, having a six-pack, biceps, and beard from birth. He is accepted as a Spartan and prepared for kinghood through his childhood training, from fighting his grandmother to enduring torture. Leonidas (Sean Maguire) is then cast out into the wild, and survives the harsh winter while killing a giant dancing penguin.

Is \\"He did not have a separate cult, but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Who is the physician of the Gods in the Iliad?\\"","completion":"While the statement \\"He did not have a separate cult, but he was the personification of the holy magic-song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease\\" offers some insight into the concept of a divine healer in ancient Greece, it does not directly answer the question, \\"Who is the physician of the Gods in the Iliad?\\" A more comprehensive and informative response to the question would be: In the Iliad, the physician of the Gods is the Greek deity Paean (also spelled Paeon). Paean is not one of the central characters in the Iliad, but he is occasionally mentioned in connection with his divine healing abilities. As the physician of the Gods, Paean is responsible for providing them with medical aid when needed, such as during the midst of battles or other conflicts. In the epic poem, he is particularly noted for his role in tending to the wounds of both gods and mortals alike. It is important to note that Paean's role as the divine healer does not mean he possessed a separate cult dedicated to his worship. The cults in ancient Greece were primarily focused on gods who had more significant roles in mythology, such as Zeus, Hera, or Athena. However, Paean was still considered a highly important figure due to his ability to heal and provide relief to those in need. Paean was traditionally portrayed as a young and beautiful god, which symbolized his close association with youthfulness, vitality, and, ultimately, good health. Additionally, his divine prowess was often said to be personified through the magic-song or hymns sung by ancient Greek magicians and healers, which were believed to have the power to cure disease. These songs, typically performed during rituals, were passed down through generations and paid homage to Paean's expertise in the art of healing. In summary, Paean is the physician of the Gods in the Iliad, responsible for providing medical aid to divine and mortal beings in the epic. Though he did not have a separate cult dedicated to his worship, Paean's importance in ancient Greek society translates through the magic-song sung by magicians, which were believed to contain holy and restorative powers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When they go out to enjoy themselves, they can wear almost anything. At theatres , cinemas and concerts you can put on anything you like: from beautiful suits and dresses to jeans and sweaters. Anything goes, as long as you look clean and tidy. But in Britain, as well as in the US, men in offices usually wear suits and ties and women wear dresses or skirts (not trousers). Doctors and business people always wear quite formal clothes. And in some hotels and restaurants men have to wear ties and women have to wear tidy dresses. In many ways, Americans are less formal than British people, but they are more careful with their clothes. At home, most Americans wear informal or sports clothes. But when they go out in the evening, they like to look nice. In good hotels and restaurants, men have to wear jackets and ties, and women have to wear pretty clothes.

Choices: - decomposition energy - reaction energy - positive energy - activation energy A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Activation Energy. Activation energy is the amount of energy that is required to initiate a chemical reaction. It is a fundamental concept in chemistry and is expressed in joules per mole or kilojoules per mole. The term was first introduced by the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius in 1889. The concept of activation energy is related to the reaction rate, which is the speed at which a chemical reaction occurs. The higher the activation energy, the slower the chemical reaction, as more energy is required to overcome the energy barrier for the reaction to proceed. In contrast, if the activation energy is low, the reaction rate is high as the reaction can easily take place. In a chemical reaction, the reactants first have to be converted into an activated complex or transition state, which is a short-lived, high-energy, unstable state. The formation of this structure requires an input of energy which is the activation energy. This explains why you need to, for instance, heat a mixture to kick start a reaction: you are feeding in the activation energy. In many cases, a catalyst is used to decrease the activation energy of a reaction. By providing a different reaction pathway, catalysts reduce the energy required to reach the transition state, and hence increase the rate of the reaction. Catalysts are extensively used in the chemical industry and biochemistry. In our bodies, for instance, enzymes act as catalysts to allow biochemical reactions to proceed quickly at normal body temperature. While \\"decomposition energy\\", \\"reaction energy\\", and \\"positive energy\\" can be associated with chemical reactions in certain contexts, none of them refers specifically to the amount of energy required to start a reaction. Decomposition energy refers to the energy associated with the breakdown of a compound into its constituent elements. Reaction energy generally refers to the energy change in a chemical reaction, which can be exothermic (releases energy) or endothermic (absorbs energy). \\"Positive energy\\" is not a term commonly used in the field of chemistry. So, the answer again: the amount of energy required to begin a chemical reaction is known as Activation Energy."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

We're trying to find the value of \\"d\\". The equation looks a bit long but don't worry, we'll break it down. Here's the equation we'll solve: -106*d = 53*d - 402 - 11192 - 10348 First, let's add the numbers on the right side of the equation: -402 - 11192 - 10348 = -21942 (it's okay if the number is negative) Now, the equation looks like this: -106*d = 53*d - 21942 We want to get all the \\"d\\" terms on one side, so let's move the \\"53*d\\" from the right side to the left side by subtracting it: -106*d - 53*d = -21942 Now, add the \\"d\\" terms: -159*d = -21942 Next, we want to find the value of \\"d\\". To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -159: d = -21942 / -159 When we do the division, we get: d = 138 So, that's the answer! The value of \\"d\\" is 138.

FedEx to Acquire TNT Express for 4.8 Billion FedEx will acquire Dutch delivery giant TNT Express for 4.8 billion in an all-cash deal that will vastly expand the American company’s operations across Europe, the company revealed on Tuesday. “This transaction allows us to quickly broaden our portfolio of international transportation solutions to take advantage of market trends – especially the continuing growth of global e-commerce – and positions FedEx for greater long-term profitable growth,” CEO of FedEx Corp. Frederick Smith said in a public statement of the deal. TNT Express’ executive board unanimously agreed to the deal which will have FedEx purchase all shares of TNT at €8 (8.60) a share, but the deal will still have to pass a review from European anti-trust regulators before closing in early 2016. Regulators previously denied UPS a similar buyout deal for TNT in 2013. “FedEx and TNT Express are confident that anti-trust concerns, if any, can be addressed adequately in a timely fashion,” FedEx noted in a press statement.

Australia #39;s Prime Minister and the country #39;s main opposition leader say quot;trust quot; will be a key issue when voters go to the polls on October the ninth.","completion":"This statement is about the Australian federal elections held on October 9th, 2004. The two key figures mentioned here are the then-incumbent Prime Minister, John Howard of the Liberal Party, and the main opposition leader, Mark Latham of the Australian Labor Party. The central theme and focal point of the 2004 Australian federal election campaign was the issue of \\"trust.\\" In the run-up to the election, both John Howard and Mark Latham emphasized the importance of trust in their campaigns. They sought to convince Australian voters that their respective parties had the qualities necessary to guide the nation through a time of significant global and domestic challenges. John Howard, who was seeking his fourth term as prime minister, was keen on highlighting his experience and competence as a leader. Since first being elected in 1996, Howard successfully navigated Australia through a period of strong economic growth and low unemployment. Additionally, he played a significant role in strengthening Australia's alliances with important global partners, especially the United States, particularly as a strong supporter of U.S.-led initiatives in Afghanistan and Iraq. Throughout the campaign, Howard sought to portray himself as a trustworthy, experienced, and stable leader, well-versed in the complexities of foreign and domestic policies. Furthermore, he pointed to the achievements and consistency of his government as evidence of his party's ability to lead the nation effectively and ensure its national security and continued prosperity. On the other hand, Mark Latham, who had taken over as the leader of the Australian Labor Party in December 2003, was eager to present a fresh and viable alternative to Howard's government. Latham focused on a range of pressing issues, such as climate change, improving the public healthcare system, and investing in education and infrastructure. One of his key campaign promises was to withdraw Australian troops from Iraq. As the main opposition leader, Latham positioned himself as a passionate and energetic advocate for change, with a vision for a more inclusive, compassionate, and forward-looking Australia. He argued that the Howard government had become complacent and disconnected from the concerns of ordinary citizens, and sought to capitalize on voter fatigue with the incumbent. Latham centered his campaign on the notion that the Australian people could place their trust in him and his party to bring about meaningful, positive reforms in the national interest. In conclusion, the 2004 Australian federal elections were marked by an emphasis on the notion of trust as a key issue. Both the incumbent Prime Minister, John Howard, and the main opposition leader, Mark Latham, sought to highlight their respective qualities and visions as the basis for voters to place their trust in them. Ultimately, the election resulted in a victory for John Howard and the Liberal Party, securing another term in office and validating their claims of trustworthiness and competence in the eyes of the Australian electorate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, on the morning of his departure, he receives a mysterious letter signed by an unknown source. The letter contains only one line - \\"Where is Lecor flown to Memphis, Tennessee?\\" Intrigued by the cryptic message, Lecor decides to unearth the truth behind it. The plot thickens when Lecor arrives in Memphis to discover that the city is being plagued by a string of bizarre occurrences. A series of bank robberies, with the victims being left alive but in a state of temporary amnesia, have the police baffled. As he delves deeper into the story, Lecor finds himself uncovering a hidden world of crime and intrigue. The city's most prolific crime lord, Alastair King, orchestrates kidnappings, drug deals, and political machinations to control the city's underworld with an iron fist. Unbeknownst to Lecor, King is also intimately connected to the recent bank robberies. The amnesia suffered by those affected is the result of a groundbreaking technology designed to extract memories and information. While working his way through the seedy criminal underworld of Memphis, Lecor enlists the help of a rogue detective named Victoria Mitchell. The two quickly uncover that the cryptic letter Lecor received had been sent by a former victim of King's memory extraction technology in a desperate attempt to warn him about the dangers he faces in Memphis. As they investigate further, Lecor and Mitchell begin to unravel the truth behind the amnesiac bank robberies and the origin of the mysterious technology. They discover that King is using this technology to gather information that will allow him to exercise more significant control over the city's political and financial infrastructure, positioning himself to take over Memphis entirely. Together, the duo tenaciously pursue King and his network of criminals, capturing his right-hand man and decrypting information that leads them to King's secret lab, where the memory extraction technology is stored. The stakes are higher than ever when Lecor is captured and subjected to the memory extraction procedure by King himself. It's a race against time as Mitchell and her team work to rescue Lecor, dismantle the criminal network, and bring King to justice. With the help of his new allies, Lecor is saved from the memory extraction procedure, and King's operation is shut down. The war against corruption and crime in Memphis is ongoing, but thanks to the investigative prowess of Lecor and Mitchell, the streets are much safer. The Memphis Mystery is a thrilling film that takes viewers on a journey through the dark and dangerous world of crime and corruption, with unexpected twists and turns that keep the audience guessing until the very end.

The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members.

Belgian killer and rapist 'will not be euthanised' despite wishes Convicted Belgian killer and rapist Frank Van Den Bleeken. (Supplied) An imprisoned Belgian serial rapist and murderer whose wish to die was previously granted by doctors, will not be euthanised following a fresh medical decision. Frank Van Den Bleeken, who has spent 26 years in jail for repeated rapes and a rape-murder, will be moved from his prison in the northwestern city of Bruges to a new psychiatric treatment centre in Ghent, Justice Minister Koen Geens said in a statement on Tuesday. Geens \\"takes note of the decision of doctors treating Mr Frank Van Den Bleeken to no longer continue the euthanasia procedure,\\" the minister said in a statement. He gave no reason for the decision, citing medical privacy. The Flemish-language newspaper De Morgen reported at the weekend that Van Den Bleeken would be euthanised in Bruges prison on January 11. Van Den Bleeken had for years requested that the state help him end his life due to what his lawyer Jos Vander Velpen called \\"unbearable\\" psychological suffering. He won approval in September. Belgium legalised euthanasia in 2002, the second country in the world to do so after The Netherlands, and logged a record 1807 cases of euthanasia in 2013. Its strict conditions for a mercy killing include that patients must be capable, conscious and have presented a \\"voluntary, considered and repeated\\" request to die. Van Den Bleeken, considering himself a menace to society, had refused to be considered for early parole but found the conditions of his detention inhumane, according to an interview he gave Belgian media.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation 493*b - 976*b - 333913 = -221*b + 4441*b for b, we first need to simplify the equation by combining like terms (terms with the same variable). 1. Combine like terms on the left side: 493*b - 976*b = (-483)*b So the equation becomes: -483*b - 333913 = -221*b + 4441*b 2. Combine like terms on the right side: -221*b + 4441*b = 4220*b Now, the simplified equation is: -483*b - 333913 = 4220*b 3. To get all the terms with variable 'b' on one side of the equation, we can add 483*b to both sides: -333913 = 4220*b + 483*b 4. Combine the 'b' terms on the right side: 4220*b + 483*b = 4703*b Now, we have: -333913 = 4703*b 5. To solve for 'b', we need to isolate the variable by dividing both sides of the equation by 4703: b = -333913 / 4703 6. Calculate the value for 'b': b ≈ -71 So, the solution to the equation 493*b - 976*b - 333913 = -221*b + 4441*b for b is b ≈ -71."},{"prompt":"Bailey used trickery to control his classmates think he can solve the mat problem.

Chiba would reprise this role in two more films \\"Karate Bearfighter\\" (1975), and \\"Karate for Life\\" (1977). - Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. - Early life. Miura was born on October 3, 1949, in Kisarazu, Chiba, Japan, the son of a ship's engineer. He has one younger brother and one younger sister. Miura began training in Shotokan karate at the age of 13 years, and had been promoted to the rank of 2nd \\"dan\\" black belt by his 18th birthday. He also studied judo in his youth, achieving the rank of 1st \\"dan\\" in that art by the time he was 17. In 1967, aged 18, he began studying Kyokushin karate in a club at Josai International University. His teacher was Yoshiji Soeno at the university. Miura also studied this karate in summer vacation at the \\"honbu dojo\\" (headquarters training hall) of the Kyokushin in Tokyo. - Combat or fight is a purposeful violent conflict meant to weaken, establish dominance over, or kill the opposition, or to drive the opposition away from a location where it is not wanted or needed. - Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock (13 August 1899 29 April 1980) was an English film director and producer, at times referred to as \\"The Master of Suspense\\". He pioneered many elements of the suspense and psychological thriller genres. He had a successful career in British cinema with both silent films and early talkies and became renowned as England's best director. Hitchcock moved to Hollywood in 1939, and became a US citizen in 1955. - Film producers fill a variety of roles depending upon the type of producer. Either employed by a production company or independent, producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting script, coordinating writing, directing and editing, and arranging financing. During the \\"discovery stage\\", the producer has to find and acknowledge promising material. Then, unless the film is supposed to be based on an original script, the producer has to find an appropriate screenwriter. - Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) is promoted by UNESCO as a counterpart to the World Heritage focusing mainly on intangible aspects of culture. In 2001, UNESCO made a survey among States and NGOs to try to agree on a definition, and the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage was drafted in 2003 for its protection and promotion. - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution. - Works. Manga. All listings are as Ikki Kajiwara unless otherwise specified. - Karate Bearfighter ( Kenka karate kyokushin burai ken , literally \`\` Fighting Karate - Brutal Ultimate Truth Fist '' ) is a Japanese martial arts film made by Toei Company in 1975 and directed by Kazuhiko Yamaguchi . It is the second installment of a trilogy of films based on the manga Karate Baka Ichidai ( literal title : \`\` A Karate - Crazy Life '' ) by Ikki Kajiwara , Jiro Tsunoda and Jya Kagemaru . Sonny Chiba reprises his role from Champion of Death as Masutatsu Oyama , the historical founder of Kyokushin karate in Japan ( Oyama makes a cameo appearance in the film as well ) . Chiba was an interesting choice for the role , as he had studied martial arts under the real - life Oyama for several years . True to the film 's title , at one point in the course of the narrative he battles a \`\` bear '' , actually a human actor in a bear costume . - , also known as Sonny Chiba, is a Japanese actor, singer, film producer, film director, and martial artist. - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - A cameo role or cameo appearance (often shortened to just cameo) is a brief appearance or voice part of a known person in a work of the performing arts, typically unnamed or appearing as themselves. These roles are generally small, many of them non-speaking ones, and are commonly either appearances in a work in which they hold some special significance (such as actors from an original movie appearing in its remake), or renowned people making uncredited appearances. Short appearances by celebrities, film directors, politicians, athletes or musicians are common. A crew member of the show or movie playing a minor role can be referred to as a cameo as well, such as Alfred Hitchcock's frequently performed cameos. - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - History. Founding of International Karate Organization / Kyokushinkaikan. After formally establishing the Kyokushinkaikan in 1964, Oyama directed the organization through a period of expansion. Oyama hand-picked instructors who displayed ability in marketing the style and gaining new members. Oyama would choose an instructor to open a new dojo. The instructor would move to that town and demonstrate his karate skills in public places. After that, word of mouth would spread through the local area until the dojo had a dedicated core of students. Oyama also sent instructors to other countries such as the Netherlands (Kenji Kurosaki), Australia (Shigeo Kato) and (Mamoru Kaneko), the United States of America (Tadashi Nakamura, Shigeru Oyama and Yasuhiko Oyama, Miyuki Miura), Great Britain (Steve Arneil), Canada (Tatsuji Nakamura) and Brazil (Seiji Isobe) to spread Kyokushin in the same way. Many students, including Jon Bluming, Steve Arneil, and Howard Collins, traveled to Japan to train with Oyama directly. In 1969, Oyama staged \\"The First All-Japan Full Contact Karate Open Championships\\" and Terutomo Yamazaki became the first champion. All-Japan Championships have been held at every year. In 1975, \\"The First World Full Contact Karate Open Championships\\" were held in Tokyo. World Championships have been held at four-yearly intervals since. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Martial arts film is a film genre. A subgenre of the action film, martial arts films contain numerous martial arts fights between characters. They are usually the films' primary appeal and entertainment value, and often are a method of storytelling and character expression and development. Martial arts are frequently featured in training scenes and other sequences in addition to fights. Martial arts films commonly include other types of action, such as hand-to-hand combats, stuntwork, chases, and gunfights. - Performing arts are a form of art in which artists use their voices and/or their bodies, often in relation to other objects, to convey artistic expression. It is different from visual arts, which is when artists use paint/canvas or various materials to create physical or static art objects. Performing arts include several disciplines but every one is performed in front of live audiences. - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'genre'.

However, I can provide general information on mobile tracking for legitimate purposes, such as finding a lost or stolen phone or using location-sharing with consent from the device owner. 1. To track a phone with permission or for personal use: Step 1: Turn on the device's location services To track a mobile phone, its location services, such as GPS, must be enabled. This usually requires the device owner's consent. Step 2: Use a built-in feature or app Some phones have built-in tracking features, such as Find My iPhone for Apple devices and Find My Device for Android users. Alternatively, third-party apps like Life360 or Cerberus offer location-sharing features for consenting users. Step 3: Register and sign in to the service To track the phone using these services, the owner needs to sign in with their Apple ID or Google Account. After signing in, they can view the phone's location on a map through the app or website. 2. To track a mobile phone even when it is off: It is challenging to track a phone when it's off since the phone's signal and internet connection are inactive.

Douglas-fir have a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. Lodgepole Pines—the most common tree species in the park—generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and downed wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish. Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Whitebark Pine, and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. Aspen trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.About thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by lightning, while another six to ten are started by people—in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive exhibits and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September—the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires burn more than 100 acres (40 ha), and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"To analyze how less waste passed to the bladder might affect MORE waste being removed from the body, let's look at each step of the kidney process and identify if any of the given perturbations could be responsible for this outcome. 1. The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery There is no direct or indirect impact on this step that would result in less waste being passed to the bladder while increasing waste removal from the body. 2. They process it with millions of tiny nephrons A perturbation indirectly impacting this step could increase the efficiency of the nephrons in filtering waste. As a result, less waste would be attached to water and eventually passed to the bladder, while more waste would be removed overall. This could be due to an increased filtration rate of the nephrons or a hormonal response that increases waste removal. 3. Remove all the waste A perturbation directly impacting this step could involve more efficient waste removal, once again contributing to less waste being attached to water and passed to the bladder, and more waste being removed from the body overall. This could also be due to an increased filtration rate of the nephrons or hormonal response. 4. The kidneys return the blood back to the body through the renal artery There is no direct or indirect impact on this step that would result in less waste being passed to the bladder while increasing waste removal from the body. 5. Send the urine with the waste to the bladder through the ureters A direct perturbation impacting this step could involve less waste being passed to the bladder because the ureters are only transferring a smaller amount of waste-laden urine. However, this would not result in more waste being removed from the body, so it doesn't fit the scenario. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation for less waste being passed to the bladder while causing MORE waste to be removed from the body is likely an indirect impact on step 2 (nephron filtration) or a direct impact on step 3 (waste removal). These perturbations could involve factors like increased filtration rate, improved nephron function, or hormonal responses that boost waste removal efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Thomas Paine (or Pain; February 9, 1737 [O.S. January 29, 1736] - June 8, 1809) was an English-born American political activist, philosopher, political theorist and revolutionary. One of the Founding Fathers of the United States, he authored the two most influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution and inspired the rebels in 1776 to declare independence from Britain. His ideas reflected Enlightenment-era rhetoric of transnational human rights. Saul K. Padover described him as \\"a corsetmaker by trade, a journalist by profession, and a propagandist by inclination\\". Paine accompanied Col. John Laurens to France and is credited with initiating the mission. It landed in France in March 1781 and returned to America in August with 2.5 million livres in silver, as part of a \\"present\\" of 6 million and a loan of 10 million. The meetings with the French king were most likely conducted in the company and under the influence of Benjamin Franklin. Upon returning to the United States with this highly welcomed cargo, Thomas Paine and probably Col. Laurens, \\"positively objected\\" that General Washington should propose that Congress remunerate him for his services, for fear of setting \\"a bad precedent and an improper mode\\". Paine made influential acquaintances in Paris and helped organize the Bank of North America to raise money to supply the army. In 1785, he was given 3,000 by the U.S. Congress in recognition of his service to the nation. Henry Laurens (father of Col. John Laurens) had been the ambassador to the Netherlands, but he was captured by the British on his return trip there. When he was later exchanged for the prisoner Lord Cornwallis (in late 1781), Paine proceeded to the Netherlands to continue the loan negotiations. There remains some question as to the relationship of Henry Laurens and Thomas Paine to Robert Morris as the Superintendent of Finance and his business associate Thomas Willing who became the first president of the Bank of North America (in January 1782). They had accused Morris of profiteering in 1779 and Willing had voted against the Declaration of Independence. Although Morris did much to restore his reputation in 1780 and 1781, the credit for obtaining these critical loans to \\"organize\\" the Bank of North America for approval by Congress in December 1781 should go to Henry or John Laurens and Thomas Paine more than to Robert Morris. Paine bought his only house in 1783 on the corner of Farnsworth Avenue and Church Streets in Bordentown City, New Jersey and he lived in it periodically until his death in 1809. This is the only place in the world where Paine purchased real estate. In 1787, a bridge of Paine's design was built across the Schuylkill River at Philadelphia. At this time his work on single-arch iron bridges led him back to Paris, France. Because Paine had few friends when arriving in France aside from Lafayette and Jefferson, he continued to correspond heavily with Benjamin Franklin, a long time friend and mentor. Franklin provided letters of introduction for Paine to use to gain associates and contacts in France. Later that year, Paine returned to London from Paris. He then released a pamphlet on August 20 called Prospects on the Rubicon: or, an investigation into the Causes and Consequences of the Politics to be Agitated at the Meeting of Parliament. Tensions between England and France were increasing, and this pamphlet urged the British Ministry to reconsider the consequences of war with France. Paine sought to turn the public opinion against the war to create better relations between the countries, avoid the taxes of war upon the citizens, and not engage in a war he believed would ruin both nations.

Today, we are going to talk about a golfer named Graeme McDowell. He was trying to get into a really big golf game called the Open. Golfers play in many games, and they have to do their best to get into the biggest games. The Scottish Open is one of those games, and Graeme was playing in it. In golf, players want to hit the ball into the hole in as few shots as possible. The less shots they take, the better they do. In the last day of the Scottish Open, Graeme hit the ball the same number of times as the golf course said was good, which is called \\"level-par 72.\\" But sadly, this was not enough for him. Some other players did even better than him, and they went up on the list called the \\"leaderboard.\\" Because Graeme didn't do as well as he wanted to, he didn't move up on the leaderboard, and he missed out on the chance to play in the big game, the Open. But some other players did get to go, and they were really happy. This shows us that, in sports like golf, players always need to practice and try their best. Graeme will probably keep practicing, and maybe he will get to play in the big game next time. In the meantime, he can learn from this experience and remember that it's not always about winning, but about doing your best and having fun while playing the game.

In 2005, Martin Kierszenbaum started this record label. - Christmas Eve is the day before Christmas Day, the festival commemorating the birth of Jesus of Nazareth. Christmas Day is observed around the world, and Christmas Eve is widely observed as a full or partial holiday in anticipation of Christmas Day. Together, both days are considered one of the most culturally significant celebrations in Christendom and Western society. - Christmas or Christmas Day (meaning \\"Christ's Mass\\") is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed most commonly on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an Octave. The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies; when Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then disseminated the message furthermore. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family. - Universal Music Group, Inc.

Angels are typically described as benevolent, dreadful, and endowed with wisdom and knowledge of earthly events, but not infallible; for they strive with each other, and God has to make peace between them. Most of them serve either as intermediaries between Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits. They are studied in the theological doctrine of angelology. In Christian Science, the word \\"angel\\" is used to refer to an inspiration from God. The use of the term has extended to refer to artistic depictions of the spirits, and it is also used figuratively to refer to messengers and harbingers, and to people who possess high qualities of goodness, purity, selflessness, intelligence, and/or beauty. - Christmastide (also Christmas Time or the Christmas season), also known as Twelvetide, is a season of the liturgical year in most Christian churches. - Kate Marie Nash (born 6 July 1987) is an English singer, songwriter, musician and actress.

Given the question: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday.

Step 3: Compare word order and punctuation The word order and punctuation are different, with the first sentence using a comma and the second using a semicolon. However, these differences do not significantly alter the meaning of the sentences. Step 4: Identify differences in phrasing (\\"spread\\" vs \\"distributed\\" and \\"Atlantic\\" vs \\"Atlantic Ocean\\") The first difference is the use of \\"spread\\" in the first sentence and \\"distributed\\" in the second sentence. Both words describe the location of the species across a certain area, and in this context, they can be considered synonymous. The second difference is the use of \\"the Atlantic\\" in the first sentence and \\"the Atlantic Ocean\\" in the second. Both refer to the same body of water, and the slight difference in phrasing doesn't alter the meaning.

If he asks if you've been to a certain restaurant, don't cut off the conversation by saying no; instead say that you've heard great things about it and ask questions about his experience. It's likely this is his way of asking you for a date! If he's teasing you, play along. Enjoy his playful personality. If you say \\"no\\" to any slightly offbeat idea he may have, you will look prudish, and not like someone he wants to hang out with. Don't be overly disagreeable right away--even if you disagree. If you find out that your favorite sports teams are arch rivals, or that you fall on opposite sides of the political spectrum, don't start a fight about it. Being playful about your differences is one thing, but getting on a soap box about your views will make you look stubborn and selfish. Men love women who have a great sense of humor and who are confident enough to show it off. Though this may not be the time for knock-knock jokes, don't be afraid to throw in a joke or two if the occasion is appropriate. Show that you can laugh at yourself. No man wants a woman who takes herself too seriously--showing that you can laugh at your own foibles will show not only that you have confidence, but that you're aware of your flaws. Men don't want a girl who is \\"too perfect\\" and this will make them feel more secure about themselves. Don't be afraid to show off your brains for fear of intimidating a man. If he's the right guy, he'll be attracted by how smart you are, and will want to spend more time picking your brain. Show him your knowledge of current events, historical figures, or even your witty analysis of pop culture. If you know what you're talking about, he'll be pleased to hear you pontificate about any subject. There's a difference between sounding smart and showing off. Avoid bragging about where you went to college, what you got on the SATs ten years ago, or any other information that may make it sound like you're floating your own boat. There are plenty of confident, funny, and smart women out there, but there is only one you. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there to show what makes you who you are. If it's appropriate, tell him a funny or interesting story from your past that will give him a sense of what kind of person you are and what kind of experiences have shaped your life. Don't be afraid to share your interests. If you're teaching yourself French or are learning to ride the unicycle, tell him about it. He'll be impressed that you're marching to the beat of your own drum and will be impressed by your zest for new things. Share something about your friends or family. While you want to avoid telling him that you can't wait to introduce him to Mom and Dad after you've just exchanged names, you can say a few things about who your family and friends are to show who has influenced you to be your best possible self. Part of attracting a man is keeping him interested. If the flame of love is glowing, you should add logs to the hearth! Though you can still play coy, make sure to exchange information before you leave if the attraction is mutual. You should avoid coming on too strong, but express an interest that will make the man see that you want to spend more time with him. You'd be surprised by how shy many men are, and how happy they are when women step up and take the initiative. Unfortunately, certain men may not be attracted to you no matter how hard you try. But don't sweat it--there are plenty of men out there, and you've made yourself a better person already by following these tips! If the man you're seeking doesn't recognize your new confidence, looks, or conversational skills, then someone else will come along who will never want to leave your side. Though you may try to attract a man with all your might, his heart may be taken. Even if he's not in a serious relationship, he may have had a recent heartbreak or could be pining for someone else, and there's nothing you can do to change that. If you're rejected, play it off.

Johann Christian Friedrich Holderlin (German: ['jo:han 'kRIsti.a:n 'fRi: Holderlin began his education in 1776, and his mother planned for him to join the Lutheran church. In preparation for entrance exams into a monastery, he received additional instruction in Greek, Hebrew, Latin and rhetoric, starting in 1782. During this time, he struck a friendship with Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, who was five years Holderlin's junior. On account of the age difference, Schelling was \\"subjected to universal teasing\\" and Holderlin protected him from abuse by older students. Also during this time, Holderlin began playing the piano and developed an interest in travel literature through exposure to Georg Forster's A Voyage Round the World. In 1784, Holderlin entered the Lower Monastery in Denkendorf and started his formal training for entry into the Lutheran ministry. At Denkendotf, he discovered the poetry of Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, and took tentative steps in composing his own verses. The earliest known letter of Holderlin's is dated 1784 and addressed to his former tutor Nathanael Kostlin. In the letter, Holderlin hinted at his wavering faith in Christianity and anxiety about his mental state. Holderlin progressed to the Higher Monastery at Maulbronn in 1786. There he fell in love with Luise Nast, the daughter of the monastery's administrator, and began to doubt his desire to join the ministry; he composed Mein Vorsatz in 1787, in which he states his intention to attain \\"Pindar's light\\" and reach \\"Klopstock-heights\\". In 1788, he read Schiller's Don Carlos on Luise Nast's recommendation. Holderlin later wrote a letter to Schiller regarding Don Carlos, stating: \\"It won't be easy to study Carlos in a rational way, since he was for so many years the magic cloud in which the good god of my youth enveloped me so that I would not see too soon the pettiness and barbarity of the world.\\" In October 1788, Holderlin began his theological studies at the Tubinger Stift, where his fellow students included Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Isaac von Sinclair and Schelling. It has been speculated that it was Holderlin who, during their time in Tubingen, brought to Hegel's attention the ideas of Heraclitus regarding the unity of opposites, which Hegel would later develop into his concept of dialectics. In 1789, Holderlin broke off his engagement with Luise Nast, writing to her: \\"I wish you happiness if you choose one more worthy than me, and then surely you will understand that you could never have been happy with your morose, ill-humoured, and sickly friend,\\" and expressed his desire to transfer out and study law but succumbed to pressure from his mother to remain in the Stift. During his time in the Stift, Holderlin was an enthusiastic supporter of the French Revolution; he and some colleagues from a \\"republican club\\" planted a \\"Tree of Freedom\\" in the Tubingen market square, prompting Charles Eugene, the Duke of Wurttemberg himself, to admonish the students at the seminary.

Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. The Malegese Ocean is primarily connected to one river. This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river. So, that's what she does whenever she has leftover fertilizer she isn't going to use. The Dundrin Ocean is connected to many rivers. However, these rivers are located primarily in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. There is one farm near the Dundrin, though, which is owned by Luke. Luke never disposes of any of his garbage in the ocean or rivers near his farm, and he chooses instead to store excess fertilizer for the future or properly dispose of his trash. Which ocean would it be harder to catch a fish in?

Melson, who has faced heavy criticism in connection with the controversial Fast and Furious gun-trafficking investigation, announced Tuesday that he is stepping down as acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Also resigning is Dennis Burke, the U.S. attorney in Phoenix whose office oversaw the Fast and Furious program, in which ATF agents purposely allowed weapons to be illegally purchased in the hope of catching Mexican drug cartel leaders.Melson shared the news in a conference call at 11:30 a.m. EDT with supervisors at the bureau's field offices, telling them that he will be moving back to the Department of Justice to serve as a senior advisor with the Office of Legal Programs. His resignation will take effect at 5 p.m. EDT.Attorney Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. announced that B. Todd Jones, the U.S. attorney in Minneapolis, will replace Melson as acting director, effective Wednesday.Despite the problems with Fast and Furious under Melson's tenure, Holder praised the outgoing acting director and his new responsibilities.\\"Ken brings decades of experience at the department and extensive knowledge in forensic science to his new role and I know he will be a valuable contributor on these issues,\\" Holder said. \\"As he moves into this new role, I want to thank Ken for his dedication to the department over the last three decades.\\"But simply transferring Melson within the Justice Department did not immediately sit well with some critics, including Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who has asked Justice officials for an accounting of all Fast and Furious cases in Texas.\\"Instead of reassigning those responsible for Fast and Furious within the Department of Justice,\\" Cornyn said, \\"Atty. Gen. Holder should ask for their resignations and come clean on all alleged gun-walking operations, including a detailed response to allegations of a Texas-based scheme.\\"Under Melson's leadership, ATF launched Operation Fast and Furious, through which agents were to watch -- and in some cases record on video -- illegal gun sales and then use surveillance teams and electronic eavesdropping to follow the guns and learn how the weapons were moved. The goal was to arrest cartel leaders overseeing gun smuggling on the U.S. side of the border with Mexico But the chase for guns and cartel leaders soon hit a dead end. The ATF was attempting to follow each of the weapons as they were moved from the straw men who bought them illegally at gun shops to what officials expected would be cartel higher-ups in the U.S., who would move them to Mexico.The agency, which didn't have the resources to follow so many weapons, soon lost track of many of them. When officials did follow them to the next level, the buyers of the guns often turned out to be Mexicans living legally in the U.S. and not cartel honchos.An investigation by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), uncovered emails that showed Melson was regularly briefed on the botched operation.richard.serrano@latimes.com ||||| The controversy over the Fast and Furious anti-gun-trafficking operation upended the careers of two Justice Department officials Tuesday as the interim head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was transferred to an obscure, new post and the well-connected chief federal prosecutor in Arizona resigned. ATF’s current acting director, Ken Melson, will move to Justice’s Office of Legal Policy this week to become a senior adviser on forensic science, the Justice Department said. Dennis Burke, the U.S. Attorney for Arizona who oversaw prosecutions in that state related to the Fast and Furious operation, stepped down and left the federal government. Text Size - + reset Issa: ATF actions 'felony stupid' POLITICO 44 Neither Attorney General Eric Holder’s statements nor one from Burke made direct reference to the high-profile congressional investigation or a separate Justice Department probe into the ATF-led operation, which was aimed at reducing the flow of guns to Mexican drug gangs but allegedly allowed as many as 2,000 firearms to pass into the hands of criminals. However, Holder and Burke — a prominent figure in Arizona politics — both made vague allusions to distractions currently facing federal prosecutors in Arizona. “I am grateful to Dennis for his dedication and service to the Department of Justice over these many years and commend his decision to place the interests of the U.S. Attorney’s office above all else,” Holder said. “My long tenure in public service has been intensely gratifying. It has also been intensely demanding. For me, it is the right time to move on to pursue other aspects of my career and my life and allow the office to move ahead,” Burke said in a statement confirming that he’d submitted his resignation to President Barack Obama. At a House hearing in June, ATF agents complained that their efforts to seize weapons and arrest alleged traffickers were impeded by the unwillingness of federal prosecutors in Burke’s office to intercede immediately after suspicious gun buys. The agents said prosecutors blamed judicial rulings about the evidence needed to prove gun trafficking or other crimes. Sources in Washington and Arizona said Burke was summoned for an interview on Aug. 18 by the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.). Burke quickly became the focus of heated questioning and ire from Republicans, a source close to Burke said. “My understanding is it did not go well,” the source said. “The bottom line is someone’s head needed to roll. … No one at the Justice Department wanted to back him up.” Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the committee, said in a statement that Melson and Burke both acknowledged to the panel that “mistakes were made and that Operation Fast and Furious lacked adequate protections for public safety. Fresh leadership will allow ATF to move forward and focus on its vital mission of enforcing our nation’s gun laws.” A lower-ranking prosecutor who dealt with the Fast & Furious operation, Emory Hurley, was also reassigned from criminal cases to civil litigation, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. The change, which took place Monday, came at his own request, the spokeswoman said. The White House had no comment Tuesday on the personnel moves. Holder offered no reason for Melson’s reassignment, but simply noted his long tenure at the department and his expertise in forensics. Melson, a veteran federal prosecutor, took the top spot at the ATF on an interim basis in 2009 and oversaw the execution of Fast and Furious, an effort that was aimed at rooting out gun smugglers selling weapons to Mexican cartels. Investigators say the ATF lost track of as many as 2,000 guns that were sold during the operation, including two that were found near the scene of the killing of a Border Patrol agent last December. In July, Melson gave a lengthy interview to congressional investigators outside the presence of — and without advance notice to — DOJ’s legislative affairs team. In the interview, Melson said he had objected to aspects of DOJ’s plans for handing the legislative inquiries and that he had been told not to tell Congress why mid-level ATF officials with responsibility for the Fast and Furious operation were reassigned. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A man named Kenneth Melson and another man, Dennis Burke, both had important jobs in the government. They were involved in a project called Fast and Furious, which was about stopping bad people from getting guns. But the project didn't work well, and this caused many people to be unhappy with them. So, Kenneth decided to leave his current job and move to another job in the government. Dennis also decided to quit his job.

Article: All reform agreements between justice department and local police forces – including Ferguson and Baltimore – to be reexamined, attorney general says The US attorney general on Monday ordered a nationwide review of all reform agreements with local police departments, placing a key part of Barack Obama’s legacy on criminal justice in jeopardy. Jeff Sessions signalled in a memo filed to a federal court that “consent decrees” such as those struck in recent years with troubled departments in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland, could be scrapped or scaled down. “It is not the responsibility of the federal government to manage non-federal law enforcement agencies,” Sessions said in the memo. Sessions said he had instructed senior officials to reexamine all formal agreements between the department of justice (DoJ) and police agencies – from training initiatives, to collaborative reform programs, to legal consent decrees – to ensure they fit his series of operating principles for his department. These included: “The misdeeds of individual bad actors should not impugn or undermine the legitimate and honorable work that law enforcement officers and agencies perform in keeping American communities safe.” The NAACP’s legal defense fund slammed the move, calling it “a blatant attempt by the justice department to abandon its obligations under federal civil rights law and the US constitution”. US attorney dismissed by Trump speaks out on Chicago's need for police reform Read more In a statement, the ACLU also took issue with the attorney general’s suggestion that abuse within police departments was attributable to “the misdeeds of individual bad actors”. “There is no national census of police misconduct to support the DOJ’s notion that there are only a few bad actors in law enforcement. Indeed, DOJ’s own investigative reports over the past eight years document systemic unlawful policing practices of local law enforcement in cities across the country.” Sessions, a hardline conservative who was previously a US senator for Alabama, has frequently accused the Obama administration of unfairly maligning all police because of the use of arguably excessive force by officers in a handful of high-profile lethal cases. Sessions made clear during his confirmation hearings in Washington in January that he was prepared to weaken legal reform agreements in order to hand authority back to local police chiefs. Consent decrees are court-enforced lists of reforms that are typically struck when justice department civil rights investigators discover a “pattern or practice” of unconstitutional policing by a department. A total of 25 such investigations were opened under the Obama administration. Sessions has repeatedly expressed unease about such agreements, saying he believes the federal government has too frequently interfered with local policing. Federal officials are currently enforcing 19 agreements, according to a report released earlier this year. This includes several reached by the Obama administration with cities such as Cleveland; Newark, New Jersey; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. The new Sessions memo was filed to court in Maryland in the case of the justice department’s consent decree with police in Baltimore. Attorneys for the justice department asked the court for a 90-day pause so it could “review and assess” the plan. Trump breaks from Obama with crime crackdown and 'blue lives matter' protections Read more The agreement was reached following severe unrest in the city following the death in April 2015 of Freddie Gray, a 24-year-old black man who died from a broken neck sustained in the back of a Baltimore police van. Baltimore officers had faced a series of allegations of misconduct and brutality in previous years. The consent decree with Ferguson grew out of the scathing findings of an inquiry prompted by unrest around the fatal police shooting of unarmed black 18-year-old Michael Brown in August 2014. It demands that the Missouri city overhaul its criminal justice system and refocus its policing on de-escalation and avoiding the use of force. Changes to consent decrees would need to be proposed in court by justice department officials and approved by a federal judge. In a statement on Monday night, Catherine Pugh, Baltimore’s mayor, said: “We strongly oppose any delay in moving forward.” She said a delay “may have the effect of eroding the trust that we are working hard to establish”. During the presidential campaign, Trump earned the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police union, and the move is likely to be popular among police officers. “I think most rank and file police officers will welcome this news,” said Jim Bueermann, a former California police chief and the head of the Police Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on policing research. “I think most street cops believe that the federal government has not been fair to them and finds the consent decree process to be intrusive.” Police chiefs, in contrast, sometimes welcome the role of the justice department, since court-mandated reforms can be a way of forcing city governments to pay for changes, Bueermann added. With the future of Chicago’s consent decree in limbo, the Chicago police department has pledged to move ahead with reforms regardless of what role the federal government plays. But in a blunt open letter, Chicago’s outgoing US attorney said that city leaders could not be trusted to fulfilthe needed reforms, and the police department needed a consent decree. Recent justice department investigations into policing in Chicago and Baltimore found evidence to support what many black residents of those cities already believed: that local police departments had engaged in a pattern of unconstitutional policing. The investigations found evidence of stark racial disparities in police enforcement, excessive force, and patterns of unjustified stops, searches and arrests. In Baltimore, the investigation’s final report described: “Two Baltimores: one wealthy and largely white, the second impoverished and predominantly black. Community members living in the city’s wealthier and largely white neighbourhoods told us that officers tend to be respectful and responsive to their needs, while many individuals living in the city’s largely African-American communities informed us that officers tend to be disrespectful and do not respond promptly to their calls for service.” Phillip Atiba Goff, a leading researcher on racial bias in policing, called Sessions’ move “a terrible blow” to efforts to build trust between police and communities. “Without the help of a federal consent decree, police executives often cannot effect the changes they know a department needs, changes designed to build trust with communities that are skeptical of their law enforcement. “Ultimately, I fear that this new direction from DOJ will make communities less safe by making them less trusting – possibly setting us back years or more.” ||||| WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a sweeping review of federal agreements with dozens of law enforcement agencies, an examination that reflects President Trump’s emphasis on law and order and could lead to a retreat on consent decrees with troubled police departments nationwide. In a memorandum dated March 31 and made public Monday, the attorney general directed his staff to look at whether law enforcement programs adhere to principles put forth by the Trump administration, including one declaring that “the individual misdeeds of bad actors should not impugn” the work police officers perform “in keeping American communities safe.” As part of its shift in emphasis, the Justice Department went to court on Monday to seek a 90-day delay in a consent decree to overhaul Baltimore’s embattled Police Department. That request came just days before a hearing, scheduled for Thursday in the United States District Court in Baltimore, to solicit public comment on the agreement, which was reached in principle by the city and the Justice Department in the waning days of the Obama administration. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a nationwide review of all reform agreements with local police departments, casting doubt on part of former President Barack Obama's criminal justice legacy.

Beneath the old volcano is an underground geothermal system that still bursts with smoking fumaroles, steam vents and boiling mud pots at eight geothermal areas that attract visitors from around the world. Yet the closest many people get to Lassen Volcanic National Park is 50 miles away on I-5, where they spot 10,457-foot Lassen Peak to the east and wonder what it is. Many in the Bay Area and Sacramento never see it, being located outside the San Francisco-to-Tahoe corridor. On my visit last Friday, 12 of 20 camping cabins at Manzanita Lake were empty, the pretty campgrounds at Summit Lake had space, and everything was quiet, pristine with world-class recreation opportunities. At Manzanita Lake, you can discover a sapphire lake with views of Lassen Peak, kayaking (with rentals available) and canoeing, and some of the best stillwater flyfishing (you need a pram or kayak) for wild trout in California. Cabin rentals, campsites and a camper’s store are within a walk of a minute or two. That’s just a start. The park is speckled with lakes nestled in high mountain cirques, rich meadows edged with wildflowers and creeks, cragged volcanic wastelands and peaks with top-of-the-world views. The outskirts of the parks includes two gorgeous lakes, Juniper and Butte, both with drive-in campgrounds, the historic Drakesbad Lodge, and 78,900 acres of wilderness with 150 miles of trails.

Question: - Your diaphragm moves down - Your lungs have more room - Your lungs fill with air - You exhale - Your diaphragm moves back up - Carbon dioxide is exhaled - You start the process over again. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process described above is the initiation of inhalation, which involves the contraction of the diaphragm muscle. To provide a comprehensive understanding, let's examine each of the subsequent steps in this respiratory cycle. 1. Diaphragm contraction: The diaphragm, a sheet-like muscle located beneath the lungs, contracts and moves downward. This contraction is triggered by the phrenic nerve, which sends signals from the brain to the diaphragm to initiate the breathing process. The downward movement of the diaphragm creates a negative pressure within the thoracic cavity. 2. Expansion of the lungs: As the diaphragm moves down, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, creating more room for the lungs to expand. This expansion reduces the pressure within the lungs, allowing air to flow into them. 3. Inhalation: With the diaphragm contracted and lungs expanded, air rich in oxygen is drawn into the lungs through the nose and/or mouth, the trachea, and the bronchi, finally reaching the alveoli, which are tiny air sacs within the lungs. Gas exchange - the process of swapping oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules - occurs at the alveoli, where oxygen enters the bloodstream and carbon dioxide is transferred from the bloodstream into the lungs. 4. Relaxation of the diaphragm: Once the required amount of oxygen has entered the lungs, the diaphragm relaxes and moves back upwards towards its original position. This movement reduces the volume of the thoracic cavity, and increases the pressure within the lungs. 5. Exhalation: As the diaphragm moves back up, the pressure within the lungs forces air rich in carbon dioxide out of the lungs. This exhalation occurs through the bronchi, trachea, and the nose and/or mouth. 6. Removal of carbon dioxide: During exhalation, carbon dioxide, which is a waste product resulting from cellular respiration, is removed from the body. This helps maintain a healthy balance of gases within the body, ensuring that cells receive adequate oxygen to function properly. 7. Respiratory cycle repetition: The process starts all over again, with the diaphragm contracting once more and initiating another inhalation. This continuous and involuntary cycle, known as the respiratory cycle, allows the body to take in the necessary oxygen for cellular respiration, and to remove carbon dioxide waste, thereby sustaining life. In summary, the first step of the process is the contraction of the diaphragm, which initiates inhalation and the subsequent respiratory cycle. This is an essential and continuous process that provides vital oxygen to cells, ensuring that the body remains healthy and functional."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this context, it refers to the fact that her position, actions, or beliefs are considered correct, morally sound, or justified by some standard. This usage of the word \\"right\\" expresses a qualitative attribute, suggesting that she is on the side of what is good and fair. In the second sentence, as spoken by Eleanor Roosevelt, \\"Certain rights can never be granted to the government but must be kept in the hands of the people,\\" the word \\"rights\\" refers to legal, social, and political entitlements or powers that people possess. In this context, \\"rights\\" are fundamental principles or freedoms that belong to individuals, which governments should protect and recognize. Examples of such rights include the freedom of speech, the right to a fair trial, and the right to vote. So, when comparing these two sentences, the meanings of \\"right\\" are distinct – the first one is about moral correctness or justice, whereas the second one refers to an individual's entitlements or abilities that ought to be respected and safeguarded. Although the word \\"right\\" appears in both sentences, its different usage based on the context results in separate interpretations of the term."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"Title: Excellent and Easy-to-Use Torrent App with Room for Improvement Review: I've been using com.frostwire.android for a few months now, and I must say, I'm satisfied with my experience so far. I rate this app 4 stars out of 5, as it has been a great tool for downloading files quickly and efficiently, as well as providing me with a clean and user-friendly interface for seamless torrenting. There's still room for growth and improvement, but this app is a worthwhile addition to my arsenal of torrenting tools. One of the most significant advantages of the FrostWire app is its effortless usability. It comes equipped with a neat, minimalistic, and organized interface that makes the overall experience enjoyable and painless. Even for someone who might be new to torrenting, this app provides an easy way to search for and download torrents without any complications. The search function works seamlessly, allowing users to find exactly what they're looking for in a matter of seconds, saving time and effort. The app also provides other interesting features that make it stand out from the competition. One such feature is the in-built music and video player that lets users preview and play downloaded files from within the app, creating a more unified experience and eliminating the need to switch between different apps. Additionally, FrostWire supports batch downloads, which means users can download multiple files at once without having to manage them individually. In terms of performance, the FrostWire app doesn't disappoint. Download speeds are generally fast (depending on the individual torrent's seeders), and it efficiently manages bandwidth usage so that your other tasks and browsing activities aren't affected. Also, I must commend the developers for maintaining a stable app environment with few crashes or glitches. However, the reason I'm giving this app 4 stars instead of 5 lies in its potential for improvement. Firstly, the intrusive ads can be quite bothersome while using the app. While I understand that they may be a necessary source of revenue for the developers, implementing a less invasive advertising strategy or providing an ad-free paid version would be a welcome change. Another area that could use some improvements is the app's battery consumption. I've noticed that the app tends to consume a significant amount of battery life, especially during prolonged downloads. Implementing measures to optimize battery usage while maintaining functionality would make the app even more competitive. Lastly, it would be helpful to see improvements in search engine integration. While the search function works well, having access to more search engines, including the integration of private tracker sites, would allow users to find content across a wider range of sources. This would help increase the overall search efficiency and effectiveness. In conclusion, the com.frostwire.android app provides an impressive torrenting experience, equipped with an easy-to-use interface, efficient download speeds, and useful additional features. However, a few improvements could elevate this app to a solid 5-star experience. Despite these drawbacks, I wholeheartedly recommend this app to anyone looking for a reliable torrent downloader with a streamlined and enjoyable user experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Robert Ervin Howard (January 22, 1906 - June 11, 1936) was an American author who wrote pulp fiction in a diverse range of genres. He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre. Howard was born and raised in Texas. He spent most of his life in the town of Cross Plains, with some time spent in nearby Brownwood. Context: Howard was born January 22, 1906 in Peaster, Texas, the only son of a traveling country physician, Dr. Isaac Mordecai Howard, and his wife, Hester Jane Ervin Howard. His early life was spent wandering through a variety of Texas cowtowns and boomtowns: Dark Valley (1906), Seminole (1908), Bronte (1909), Poteet (1910), Oran (1912), Wichita Falls (1913), Bagwell (1913), Cross Cut (1915), and Burkett (1917). During Howard's youth his parents' relationship began to break down. The Howard family had problems with money which may have been exacerbated by Isaac Howard investing in get-rich-quick schemes. Hester Howard, meanwhile, came to believe that she had married below herself. Soon the pair were actively fighting. Hester did not want Isaac to have anything to do with their son. She had a particularly strong influence on her son's intellectual growth. She had spent her early years helping a variety of sick relatives, contracting tuberculosis in the process. She instilled in her son a deep love of poetry and literature, recited verse daily and supported him unceasingly in his efforts to write. Other experiences would later seep into his prose. Although he loved reading and learning, he found school to be confining and began to hate having anyone in authority over him. Experiences watching and confronting bullies revealed the omnipresence of evil and enemies in the world, and taught him the value of physical strength and violence. Being the son of the local doctor gave Howard frequent exposure to the effects of injury and violence, due to accidents on farms and oil fields combined with the massive increase in crime that came with the oil boom. Firsthand tales of gunfights, lynchings, feuds, and Indian raids developed his distinctly Texan, hardboiled outlook on the world. Sports, especially boxing, became a passionate preoccupation. At the time, boxing was the most popular sport in the country, with a cultural influence far in excess of what it is today. James J. Jeffries, Jack Johnson, Bob Fitzsimmons, and later Jack Dempsey were the names that inspired during those years, and he grew up a lover of all contests of violent, masculine struggle.

They were both very surprised with they findings. and a hint : In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

What is the answer to this question? who did bernardo kill in west side story?","completion":"In West Side Story, Bernardo, the leader of the Puerto Rican gang called the Sharks, kills Riff, the leader of the white gang called the Jets. The tragic sequence of events that led to this situation stems from the overarching rivalry and animosity between the two major street gangs in the narrative. West Side Story is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, set in New York City during the 1950s. The Sharks and Jets represent the Montagues and Capulets, respectively, in embedding the feud component from the classic play. Racial tensions predominantly drove the conflict between the two gangs. During the theatrical development, the character of Bernardo is portrayed as a strong, proud, and courageous individual. As the Sharks' leader, he feels a sense of responsibility to protect his fellow members from the inherent discrimination they experience as immigrants in the United States. Love eventually plays a role in exacerbating the conflict between the two gangs when Bernardo's sister, Maria, falls in love with one of the Jets, Tony. The drama-igniting killing occurs during the protagonist's intention to stage a \\"war council\\" in which the feud's climactic rumble would be deliberated. Despite initial intentions to enact a \\"fair fight\\" showdown, unforeseen, tense circumstances provoke Bernardo into killing Riff. In response to the shocking death of his best friend, Tony retaliates and kills Bernardo. Bernardo's tragic death is a pivotal moment in West Side Story, adding increased tension and emotional stakes to the already intense tale of love and rivalry. The story's portrayal of the consequences of racial prejudice and gang violence serves as a cautionary tale, urging audiences to reassess their judgments and prejudices towards others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Shipman hanged himself in his cell at Wakefield Prison at 06:20 on 13 January 2004, on the eve of his 58th birthday, and was pronounced dead at 08:10. A Prison Service statement indicated that Shipman had hanged himself from the window bars of his cell using bed sheets. Some of the victims' families said they felt cheated, as his suicide meant they would never have the satisfaction of Shipman's confession nor answers as to why he committed his crimes. The Home Secretary David Blunkett noted that celebration was tempting, saying: \\"You wake up and you receive a call telling you Shipman has topped himself and you think, is it too early to open a bottle? And then you discover that everybody's very upset that he's done it.\\" His death divided national newspapers, with the Daily Mirror branding him a \\"cold coward\\" and condemning the Prison Service for allowing his suicide to happen. The Sun, however, ran a celebratory front-page headline; \\"Ship Ship hooray!\\" The Independent called for the inquiry into Shipman's suicide to look more widely at the state of Britain's prisons as well as the welfare of inmates. In The Guardian, an article by Sir David Ramsbotham (former Chief Inspector of Prisons) suggested that whole life sentencing be replaced by indefinite sentencing as these would at least give prisoners the hope of eventual release and reduce the risk of their ending their own lives by suicide as well as making their management easier for prison officials. Shipman's motive for suicide was never established, although he had reportedly told his probation officer that he was considering suicide to assure his wife's financial security after he was stripped of his National Health Service (NHS) pension. Primrose Shipman received a full NHS pension, to which she would not have been entitled had Shipman lived past age 60. Additionally, there was evidence that his wife, who had consistently protested Shipman's innocence despite the overwhelming evidence, had begun to suspect his guilt. Shipman had refused to take part in courses leading toward a full confession of his crimes, leading to temporary removal of privileges, including the opportunity to telephone his wife. During this period, according to Shipman's cellmate, he received a letter from Primrose exhorting him to \\"tell me everything, no matter what\\".

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I think that one of the people who caused me the most misery for the longest was someone that I’ll call “Luna”. So, most people have probably met that person that acts all suicidal and then uses that against you. For example, you’re talking to someone like that and you’re having some sort of argument and the moment they realize they aren’t winning they send you pictures of their bloodied wrists and say “This is your fault”. Well, that person was my friend for a long time. Every time I would try to leave her to go to sleep she would threaten to do “something bad” and I knew what she meant, and me, first meeting her when I was around 9 or 10, and I was still extremely naive. So most of the time, I ended up staying awake til 3 AM on school nights and I would get only a few hours of sleep, and she’d be happy because her life wasn’t worsened at all. But I think the thing that made me the most miserable, was the fact that it never got better. No matter how much I talked to her, or how sympathetic I tried to be, or how much I tried to convince her to be happier, it never got better. She still acted super depressed, but like it was a joke. All of these things combined to make me completely miserable because it seemed like it was all for nothing. But I just let it happen, because she was the only person I had and she was really my only “friend” at that point, and all the way up to seventh grade. So for that entire period of time, she certainly wasn’t the only source of misery for me, but she made me feel way worse than I would have if I hadn’t been friends with her.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Stephen Crane (November 1, 1871 - June 5, 1900) was an American poet, novelist, and short story writer. Prolific throughout his short life, he wrote notable works in the Realist tradition as well as early examples of American Naturalism and Impressionism. He is recognized by modern critics as one of the most innovative writers of his generation. The ninth surviving child of Methodist parents, Crane began writing at the age of four and had published several articles by the age of 16. Stephen Crane's fiction is typically categorized as representative of Naturalism, American realism, Impressionism or a mixture of the three. Critic Sergio Perosa, for example, wrote in his essay, \\"Stephen Crane fra naturalismo e impressionismo,\\" that the work presents a \\"symbiosis\\" of Naturalistic ideals and Impressionistic methods. When asked whether or not he would write an autobiography in 1896, Crane responded that he \\"dare not say that I am honest. I merely say that I am as nearly honest as a weak mental machinery will allow.\\" Similarities between the stylistic techniques in Crane's writing and Impressionist painting--including the use of color and chiaroscuro--are often cited to support the theory that Crane was not only an Impressionist but also influenced by the movement. H. G. Wells remarked upon \\"the great influence of the studio\\" on Crane's work, quoting a passage from The Red Badge of Courage as an example: \\"At nightfall the column broke into regimental pieces, and the fragments went into the fields to camp. Tents sprang up like strange plants. Camp fires, like red, peculiar blossoms, dotted the night.... From this little distance the many fires, with the black forms of men passing to and fro before the crimson rays, made weird and satanic effects.\\" Although no direct evidence exists that Crane formulated a precise theory of his craft, he vehemently rejected sentimentality, asserting that \\"a story should be logical in its action and faithful to character. Truth to life itself was the only test, the greatest artists were the simplest, and simple because they were true.\\" Poet and biographer John Berryman suggested that there were three basic variations, or \\"norms\\", of Crane's narrative style. The first, being \\"flexible, swift, abrupt and nervous\\", is best exemplified in The Red Badge of Courage, while the second (\\"supple majesty\\") is believed to relate to \\"The Open Boat\\", and the third (\\"much more closed, circumstantial and 'normal' in feeling and syntax\\") to later works such as The Monster. Crane's work, however, cannot be determined by style solely on chronology. Not only does his fiction not take place in any particular region with similar characters, but it varies from serious in tone to reportorial writing and light fiction. Crane's writing, both fiction and nonfiction, is consistently driven by immediacy and is at once concentrated, vivid and intense. The novels and short stories contain poetic characteristics such as shorthand prose, suggestibility, shifts in perspective and ellipses between and within sentences. Similarly, omission plays a large part in Crane's work; the names of his protagonists are not commonly used and sometimes they are not named at all. Crane was often criticized by early reviewers for his frequent incorporation of everyday speech into dialogue, mimicking the regional accents of his characters with colloquial stylization. This is apparent in his first novel, in which Crane ignored the romantic, sentimental approach of slum fiction; he instead concentrated on the cruelty and sordid aspects of poverty, expressed by the brashness of the Bowery's crude dialect and profanity, which he used lavishly. The distinct dialect of his Bowery characters is apparent at the beginning of the text; the title character admonishes her brother saying: \\"Yeh knows it puts mudder out when yes comes home half dead, an' it's like we'll all get a poundin'.\\" Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Stephen Crane was a famous writer from a long time ago who wrote poems, stories, and novels. He was known for writing in different styles like Realism, Naturalism, and Impressionism, which helped make his work really special and unique. Sometimes he wrote in a way that showed you the world as it really was, and other times he painted pictures with his words, like an artist would do with colors on a canvas. One of his most famous books is called \\"The Red Badge of Courage.\\" People really liked how he wrote about the feelings of soldiers during a war. Stephen also wrote about everyday people and their lives, but he didn't sugarcoat it. He showed the tough and ugly parts of life, too. And when his characters talked, he made them sound like real people, using the way they would really speak. People keep talking and studying about Stephen Crane today because he was really good at telling stories in different ways, and he knew how to make them feel real and alive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - William John Swainson FLS, FRS (8 October 1789 6 December 1855), was an English ornithologist, malacologist, conchologist, entomologist and artist. - Nicholas Aylward Vigors (1785 26 October 1840) was an Irish zoologist and politician. He popularized the classification of birds on the basis of the quinarian system. - William Sharp Macleay or McLeay (21 July 1792 26 January 1865) was a British civil servant and entomologist. - Johann Jakob Kaup ( April 10 , 1803 - July 4 , 1873 ) was a German naturalist . A proponent of natural philosophy , he believed in an innate mathematical order in nature and he attempted biological classifications based on the Quinarian system . - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Johann Jakob Kaup (10 April 1803 4 July 1873) was a German naturalist. A proponent of natural philosophy, he believed in an innate mathematical order in nature and he attempted biological classifications based on the Quinarian system. Biography. He was born at Darmstadt. After studying at Göttingen and Heidelberg he spent two years at Leiden, where his attention was specially devoted to the amphibians and fishes. He then returned to Darmstadt as an assistant in the grand ducal museum, of which in 1840 he became inspector. In 1829 he published \\"Skizze zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der europäischen Thierwelt\\", in which he regarded the animal world as developed from lower to higher forms, from the amphibians through the birds to the beasts of prey; but subsequently he repudiated this work as a youthful indiscretion, and on the publication of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" he declared himself against its doctrines. The extensive fossil deposits in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt gave him ample opportunities for palaeontological inquiries, and he gained considerable reputation by his \\"Beiträge zur näheren Kenntniss der urweltlichen Säugethiere\\" (18551862). He also wrote \\"Classification der Säugethiere und Vögel\\" (1844), and, with Heinrich Georg Bronn, \\"Die Gavial-artigen Reste aus dem Lias\\" (18421844). - The Quinarian system was a method of zoological classification which had a brief period of popularity in the mid 19th century, especially among British naturalists. It was largely developed by the entomologist William Sharp MacLeay in 1819. The system was further promoted in the works of Nicholas Aylward Vigors, William John Swainson and Johann Jakob Kaup. Swainson's work on ornithology gave wide publicity to the idea. The system had opponents even before the publication of Charles Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species\\" (1859 ) which paved the way for evolutionary trees. - Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature (from Latin \\"philosophia naturalis\\") was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science.

Article: Most people are aware of what the adoption process is because it has become rather common in our society. Adoption is where a child is legally placed with guardians or parents (or perhaps a single parent) other than the birth mother or father. Once an adoption is finalized, all parental rights are turned over to the adoptive parents and there is no legal difference between adoptive parents and natural birth parents. There are generally two types of adoption, which are closed adoption and open adoption. When an adopted person has access to his or her adoption file and original records, it is referred to as an open adoption. The term is also used to describe any contact that may be between the adoptive family, the birth parents, and the adopted child. The level of openness can change greatly in such contact depending on each individual relationship. There can be indirect contact between the natural birth parents and the child through the form of letters and photographs, or there can be actual physical contact. A semi-open adoption is where the birth parents may have contact with the adoptive parents before the birth of the child, either once or several times. After the birth there is no more contact. A semi-open adoption may remain as it is or it can become either open or closed. A closed adoption is where only the medical and historical information about the biological parents is given to the adoptive family. Typically, the birth and adoptive parents do not know each other's identities. The record of the birth parents is kept sealed . A closed adoption is usually only effective in the adoption of babies. The adoption of an older child who already knows his or her birth parents cannot be kept closed. Question: How many adoption types are mentioned in the passage? Options: A: 2. B: 3. C: 4. D: 5.

Article:The think tank weighed up the benefits of staying in the single market compared with membership of the World Trade Organization alone. The UK voted to leave the EU in the June referendum. Paul Johnson, IFS director, said there was a big difference between access and membership of the single market. \\"We've heard a lot of people saying of course we'll have access if we leave the single market union. \\"Broadly speaking, yes, we will, as every other country in the world does. You can export into the EU wherever you are from, but there are different sorts of barriers to doing so.\\" The IFS report said access to the single market was \\"virtually meaningless as a concept\\" because \\"any country in the World Trade Organization - from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe - had 'access' to the EU as an export destination\\". Five models for post-Brexit UK trade Who has access to the single market? The IFS report argued that the special advantage of being an EU member was that its single market reduced or eliminated barriers to trading in services, such as the need for licences or other regulations. The IFS said that the absence of trade barriers for services was far more important than removing tariffs on the trade in goods between EU members, such as customs checks and import taxes. It said that while leaving the EU would free the UK from having to make a budgetary contribution of Â£8bn, loss of trade could depress tax receipts by a larger amount. It found new trade deals would be unlikely to make up for lost EU trade, which accounts for 44% of British exports and 39% of service exports. The government has yet to start negotiating the UK's departure. The IFS issued stark warnings over the impact of Brexit ahead of the EU referendum, which have made some question its views. Mr Johnson said he hoped the IFS was proved wrong. \\"We wait to see what the economic consequences are going to be, but we've already seen the Bank of England significantly reduce its predictions of growth over the next couple of years and increase its view of where unemployment will be,\\" he added. The report said UK services would be particularly vulnerable if the government were unable or unwilling to negotiate a replacement deal and become a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), like Norway. The IFS report added that financial services, which generate 8% of the UK's economic output, might suffer in particular if a final Brexit deal meant they lost their so-called \\"passporting rights\\" that allows them to be sold directly to EU customers and businesses. \\"To maintain these rights would likely require membership of the European Economic Area (EEA),\\" it said. \\"But that would come at the potentially considerable cost of submitting to future regulations designed in the EU without input from the UK. The UK may have to make some very difficult choices between the benefits from passporting and the costs of submitting to external imposed regulation.\\" The IFS explored the possibility of the UK signing its own free trade agreement with the EU, or simply adopting WTO rules. But in both cases, the report argued, such deals would still involve tariffs or other barriers to free trade in goods and services. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that the UK could face serious consequences if it opts for a \\"hard Brexit\\" and leaves the EU single market, with reduced access negatively affecting trade and UK economic growth. The IFS emphasised the importance of the single market in reducing or eliminating barriers to trading services, which make up 44% of British exports and 39% of service exports. Financial services could be specifically affected if passporting rights are lost, hindering their ability to be sold directly to EU customers and businesses. The IFS noted that new trade agreements are unlikely to make up for lost EU trade and could lead to a drop in tax receipts larger than the cancellation of the UK's £8 billion budgetary contributions to the EU."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She was a member of the European People's Party and the Christian Democratic Appeal Party. During her tenure as an MEP, one of her focuses was on improving pension systems across the European Union. The report on adequate, sustainable, and secure European pension systems aims to address the challenges faced by the pension systems in the European Union's member countries. It proposes a number of measures to ensure that these systems are financially sustainable and provide adequate support to retirees. Some key recommendations of the report include: 1. Encouraging higher employment rates, particularly among older workers, as well as increasing the effective retirement age, in order to support the financial stability of pension systems. This can be achieved through targeted incentives and policies. 2. Ensuring that pension systems are sufficiently funded and that the investments made by pension funds are managed prudently and transparently. 3. Strengthening the link between contributions and benefits, so that those who have contributed more to their pension funds can expect to receive higher benefits upon retirement. 4. Promoting greater harmonization and coordination across different European pension systems, in order to improve pension portability and make it easier for citizens to move and work across the European Union. 5. Encouraging member countries to develop and implement more efficient and effective ways of delivering pension benefits, such as through the digitalization of services and the simplification of administrative processes. 6. Protecting the rights and interests of beneficiaries, ensuring that pension funds are adequately regulated and supervised, and promoting the development of consumer protection measures, including clear and transparent information for pension savers. Overall, the report on adequate, sustainable, and secure European pension systems aims to provide a comprehensive roadmap for the improvement of pension systems across the EU member countries.

Article: Many studies have been carried out to discover the benefits of listening to and playing music. The growing field of \\"music treatment\\" is presenting increasing amounts of proof that point to the great powers of music. Emotional benefits The right song can put anybody in a better state. Most people turn to certain songs to make them feel better. The main reason behind this is that music can express our feelings better than any other medium. In addition, we have favorite songs for particular situations because we turn to the music which has the best effect on us. Music and exercise Have you ever noticed how out of breath you get when listening to an exciting song while doing exercises at the gym? It has been suggested that exciting music can actually increase muscle tension , while light music does the opposite. It has also been proved that music can improve motor skills. An experiment done on a group of pupils proved that children learning basic motor skills such as throwing ,catching and jumping while listening to music did better than those with no music. Chronic pain relief Music also has the ability to reduce chronic pain. In fact, according to a paper published in the Journal of Advanced Nursing, music can reduce chronic pain by 21%. The paper reports that 60 patients in an experiment were divided into two groups--one group listened to music, and the other did not. The results showed that people who listened to music for an hour each day for a week improved physically and psychologically while those who did not listen to music did not.

The temperature in your home drops below the set point on your thermostat. To give a more detailed and fuller understanding of the whole heating process, here's a breakdown of the steps: 1. The temperature in your home drops below the set point on your thermostat: When the temperature inside your home becomes lower than the desired level set on your thermostat, the thermostat detects this change and activates the heating process. 2. Your thermostat sends a signal to your heating system to provide heat for your home: Once the thermostat detects the temperature drop, it sends an electrical signal to the heating system, indicating that it needs to turn on and start generating heat. 3. When your oil burner is engaged, heating oil travels from the tank to the burner by way of a pump: As the heating system is activated, a pump pulls heating oil from the storage tank and sends it to the oil burner, preparing it for the combustion process. 4. Here the oil becomes a fine mist mixed with air: Before the heating oil enters the combustion chamber, it is transformed into a fine mist by an atomizing nozzle. This process allows for more efficient combustion, as the oil is mixed with air to create a fuel/air mixture. 5. The fuel/air mixture is then injected into the burner where it is ignited in the combustion chamber: The fine mist of heating oil and air is sprayed into the combustion chamber, where it is ignited by a spark or a hot surface. This combustion generates heat, which is then transferred to the air or water that will be circulated throughout your home. 6. The warm air is disbursed through vents, hot water through baseboards, or by steam radiators: Depending on the heating system in your home, the heat generated by the oil burner is transferred to the air or water used for space heating. If your home uses a forced-air system, the heated air is distributed through vents or ducts. If you have a hydronic (hot water) system, the hot water circulates through baseboards or radiators. Finally, if your home uses a steam radiator system, the steam produced by the heating process is sent to the radiators to release heat into the rooms. Ensuring that the temperature in your home is comfortable and consistent involves a sequence of carefully coordinated steps. Understanding these steps can help you manage and maintain your heating system more effectively, keeping your home warm and your energy expenses in check."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Having a well-paying job often means that an individual has pursued a career in a high-demand, specialized, or competitive field, which in turn has led them to secure a position with a significantly higher salary than those in other professions. In Logan's case, his dedication, hard work, and acquired skills have granted him the opportunity to land an extraordinarily lucrative role, resulting in an annual income surpassing that of Brian. On the other hand, even though Brian may also have a well-paying job, the income he earns annually does not exceed that of Logan. Brian's career path might involve less specialization or lower market demand for his skills, which could partly explain the discrepancy in their earnings. Additionally, factors like experience, education, and specific job responsibilities can contribute to the variation in their income levels. Nevertheless, it's essential to consider that earning a significant income is not the sole measure of one's success or happiness. Both Logan and Brian may derive satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment from their respective professions, regardless of the difference in monetary compensation. Furthermore, one must take into account external factors affecting these individuals' work-life balance, such as job security, benefits, and overall job satisfaction.

Answer this question: n which country was the game chinese checkers invented??","completion":"Chinese Checkers, despite its name, was not invented in China nor is it historically linked to traditional Chinese culture. The game was actually invented in Germany. Chinese Checkers is a modern version of an older game called Halma, which was developed in the late 19th century by an American named George Howard Monks. Halma is a board game played on a square or diamond-shaped board with 16 spaces on each side. The goal of the game is to move all of one's pieces from their starting corner to the opposite corner before the other player does the same. In 1892, a German company called Ravensburger introduced a more simplified version of Halma called \\"Stern-Halma,\\" which translates to \\"Star-Halma.\\" This version of the game featured a star-shaped board, making it faster and easier to play compared to its predecessor. Stern-Halma became highly popular across Europe, and soon reached the United States under the name \\"Chinese Checkers\\" — a complete rebranding to make the game more marketable and exotic. Apart from being called Chinese Checkers, there is no direct influence or connection between the game and Chinese culture or history. The game only retains its name in an attempt to attract consumers and to create an air of mystique around its origins, which has led many to mistakenly believe that it was indeed created in China. To summarize, Chinese Checkers was invented in Germany, as an adaptation of the American game Halma.

As more clouds form overhead, it is expected that the grass will grow faster. This phenomenon can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. The direct impact of the rain is clearly visible when talking about the steps involving the wood; rain falling on the wood, seeping into its surface, permeating the wood, and affecting its finish. However, the grass growing faster, while it may be related to the overall weather conditions, is not directly involved in the process of the wood losing its luster or paint. So, despite not being directly related to the process specified, the grass growing faster can be considered as an indirect perturbation for the following reasons: 1. The faster-growing grass indicates increased levels of moisture and precipitation. This increased moisture in the environment may contribute to the wood being subject to more rainwater exposure, further exacerbating the issue. 2. The growth rate of grass may indirectly influence the rate at which the wood is exposed to and affected by different weather conditions. The more grass grows, the higher the likelihood of trapping additional moisture in the area, which could accelerate the effect of the rain on the wood. Therefore, the supposed perturbation caused by more clouds forming overhead and affecting grass growth can be categorized as indirectly impacting a step of the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Load testing is a critical aspect of software testing that focuses on verifying the performance, reliability, and stability of an application or system under a specified amount of load. In more detail, load testing is essential for determining how a software system will perform under real-world conditions such as high traffic, large data volumes, and multiple simultaneous users. The goal of load testing is to identify potential bottlenecks or performance issues that may impact the end-user experience and ensure that the system is optimized to handle the expected workloads. Load testing typically involves the following processes: 1. Requirements gathering: To get started, it is crucial to gather and understand the performance requirements and objectives of an application, which may include metrics like response times, throughput, and resource utilization. 2. Test planning: In this phase, testers create a detailed plan to load-test the application, including the selection of testing tools, identification of test scenarios, definition of test data requirements, and identification of performance acceptance criteria. 3. Test design: Testers design realistic test scenarios that mimic actual user behavior, data volumes, and concurrent users to ensure that the tests cover different aspects of the system's performance under load. This may include parameterized test scripts and automation scripts for simulating users. 4. Test execution: Using load testing tools, testers inject simulated user loads and run performance tests based on the designed test scenarios. Testers monitor the system's behavior and response during the tests, collecting various performance metrics such as response time, throughput, and error rates. 5. Results analysis: After running the tests, testers analyze the results to identify bottlenecks, resource constraints, or other issues impacting performance. They may use various performance monitoring tools and visualizations to interpret the collected data for more in-depth analysis. 6.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Would trail B be shorter or longer than trail A? David is an entomologist. He recently got interested in ants and their behaviors. To that end, he studied a group of ants, which be labeled as case A. To compare ants with other ant like creatures he studied another hymenopteran group, which he labeled as case B. Moreover, he noticed two distinct trails made by the ants, trail A or trail B. Trail A was followed by many ants, but trail B was abandoned by them. Hint: Ants communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \\"propaganda pheromones\\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to... Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is not explicitly mentioned whether trail B would be shorter or longer than trail A. However, we can deduce some information about the trails from the ants' behavior and their use of pheromones. Ants communicate using pheromones and mark trails leading to food sources. When a forager ant discovers a food source, it marks a trail for other ants to follow. This trail is then reinforced by other ants returning with food, making the trail stronger. Once the food source is exhausted, the ants stop marking the trail, and the scent dissipates. When an obstacle blocks an established trail, ants explore new routes to the food source, marking the shortest route they find. In the given case, trail A was followed by many ants, and trail B was abandoned by them. It is possible that trail B was initially established as a path to a food source, but later the food source was either exhausted or blocked by an obstacle. The ants then stopped marking and reinforcing the trail. On the other hand, trail A might still have a viable food source, explaining the preference of ants for this trail. The ants' behavior of marking the shortest route back to the colony when they find a new path after encountering an obstacle could suggest that trail A is shorter than trail B. However, this is not definitive, as the situation might be more complex. To summarize, it is not explicitly mentioned whether trail B is shorter or longer than trail A, but based on the ants' behavior and their use of pheromones, it could be inferred that trail A might be shorter or more efficient in terms of reaching a viable food source. However, without more context and details, we cannot provide a definitive answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: Eden Log Movie plot: A man wakes up disoriented, deep inside an underground cave. Suffering amnesia, he has no recollection of who he is, or how he got there. A dead man lies next to him. As he stumbles around in the limited light, he comes upon a dilapidated area with damaged pieces of technology all around him. A registration plays, explaining the place is a sort of processing network called Eden Log, whose workers are all immigrants promised citizenship in the society above ground. The workers are apparently harvesting the sap of a gigantic plant whose roots and vines are now everywhere in the underground complex, which appears abandoned. While trying to reach the surface, the man comes upon a bearded stranger pinned against the wall by the protruding vines that are slowly taking over his body. The stranger, in great pain and sounding deranged, tells the man he's the creator of that entire system, and then warns him about an unseen menace. A growling noise approaches and the man loses consciousness. Upon waking up, the man keeps going up, passing throughout areas increasingly better-lit. He retrieves more recordings, revealing that one of the network technicians refused to give access to security personnel. It becomes clear that some kind of revolt was started by the workers over the conditions in the network. As a result, the corporate overlords ordered the security forces to forcibly take control of the network levels and seal the area.

Bach structured the cantata in eight movements: an instrumental sinfonia and seven vocal movements corresponding to the stanzas of the hymn. The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work. The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones).

Woodes Rogers spent part of his childhood in Poole, England, where he likely attended the local school; his father, who owned shares in many ships, was often away nine months of the year with the Newfoundland fishing fleet. Sometime between 1690 and 1696, Captain Rogers moved his family to Bristol. In November 1697, Woodes Rogers was apprenticed to Bristol mariner John Yeamans, to learn the profession of a sailor. The ships then went to the Dutch port of Batavia in what is now Indonesia, where Rogers underwent surgery to remove a musket ball from the roof of his mouth, and the expedition disposed of the less seaworthy of the two Spanish prizes. Dealing with the Dutch there constituted a violation of the British East India Company's monopoly. When the ships finally dropped anchor in the Thames River on 14 October 1711, a legal battle ensued, with the investors paying the East India Company PS6,000 (about PS820,000 at today's values) as settlement for their claim for breach of monopoly, about four percent of what Rogers brought back. The investors approximately doubled their money, while Rogers gained PS1,600 (now worth perhaps PS218,700) from a voyage which disfigured him and cost him his brother, who was killed in a battle in the Pacific. The money was probably less than he could have made at home, and was entirely absorbed by the debts his family had incurred in his absence. However, the long voyage and the capture of the Spanish ship made Rogers a national hero. Rogers was the first Englishman, in circumnavigating the globe, to have his original ships and most of his crew survive. After his voyage, he wrote an account of it, titled A Cruising Voyage Round the World. Edward Cooke, an officer aboard Duchess, also wrote a book, A Voyage to the South Sea and Round the World, and beat Rogers to print by several months. Rogers' book was much more successful, with many readers fascinated by the account of Selkirk's rescue, which Cooke had slighted. Among those interested in Selkirk's adventure was Daniel Defoe, who appears to have read about it, and fictionalised the story as Robinson Crusoe. While Rogers' book enjoyed financial success, it had a practical purpose--to aid British navigators and possible colonists. Much of Rogers' introduction is devoted to advocacy for the South Seas trade. Rogers notes that had there been a British colony in the South Seas, he would not have had to worry about food supplies for his crew. A third of Rogers' book is devoted to detailed descriptions of the places that he explored, with special emphasis on \\"such [places] as may be of most use for enlarging our trade\\". He describes the area of the River Plate in detail because it lay \\"within the limits of the South Sea Company\\", whose schemes had not yet burst into financial scandal. Rogers' book was carried by such South Pacific navigators as Admiral George Anson and privateering captains John Clipperton and George Shelvocke.

According to the National Reading Survey, before the 17thWorld Reading Day on April 23, only 1.2 percent of Chinese people said they read a lot. But 38.6 percent said they read on digital devices like cell phone and e-books. This is a 17.7 percent increase from 2010. Many experts are talking about a trend toward fragmented reading --reading many short messages or items on a digital device like a cell phone instead of one long text in a book. Zhao jianmin, a professor at Shanghai University, said fragmented reading was part of modern life. \\"The fast _ of life leaves many people no time to sit and read a whole book,\\" he said. \\"So making use of fragmented time to read is sure to be a trend\\" Fragmented reading has its advantages. People can enjoy large amounts of information, knowledge and entertainment in a short time. Digital reading is faster than traditional deep reading. However, some experts fear the trend of digital reading will lead people to read in a simple way. Xu Guosheng, at a Chinese Academy of Press and Publication, says fragmented reading makes it harder for people to think more about what they read.

Article: Everyone's at it, even my neighbors. I thought I might be the only person left in the world who hadn't done an eBay deal. So I decided to try my hand at online auction. Buying for beginners: Sign up on www.eBay.co.uk. Most items (e.g. tables, computers, and books) ready for auction will come with a picture and a short description; others may be marked with \\"Buy It Now\\" and have a fixed price. You can buy these right away. If the item is being auctioned, you offer the highest price you are prepared to pay and eBay bids for you.The bid will be increased little by little until it goes beyond your highest bid, then you are emailed and asked if you would like to bid again. Auctions last up to 10 days, and when they finish you get an email telling you whether you have won the item. How to pay: Sellers decide how they would like to be paid and you need to check this before placing a bid as you might not want to post a cheque or postal orders. The easiest way is through PayPal, an online payment system that takes the money away from your credit card. Selling made simple: If you plan to sell on eBay, it helps to include a picture of the item.I followed my friends' advice and put up the items I wanted to sell for a 10-day auction, starting on a Thursday.This way buyers had two weekends to bid. The big things in life: It's easy to post a small item, but furniture is a big part of eBay and this has to be collected or sent by delivery men.Check the ways of delivery before you bid.

A list contains numbers separated by a comma. You need to round every integer to the closest power of 2. A power of 2 is a number in the form '2^n', it is a number that is the result of multiplying by 2 n times. The following are all powers of 2, '2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096'. If an integer is exactly in equally far from two different powers of 2 then you should output the larger power of 2. The output should be a list of integers that is the result of rounding each integer int the input list to the closest power of 2. The output should include a '[' to denote the start of the output list and ']' to denote the end of the output list. Input: [83, 716, 2048, 2638] Output:","completion":"To complete this task, I will follow these steps: 1. Extract the numbers from the input list. 2. For each number, determine the closest power of 2. 3. If the number is equally far from two different powers of 2, choose the larger power of 2. 4. Store the found closest powers of 2 in a new list. 5. Format the output list with a '[' at the beginning and ']' at the end. Now, let's perform these steps for the given input: [83, 716, 2048, 2638] Step 1: Extract numbers from the input list. The given input is already a list: [83, 716, 2048, 2638]. Step 2-3: Determine the closest power of 2 for each number, choosing the larger power of 2 if necessary. 83 is closer to 64 (2^6) than 128 (2^7), so the closest power of 2 for 83 is 64. 716 is closer to 512 (2^9) than 1024 (2^10), so the closest power of 2 for 716 is 512. 2048 is already a power of 2 (2^11), so the closest power of 2 for 2048 is 2048. 2638 is closer to 2048 (2^11) than 4096 (2^12), so the closest power of 2 for 2638 is 2048. Step 4: Store the found closest powers of 2 in a new list. The new list containing the closest powers of 2 found is [64, 512, 2048, 2048].

Among them is British journalist David Frost, currently recording a talk show in Australia, who decides to interview Nixon. Nixonâs literary agent, Irving \\"Swifty\\" Lazar, believes the interview would be an opportunity for Nixon to salvage his reputation, and to make some money. Nixon ultimately demands 600,000, and Frost accepts. After persuading his friend and producer John Birt that the interviews would be a success, Frost and Birt travel to California to meet with Nixon. On the plane to California, Frost flirts with a young woman called Caroline Cushing, and they begin a relationship. Frost struggles to sell the interviews to U.S. networks, and decides to finance the project with private money and syndicate the broadcast of the interviews. He hires two investigators â Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr. â to help him prepare, along with Birt. Frost is not clear on what he wants from the interview, and Reston encourages him to aim for a confession from Nixon. Under the watchful eye of Nixon's post-presidential chief of staff, Jack Brennan, Frost and Nixon embark on the first three recording sessions. Restricted by an agreed-upon timeframe and under pressure from his own team to ask the tough questions, Frost struggles to get a word in as Nixon dominates with lengthy and self-serving monologues, fencing ably on Vietnam and boasting about his achievements in foreign policy. Behind the scenes, Frost's editorial team is nervous about his interviewing technique, and angry that Nixon appears to be exonerating himself. Four days before the final session, which will center on Watergate, Frost receives a phonecall from an inebriated Nixon.

Given the question: Information: - A hobby is a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time. Hobbies can include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. A list of hobbies is lengthy and always changing as interests and fashions change. By continually participating in a particular hobby, one can acquire substantial skill and knowledge in that area. Engagement in hobbies has increased since the late nineteenth century as workers have more leisure time and advancing production and technology have provided more support for leisure activities. As some hobbies have become less popular, like stamp collecting, others have been created following technological advances, like video games. - Model building as a hobby involves the creation of models either from kits or from materials and components acquired by the builder . Categories of modelling include : Scale model building Live steam models Matchstick models Military models Model aircraft Model cars Model commercial vehicles Model construction vehicles Building models Architectural models Model figures Model military vehicles Rail transport modelling Model rockets Model ships Freelance model Cardboard engineering Firearm models ( See Airsoft guns ) Gundam Models - The hobby of collecting includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining whatever items are of interest to the individual collector. The scope of collecting is unlimited: \\"If something exists, somebody somewhere collects them.\\" - Leisure has been defined as a quality of experience or as free time. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - Stamp collecting is the collecting of postage stamps and related objects. It is related to philately which is the study of stamps. It has been one of the world's most popular hobbies since the late nineteenth century with the rapid growth of the postal service, but is now in decline with the rise of the internet which has sharply reduced the number of postal items arriving in households. Stamp collecting proved to be an almost perfect hobby for collectors because there was a never ending stream of new stamps as each country sought to advertise its distinctiveness through its stamps. Because some stamps became rare, a thriving international trade in stamps was created. While stamp collectors are of all ages, it has been particularly popular hobby among children, many of whom continued the hobby as adults. Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'subclass of' with the subject 'model building'.

Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - Morocco (', lit. \\"The West\\"; '), officially known as the Kingdom of Morocco (', lit. \\"The Western Kingdom\\"; '), is a sovereign country located in the Maghreb region of North Africa. Geographically, Morocco is characterized by a rugged mountainous interior, large tracts of desert, and a lengthy coastline along the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. - The Saadi dynasty or Saadian dynasty (Arabic: , \\"as-saadin\\"; Berber: , \\"Isdiyen\\"; original name Bani Zaydan) was a dynasty that ruled Morocco from 1549 to 1659. - Zidan Abu Maali (? September 1627) was the embattled Sultan of Morocco from 1603 to 1627, ruling only over the southern half of the country after, his brother took the northern half and a Sanhaji rebel from Tafilalt (Ahmed ibn Abi Mahalli) marched on Marrakesh claiming to be the Mahdi. All of which exacerbated by, a context of chaos that ensued a plague pandemic which left a third of the country dead, the end of the Anglo-Spanish war (Treaty of London (1604)) which broke the Anglo-Dutch axis that Morocco was relying upon as a means of protection from Spain, and so caused the Spanish navy to resume devastating raids on the Moroccan coast and the rebellion of one of his provincial governors who established his own independent republic between Azemmour and Salé. He was the son and appointed hair of Ahmad al-Mansur, and resided mostly in Safi where he became encircled after being driven out of Marrakesh and failed military campaigns against the rebellious brother in the north. - Ahmad I al-Mansur (also El-Mansour Eddahbi [the Golden], ; and Ahmed el-Mansour; 1549 in Fes 25 August 1603, outskirts of Fes) was Sultan of the Saadi dynasty from 1578 to his death in 1603, the sixth and most famous of all rulers of the Saadis. Ahmad al-Mansur was an important figure in both Europe and Africa in the sixteenth century, his powerful army and strategic location made him an important power player in the late Renaissance period. - Abu Faris Abdallah , nicknamed al - Wathik Billah ( 1564 -- 1608 ) was a ruler of the Saadi dynasty .

He especially fought his brother Zidan Abu Maali ( r. 1603 -- 1627 ) . - Sultan (') is a noble title with several historical meanings. Originally, it was an Arabic abstract noun meaning \\"strength\\", \\"authority\\", \\"rulership\\", derived from the verbal noun ', meaning \\"authority\\" or \\"power\\".

He identified three planets, planet A, planet B and planet C. Little did he know that less than a hundred years ago people used to call planet A as Earth, planet B as Venus, and planet C as Mercury. Which planet would have lower pressure on the surface, planet A or planet B? Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Answer:","completion":"To determine which planet has lower pressure on the surface between planet A and planet B, let's examine the given information. 1.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Today's generation is chock full of people that feel unaccomplished. You could get all existential about your life, but that won't get you anywhere. Instead, put your mind to something and do it. The action of getting something done will show you that you can overcome challenges, and make you feel capable, useful, and worthwhile. It can be anything. Run a 10k. Overcome your shyness. Become a wine connoisseur. Whatever you can see yourself enjoying for a long time will be worth your while. But remember: the harder it is, the bigger the payoff. Losing 5 pounds is great, but losing 10 might make you feel twice as good. This is similar to the previous step. But mastering something, becoming a true expert, will give you a sense of identity, knowledge, and a great feeling of internal satisfaction. Whatever you're good at now, throw yourself into 150%. The payoff will be unimaginable. When you become an expert, you know you're truly good at something. There is no room for doubt, no room for negativity. This can become a haven of positivity, reassurance, and relaxation. And, inevitably, it'll be a part of your everyday life. So if you've been hiding the fact that you play the bagpipes for 8 years now, let 'er out. This is also similar to the last two steps -- in fact, they can all be intertwined. Your resolution could be to become a painter. But back to the point -- creating something is so validating, especially in today's world. We walk through turning on lights with the flick of a switch, talking to people through screens, and sitting down as we scoot down the highway. Everything is done for us. Create something yourself and you become one of the few who are resourceful, knowledgeable, and tuned in. Once more, it doesn't matter what it is. Sure, a new irrigation system for the Congo would be super great for the world at large, but making a duct tape bag gets you thinking creatively, too. What can you do with your set of talents and skills? This doesn't work for everyone, but it could work for you. Ever gone on a run and felt a thousand times better after (or three times better)? That's it. That's the feeling. Putting your body to work might get your brain on the right track. It's too easy to get cooped up at the office and consider the 20-foot walk into Starbucks to be your daily gallivant with nature. Go for a walk. Get outside. Feel the sun. You'll wake up, you'll feel more energized, and you'll feel more mentally energized. Old habits may be impossible to erase from your brain, but they aren’t impossible to break. Instead of trying to eradicate old habits, develop healthier, stronger alternatives that bypass the old ones. Developing new habits takes time, but once they are established, they’re with you for life. Do some exercise! Go swimming and try a dive that you have never done before. Go to a dance class and try a style of dance that you don't know. Or try a whole new sport! Volunteer. Working with children, puppies, and the poor are great ways to feel good about yourself. And the feeling is almost instantaneous. Want to feel happy? Go to the hospital with a puppy and ask for the cancer ward. Done.

Originally setting his sights on the Indianapolis 500, Cole realizes that \\"To win in Indy I'd need a great car, but stock cars are all the same\\". He is recruited by Chevrolet dealership tycoon Tim Daland to race for his team in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series. Daland brings former crew chief and car builder Harry Hogge out of retirement to lead Cole's pit crew. After Cole sets a fast time in a private test at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Hogge builds him a new Chevrolet Lumina. In his first few races, Cole has difficulty adjusting to the larger NASCAR stock cars and communicating with his crew, while being intimidated on the track by Winston Cup Champion and dirty driver Rowdy Burns; these obstacles, combined with crashes and blown engines, prevent Cole from finishing the races. Discovering that Cole does not understand common NASCAR terminology, Harry puts him through rigorous training.

It appeared in the late Devonian period (Famennian age) about 365 million years ago, and was anatomically intermediate between lobe-finned fishes and those that were fully capable of coming onto land. - The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, Mya. The name \\"Carboniferous\\" means \\"coal-bearing\\" and derives from the Latin words \\"carb\\" (\\"coal\\") and \\"fer\\" (\\"I bear, I carry\\"), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian. - Eogyrinus attheyi ( from Greek eos , meaning \`\` dawn '' , and gyrinos , meaning \`\` tadpole '' ) was one of the largest Carboniferous tetrapods , and perhaps one of the largest of its family , Eogyrinidae , at 4.6 metres ( 15 ft ) in length . Eogyrinus appears to have been a powerful swimmer that moved quickly through the water by swishing its long tail from side to side . It may have been a predator , lying in wait for prey in much the same way as a modern crocodile . It was a lightly built animal , weighing around 560 kilograms ( 1,230 lb ) . Although probably better at hunting in the water , Eogyrinus could probably have also made a grab for prey passing close by on land . Fossils of Eogyrinus are known from northern England . Recent studies by Jennifer A. Clack suggest that the amphibian Pholiderpeton described by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1869 is the same animal as Eogyrinus . If this is so , then Pholiderpeton 's name takes priority . - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - Eogyrinidae is an extinct family of large, long-bodied tetrapods that lived in the rivers of the Late Carboniferous period.

In a Monday press conference in Seoul, the company said early Galaxy Note 7 fires were caused by ill-fitting battery components, the BBC reports. In replacement phones, defects including welding issues and a lack of insulation were to blame, the company said. Samsung issued a recall last year after widely reported cases of the phone catching fire and exploding.

Write a text based on this summary: australian treasurer says current account deficit a wake up call Text:","completion":"Title: Australian Treasurer Declares Current Account Deficit a Wake-Up Call In recent news, the Australian Treasurer has voiced concerns over the country's current account deficit. This economic issue has arisen as a wake-up call for the nation, urging policymakers and citizens to address structural and budgetary challenges in order to ensure long-term prosperity. The current account deficit, which represents a gap between the value of goods and services a country exports and the value of goods and services it imports, has dramatically widened in recent months. This deficit, coupled with a range of other economic indicators, highlights Australia's vulnerability and the urgent need for strong economic policy reforms. According to the Treasurer, one of the primary contributors to the current account deficit is a decline in export earnings, caused in part by the global economic slowdown and lower demand for Australian commodities. Additionally, Australia has been grappling with persistent trade deficits, diminishing investments, and lower productivity levels – all factors that have placed increased pressure on the nation's current account balance. Moreover, Australia's current account deficit has resulted in an increased reliance on foreign capital. This has the potential to compromise the country's financial stability, should global financial markets undergo a downturn or if investors lose confidence in Australia's economy. As a result, the Treasurer is urging the government to address these issues through strategic planning and policy implementation. Several steps have been proposed to tackle the current account deficit and associated economic challenges: 1. Boosting productivity – There is a pressing need to improve national productivity through investments in infrastructure, education, and skills development. By increasing productivity, Australia can strengthen its competitiveness in global markets and bolster export revenues. 2. Encouraging innovation – Supporting research and development in key sectors such as technology, agriculture, and energy can help Australia diversify its economy and reduce dependence on the commodities market. 3. Enhancing fiscal responsibility – The government should prioritize more efficient spending, reducing the budget deficit, and managing public debt to create a sound financial environment. 4. Focusing on domestic demand – Policymakers should take measures to encourage private sector investment and consumer spending, fostering sustainable economic growth that is less reliant on external factors. 5. Nurturing sustainable relationships – The government should pursue trade agreements and partnerships that create opportunities for economic cooperation and mutual growth with other countries. The Treasurer's remarks on the current account deficit reveal a sense of urgency within the Australian government to address these long-standing economic issues that have accumulated over time. By implementing policy changes and strategic initiatives that address productivity, innovation, fiscal responsibility, domestic demand, and international relationships, Australia can work towards rebalancing its current account and fostering an economy built on stable growth and prosperity. In conclusion, the Australian Treasurer's recent statement on the current account deficit serves as a wake-up call to the nation. The current economic situation is a warning signal that highlights the need for decisive action and a reevaluation of Australia's economic trajectory. It is essential that the government, policymakers, and citizens come together to address the challenges posed by the current account deficit and ensure a brighter economic future for Australia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.

Summarize the following movie reviews: 1. Arnold's last barbarian role -- worth it for that if nothing else. 2. The scene where Nielsen stands at the molten river border of the 'land of eternal night' looks particularly good. 3. Mr. Fleischer brings absolutely no playfulness to what might, at least, have been enjoyably light. And he brings out the worst in a cast that was ill-chosen to begin with. 4. Horrible spawn of the mediocre Conan the Barbarian. 5. Worst of all, there's a charmless brat prince for Sonja to take under her wing. 6. It's a truly horrible concoction, filled with stiff, overly serious dialogue, wretched performances, bad lighting and a lazy score by the otherwise great Ennio Morricone. 7. Unwatchably bad sword-and-sorcery nonsense. 8. ...pure silliness, but not silly enough to qualify as amusing. Face it; it's just dull. 9. The film is at least as good as Conan the Destroyer. Which is faint praise, indeed. 10. Sure, there are a few funny moments here and there with several obviously intended jokes, but director Richard Fleischer never milks the elements of self-parody for what they're worth.","completion":"The movie reviews describe a film featuring Arnold's last barbarian role and impressive visuals, such as the molten river border scene. However, it suffers from Mr. Fleischer's lack of playfulness, a poorly chosen cast, and being a subpar follow-up to Conan the Barbarian.

First, let's combine the terms with b (-446*b and -2362*b): -446*b - 2362*b = -2808*b. 2. Now, the equation will look like this: -2808*b - 92664 = 0. 3. We want to move the -92664 to the other side of the equation. To do this, we need to add 92664 to both sides: -2808*b = 92664. 4. Now, we need to find the value of b. To do this, we'll divide both sides by -2808: b = 92664 / -2808. 5. After calculation, we find that b is approximately equal to -33. So, the answer is b = -33."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: However, in English, the term madrasah usually refers to the specifically Islamic institutions. A typical Islamic school usually offers two courses of study: a ḥifẓ course teaching memorization of the Qur'an (the person who commits the entire Qurʼan to memory is called a ḥāfiẓ); and an ʻālim course leading the candidate to become an accepted scholar in the community. A regular curriculum includes courses in Arabic, tafsir (Qur'anic interpretation), sharīʻah (Islamic law), hadiths (recorded sayings and deeds of Muhammad), mantiq (logic), and Muslim history. In the Ottoman Empire, during the Early Modern Period, the study of hadiths was introduced by Süleyman I. Depending on the educational demands, some madaris also offer additional advanced courses in Arabic literature, English and other foreign languages, as well as science and world history. Ottoman madaris along with religious teachings also taught \\"styles of writing, grammary, syntax, poetry, composition, natural sciences, political sciences, and etiquette.\\" What is the answer to this question: What is shariah?","completion":"Shariah, also spelled as sharīʻah, is the Islamic law derived from the Quran (the holy book of Islam) and Hadiths (recorded sayings and deeds of Prophet Muhammad).

Write a question about the following article: Coming off their road win over the Panthers, the Cowboys closed out the regular season at FedExField in a Week 17 NFC East rematch with the Washington Redskins. With the #1 seed already wrapped up, the Cowboys had little to play for and rested many of their starters in the 2nd half. In the first quarter, Dallas trailed early with Redskins RB Clinton Portis getting a 23-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, Washington increased its lead with kicker Shaun Suisham getting a 46-yard field goal. The Cowboys would respond with rookie kicker Nick Folk getting a 37-yard field goal, but the Redskins replied with Suisham kicking a 21-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Washington continued to lead as Portis got a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Redskins pulled away as QB Todd Collins completed a 42-yard TD pass to WR Santana Moss. Dallas would end the game with Folk nailing a 30-yard field goal. With the loss, the Cowboys ended the regular season at 13-3, along with the NFC's #1 seed. The Cowboys secured a bye and home field advantage throughout the playoffs with an NFC best 13-3 regular season record. Fresh off a bye week, the #1 seed Cowboys hosted the #5 seed New York Giants in the Divisional round of the playoffs. The Giants were fresh off an upset win over the #4 seed Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Tampa Bay in the Wild Card round. It would be the third time the NFC East division rivals faced off against each other that season, with the Cowboys winning the previous two matchups. The Giants took the opening kickoff and came out firing, hitting the Cowboys with a quick 52 yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning to Amani Toomer. The Cowboys and Giants would exchange punts on the next 2 series before the Cowboy marched 96 yards down the field, scoring on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Tony Romo to Terrell Owens (which was reviewed and upheld), tying the score at 7-7. The Cowboys never faced a 3rd down on the drive. With the 2nd quarter underway, the Giants would punt on the next series, giving the ball to the Cowboys at their own 10 yard line with 11:21 left in the 2nd quarter. The Cowboys would proceed to march methodically down the field in small chunks, as they burned up all but 61 seconds of the clock before Marion Barber bulled into the end zone on a 1-yard touchdown run, making it 14-7 in the Cowboys favor (the play was reviewed but upheld). With just 61 seconds left in the half, the Giants seemed to catch the Cowboys' defense napping as they quickly marched down the field from their own 29 yard line, stunning the Cowboys with a 4-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Toomer with 11 seconds left in the half. It was Manning and Toomer's 2nd touchdown connection of the first half. The game went into halftime with the score tied at 14-14. The Cowboys took the opening kickoff, and much like their last drive in the first half, proceeded to march very slowly down the field, gaining yards in small chunks. After a drop by tight end Anthony Fasano in the end zone, the Cowboys' long drive stalled out and they had to settle for a 34-yard FG from kicker Nick Folk, to make it 17-14 for the Cowboys. The drive took up over 8 minutes of the 3rd quarter. The next 2 series of the game resulted in punts. After a 25-yard punt return, the Giants had excellent field position at the Dallas 37 yard line. The drive went into the start of the 4th quarter, where Brandon Jacobs rumbled into the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown, to make it 21-17 for the Giants. As the 4th quarter ticked on, both teams exchanged punts on the next 4 series. With 1:50 left in the game, the Cowboys took over on the Giants 48 yard line after a short punt return. They marched down to the Giants 22 yard line with 31 seconds left, still trailing 21-17. On 3rd and 11, with 21 seconds left, Romo lofted a pass into the corner of the end zone that dropped just in front of receiver Patrick Crayton, who had a couple steps on his defender. Replays showed that Crayton hesitated at the top of his route instead of running straight into the end zone, which is where Romo expected him. The pass fell incomplete as a result. Now on 4th down and 11, with just 16 seconds left, Romo heaved a desperation pass into the back of the end zone, into double coverage, which was intercepted by Giants cornerback R.W. McQuarters, effectively ending the game, 21-17 Giants. The 2007 Dallas Cowboy season ended in disappointment, after raising huge hopes with a spectacular 13-3 regular season, the best season for the Cowboys since their last Super Bowl season of 1995. The Giants would go on to shock the undefeated New England Patriots in the Super Bowl.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The first MP4 player was born years ago. Soon many music fans were wondering how fantastic it is! If you have been into technology enough, perhaps you may have a knowledge of the MP4. If not, you do need to know something before buying one, even if you are familiar with MP3. MP3 is the CD-like disc with greater capacity. How about MP4? This small digital product will really enrich the joy from listening to music. You can even feel the \\"touch\\" of music to your soul! Now, some similar digital products advertised as \\"MP4 players\\" are simply MP3 players, which do not play video and MPEG format and also lack other particular functions. These products confuse some buyers, as they may think the \\"MP4\\" players simply mean they can do more than MP3. What is MP4?! It is a multimedia container. It is not only used to store digital audio and digital video streams, especially those of MPEG, but can also be used to store other data such as subtitles and pictures. As a most modern container format, it allows streaming over the Internet. With the help of a piece of MP4 video equipment, you can change various programs such as MPEG to MP4, ASX to MP4, AVI to MP4 and so on, which can be done very quickly and easily without any effect on the sound quality. By installing DVD-MP4 software, you can transfer particular music from a DVD to an MP4 video file. It really excites your listening music experience. Then, there is MP4 advanced and you can set your own collection of all the programs -- TV shows, games, and music. You can even see movies which are still running in cinemas. _ ? Question: From the last sentence, it's clear that the writer tries to tell us it is _ .

The ability to set your own collection of TV shows, games, music, and view currently running movies as mentioned in the last sentence, display the unique features of an MP4 player. This suggests that buying an MP4 will be a smart choice, therefore option C: a very wise choice to buy an MP4, aligns well with the author's intent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Where did Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit originate from?\\" Context: \\"Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\\" Answer:","completion":"Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit, or the unique cultural identity associated with Ashkenazi Jews, originated from the diverse historical, religious, and cultural experiences of Jewish communities residing in Central and Eastern Europe. The development of Yiddishkeit was influenced by various factors such as the migration of Jewish communities throughout Europe, their interaction with surrounding non-Jewish cultures, the religious and cultural practices adopted by these communities, as well as the challenges they faced due to persecution and discrimination. Jewish migration to Europe began in the late Roman period, with the Jewish population expanding into the Rhineland region (comprising present-day Germany and France) during the 9th and 10th centuries. Here, they were exposed to a new cultural milieu, as they came into contact with the Germanic and Latin-speaking Christian population. These early Ashkenazi communities began to develop their unique Jewish identity through the synthesis of their traditional Jewish practices and customs with elements of their new European environment. The development of the Yiddish language itself played a crucial role in shaping Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit. Yiddish, with its combination of Hebrew, Aramaic, German, and Slavic elements, emerged as the lingua franca of Ashkenazi Jewish communities. The Yiddish language not only facilitated communication within the Jewish diaspora but also became an essential medium through which Ashkenazi Jews expressed their religious and cultural beliefs as well as their creativity, including literature, poetry, and theater. The distinctive religious practices of Ashkenazi Jews also contributed to the development of Yiddishkeit. The study of sacred texts like the Torah and Talmud, adherence to Jewish Law, and observance of rituals and holidays formed the core of Ashkenazi religious life. As the Ashkenazi communities faced persecution and expulsion from various European countries, they developed a strong sense of communal solidarity and an unwavering commitment to their faith and traditions. Additionally, the rise of Hasidism in the 18th century offered a more spiritual and mystical dimension to the religious profile of Ashkenazi Jews, which contributed to a rich and diverse tapestry of Ashkenazi religious experience. Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit underwent significant changes with the advent of Haskalah, or the Jewish Enlightenment, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Haskalah aimed to modernize Jewish life by promoting secular education, embracing European culture, and advocating for the emancipation of the Jewish population. As a result, many Ashkenazi Jews began to explore various cultural, intellectual, and political movements outside traditional religious frameworks, such as secularism, socialism, and Zionism. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, continuing political and social upheaval, including the mass migration of Ashkenazi Jews to other parts of the world like the United States and the foundation of the State of Israel, further diversified and reshaped the contours of Yiddishkeit. As their diasporic experience expanded, the cultural horizons of Ashkenazi Jews grew to encompass not only religious and traditional forms of Jewishness but also an eclectic array of expressions and identities within the cultural, political, and artistic spectrum. Today, Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit represents a multifaceted and dynamic cultural identity that has evolved over centuries of complex interactions between the Jewish populations and their surrounding environments. While there has been a decline in the use of the Yiddish language, Yiddishkeit is still identifiable through the artistic and cultural expressions, values, humor, social patterns, culinary traditions, and narratives that continue to enrich the lives of Ashkenazi Jews and the broader Jewish experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: If lions live in communities called prides, then what are lion communities called? Answer choices: - complex - PDAs - groups - protected - prides - murders - flocks - dangerous Answer:","completion":"Lion communities are called prides. A pride of lions typically consists of several adult females and their offspring, along with one or more adult males that serve as the dominant protectors and breeders within the group. The size of a pride can vary greatly, with some prides consisting of as few as 3 lions, while others may have 40 or more members. Prides have a complex social structure that allows them to efficiently work together as a group. Female lions, also known as lionesses, are typically related and form the core of the pride. They are responsible for hunting and providing food for the entire group. Lionesses work together in a collaborative manner to stalk and capture prey, using their exceptional stealth and speed to increase their chances of success. Male lions in a pride, on the other hand, are focused on protecting the group and its territory from rival prides or other potential threats. These males are usually related, either being siblings or cousins, and form coalitions to help support each other in warding off intruders. The dominant male, or males, have the privilege of mating with the pride's females, fathering the cubs, and ensuring the continuation of their genetic line. It is important to note that lions are not the only animals to have a unique name for their social groups. For instance, groups of crows are called murders, while gatherings of geese are referred to as flocks. These collective nouns provide a convenient and descriptive way to refer to the specific social structures that different animals form. The term \\"pride\\" for a lion community highlights the importance of cooperation and collaboration within these groups. Lions depend on one another for survival, with both males and females playing vital roles in the pride's overall success. The structure of a pride allows lions to thrive in their habitats, working together to overcome challenges like finding food, raising cubs, and defending their territory from rivals or other threats. In conclusion, lion communities are called prides. Prides are groups of lions that consist of related females, their offspring, and dominant males. This unique social structure enables a pride to work as a cohesive unit, utilizing each member's skills and strengths to ensure the successful hunting, reproduction, and protection of the community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

What might be the first step of the process?","completion":"The first step in the overall process of liver functions is blood filtration. When the blood from the digestive system enters the liver (via the hepatic portal vein), it filters and processes the nutrients, toxins, and waste products present in the blood. This is essential for maintaining the body's overall metabolic balance and preparing substances for further processing or excretion. Here's a breakdown of the functions you mentioned, including their first steps: 1. Bile production: The first step in bile production is synthesizing bile acids from cholesterol. Bile acids are then combined with other substances, like bilirubin and phospholipids, to form bile. Bile is then stored in the gallbladder and released into the small intestine for digestion when needed. 2. Protein production for blood plasma: The liver synthesizes various proteins, including albumin and clotting factors. The initial process involves the translation of amino acids into specific protein chains, based on the information encoded in DNA. These proteins are then folded and modified, if necessary, before being secreted into the bloodstream. 3. Conversion of excess glucose into glycogen for storage: The first step in this process is the phosphorylation of glucose, in which a phosphate group is added to glucose by an enzyme called hexokinase. This creates glucose-6-phosphate, which then undergoes a series of reactions to be converted into glycogen. 4. Conversion of ammonia to urea: The first step in the urea cycle is the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia and bicarbonate, catalyzed by the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. The subsequent steps involve a series of enzymatic reactions, ultimately producing urea, which is excreted by the kidneys. 5. Regulation of blood clotting: The liver primarily achieves this by producing clotting factors, such as fibrinogen, prothrombin, and factors V, VII, IX, and X. The first step in the synthesis of these clotting factors involves the transcription of specific genes that code for these proteins, followed by translation and post-translational modification, as necessary. These clotting factors are then secreted into the bloodstream, where they play a crucial role in initiating and regulating the blood clotting process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Georgette Heyer (; 16 August 1902 - 4 July 1974) was an English historical romance and detective fiction novelist. Her writing career began in 1921, when she turned a story for her younger brother into the novel The Black Moth. While holidaying with her family in December 1920, Heyer met George Ronald Rougier, who was two years her senior. The two became regular dance partners while Rougier studied at the Royal School of Mines to become a mining engineer. In the spring of 1925, shortly after the publication of her fifth novel, they became engaged. One month later, Heyer's father died of a heart attack. He left no pension, and Heyer assumed financial responsibility for her brothers, aged 19 and 14. Two months after her father's death, on 18 August, Heyer and Rougier married in a simple ceremony. In October 1925 Rougier was sent to work in the Caucasus Mountains, partly because he had learned Russian as a child. Heyer remained at home and continued to write. In 1926, she released These Old Shades, in which the Duke of Avon courts his own ward. Unlike her first novel, These Old Shades focused more on personal relationships than on adventure. The book appeared in the midst of the 1926 United Kingdom general strike; as a result, the novel received no newspaper coverage, reviews, or advertising. Nevertheless, the book sold 190,000 copies. Because the lack of publicity had not harmed the novel's sales, Heyer refused for the rest of her life to promote her books, even though her publishers often asked her to give interviews. She once wrote to a friend that \\"as for being photographed at Work or in my Old World Garden, that is the type of publicity which I find nauseating and quite unnecessary. My private life concerns no one but myself and my family.\\" Rougier returned home in the summer of 1926, but within months he was sent to the East African territory of Tanganyika. Heyer joined him there the following year. They lived in a hut made of elephant grass located in the bush; Heyer was the first white woman her servants had ever seen. While in Tanganyika, Heyer wrote The Masqueraders; set in 1745, the book follows the romantic adventures of siblings who pretend to be of the opposite sex in order to protect their family, all former Jacobites. Although Heyer did not have access to all of her reference material, the book contained only one anachronism: she placed the opening of White's a year too early. She also wrote an account of her adventures, titled \\"The Horned Beast of Africa\\", which was published in 1929 in the newspaper The Sphere. In 1928, Heyer followed her husband to Macedonia, where she almost died after a dentist improperly administered an anaesthetic. She insisted they return to England before starting a family. The following year Rougier left his job, making Heyer the primary breadwinner. After a failed experiment running a gas, coke, and lighting company, Rougier purchased a sports shop in Horsham with money they borrowed from Heyer's aunts. Heyer's brother Boris lived above the shop and helped Rougier, while Heyer continued to provide the bulk of the family's earnings with her writing.

It won the MTV Movie Spoof Award at the MTV Movie Awards 2007. The short was created by Andy Signore along with some of his friends. During his speech, he said, roughly, \\"The film was not making fun of a tragedy; it was a tribute to those who stood up against tyranny\\". Can we infer the following? United 300 was banned from some schools","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is not explicitly stated that United 300 was banned from some schools. The film is a parody of two popular movies, \\"United 93\\" and \\"300\\", and was created by Andy Signore along with his friends. The film won the MTV Movie Spoof Award at the MTV Movie Awards in 2007, which signifies its recognition and appreciation within the entertainment industry. However, this does not necessarily imply that the film faced any ban or restrictions, particularly in schools. According to Signore's statement during his speech, the short film was intended as a tribute to those who stood up against tyranny, rather than making fun of a tragedy. This suggests that the creators of the parody were mindful of the potential sensitivity around the themes of the films being spoofed, especially \\"United 93\\", which is based on the real-life events of the September 11, 2001 attacks. It is possible that some schools might have disapproved of the film due to its subject matter or the nature of parody, especially if they have concerns related to the way the film handles real-life tragedies or the historical events depicted in the movies it parodies. However, without further information specifically indicating that United 300 was banned from some schools, it would be speculative to make that inference. In conclusion, while it is not possible to definitively state whether or not United 300 was banned from some schools based on the provided information, it is essential to recognize that the creators of the parody intended it as a tribute and not as a way of making fun of tragic events. To accurately determine if the film faced any restrictions or bans, further research would be necessary to corroborate such claims."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, this could be about an Australian sculptor named Bronwyn Joy Gooda. Bronwyn was born on February 22, 1959, in Gum Flat, New South Wales, Australia, and passed away on July 11, 2006. Unfortunately, there isn't a well-known artist by that name in public records or renowned art circles. However, it is plausible that Bronwyn Joy Gooda could have been a local or lesser-known artist whose life and work primarily took place in Australia. In a country famous for its love for art, it is not uncommon to find talented individuals who engage in various forms of artistic expression, including sculpture. Sculpture, as an artistic medium, has a long tradition of being an integral part of Australian culture. This field is known for producing world-renowned artists such as Ron Mueck, Deborah Halpern, and Ricky Swallow, among others. Considering the timeframe of her life, it is possible that Bronwyn Joy Gooda's work may have been influenced by popular sculptural movements and styles of her time. These could include Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, or Postmodernism. It is also likely that she could have been influenced and inspired by fellow Australian artists, incorporating distinct elements and themes related to her cultural background, such as Aboriginal art and symbolism, as well as the Australian landscape. Her sculptures may have been exhibited in local galleries or events, providing a platform for Bronwyn to share her work with her community or perhaps even nationally. Although not much information is available about her artistic career, her art may very well have left an impact on those who encountered it. It is important to remember that the significance of an artist's work cannot always be measured by their fame or public recognition alone. In conclusion, while we cannot accurately confirm that the details provided refer to a specific, well-known Australian artist, it is quite plausible that these details refer to Bronwyn Joy Gooda, who might have been a talented and passionate artist in her own right. Her contributions to the world of sculpture, even if known to a limited audience, should be remembered and acknowledged."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Plot title: John Carpenter's The Fog Movie plot: Set in a Northern California fishing town called Antonio Bay, the town is about to celebrate its centennial on April 21, 1980, and are having a celebration led by Kathy Williams (Janet Leigh). However, the centennial is also marked by ominous events, including the appearance of a glowing fog that spreads over land and sea.In the first scene, on the night before the town's celebration, a group of children seated around a campfire on a beach, are entertained by a ghost story, told by 'old' Mr. Machen (John Houseman) (exactly at the stroke of midnight), the resident elderly fisherman. The story being told is indicative of the history of the town's formation, which is being discovered at that exact moment by the local priest, Father Malone (Hal Holbrook), when he finds the diary of his grandfather (who was also the town's priest).The diary later reveals a dark secret unknown to the current inhabitants where, in 1880, six of the founders of Antonio Bay (including Malone's grandfather) deliberately sank and plundered the Elizabeth Dane, a clipper ship owned by Blake, a wealthy man with leprosy who wanted to establish a colony near Antonio Bay. The six conspirators lit a fire on the beach near treacherous rocks, and the crew of the clipper, deceived by the false beacon, crashed into them. Everyone aboard the ship perished. The six conspirators were motivated both by greed and disgust at the notion of having a leper colony nearby. Antonio Bay and its church were then founded with the gold plundered from the ship.The mysterious fog contains the vengeful ghosts of Blake and the clipper's crew, who have come back on the 100th anniversary of the shipwreck and the founding of the town to apparently take the lives of six people (symbolic substitutes for the six conspirators).This same night, three local fishermen, Al Williams, Tommy Wallace, and Dick Baxter, are gruesomely murdered by supernatural attackers after the fog covers their boat.

These ghosts are within the mysterious, glowing fog that spreads throughout the town of Antonio Bay during its centennial on April 21, 1980. The ghosts have returned to seek revenge on the town as they were wronged 100 years earlier when the six founders of Antonio Bay deliberately sank and plundered their ship, the Elizabeth Dane. The town and its church were built using the gold taken from the ship, which originally belonged to Blake, a wealthy leper who wanted to establish a colony near Antonio Bay. As Dan becomes one of the six victims the vengeful ghosts claim to represent the six conspirators involved in the town's dark past, he meets his demise at the hands of the supernatural attackers concealed within the ominous fog. The deaths of the six victims signify the ghosts' pursuit of justice and retribution for the atrocities committed against them a century before.

Solve this instance: Context: Adult attachment theory provides a useful framework for understanding how early developmental experiences affect social processes, associated physiological stress responses, and ultimately, health across the lifespan. The current study examined the effects of attachment orientation on physiological responses to naturalistic social interactions in adolescents.', 'Two-hundred five black (49%) and white high school students (14-16 years; 50% boys) completed a measure of anxious and avoidant attachment, and underwent 1.5 days of ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate (AmBP and AmHR) monitoring while they tracked social experiences.', 'As predicted, individuals with higher avoidant attachment reported fewer interactions with friends (t [299] = -3.18, p < .01) and more anxious adolescents experienced less pleasant interactions both during (t [299] = -3.59, p < .01) and outside of school hours (t [298] = -3.59, p < .01). Individuals who were higher in anxious attachment showed augmented ambulatory diastolic and systolic blood pressure (AmDBP, AmSBP; both p < .05) in conjunction with current or recent interactions with friends. More avoidant adolescents exhibited augmented AmDBP responses to social conflict (p < .05).Question: Does adolescents ' attachment orientation influence ambulatory blood pressure responses to everyday social interactions? Student:","completion":"Part 1: Understanding the task definition Usage: \\"You are given a passage which has a question and the context. You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context.\\" Explanation: The task requires us to read a given passage, understand the question within the passage, and provide an answer based on the information provided in the context. The focus is on comprehending the context and using it to answer the question. Part 2: Comprehending the context Usage: \\"Adult attachment theory provides a useful framework for understanding how early developmental experiences affect social processes, associated physiological stress responses, and ultimately, health across the lifespan.\\" Explanation: In this example, we are introduced to the adult attachment theory and how it can be used to study the development of social processes, stress responses, and health across a person's life. Part 3: Details of the study Usage: \\"Two-hundred five black (49%) and white high school students (14-16 years; 50% boys) completed a measure of anxious and avoidant attachment, and underwent 1.5 days of ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate (AmBP and AmHR) monitoring while they tracked social experiences.\\" Explanation: The study involves students from different racial backgrounds and measures their attachment orientation while monitoring their blood pressure and heart rate during social experiences. This part of the definition provides information about the study participants and the process of the study. Part 4: Results of the study Usage: \\"Individuals with higher avoidant attachment reported fewer interactions with friends and more anxious adolescents experienced less pleasant interactions both during and outside of school hours. Individuals who were higher in anxious attachment showed augmented ambulatory diastolic and systolic blood pressure in conjunction with current or recent interactions with friends.\\" Explanation: The study found that attachment orientation influences individuals' social interactions and their ambulatory blood pressure responses to these interactions. Anxious attachment leads to increased blood pressure during social interactions, while avoidant attachment results in fewer interactions with friends. Part 5: Answering the question Usage: \\"Does adolescents ' attachment orientation influence ambulatory blood pressure responses to everyday social interactions?\\" Explanation: Based on the information from the study, the answer to the question is yes, adolescents' attachment orientation does influence ambulatory blood pressure responses to everyday social interactions. The study showed that individuals with higher anxious attachment had increased blood pressure during social interactions, while those with higher avoidant attachment had fewer interactions with friends."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Ronnie and Reggie Kray were born on 24 October 1933 in Hoxton, East London, to Charles David Kray (10 March 1907 - 8 March 1983), a scrap gold dealer, and Violet Annie Lee (5 August 1909 - 4 August 1982). They were of English, Jewish, Irish and Romani Gypsy heritage. The brothers were identical twins, with Reggie being born ten minutes before Ronnie. Their parents already had a six-year-old son, Charles James (9 July 1927 - 4 April 2000). Context: Ronnie Kray shot and killed George Cornell, a member of the Richardsons (a rival South London gang), at the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel on 9 March 1966. The day before, there had been a shoot-out at Mr. Smith's, a nightclub in Catford, involving the Richardson gang and Richard Hart, an associate of the Krays, who was shot dead. This public shoot-out led to the arrest of nearly all the Richardson gang. Cornell, by chance, was not present at the club during the shoot-out and was not arrested. Whilst visiting the hospital to check up on his friends, he randomly chose to visit the Blind Beggar pub, only a mile away from where the Krays lived. Ronnie was drinking in another pub when he learned of Cornell's location. He went there with his driver \\"Scotch Jack\\" John Dickson and his assistant Ian Barrie. Ronnie went into the pub with Barrie, walked straight to Cornell and shot him in the head in public view. Barrie, confused by what happened, fired five shots in the air warning the public not to report what had happened to the police. Just before he was shot, Cornell remarked, \\"Well, look who's here.\\" He died at 3:00am in hospital. Ronnie Kray was already suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the killing. According to some sources, Ronnie killed Cornell because Cornell referred to Ronnie as a \\"fat poof\\" (a derogatory term for gay men) during a confrontation between the Krays and the Richardson gang at the Astor Club on Christmas Day 1965. Richardson gang member \\"Mad\\" Frankie Fraser was tried for the murder of Richard Hart at Mr.Smith's, but was found not guilty. Richardson gang member Ray \\"the Belgian\\" Cullinane testified that he saw Cornell kicking Hart. Witnesses would not co-operate with the police in the murder case due to intimidation, and the trial ended inconclusively without pointing to any suspect in particular. Question: Was Ronnie charged?. Whats the answer?","completion":"In the text provided, it does not explicitly state whether Ronnie Kray was charged for the murder of George Cornell. To answer this question completely, I would need to look for additional information outside the provided context. However, based on the text given, it is described that Ronnie Kray shot Cornell in the head in public view, and he did so while suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. This statement could imply that there were witnesses to the event, which typically leads to charges being filed. Yet, the text also says that witnesses did not cooperate with the police due to intimidation, meaning this could have affected the decision to charge Ronnie Kray. Summary: Due to incomplete information in the provided text, it cannot be determined for certain whether or not Ronnie Kray was charged for the murder of George Cornell."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Fish mortality is a parameter used in fisheries population dynamics to account for the loss of fish in a fish stock through death. The mortality can be divided into two types: Natural mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to causes not associated with fishing. Such causes can include disease, competition, cannibalism, old age, predation, pollution or any other natural factor that causes the death of fish. In fisheries models natural mortality is denoted by (M).[1] Fishing mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to fishing activities using any fishing gear.[1] It is denoted by (F) in fisheries models. and the situation: The fisherman had 2 choices: he could go to Silver Lake situated at a higher altitude and fish there; or he could go to Red lake, a few miles further down the road. Both lakes were natural, but Red Lake had a few pollution problems last year, and the oxygen levels in the water decreased, leading to many fish dying. Silver lake was still pristine, untouched by human activities such as pollution. Answer the following question: Which lake is situated at a lower altitude?

Article: A 15-year-old Saanich student who invented a flashlight powered by body heat is heading home today from California with a big prize--and an opportunity to expand on her work. St. Michaels University School student Ann Makosinski was the only Canadian among the four winners at Google's annual international science fair, beating out thousands of other young scientists from around the world. Winning the international contest was \\"a total shock\\", Ann said from San Francisco. \\"I definitely think it will have an influence on my future.\\" Ann thanked her family for encouraging her interest in science, telling the judges that her first toy was a box of transistors . Ann's prize includes a 25,000 scholarship and a \\"once-in-a-lifetime experience\\" from either the European Organization for Nuclear Research, Lego or Google for her Hollow Flashlight, which has no moving parts or batteries. Ann created the flashlight for a local science fair. The inspiration for the invention came from seeing unwanted batteries and after visits to the Philippines, where she saw the need for a battery-free flashlight. A friend at school there failed in her studies because of a lack of electricity and light to study when it became dark. In her project, Ann wrote that she \\"made two flashlights that do not use any batteries, harmful chemicals, or kinetic energy . They do not create any noise and will always work. The flashlight's only limitation is its need for at least a 5degC temperature difference to provide usable light.\\" A You Tube video of Ann explaining how she created the flashlight has been viewed more than 1.4 million times. Despite her success, the private school student is undecided about her career path. Ann hopes she can find a way to combine her love of film with science. The four winners were chosen from 15 finalists from eight countries. The contest attracted thousands of entries from students in 120 countries.

Summarize: Researchers believe one in 2,000 people in the UK is a carrier of the disease linked to eating contaminated beef. Their estimate in the BMJ comes from studying more than 32,000 samples of human tissue removed during appendix operations carried out between 2000 and 2012 at 41 hospitals. It remains unclear if any of these carriers will ever develop symptoms. Early predictions of a vCJD epidemic didn't come to fruition. To date, here have been 177 UK deaths from vCJD. Most of these occurred in the late 90s and early 2000s. There has been only one death in the last two years. The rare, fatal disease progressively attacks the brain. But it appears that relatively few who catch the infectious agent that causes the disease develop symptoms. People can be \\"silent\\" carriers for decades and not even know it. The BMJ research identified 16 such carriers out of the thousands of appendix tissue samples studied. Experts say many vital questions remain unanswered. Since the link between vCJD and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), known as mad cow disease, was discovered in 1996, there have been strict controls to prevent meat from infected cattle from entering the food chain. However, the average time it takes for the symptoms of vCJD to occur after initial infection is still unclear. Preventing spread This means people exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced continue to develop variant CJD, and may spread it to others. Experience tells us that the disease could be transmitted from human to human via blood - in the UK, there have been three reported cases of vCJD associated with a blood transfusion. Blood donor services take measures to ensure blood is not infected but there is no test to screen for vCJD, although scientists are working on this. And there is currently no cure for the disease. Prof Sebastian Brandner of University College London, who led the BMJ research, said: \\"We do not know what will happen. \\"Will these people develop disease and can they transmit it? There are many questions we still do not know the answers to.\\" Prof Richard Knight, director of the National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, said the answers might not be known for decades. In the meantime, surveillance was key, he said. \\"You can see from the data available that its likely that we will get a secondary or tertiary wave of disease but its likely that these further waves will be small. \\"Future clinical cases will be pretty small in number,\\" he added. Dr Graham Jackson, of the MRC Prion Unit at UCL Institute of Neurology, said: \\"Given the high levels of infection indicated by this research, it is now crucial we establish how many people in the UK harbour that infection in their bloodstream in order to adequately assess the risks of transmission through contaminated blood donations. \\"Studies to develop new blood tests for CJD must remain a priority to assist with screening and protecting the UK blood supply.\\"","completion":"Researchers have found that one in every 2,000 people in the UK could be carriers of the disease linked to eating contaminated beef. They have been studying over 32,000 tissue samples from appendix operations and have identified 16 silent carriers. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is a rare and fatal disease that progressively attacks the brain. Although people can be silent carriers of the disease without showing symptoms for decades, it remains uncertain if they will ever develop symptoms. The link between vCJD and mad cow disease was discovered in 1996, and since then, measures have been taken to prevent infected meat from entering the food chain. However, there is currently no test to screen for vCJD or cure for the disease. Developing new blood tests for CJD remains a priority to protect the UK blood supply."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: There are some great differences between the traditional family and the modern family. The first important difference is in the man's role.The traditional husband was the head of the household because he was the only one who worked outside the home.If the wife worked for money,then the husband was not considered to be a good provider,In many families today,both husband and wife work for money.Therefore,they share the role of head of household.In addition,the traditional husband usually made big decisions about spending money.However,the modern husband shares these decisions with his working wife.Also,the traditional husband did not help his wife with housework or meal preparation. Dinner was ready when he came home,In contrast,the modern husband helps his working wife at home.He may do some of the household chores,and it is not unusual for him to cook. The second difference is in the woman's role. In the traditional family,the woman may have worked for miney during her first years of marriage.However,when she gave birth,she would usually give up her job. Her primary role would be to take care of her family and home.In contrast,in many families today,the modern woman works outside the home even after she has children .She's doing two jobs instead of one,so she is busier than the traditional mother was.The traditional wife learned to live within her husband's income.But the modern wife does not have to because the family has two incomes. The final difference is in the role of the children .In the traditional family,the children were taken care of by the mother because she didn't work outside.However,today pre-school children may go to a child-care center or to a baby-sitter regularly because the mother works.The school-age children of a traditional family were more dependent.Their mother was there to help them get ready for school and to make their breakfast.In conrtast,modern children are more independent.They have to get up early and get ready for school themselves,and they may even have to make their own breakfast.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. When was the water level lower, in April or in March? The water level in Large Lake was high in March, 3 feet higher in April, and 7 feet higher still in May. It dropped to a much lower level in September, October and November, when they released a significant portion of the water as a yearly chore. Hint: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. A:","completion":"The water level was lower in March.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What does Adrian Kingsley-Hughes say of his thoughts on the origins of the interface?\\" Context: \\"The interface of Windows 8 has been the subject of mixed reaction. Bright wrote that its system of hot corners and edge swiping \\"wasn't very obvious\\" due to the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface, even by the video tutorial added on the RTM release (which only instructed users to point at corners of the screen or swipe from its sides). Despite this \\"stumbling block\\", Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the \\"Metro\\" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means. Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was \\"as stunning as it is surprising\\", contributing to an \\"incredibly personal\\" experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store. Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from ZDNet, considered the interface to be \\"clumsy and impractical\\" due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it \\"two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together\\"), and concluded that \\"Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction—touch and tablets -- that allows it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad.\\"\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, a writer for ZDNet, expressed his thoughts on the origins of the Windows 8 interface as an attempt by Microsoft to shape the PC industry and remain relevant amidst the growing popularity of touch devices and tablets, such as Apple's iPad. He believed that the interface was not developed in response to actual needs or demands from users but rather as a strategic move by Microsoft to compete against its rivals and maintain a strong foothold in the industry. Kingsley-Hughes further criticized the Windows 8 interface for being \\"clumsy and impractical\\" due to the inconsistent design between the \\"Metro\\" environment and the classic desktop view. He perceived the interface as an amalgamation of two operating systems that were awkwardly and abruptly connected, which resulted in a disjointed user experience. This inconsistency in design made navigating the operating system difficult and confusing for users, as they would have to switch between the two different environments. Moreover, Kingsley-Hughes argued that the lack of clear instructions on how to utilize the new touch-based interface, such as the hot corners and edge swiping features, contributed to the overall negative reception of the operating system. The video tutorial added in the RTM release proved to be insufficient, as it only instructed users to point at the corners of the screen or swipe from its sides without explaining the functions of accessing the user interface. Despite these criticisms, some, like Tom Warren of The Verge, acknowledged the necessity for Microsoft to adopt a touch-oriented interface to push app development for the Windows Store and adapt to the changing landscape of the tech industry. However, even Warren conceded that the learning curve associated with the new interface was steep and its integration with a keyboard and mouse setup was clunky and uncomfortable. Overall, Adrian Kingsley-Hughes' thoughts on the origins of the Windows 8 interface revolve around the idea that the design was driven by Microsoft's desire to assert its influence on the PC industry and adapt to the growing trend of touch and tablet devices. Although the interface showed potential in some aspects, its clumsy and inconsistent design, coupled with the lack of clear instructions, resulted in a negative user experience that left many users displeased and frustrated with the operating system."},{"prompt":"Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Gordon Liu Review: When I purchased this DVD I wasn't expecting much, but it's Gordon Liu so I thought I'd give it a try.

Possible A: kitchen floor, furniture, house, mobile home, own land Why is \\"mobile home\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Mobile home\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. First, let's analyze the question and the context it provides: \\"Where do you live if you have cheap linoleum covering and boxy rooms?\\" The question is essentially asking for a type of living space characterized by these specific attributes: 1. Cheap linoleum covering: Linoleum is an affordable flooring material that has been commonly used in a variety of residential settings, including mobile homes. It is durable, inexpensive, and easy to install, which makes it an ideal choice for living spaces that need to be cost-effective and functional. 2. Boxy rooms: Boxy rooms refer to spaces with limited architectural design and simple, rectangular shapes. This description may be indicative of a living environment that is designed with practicality and affordability in mind, which is a common characteristic of mobile homes. Now, looking at the possible answers: a. Kitchen floor: This answer refers to a part of a house rather than the type of living space itself, so it doesn't align with the context provided by the question. b. Furniture: This answer is not relevant, as it refers to objects within a living space rather than the living space itself. c. House: While a house could potentially have both cheap linoleum covering and boxy rooms, the question is presenting a specific combination of features that seems to be hinting at a more particular type of living arrangement, which makes \\"house\\" a less fitting answer. d. Mobile home: As mentioned earlier, a mobile home is a type of affordable, functional living space that often features inexpensive linoleum flooring and boxy, rectangular rooms, making it a suitable answer to the question given the specific attributes mentioned. e. Own land: This answer refers to property ownership rather than the type of living space, making it irrelevant to the question's context. In conclusion, when taking into consideration the context and features mentioned in the question, \\"mobile home\\" aligns with human common sense as it accurately reflects a type of living space characterized by cheap linoleum covering and boxy rooms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The magazine is known for its investigative journalism, political commentaries, and cultural analysis, covering topics such as social issues, economics, and the arts. Born in the mid-1950s, it has since then played a key role in shaping public opinion through its in-depth articles and outstanding journalism. While there are a number of news magazines and dailies that compete with l'Espresso in the Italian media landscape, its biggest rival is Panorama. Panorama is a prominent Italian weekly news magazine founded in 1962 and published by the Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, Italy's largest publishing company. Similar to l'Espresso, Panorama provides its readers with extensive coverages on current events, politics, economy, culture, and entertainment. Both l'Espresso and Panorama have strong readerships, and they appeal to different segments of the Italian public. While l'Espresso is known for its liberal and progressive perspective, often delving deep into social injustices and political corruption, Panorama is considered to have a more center-right leaning and is affiliated with Silvio Berlusconi's media empire. This places Panorama in a more conservative political space, compared to l'Espresso's left-leaning position. Throughout the years, the rivalry between l'Espresso and Panorama has been fueled by their contrasting editorial stances and unique journalistic styles. Competing for the same target audience, these leading Italian weekly news magazines continue to vie for supremacy, each striving to be the primary source of credible and well-informed content to their readers. In conclusion, Panorama is l'Espresso's biggest rival in the Italian weekly news magazine market, with both publications occupying significant positions within the country's media landscape. Their contrasting political affiliations and editorial approaches contribute to their ongoing competition to earn and maintain the trust and attention of readers in Italy and abroad."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In both sentences, the speaker believes that a certain event or decision is favorable or the most appropriate course of action. Here is a detailed breakdown of each sentence: Sentence 1: \\"That was probably for the best.\\" In this sentence, the use of \\"that\\" indicates a specific event or decision. The phrase \\"for the best\\" means that the event or decision is considered to be the most beneficial or suitable choice. The use of \\"probably\\" implies some uncertainty, but the speaker conveys that they believe the event or decision is ultimately a positive one. Sentence 2: \\"This was probably the best solution.\\" In this sentence, the use of \\"this\\" also refers to a specific event or decision, just like \\"that\\" in Sentence 1. The phrase \\"the best solution\\" conveys that the event or decision is seen as the optimal choice. The use of \\"probably\\" once again introduces an element of uncertainty, but the speaker still conveys a belief that the decision or event is a favorable one. Although Sentence 2 uses the term \\"solution\\" and Sentence 1 uses the phrase \\"for the best,\\" they both refer to the idea that an event or decision is the most favorable choice in a particular situation.

It's the first state to impose such a mandate. To prevent perpetrators from claiming they never heard a definite \\"no\\" from their victims, the bill now calls for an \\"affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity.\\" The legislation is meant to protect individuals who are drunk, drugged, asleep, or unconscious, the AP reports; it notes consent can be nonverbal (ie, a nod of the head). The bill adds that colleges and universities have to come up with a blueprint to help sexual assault victims, make counseling and health services available, and better train faculty who review such cases. \\"This is amazing,\\" says a UCLA student. \\"It's going to educate an entire new generation of students on what consent is and what consent is not ... that the absence of a 'no' is not a 'yes.'\\" Also signed by Brown over the weekend: a bill that offers college loans to students in the US illegally, and a bill that will ask voters whether to repeal parts of a 1998 law that mandate school instruction be in English. (Some people aren't happy with the way Florida State has handled its sexual assault cases.)","completion":"Title: California Leads the Way in Strengthening Sexual Assault Prevention on Campus In an effort to combat sexual assault on college campuses, California Gov. Jerry Brown recently signed several bills aimed at helping students across the state. The most notable among these is Senate Bill 967 (SB-967), which has placed California as the first state to implement an \\"affirmative consent\\" mandate for colleges and universities. This groundbreaking legislation has the potential to reshape how sexual assault cases are handled on campus and protect an entire generation of students. The traditional \\"no means no\\" mantra is axed by SB-967, and instead, colleges and universities will now need to adopt a standard of \\"clear consent\\" when it comes to students' sexual activity, reports the Los Angeles Times. This transformation is an essential step towards mitigating sexual assault on campuses across the state and establishing a safer environment for all students. To prevent perpetrators from claiming that they never heard a definite \\"no\\" from their victims, the bill now requires that \\"an affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity\\" be demonstrated by all parties. This legislation is intended to protect individuals who may be intoxicated, drugged, asleep, or unconscious. It is noteworthy that consent can be nonverbal, such as through a nod of the head. In addition to requiring clear consent, SB-967 proposes that all colleges and universities in the state devise a blueprint to assist victims of sexual assault. This includes providing access to counseling and health services, as well as improving the training of faculty who review such cases. The overall aim of the bill is to create a more supportive ecosystem for sexual assault victims, ensuring that their voices are heard and that they receive the necessary resources to heal and move forward. A UCLA student was quoted as saying, \\"This is amazing. It's going to educate an entire new generation of students on what consent is and what consent is not...that the absence of a 'no' is not a 'yes.'\\" With California leading the way on this crucial issue, it is hoped that other states will follow suit and adopt similar legislation to better protect students on college campuses nationwide. Other bills signed by Gov. Jerry Brown during a busy weekend included a bill offering college loans to students who are undocumented and living in the US, as well as a bill proposing a vote on whether to repeal parts of a 1998 law mandating that school instruction be in English. Given the attention that sexual assault cases have received – including the criticism faced by Florida State University for its handling of such incidents – it is crucial that robust efforts are made in preventing and addressing these crimes on campus. With the passage of SB-967, California has taken a significant step forward in ensuring the safety and well-being of its college students."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Run the apple under clean water, turning it as necessary to remove any dirt and debris. Remove the skin with a pairing knife or vegetable peeler. Options are: -- Use either a knife or vegetable peeler to gently peel the skin off the apple. Try to remove only a thin layer of skin and keep most of the apple intact. -- Use a shallow cutting knife to cut away the skin near the nape of the apple. Heat the base vegetable roux to 350 ° f (177 ° c). -- Washing apples removes some of the outer flesh in the apples, making it easier to cut. If you don't have a pair of cutting knives, use a paring knife, plastic spoon, or pie plate to peel your apples. -- Scrubbing the apples gently with a vegetable peeler will expose the skin. If you don't have any vegetable peeler, use a bread grater to remove the skin at the base of the apple.","completion":"After washing and peeling the apples, the most logical next step would be to core and slice the apples for stewing. Here's a detailed explanation: 1. Core the apples: -- Use an apple corer or a sharp knife to remove the core from each apple. Place the apple on a cutting board and push the corer or knife into the center of the apple, starting at the stem end and going through the bottom. Twist the corer slightly and pull it back through the apple, bringing the core with it. If you don't have an apple corer, you can use a sharp knife to cut around the core by cutting the apple into quarters first and then removing the core section from each quarter. 2. Slice the apples: -- Once the core has been removed, slice the apples. Cut each apple into even slices – about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick – depending on your preference. Thinner slices will cook faster and become softer, while thicker slices will retain more of their shape and texture as they cook. Ensure all the slices are of similar thickness for even cooking. 3. Place the apple slices in a pot or large saucepan: -- Select a pot or saucepan with enough space to hold all the apple slices and accommodate the liquid they will release during cooking. Arrange the apple slices in the pot, spreading them evenly. 4. Add sweetener, spices, and liquid: -- Add your desired sweetener to taste, such as sugar, honey, or maple syrup. Then, add your preferred spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, or cloves, according to your preference. To prevent the apples from sticking to the pot and to enhance flavor, add a small amount of liquid – water, apple juice, or cider all work well. Start with just a couple of tablespoons to avoid making the apples too watery, adding more as needed during cooking. 5. Cook the apple slices until tender: -- Heat the pot or saucepan over medium-low heat, allowing the apples to cook slowly and release their natural juices. Stir the apples occasionally to ensure even cooking. Cook the apples for 15-30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the slices and your desired level of tenderness. 6. Adjust seasonings and serve: -- Taste the stewed apples and adjust the sweetener and spices as needed. Once the apples are cooked to your desired tenderness, remove them from the heat. You can serve the stewed apples warm or chilled, as a side dish, dessert, or topping for other dishes such as oatmeal, pancakes, or ice cream."},{"prompt":"Q: In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper.

Chloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline previously used in malaria therapy and now becoming an emerging investigational antiviral drug due to its broad spectrum of antiviral activities. To explore whether the low pH-dependency of influenza A viruses might affect the antiviral effects of chloroquine at clinically achievable concentrations, we tested the antiviral effects of this drug on selected human and avian viruses belonging to different subtypes and displaying different pH requirements. Results showed a correlation between the responses to chloroquine and NH 4 Cl, a lysosomotropic agent known to increase the pH of intracellular vesicles. Time-of-addition experiments showed that the inhibitory effect of chloroquine was maximal when the drug had been added at the time of infection and was lost after 2 h post-infection. This timing approximately corresponds to that of virus/cell fusion. Moreover, there was a clear correlation between the EC 50 of chloroquine in vitro and the electrostatic potential of the HA subunit (HA2) mediating the virus/ cell fusion process. Overall, the present study highlights the critical importance of a host cell factor such as intravesicular pH in determining the anti-influenza activity of chloroquine and other lysosomotropic agents.

GRANTSVILLE — One man died Saturday night after witnesses say he ran into a ceremonial bonfire at a regional burning festival Saturday night. The annual event, put on by Element 11, is a spinoff of the Burning Man festival held in Black Rock City, Nevada. As part of the event, several effigies about 30 feet tall are constructed out of dry wood and ceremoniously burned, according to Element 11 spokesman J.P. Bernier. Because the burning produces extreme heat, volunteers form a perimeter around the burning for the safety of other participants, Bernier said. After 11 p.m., volunteers noticed a man who came running forward through the crowd and went past the perimeter. Volunteers made attempts to call out and stop the man, but they were unsuccessful in preventing him from jumping into the fire, Bernier said. \\"The nature of the fire is such that our volunteers were not able to get close enough to the fire for risk of their own safety,\\" Bernier said. \\"He was very fast; he was very motivated. It wasn't an accident or any act of negligence on anybody's part. He had a very deliberate objective to get past our volunteers, past our safety perimeter.\\" The victim's name was not released Sunday. Grantsville police issued a very brief statement only saying that they were investigating \\"a fatality at an event being held within Grantsville City.\\" Many participants were distraught and confused by the suddenness of the incident, according to a participant and a documentary photographer named Christian, who declined to provide his last name. \\"I did see that a lot of the community was shocked and traumatized,\\" he said. \\"There's a lot of questions, a lot of facts that are unknown.\\" Doug Johnson said the incident was the first of its kind that he's seen after attending the event for more than a dozen years. \\"I was blown away,\\" Johnson said. \\"Fifteen years and I've never had anything like that happen, ever.\\" More than 100 volunteers help facilitate the regional event, which is intended to \\"ignite a culture of creativity in the community,\\" Bernier said. The event hosted more than 1,200 attendees, and members of the volunteer Grantsville Fire Department were present. A burning scheduled for Sunday morning was canceled after Saturday's incident. Christian said safety has been an ever-growing priority at the event over the five years he's been attending. \\"This is the first event that I was restricted as a documentary photographer to ever get near anything there because safety was such a concern,\\" he said. \\"And the fact that he had to break through that barrier anyway, I would just say that it was not something that was easily prevented at all.\\" Bernier said that while safety procedures were followed, policies will be examined in the hope that such incidents will be prevented in the future. \\"We'll definitely look at our policies,\\" Bernier said.

It’s like he thought it was just a playground.\\" Fire safety rangers were unable to stop Wallace from tossing himself into the inferno. Witnesses said they saw Wallace’s hand rise up from the flames as he died. \\"The whole time I was thinking, ‘He’s gonna walk out. He’s gonna be okay,’ \\" McDonald said. \\"I thought he was gonna survive.\\" Wallace, who was in his late 20s or early 30s, had told other festival-goers earlier in the day that he planned to kill himself by jumping into the burning effigy, said Grantsville police Lt. Steve Barrett. \\"This is what he was going to do, and it’s what he did,\\" Barrett said, adding that neither security rangers nor firemen could have prevented Wallace from killing himself. \\"It took not even seconds. He was just through the barricades and into the fire.\\" Grantsville police reviewed video footage recorded by witnesses before determining that Wallace’s death was a suicide. The effigy had been burning for about 30 minutes when Wallace leapt into the fire at about about 11 p.m. Saturday, said Grantsville police Lt. Steve Barrett. Firefighters on scene tried to extinguish the flames but could not save Wallace. \\"It was shocking to everybody,\\" said Grantsville Mayor Brent Marshall, who did not witness the burn but visits the event site each year to perform a safety inspection. Marshall expressed his sympathy not only for the family of the dead man but also for the people who witnessed the suicide. \\"Horrific things get embedded into people’s minds,\\" Marshall said. \\"It’s a tragedy any way you want to look at it.\\" story continues below story continues below Element 11, or E-11 for short, is a so-called \\"regional burn,\\" one of dozens of smaller-scale events affiliated with the Burning Man arts and culture festival that takes place in Nevada’s Black Rock Desert every August.

Summarize this article: Alcoholism vaccine will give drinkers an immediate hangover if they drink even a small amount of booze The vaccine would be effective for between six months and a year It sends a message to the liver not to express genes that metabolize alcohol Trials on mice begin next month with human tests planned for November A vaccine being developed in Chile will give anyone who drinks alcohol and immediate hangover A new vaccine will give anyone who drinks even a small amount of alcohol an immediate and very heavy hangover. Scientists from the University of Chile have spent a year designing the drug in a bid to tackle the growing problem of alcoholism in the country. The vaccine, which would be effective for between six months and a year, works by sending a biochemical message to the liver telling it not to express genes that metabolise alcohol. Normally, the liver turns alcohol into the hangover-causing compound called acetaldehyde which is then broken down by a metabolising enzyme. If someone who’s been vaccinated tries to drink alcohol, they will immediately experience severe nausea, accelerated heartbeat, and general discomfort. Once the vaccine has been administered it cannot be reversed. A preclinical trial using mice to determine the correct dosing is due to begin next month with researchers hoping to begin tests on human subjects in November. The vaccine, which would be effective for between six months and a year, works by sending a biochemical message to the liver telling it not to express genes that metabolise alcohol Dr. Juan Asenjo, director of the university's Institute for Cell Dynamics and Biotechnology said while the vaccine is not a cure-all, it could provide an important first step. He told the Santiago Times newspaper: 'People who end up alcoholic have a social problem; a personality problem because they’re shy, whatever, and then they are depressed, so it’s not so simple. Clanger: The hangover vaccine would be effective for between six months and a year 'But if we can solve the chemical, the basic part of the problem, I think it could help quite a bit. 'In Chile, according to the most recent 2011 study from the World Health Organization, one in 15 men have an alcohol use disorder. Dr Asenjo belives the vaccine has the potential to help millions of people worldwide. He added: 'If it works, it’s going to have a worldwide impact, but with many vaccines one has to test them carefully. I think the chances that this one will work are quite high.' Inspiration for the vaccine came from the far East, said Asenjo, where between 15 and 20 pwer cent of Japanese, Chinese or Koreans have a mutation which inhibits the breakdown of alcohol in their bodies. The idea of using drugs to combat alcoholism is not new. Disulfiram, which was developed almost a century ago works in a similar way blocking the enzyme from breaking down alcohol, thus intensifying the body’s negative response. However users often find the effects so unpleasant they simply stop taking the pills. ||||| Splitting headaches and waves of nausea – a drinker’s worst enemy – may soon provide alcoholics with an unlikely rescue from a crippling addiction.

This vaccine is being made to help with the problem of people drinking too much alcohol. After getting the vaccine, the effect lasts for about six months to a year. The way this vaccine works is by sending a message to the liver that tells it not to break down alcohol.

His father, Bobby, was a long-time professional hockey player in both the National Hockey League (NHL) and World Hockey Association (WHA). His mother, Joanne (McKay), was an American professional figure skater and taught him how to skate. He has three brothers: Bobby Jr., Blake and Bart, and a younger sister: Michelle. Hull worked two jobs in 2006-07. He served as a special assistant to the team president of the Dallas Stars and provided studio analysis for NHL on NBC telecasts. He left NBC after one season when he was named a special adviser to the team's hockey operations department. Hull was promoted to interim co-general manager of the Stars, sharing the role with Les Jackson after Doug Armstrong was fired on November 13, 2007. ESPN analyst Scott Burnside criticized the promotion of Hull, noting his lack of front office experience and questionable work ethic. The pair made one of the most prominent trades in the 2007-08 NHL season, acquiring Brad Richards from the Tampa Bay Lightning as part of a five-player trade. The team went on to reach the Western Conference Final of the 2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Stars' deepest playoff run in eight years. Team owner Tom Hicks rewarded the pair with three-year contracts and named them permanent co-general managers. He credited Hull for his positive relationship with the players and his \\"unconventional wisdom\\". The signing of controversial forward Sean Avery prior to the 2008-09 season proved a turning point for Hull and Jackson. Avery's erratic behavior created divisions within the team's locker room, particularly after he made derogatory comments towards another player's girlfriend in the media. The Stars missed the playoffs that season, leading the team to replace Hull and Jackson as general manager with Joe Nieuwendyk. Hull remained with the organization, serving as an adviser to Hicks and team president Jeff Cogen.

It's like when you play with your toy cars, and you have that big dump truck that can fit a lot of other smaller toys in it. One sunny day, we had to move to a new house. My brother had just finished packing all his favorite toy soldiers into a big box, and I had folded all my clothes neatly. Our pet dog, Sparky, wagged his tail excitedly as he watched us pack. He knew something fun was about to happen. My brother Sam and I carried the boxes out to his truck. The truck was red, shiny, and had really big wheels. It reminded me of the firetrucks you see in your cartoons! We carefully loaded the boxes in the back of the truck and made sure they were safely stacked like a big block tower. Once the truck was filled with all our boxes and furniture, we hopped into the front seat – me, Sam, and Sparky – and we buckled our seatbelts, just like you do when we go for a car ride. With a big smile, Sam turned the key, and the truck rumbled to life like a friendly giant. As we drove through the neighborhood, our friends and neighbors waved goodbye to us with big smiles, and we waved back at them. Sparky excitedly barked out the window, happy to see all the friendly faces. The ride to our new home wasn't very long, just like when we go to visit Grandma's house. When we arrived, the new house looked so big, just like a castle! It had a lovely big yard for Sparky to run around in, lots of space for your toys, and a big, comfy bedroom for you to sleep in. We carefully unloaded all the boxes and furniture from the truck, working together like a team of ants carrying food back to their nest. It took time, but eventually, we had everything out of the truck, and with a big high five, we were officially in our new house! We all spent the day unpacking and setting up our new rooms, putting your toy cars on the shelves and hanging pictures on the walls. At the end of the day, we sat down in our cozy new living room, ordered pizza – your favorite, pepperoni – and enjoyed a family movie night, feeling very happy in our new home.

Article: Forty-three years seems like a long time to remember the name of a mere acquaintance. I have forgotten the name of an old lady, who was a customer on the paper route in my home town when I was a twelve-year-old boy. Yet it stays in my memory, for she taught me a lesson of forgiveness that I shall never forget. On a winter afternoon, a friend and I were throwing stones onto the leaning roof of the old lady's house from a spot near her backyard. The object of our play was to observe how the stones changed to missiles as they rolled to the roof's edge and shot out into the yard. I found myself a perfectly smooth rock and threw it out. The stone, however, slipped from my hand and headed straight for a small window on the old lady's back porch. At the sound of fractured glass, we knew we were in trouble. We ran as fast as possible. I was too scared about getting caught to be concerned about the old lady with the broken window in winter. However, a few days later, when I was sure that I hadn't been discovered, I started to feel guilty for her misfortune. She still greeted me with a smile each day when I gave her the paper, but I was no longer able to act comfortably in her presence. I made up my mind that I would save my paper delivery money, and after three weeks I had the seven dollars that I thought would cover the cost of her window. I put the money in an envelope with a note explaining that I was sorry for breaking her window and hoped that the seven dollars would cover the cost. I put the letter through the letter slot in her door. My soul felt _ and I could have the freedom of, once again, looking straight into the old lady's kind eyes. The next day, I handed the old lady her paper and was able to return the warm smile that I was receiving from her. She gave me a bag of cookies. I thanked her and felt an envelope in it.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The film is based on actual events, beginning in August 1941. Nazi Einsatzgruppen (task forces) are sweeping through Eastern Europe, systematically killing Jews. Among the survivors not killed or restricted to ghettoes are the Belarusian Jewish Bielski brothers: Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron. Their parents are dead, killed by local police under orders from the occupying Germans. The brothers flee to the Naliboki Forest, vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents. They encounter other Jewish escapees hiding in the forest, and the brothers take them under their protection and leadership. Tuvia kills the local Auxiliary Police chief responsible for his parents' deaths. Over the next year, they shelter a growing number of refugees, raiding local farms for food and supplies and moving their camp whenever they are discovered by the collaborationist police. Bielski brothers stage raids on the Germans and their collaborators. Casualties cause Tuvia to reconsider this approach because of the risk to the hiding Jews. Rivalry between the two eldest brothers, Tuvia and Zus, fuels a disagreement between them about their future; as winter approaches, Zus decides to leave the camp and join a local company of Soviet partisans, while his older brother Tuvia remains with the camp as their leader. An arrangement is made between the two groups in which the Soviet partisans agree to protect the Jewish camp in exchange for supplies.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. The reason it is an indirect impact is because the decrease in space rock does not directly affect any specific step of the cave formation process mentioned above. However, the formation of caves relies on the availability of rock, which in this scenario is less. With less space rock, there is less material for the cave formation process to occur. This would lead to fewer opportunities for caves to form and potentially smaller cave systems, since there is less rock to carve through over the years."},{"prompt":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In China, safety education is becoming more and more important now.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who was one of the first people to study conservation? is inside the article: Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who is surrounded by staffers? Manfred Link is the President of the United States. He and the usually tipsy First Lady have a 28-year-old, sex-starved daughter named Gloria. The President is surrounded by a number of eccentric staffers and allies, including vice president Shockley, ambassador Spender, press secretary Bunthorne and a presidential aide named Feebleman. He also is advised by General Dumpston, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The administration needs the support of the (fictional) African nation of Upper Gorm for an upcoming vote and must deal with Longo, that country's United Nations ambassador. Unfortunately, it can find only one American who knows how to speak the Upper Gormese language, a man named Alexander Grade. As best they can understand it, the ruler of Upper Gorm wants, in exchange, a number of Americans sent to his land so that his country, like the United States, can know what it's like to have an oppressed minority. Gloria is kidnapped and Americans are transported to Africa like slaves.

A young woman who was given three months to live and started completing her ‘bucket list’ has stunned doctors by making a miraculous recovery. Kayleigh Allport bravely made a list of things to do before she died when she was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer at the age of just 21. Her list of final wishes, which takes its name from the phrase, ‘kick the bucket’, included learning to drive, seeing a West End show and visiting New York - her life-long dream. Brave: Kayleigh Allport was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 21 after being given three months to live. It was only when she returned from the United States that her fortunes changed, when doctors put her on a new treatment which might prolong her life. She was warned that it would not cure her illness -but against the odds she proved the experts wrong and is now in remission. Kayleigh, now 26, has just completed a degree and now plans to marry her boyfriend Richard Glasby, 24. She said: ‘The drug has worked wonders. I was given three months to live but I’m still here now. ‘I’m so grateful and I live life to the full now. ‘Before this happened I was quite shy, but now nothing holds me back or bothers me anymore. ‘Facing up to dying has showed me how to live.’ Six years after being told she had months to live, Kayleigh Allport graduated from Teeside University with a 2:1 in psychology. Left to right mum Michelle, Kayleigh, sister Claire, and dad Eddie. Pictured from left to right dad Eddie, sister Claire, mum Michelle and Kayleigh in New York, listed as a place to visit on Kayleigh's bucket list. The problems began for Kayleigh when she had a scan for an unrelated back problem and doctors found a tumour on her kidney. The cancer was removed in an operation and she was told no further treatment was needed. But two years later, she received the devastating news that the cancer was back - this time in her liver. Doctor said described the organ as ‘a mass of tumours’ and declared it inoperable, giving her three months to live. It was then that Kayleigh, from Middlesborough, started on her bucket list - which saw her taking driving lessons and going to see her first West End show, Dirty Dancing. And after tireless fundraising by family and friends, Kayleigh, her mother Michelle, 45, father Eddie, 51, and sister Claire, 25, jetted off to New York fulfil the then 21-year-old’s final wish. After taking part in a drug trial, Kayleigh Allport has been told she is in remission and plans to marry her boyfriend Richard Glasby. The drug trial had terrible side effects, but it helped Kayleigh pass her three-month deadline. She added: ‘I just thought of the list, it was just things that I’d always wanted to do. ‘When I first found out I had three months left to live, I was in shock. ‘There were a lot of people around me and it was hard to take in. ‘I came to terms with it a couple of days later.’ On her return from America, Kayleigh was offered the chance to take part in a drug trial of Sunitinib, which was brand new to the market. The drug had terrible side effects, but it helped Kayleigh pass her three-month deadline. Determined to get on with her life, no matter how long she had left, Kayleigh passed her driving test and enrolled at Middlesbrough College before moving on to study Psychology at Teesside University, graduating with a 2:1. Kayleigh is just about to start a teaching placement and dreams of becoming a primary school teacher. And in September last year, Kayleigh was told she was in remission as the cancer had almost disappeared. She is just now about to start a teaching placement and dreams of becoming a primary school teacher. Kayleigh requires check ups every three months but has been told she is remission and will not require any further medical treatment. Kayleigh said: ‘It feels great because I didn’t think anything like this was going to happen. I’ve got my whole life ahead of me.’ The phrase ‘bucket list’ is derived from the phrase ‘kick the bucket’, a morbidly humorous way to refer to death thought to be derived from the kicking of a bucket in a hanging. The idea was popularised by John Goddard’s ‘Life List’, which featured in the book Chicken Soup for the Soul. It also featured in the film The Bucket List, in which characters played by Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman meet in a cancer ward, then race around the world, packing in experiences.

One of Gruber's sons discovers mice in the pipes of the organ and the mice have chewed up parts of the organ. Without the organ the church choir cannot perform the rehearsed Bach piece because the music was written to be performed with an organ.

By Chris Parsons PUBLISHED: 09:50 EST, 30 April 2012 | UPDATED: 04:56 EST, 1 May 2012 A Muslim faith school has revealed that less than one per cent of its pupils class English as their main language. Of the 630 youngsters at Iqra Slough Islamic Primary School in Berkshire, just ten are non-Muslim and more than 99 per cent class English as an 'additional' language. The school had faced educational meltdown 18 months ago after a bad Ofsted report, but is now 'making good progress', as bosses have claimed that 'faith has paid off'.

The massive 99% of pupils at Iqra Slough Islamic Primary School in Berkshire classing English as an additional language speaks to the diverse cultural background of the student population. While the fact that the school comprises predominantly Muslim students may raise some eyebrows, it is essential to understand that faith-based schools cater to specific religious communities, providing an education that aligns with their beliefs and values. It is crucial to recognize that the poor Ofsted report 18 months ago had served as a wake-up call for the school's management. As a result, the school has shown steady improvement and is now \\"making good progress,\\" demonstrating that faith-based schools, including Muslim schools, have the capacity to provide a high-quality and well-rounded education for their pupils. Moreover, the presence of non-Muslim students at Iqra Slough Islamic Primary School is another example of the misperception associated with faith-based schools. It is important to dispel stereotypes and prejudices, as these educational institutions strive to offer valuable learning experiences that foster a sense of community, respect, and understanding among students. To conclude, the myth that Muslim schools are subversive religious madrasas in disguise is unfounded and dangerous. Singling out and stigmatizing these schools only perpetuates harmful stereotypes without acknowledging their commitment to providing students with a robust and comprehensive education that is grounded in the principles of their faith."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The document also calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides also promised to hold follow-up negotiations. “We’re going to denuke North Korea,” Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren. He also said neither side issued ultimatums and that the agreement Tuesday was the result of months of negotiations. “You know that could have ended in a war, that could have ended with many millions of people — you know North Korea very well, Seoul has 28 million people, that could have ended with millions of people dead but we ended with a deal,” he said. Trump also told VOA that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announced one concession long-sought by North Korea. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said. Trump said at later news conference that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \\"are no longer a factor.\\" As for verification, Trump said he and Kim discussed the issue and that monitoring denuclearization efforts would be achieved “by having a lot of people there.” He also predicted Kim would begin work right away to “live up to” the agreement.

Security blogger Brian Krebs has spent months investigating the attack which knocked his blog offline. He claims that the origins of the Mirai botnet can be traced back to rivalries in the Minecraft community. His claims are backed up by a security expert who provided net security for Minecraft servers. Robert Coelho, vice president of security firm ProxyPipe, told the BBC that his suspicions about who was behind the Mirai code have been passed to the FBI, which is \\"actively investigating\\" the claims. The botnet Mirai was made up of more than 500,000 web-connected devices such as webcams and routers. The attacks it launched - so-called denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that hit web pages with so much data that they fall over - were the biggest the net had ever experienced. Victims that were knocked offline included Twitter, Spotify and Reddit. Shortly after the attacks, the individual claiming responsibility - using the codename Anna Senpai - released the source code online, paving the way for copycat attacks. A modified form of the malware was later used to attack UK internet service providers TalkTalk and the Post Office. Since being hit by the Mirai botnet in September 2016, Mr Krebs has devoted \\"hundreds of hours\\" into uncovering who was behind it. \\"If you've ever wondered why it seems that so few internet criminals are brought to justice, I can tell you that the sheer amount of persistence and investigative resources required to piece together who's done what to whom (and why) in the online era is tremendous,\\" he wrote. His research led him directly to the community around Minecraft, a computer game now owned by Microsoft, in which users build things from cubic blocks. It has a huge following, especially among children, and it is estimated that at any one time a million people are playing it. According to Mr Krebs, a large successful Minecraft web server with more than 1,000 players logging on each day can earn up to 50,000 (Â£40,600) per month, mainly from players renting space to build their Minecraft worlds. \\"The first clues to Anna Senpai's identity didn't become clear until I understood that Mirai was just the latest incarnation of an IoT [internet of things] botnet family that has been in development and relatively broad use for nearly three years,\\" he writes. The code for these earlier versions was often used to knock over web servers used to host Minecraft, he claims. ProxyPipe - owned by Mr Coelho - had plenty of Minecraft servers as clients and in mid-2015 was hit by a massive attack, launched from a botnet made up of IoT devices such as web cameras. Mr Coelho told the BBC that he had his suspicions about who was behind the attack: \\"Minecraft is a tight knit community. We know who is talking to who.\\" He alleged that the attack came from a competing security firm, which also offered DDoS protection to Minecraft clients. He claimed that the founder of the security firm had previously run a Minecraft web server and was one of his clients. He also claims that the Mirai author - Anna Senpai - contacted him via Skype at the end of September, partly to explain that the attack on his firm was \\"not personal\\" but also to brag that he had been paid by the owners of a large Minecraft server to launch an attack on a rival server.","completion":"Security researcher Brian Krebs and security firm ProxyPipe have claimed that the origins of the Mirai malware, which launched unprecedented denial-of-service attacks, can be traced back to rivalries in the Minecraft community, with the FBI reportedly investigating these claims."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hatfield, a radiologist, and Julie Hatfield, a former Boston Globe features, society, travel writer, and fashion critic who currently works as a freelance travel writer. Hatfield grew up in the Boston suburb of Duxbury. Although well known for the early 1990s hit, \\"My Sister\\", Hatfield has two brothers, but no sisters. Hatfield's father claimed his family were descendants of the West Virginia Hatfields of the Hatfield-McCoy feud following the Civil War. In 1995, following the success of Become What You Are she released her follow-up album, Only Everything, in which she \\"turned up the volume and the distortion and had a lot of fun\\". One reviewer describes it as \\"a fun, engaging pop album\\". The album spawned another alternative radio hit for Hatfield in \\"Universal Heartbeat\\". The video featured Hatfield as an overly demanding aerobics instructor. Prior to the tour for Only Everything, Hatfield released Phillips and brought on Jason Sutter (American Hi-Fi, Chris Cornell, Jack Drag), as well as Ed Slanker (Thudpucker, Tinsel) on 2nd guitar, and Lisa Mednick on keyboards. Two weeks into the tour, Hatfield canceled the tour, which her publicist explained as due to \\"nervous exhaustion,\\" and took a month-long break. In her memoir, Hatfield writes that in truth she was suffering from depression severe enough to the point of being suicidal. Hatfield disagreed with the decision not to be upfront about her depression. The drummer was, once again, replaced, this time by Phillips, and touring resumed with Jeff Buckley as the opening act. In 1996, she traveled to Woodstock, New York where she recorded tracks for God's Foot, which was to be her fourth solo album (third if not counting Become What You Are, which was recorded with the Juliana Hatfield Three), intended for 1997 release. After three failed attempts to satisfy requests from Atlantic Records to come up with a \\"single\\" that the label could release, Juliana requested she be released from her contract. The label obliged, but kept the rights to the songs produced during these sessions (Atlantic had reportedly paid 180,000 to that point on the recordings). Two tracks - \\"Mountains of Love\\" and \\"Fade Away\\" - were eventually released on a greatest hits collection entitled Gold Stars, while still another, \\"Can't Kill Myself,\\" was available for download from Hatfield's official website. The remaining tracks have surfaced only as substandard bootleg versions (which do not meet Hatfield's approval) and she has rarely featured them in her subsequent live performances. In 1997 Hatfield toured with the first Lilith Fair, a prominent all-female rock festival founded by singer Sarah McLachlan.","completion":"This text is about Juliana Hatfield, a singer and musician.

He thought, \\"It's better to be somewhere secluded, so there's no chance of someone walking in on me.\\" Step 2: Finding a large and dense bush, Jack stepped behind it and fumbled around with his belt and zipper.

As Jack carried on, a small feeling of guilt still lingered in his mind.

Feds Consider Part Ownership in Banks WASHINGTON (Oct. 9) - News that the Bush administration is considering taking part ownership in a number of U.S. banks helped restore a relative calm over global financial markets Thursday. The aim of such a move would be to thaw the lending freeze that threatens to push the world's economy into recession. It comes after rampant fear about the global economy sent investors scurrying on Tuesday for safety in U.S. government securities despite an orchestrated round of rate cuts by the world's central banks.

Wall Street began the day higher, but then slid after declines in some blue chip names like General Motors Corp. weighed on the markets. In an effort to show that governments around the world were focusing intently on ways to resolve the crisis, the administration announced that President Bush would meet with finance officials from the Group of Seven major industrial countries at the White House on Saturday. \\"The president will have the opportunity to hear directly from the finance ministers about how the financial crisis is affecting their respective economies and the steps they are taking to deal with these challenges both individually and collectively,\\" presidential press secretary Dana Perino told reporters. Perino said Bush would stress \\"the importance of nations working in a coordinated way to address the crisis while respecting the different conditions in each economy.\\" An administration official, who spoke late Tuesday on condition of anonymity because no decision has been made, said the 700 billion rescue package passed by Congress last week allows the Treasury Department to inject fresh capital into financial institutions and get ownership shares in return. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told reporters that Treasury was moving quickly to implement the 700 billion rescue effort and he specifically mentioned reviewing ways to bolster the capital of banks. \\"We will use all the tools we've been given to maximum effectiveness, including strengthening the capitalization of financial institutions of every size,\\" Paulson said at a Wednesday news conference. His statements came on the heels of Britain's move to pour cash into troubled banks in exchange for stakes in them — a partial nationalization. Asked whether he would try something like the British plan, Paulson said: \\"We have a broad range of authorities and tools. ... We've emphasized the purchase of liquid assets, but we have a broad range of authorities. And I'm confident we have the authorities we need to work with going forward.\\" The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its target for the benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks to 1.5 percent. The cut from 2 percent took the rate to its lowest level in more than four years. In an unprecedented coordinated move, central banks in England, China, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland and the European Central Bank also cut rates after a series of high-stakes phone calls over several days between Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his counterparts. The Fed acted in concert with the European Central Bank to make emergency interest rate cuts after the Sept. 11 terror attacks in 2001. But Wednesday's cuts were unique in the number of nations that participated, the Fed said. On Thursday, rates in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan were also trimmed and Asian markets appeared to find their feet after a brutal round of selling Wednesday. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose more than 1 percent but fell back to close down 0.5 percent to 9,157.49, a five-year low. That followed a 9.4 percent plunge Wednesday, its biggest one-day drop since the 1987 market crash. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 3.6 percent to 15,985.39, while South Korea's key index rose 0.6 percent after earlier rising as much as 2.9 percent. European markets shed some early gains Thursday ahead of Wall Street's opening, but remained in positive territory, with British banking stocks in particular enjoying a strong rally in the wake of the government's 865 billion plan to buy stakes in banks . But all eyes are on now on Wall Street, where investors hope markets are getting closer to finding a bottom after the worst five-day rout since 1987. On Wednesday, the Dow gave up 189 points to close at — and is now down about 35 percent from its high of 14,164.53 reached exactly one year ago. In midmorning trading, the Dow Jones industrial average fell almost 1 percent. GM was the biggest decliner in the Dow. Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.2 percent. The tentative move back into stocks Thursday siphoned some money away from safe haven investments like government bonds and gold. Demand for short-term Treasurys waned, with the yield on the three-month Treasury bill, which moves opposite its price, rising to 0.69 percent from 0.63 percent late Wednesday. Longer term debt also fell, with the yield on the 10-year note rising to 3.74 percent from 3.65 percent late Wednesday. For millions of Americans, the Fed's cut means borrowing money becomes cheaper. Home equity loans, credit cards and other floating-rate loans all fluctuate depending on what the Fed does. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other banks cut their prime rate by half a point to 4.5 percent, also the lowest in more than four years, after the Fed announced its decision early Wednesday. Fed watchers believe the central bank might cut rates further when it meets later this month, and perhaps again in December, in hopes of cushioning the blow if the United States falls into recession. Even the coordinated action may not break the fear that has gripped investors across the world as jobs evaporate and retirement savings dry up. Banks may still be inclined to hoard cash, and until they decide to lend again the crisis is not likely to let up. If anyone needed evidence, major American retailers turned in dismal sales figures for the third quarter — further proof that consumer spending, the lifeblood of the economy, is sputtering. The government reported Thursday that jobless claims fell by 20,000 to 478,000 last week, within economists' expectations. The claims still remain at elevated levels due to the struggling economy, though. The Fed's interest rate cut was a change in course. It had held rates steady because of inflation concerns. Since the Fed had put a stop to interest-rate cuts in June, the economic outlook has deteriorated. \\"The pace of economic activity has slowed markedly in recent months,\\" the Fed said. \\"Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit.\\" Although inflation has been running higher, the Fed believes the recent drop in prices for oil and gas, and the weaker prospects for economic activity, have reduced the threat it poses to the economy. The credit markets, which have been remarkably tight for weeks, showed only small signs of loosening. Rates on commercial paper, the short-term debt companies issue to raise cash for everyday expenses, went down. But the rate banks charge each other for loans went up. The Fed also reduced its emergency lending rate to banks by half a percentage point, to 1.75 percent. Given the intense credit crisis, banks have been borrowing more under what is known as the discount window. Associated Press writers Joe Bel Bruno and Anne D'Innocenzio in New York, Christopher S. Rugaber in Washington and Pan Pylas in London contributed to this report.

Movie plot title: Behold a Pale Horse Movie plot: By 1964, it was possible for a major studio to make a film touching upon the Spanish Civil War without having to answer to some senate investigating committee or other. Based on Emeric Pressburger's novel A Mouse on Sunday, Behold a Pale Horse stars Gregory Peck as a Republican war veteran Manuel Artiguez who continues waging a one-man offensive 20 years after hostilities have officially ceased. Pressburger's novel was loosely based on the last raid of real-life anarchist guerrilla Antonio Sabate who was killed in an ambush in 1959.When the young son of an old comrade in arms comes to the French border village where Artiguez is exiled, he asks the old warrior to avenge the death of his father at the hands of vengeful Nationalist police captain Vinolas played by Anthony Quinn. At first Manuel refuses, but when Manuel learns that his aged mother Pilar (Mildred Dunnock) is dying he's determined to return to Spain to bid farewell to her.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many percent of people were not from 2 or more races?","completion":"Title: Demographics and Diversity: Unraveling the Percentage of People Not Identifying as Two or More Races Introduction In the modern world, with increased globalization and constant population movements, cultural and ethnic diversity has become an important aspect of society. This has given rise to the concept of multiracial or biracial identity, where individuals can identify with two or more racial categories. Analyzing the proportion of people who do not fall under the multiracial identity would provide us an insight into the broader demographic landscape and help in shaping future policies and plans for social integration and diversity awareness. In this article, we will explore the world demographic data and the percentage of people who do not identify as two or more races. World Demographics and Multiracial Identity Estimating the proportion of multiracial individuals across the globe can be challenging, as several countries have different ways of collecting and reporting data. For instance, some countries provide population data based on ethnicity rather than race, making it difficult to achieve a complete picture. Nonetheless, the available data helps us understand the trend and the proportion of multiracial individuals in different regions. According to the United States Census Bureau, the population identifying as two or more races in 2020 was approximately 33.8 million, representing 10.2% of the total population. By analyzing this data, we can infer that 89.8% of the US population does not identify as two or more races. In European countries, multiracial population percentages can be more difficult to determine, as the data is mainly collected based on ethnicity or nationality rather than race. However, the available information suggests that the proportion of multiracial individuals in Europe is relatively smaller in comparison to the US. According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, approximately 3% of the European population comes from a mixed racial background, which would mean that 97% of the population does not identify as two or more races. Similar data from Asian, African, and South American countries show that multiracial populations make up a minority in these regions. The proportions vary from country to country, but a vast majority do not identify as two or more races. For instance, in Brazil, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), approximately 9.67% of the population identifies as multiracial, which signifies that around 90.33% of the population does not. Global Synthesis Considering the varying proportions of multiracial individuals in different continents and countries, it is difficult to derive an accurate global percentage. However, by analyzing data from various sources such as government surveys, research studies, and international organizations, we can infer that a significant majority of the world population does not identify as two or more races. The global proportion of people not identifying as two or more races can be estimated to be around 93-97%. Conclusion In conclusion, the demographics pertaining to multiracial identity vary across countries and regions. While some places show higher proportions of individuals identifying as two or more races, such as in the United States, a significant majority of the world population can still be said to identify with a single race. It is essential to understand these demographic trends as they can help inform policies and promote societal integration, cultural exchange, and appreciation of diversity. As demographics and migration patterns continue to change, so too will the percentage of people identifying as two or more races, making it vital for continuous monitoring and updating of data."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: An astronaut's work may sound exciting, but living in space isn't as fun as you think. The website www.space.com lists the disadvantages of living in space. Here are some of them. When astronauts work outside the station during spacewalks, they have to wear special gloves. The gloves are very tight. They can hurt the astronauts' fingernails and even make them fall off. In space, you don't have many choices in what you eat. It's hard to get fresh fruits and vegetables. It is not OK to eat bread because it leaves crumbs . Crumbs could fly around everywhere. In space, it is impossible to have a good shower because water can fly all over the ship and break the machines. Astronauts have to use a special water-shooting gun and a washcloth. Astronauts lose their bone strength quickly during their stay in space. So far, there is no way to solve this problem. They do exercise while they're in space to try to keep their bones strong as long as possible. Perhaps the hardest part of life in space is the feeling of loneliness. Astronauts sometimes have to spend weeks and even months away from Earth. They miss their friends and families.

The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964. Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born. The Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a \\"package\\" bill that included Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years, possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour. However, over the next few years, Davies went into a state of depression, not helped by his collapsing marriage, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was \\"sick of it all\\" at a gig in White City Stadium in 1973.

Title: Never Cry Wolf Movie plot: A young, naive Canadian biologist named Tyler (Charles Martin Smith) (portraying the real-life biologist Farley Mowat) is assigned by the government to travel to the isolated Canadian arctic wilderness and study why the local caribou population is declining, believed due to indiscriminate wolf-pack attacks. Tyler receives a baptism of fire into bush life with a trip by bush plane piloted by an odd, adventurous bush pilot named Rosie (Brian Dennehy). After landing at the destination, Rosie leaves Tyler and his gear in the middle of a frozen lake in a sub-zero Arctic nowhere. Unsure of where to start, Tyler's indecision quickly imperils him when he runs into a traveling wolf pack until he is rescued by a travelling elderly Inuit native named Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq), who builds a shelter for him.Alone, Tyler's days are divided between research and mere personal survival, while nights are fraught with anxiety-born nightmares of wolf attacks upon him. He soon encounters two wolves which he names George and Angeline, who have pups, and discovers they seem as curious of him as he is of them, slowly dispelling their mutual fears. He and the wolves both begin social exchanges, even urine-marking their territories, producing trust and respect between them.As the spring season arrives and the winter snow slowly melts, Tyler (being a person of procedure) soon discovers the simple, blunt arctic is indifferent to his sense of order. First dealing with sub-freezing weather extremes, ranging from cold snow to warmer heavy spring rains, compromise his shelter, his paperwork duties, his research. Complicating matters further are an invasive horde of Arctic mice when they show up after the spring thaw: they are everywhere, frustrating him and the wolves. Yet the wolves seem to cope with the madness by eating the mice, which Tyler emulates in his own bizarre way to see if an animal can survive on mice alone.During the mild summer season, another Inuit named Mike (Samson Jorah) encounters Tyler, who was sent by Ootek for...

Would \\"Before a statute becomes law in some countries, it must be agreed upon by the highest executive in the government , and finally published as part of a code .\\" be a reasonable answer? Choose your answer from: (1). No; (2). Yes; Answer:","completion":"2. Yes, the statement \\"Before a statute becomes law in some countries, it must be agreed upon by the highest executive in the government, and finally published as part of a code.\\" is a reasonable answer. However, to provide a detailed and long explanation, we should delve deeper into the topic. Statutes are formal written enactments of a legislative authority that govern a city, state, or country. They are formed through a legislative process involving a series of steps that vary depending on the jurisdiction. While the specific process may differ from one country to another, there are general stages that can be observed. 1. Proposal or introduction: A legislator, sometimes called a lawmaker or a member of parliament, proposes a new statute or an amendment to an existing one. The proposal may originate from the executive branch of the government, interest groups, or citizens. In some countries, the executive branch has the power to propose legislation, while in others, only members of the legislative branch can do so. 2. Review and debate: Once the proposed statute is introduced, it is often assigned to a committee for further review. This committee may hold public hearings and consult with experts on the subject matter to gather relevant information and input. After the committee's review, the proposed statute may be amended or modified to address any potential issues or concerns. Then, it is brought to the floor of the legislative chamber, where members debate and discuss the merits of the proposed statute. 3. Voting and approval: Once the debate concludes, members of the legislature vote on whether to pass the proposed statute. If it receives a majority vote in the legislative chamber, the statute moves to the next chamber (if there is one, as in bicameral legislatures) for further debate and voting. If it is approved by both chambers, it proceeds to the highest executive in the government for their assent. 4. Executive assent: The highest executive, such as a president, prime minister, or governor, holds the power to approve or veto the proposed statute. If they approve it, the statute becomes law. However, if they veto it, it is sent back to the legislative body. In some jurisdictions, the legislature may override the veto through a higher majority vote. 5. Publication and codification: After the statute has been assented to by the highest executive, it is officially published and becomes part of the legal code. This process usually involves incorporating the statute into an existing system of laws, organized by subject matter, and making it available to the public. Once published, the statute takes effect either immediately or on a specified date. While variations exist between countries, the process of forming statutes generally follows these steps. Thus, the given statement reasonably describes the journey of a proposed statute becoming law and being included in a code."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The process you described for baking a cake doesn't include coffee or any liquid derived from a coffee machine as an ingredient.

Unless the recipe specifically called for coffee or water from the coffee machine, which it does not in this case, then the lack of water in the coffee machine would have no effect on the quantity of ingredients used for the cake. It's important to remember that baking is often a precise science, with each ingredient playing a specific role in the final product. The ingredients' amounts are usually determined by the recipe and the desired outcome of the cake. Components such as eggs, oil, flour, sugar, baking powder, and any flavorings need to be balanced correctly.

Also provide the insurance company with information on the other driver. Immediately filing a claim will speed up the process of getting your car repaired and securing a rental vehicle, if necessary. Do not lie when stating the facts of the accident, as this can result in denial of your coverage. The other driver may suggest not filing claims in the event of a small accident, as filing a claim will raise your rates. However, it is always a good idea to file a claim to protect yourself. The other driver may later change his mind and file a claim, even claiming injuries that weren’t apparent at the time of the accident. You want to be sure your insurance company has your version of the accident as soon as possible. Particularly if anyone was hurt in the accident, hiring a lawyer is a good idea. A lawyer can help you maximize your reward if you have been injured, or defend you if the other motorist was injured. Keep records of any hospital visits, tests, prescriptions or other expenses that arise as a result of your auto accident. This information will be needed by your insurance company and attorney. If the accident impacts your life to the extent that you decide to file a personal injury suit, you can claim damages for mental and physical distress and/or lost wages, as well as medical treatment. Keep a diary of how the injuries impact your life, including missed workdays, routine activities you cannot undertake, and changes to you family life. This will determine how much your company, or the other motorist's company if they were at fault, is willing to pay to replace or fix your car. If you think the number is too low, get your own independent estimates, and then discuss them with your adjuster. Certainly the other motorist’s company, and perhaps your own, may not have your best interests at heart. If the other motorist’s insurance company calls you, politely refuse to discuss the accident with them and mention the call to your own insurance company or lawyer. If your company offers you an early settlement, do not sign it until you are sure you will be compensated for all your injuries. Some injuries – particularly back and neck ones caused by whiplash – might not show up or reach their maximum level of pain until weeks or even months after the accident.","completion":"This article says to report a car accident to your insurance company right away, share the truth about what happened, and maybe get a lawyer to help you with the details, so you can fix your car and feel better after the accident."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: The car hit a post, but the driver didn't stop.

It may be the world's most expensive car and one of the most environmentally friendly cars. The FCX is the first fuel-cell-powered car to be used by a family anywhere in the world. The FCX uses hydrogen and oxygen for fuel. Car makers have been working to develop vehicles that are better for the environment. They are developing cars that use fuel other than gasoline. And then what is fuel cell technology? Fuel cell technology works by changing the chemicals hydrogen and oxygen into water. This process produces electricity, and water vapor which comes out of the exhaust pipe. Most cars release dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Many scientists say these gases are major contributors to global warming. \\"The FCX is driven just like any other vehicle on the road, but without the gases which pollute the environment,\\" scientists say.

Средний класс все еще продолжает надеяться на то, что можно спасти свои сбережения, однако эти деньги, находящиеся в заморозке на банковских счетах нации, вряд ли когда-нибудь будут доступны кому-либо. Это ставит их в крайне непростое материальное положение, так как они отчасти или полностью лишены своих средств к существованию. Такая ситуация ставит под угрозу социальное положение среднего класса, и связана с различными негативными последствиями. Во-первых, стабильность экономики начинает рушиться, так как люди все больше и больше опасаются за свое финансовое будущее. Это может привести к увеличению недоверия к банковским учреждениям и даже к протестам и массовым выступлениям, особенно если сбережения небольшие и семьям едва хватает на проживание. Во-вторых, затяжной кризис с замороженными сбережениями может привести к долгосрочному снижению уровня жизни среднего класса. Семьи становятся вынуждены возвращаться к дешевому и низкокачественному потреблению, что в свою очередь ухудшает качество жизни и оказывает сильное воздействие на рынок, на который средний класс тратит большую часть своих средств. В-третьих, такие тенденции сказываются на социальной напряженности и психологическом состоянии людей.

В результате общественное недоволство растет, а межклассовые разногласия могут усилиться. Важно осознавать, что заморозка сбережений среднего класса - это не только финансовый вопрос или проблема конкретных людей, но и серьезное социально-экономическое предупреждение.

There were 1,280,325 households with approximately 2.1 persons per household. The population density was 11,836 persons per km². The 1923 Great Kantō earthquake caused a mass migration to Osaka between 1920 and 1930, and the city became Japans largest city in 1930 with 2,453,573 people, outnumbering even Tokyo, which had a population of 2,070,913. The population peaked at 3,252,340 in 1940, and had a post-war peak of 3,156,222 in 1965, but continued to decrease since, as the residents moved out to the suburbs.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose If there is a drought happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER caverns. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation, in this case a drought, can have both direct and indirect effects on the formation of small or less caverns. Direct effects: 1. Reduced water availability: A drought leads to a significant reduction in water available on the surface. This means that less water will seep below the soil and come into contact with the rocks, which reduces the water's ability to carve through the rock over time. 2. Slower process of cavern formation: Due to less water seeping into the ground, the process of cavern formation will potentially slow down. The rocks may take much longer to dissolve, and the space within the rock might not grow as rapidly, resulting in smaller or fewer caverns. Indirect effects: 1. Changes in the ecosystem: Drought can lead to various environmental changes, such as reduced vegetation growth and the death of organisms that help break down rocks. This could further contribute to slowing down the process of cavern formation. 2. Erosion: Drought can affect the overall rate of erosion, potentially leading to a slower rate of cavern formation. In some cases, drought can also cause the existing caverns to collapse, resulting in smaller and less stable caverns. In summary, the perturbation of drought, directly and indirectly, affects the process of cavern formation, leading to smaller and less caverns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Even if you are against a person, it is important to have respect. It is this respect that makes us human. Without respect, we become animals. We need to respect our friends for our friendship. We even need to respect our enemies because they help us to grow up and become stronger. Respect is one of the crucial values in a relationship. Love Love is everything. With love in our hearts, we feel no need to hurt another. With love in our hearts, we will pay more attention to the similarities in opinions rather than the disagreement. If we want others to be good to us, we need to be good to them. After all, we give love to get love, right? Loyalty People often ignore the meaning and importance of loyalty. Loyalty is necessary for people to believe in each other. In no matter what kind of friendship, we need to believe in each other so that we can work together towards the same goal. Honesty Honesty is to show other people who we really are. Honesty helps to do better, because it makes us realize our problems and find ways to solve them.

This has led to a Right-to-Dry Movement that is calling for laws to be passed to protect people's right to use clotheslines.So far, only three states have laws to protect clothesline.Right-to-Dry supporters argue that there should be more. Matt Reck, 37, is the kind of eco-conscious person who feeds his trees with bathwater and reuses water drops from his air conditioners to water plants.His family also uses a clothesline.But on July 9, 2007, the HOA in Wake Forest, North Carolina, told him that a dissatisfied neighbor had telephoned them about his clothesline.The Recks paid no attention to the warning and still dried their clothes on a line in the yard.\\"Many people say they are environmentally friendly but they don't take matters into their own hands,\\" says Reck.The local HOA has decided not to take any action, unless more neighbors come to them.

Given the task definition and input, reply with output. In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Reports suggest that the club is ready to pay the £15.3 million release clause in Paulista's contract this transfer window, ensuring the stability and strength the team needs for the remainder of the season. The move is contingent on it being in the best interest of all parties involved. Villarreal seems open to negotiations, providing an excellent opportunity for the Gunners to strengthen their defense, which has been heavily reliant on Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker in recent times. Gabriel Paulista, a 29-year-old versatile player, has been a pivotal figure in Villarreal's 15-game unbeaten run across all competitions, showcasing top-notch performance and outstanding skills on the field. This run of form has seen the Spanish club rise to the top of their domestic league standings and become a serious contender in European competitions. The transfer of Paulista to the Premier League club would provide significant cover for Arsenal's defensive duo of Koscielny and Mertesacker, filling in any gaps left by the pair's injuries or suspensions. Arsenal's manager recognizes the need for reinforcements, as the team is currently fighting for both domestic and European glory. Despite being in the top four, Arsenal has faced criticism for their frailties at the back, which have sometimes derailed otherwise promising campaigns. By bringing in an accomplished player such as Paulista, the club seeks to address these concerns and create a formidable, well-balanced team capable of challenging for silverware on multiple fronts. The potential transfer of Gabriel Paulista to Arsenal also highlights the fluid nature of the transfer market, where clubs must be adaptable and strategic to remain competitive. By being ready and willing to part with the £15.3 million release clause, Arsenal demonstrates its intentions to be a force to reckon with in European football. The financial power of England's top clubs is often seen as a primary driver for securing talented players from across the globe, and this potential deal is yet another example of that trend. Fans and experts alike eagerly await the culmination of the deal, with supporters hoping that the addition of Paulista will propel Arsenal to new heights - both domestically and on the European stage. With several weeks remaining in the transfer window, the club has ample time to finalize negotiations, ensuring that the possible arrival of the Brazilian defender is a smooth and well-coordinated transition. In conclusion, the proposed transfer of Gabriel Paulista from Villarreal to Arsenal offers an exciting prospect of further bolstering the English club's defensive capabilities. If successful, the deal would be a mutually beneficial arrangement, allowing Paulista to continue his career in one of the world's top leagues and providing Arsenal the necessary reinforcements to mount a strong challenge for titles in the coming months."},{"prompt":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who volunteered to tend to army horses? , can you please find it? Sir Edwin Lutyens was among the most distinguished architects for war memorials in Britain. He became a nationally renowned designer of war memorials following his work as an adviser to (and later one of the principal architects for) the Imperial War Graves Commission and his design for the Cenotaph on London's Whitehall. As well as dozens of public war memorials in towns and cities across Britain, Lutyens designed several private memorials to individual casualties, usually the sons of friends or clients. Many were heirs to the country houses Lutyens had built earlier in his career, as in Mells where he renovated the manor at the beginning of the 20th century. His work in Mells arose through his friend and collaborator Gertrude Jekyll, who introduced him to the Horners through a family connection. Lutyens established a friendship which led to multiple commissions in the village. In addition to his work on the manor, he redesigned its gardens and worked on several related buildings and structures, and after the war was responsible for a tribute to Raymond Asquith (Edward's brother-in-law), also located in St Andrew's Church, and the village war memorial. Lutyens designed two other memorials to Horner: a wooden board featuring a description of the events leading up to his death, which was placed on a wall in the family chapel in St Andrew's Church; and a stone tablet in Cambrai Cathedral.Alfred Munnings was a painter specialising in horses. He volunteered for military service at the outbreak of war but was deemed unfit due to lack of sight in one eye. He volunteered to tend to army horses and was later recruited as a civilian war artist attached to Canadian cavalry. In 1919, he was beginning to move into sculpture. The Horner memorial was his first public work of sculpture, for which Lutyens commissioned him based on a pre-existing friendship. The work led to several further commissions for equine statues, including from the Jockey Club for a sculpture of the racehorse Brown Jack at Epsom Downs Racecourse....

As she goes to pass, her car is clipped by a truck going in the opposite direction, then slammed full-force by the Mack, killing her. Meanwhile, John Quincy Archibald and his wife Denise witness their young son Michael collapse at his baseball game and take Michael to the hospital. After a series of tests at the hospital, John is informed by Dr. Raymond Turner and Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, that his son has an enlarged heart and will need a heart transplant to live. The procedure is very expensive: 250,000 (at a minimum), with a down payment of 75,000 (30%) required to get Michael's name on the organ donor list. John tells them he is insured, but after looking through his policy, they tell him that because the company he works for dropped John from full-time to part-time, his health insurance has been changed, and the new policy does not cover the surgery, which leaves John and Denise to raise 75,000 on their own. The family tries to raise the money but are only able to come up with a third of the necessary payment. The hospital tires of waiting and releases Michael; Denise urges John to do something. Unwilling to let his child die, John walks into the hospital ER with a handgun, gathers eleven hostages, and sets demands: his son's name on the recipient list as soon as possible.

Stuttgart's mayor urged residents to use public transport or electric taxis, or to form carpools. Stuttgart is the first city in Germany to issue an official alarm over levels of polluting particles in the air. On Monday, levels of harmful PM10 particles in Stuttgart reached 89 micrograms per cubic meter - nearly double the safe maximum of 50 micrograms, according to the regional environment agency for the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. In a statement (in German), the city website urged residents to use public transport, electric taxis, or form carpools. Some 500,000 car journeys are made each day in Stuttgart - the home of the famous Daimler and Porsche brands. In a statement (in German), the city council also asked employers to let staff work flexible hours or even from home. It advised against using wood-burning stoves which could increase pollution levels. \\"The aim is to improve the quality of life in Stuttgart,\\" the statement said. Authorities acted after meteorologists warned there was a danger that cancer-causing particles would be trapped in the air above the city for several days. They said it was because a layer of warm air higher up would prevent the particle-rich colder air near the ground from rising out of the city.

You're never too old to play Nintendo Wii-Fit – because it helps keep older people on their feet, claim researchers. Those prone to falling have most to gain from the popular computer game console, which simulates sports such as tennis, bowling and boxing. A study shows it benefits those too frail to take part in conventional physiotherapy because they are not strong or fit enough. They tried to make me go to rehab: Playing a Nintendo Wii Fit takes 30 per cent less energy than physio, while improving balance and coordination. Playing Wii-Fit games uses 30 per cent less energy than physio treatment, but improves the balance and co-ordination needed to avoid falls. Researchers Dr Murray Griffin and Dr Matt Taylor, from the School of Biological Sciences at Essex University, studied 20 pensioners who had suffered heart problems. Keeping active: Nintento Wii. In the study, published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, the volunteers used a Wii-Fit balance board to play co-ordination and ski jump games. Talking about the finding that the volunteers used less energy, Dr Griffin said: ‘This offers a real hope to some of the most vulnerable and elderly people in society whose frailty seriously impacts on their quality of life.’ Recurrent fallers cost the NHS nearly £1.7billion a year in hospital admissions and long-term care costs. Not only can it cause broken bones and other physical damage, fallers are often left feeling anxious and less likely to move about. This can have a negative effect on their quality of life and lead to depression. It is thought the effect of Wii exercise on the brain may be similar to real exercise, which can boost levels of the feelgood chemical dopamine.

Question: This article: In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954. Its preparation was dogged by misfortunes.

Write a summary based on this article: CENTENNIAL — Prosecutors presented video of terrified moviegoers, laid out where police recovered bodies and explained in precise detail how each of the 12 slain victims died during a grim first day of theater-shooting suspect James Holmes' preliminary hearing. Testimony on Monday painted a picture of pandemonium, where blood-drenched people screamed for help and police officers raced against time to save survivors. While police choked up on the stand recounting the day, the accused sat bushy-bearded at the defense table showing no emotion. Coroners testified that 33 rounds — a mix of single bullets and shotgun blasts — were used to kill the 12 slain victims. Four struck 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan. In signs of an anticipated insanity defense, prosecutors and the defense fought to frame Holmes' state of mind during and immediately after the July 20 shooting, pitting images of a determined shooter against someone disconnected from his surroundings. Surveillance video from the lobby of the Century Aurora 16 theater shows Holmes hiding his dyed-red hair beneath a dark stocking cap. He had purchased his ticket for the midnight showing July 8. Police recovered 209 live AR-15 rounds and 15 live 40-caliber handgun rounds from the scene, testified Detective Matthew Ingui. The gunman was \\"very calm and moving with purpose,\\" one victim told Ingui. Officers from all points rushed to the scene, at first mistaking the man in the gas mask and body armor for one of their own. From atop an elevated garage, Sgt. Gerald Jonsgaard scouted the back of the theater, where he spotted Holmes. \\"My first thought was, 'How did that SWAT guy get here so quick?' \\" Jonsgaard testified. For a few brief moments, he held Holmes in his cross hairs. At the same time, Officer Jason Oviatt realized he had made a similar mistake. Holmes was \\"just standing there,\\" Oviatt testified. \\"Not doing anything. Not in any hurry. Not excited.\\" Oviatt and the other officers paint a nuanced picture of his state of mind — details attorneys homed in on. At one point, defense attorney Daniel King pointed out that Oviatt had observed Holmes dripping with sweat. Chief Deputy District Attorney Karen Pearson quickly pointed out that anyone wearing body armor would likely be sweating. Oviatt's reports from that day note Holmes \\"simply stared off into the distance\\" and \\"seemed to be out of it and disoriented.\\" On the stand, Oviatt said Holmes was \\"very, very relaxed\\" and showed no normal emotional responses but understood directions and cooperated. Oviatt testified he saw no signs of drug use, despite noting in reports that Holmes' pupils were \\"huge.\\" Officer Justin Grizzle remembered asking Holmes if he had a partner in the shooting shortly afterward and receiving an enigmatic response. \\"He just looked at me and smiled,\\" Grizzle said. ||||| The families of victims last year's mass shooting at a Colorado theater shooting sat through emotional testimony Monday from police officers who tried to save the lives of the wounded.

(Associated Press) Family members and victims line up to get into court for a preliminary hearing for Aurora theater shooting suspect james Holmes at the courthouse in Centennial, Colo., on Monday, Jan. 7, 2013. Holmes... (Associated Press) One sergeant recalled during the hearing for suspected gunman James Holmes that he checked and did not find a pulse for the youngest victim, 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan. Another who drove the wounded to the hospital said he had to stop one man worried about his 7-year-old daughter from jumping out of the moving patrol car. A bearded Holmes didn't appear to show any emotion. One woman sat with her head buried in her hands during the testimony about Veronica. The police officer who arrested the suspected gunman said he first thought James Holmes was a fellow officer because he was wearing body armor. Then the officer realized he was wrong because Holmes wasn't running toward the scene. The first extensive details were emerging about the young man suspected of killing 12 people and wounding at least 58 in one of the worst mass shootings in the U.S. last year. The hearing will determine whether the case will go to trial. Holmes is charged with more than 160 counts, including murder and attempted murder. Investigators say he was wearing a gas mask, in addition to the body armor, when he tossed two gas canisters and opened fire in the theater on July 20. As soon as Officer Jason Oviatt saw Holmes outside the theater and realized that he wasn't a fellow officer, he pointed his gun at Holmes, handcuffed him and searched him. Oviatt said he found two knives and a semi-automatic handgun on top of Holmes' car. The officer said an ammunition round fell out of Holmes' pocket, and he found another one on the ground. Police officers who arrested Holmes described him as unusually relaxed but fidgety at times. They said he told them that his apartment had been booby trapped. Holmes didn't seem to have \\"normal emotional reactions\\" to things, Oviatt said. \\"He seemed very detached from it all,\\" he said. Until now, many details of the case have been kept quiet. Three days after the shooting, District Judge William Sylvester forbade attorneys and investigators from discussing the case publicly, and many court documents have been filed under seal. Police say Holmes, now 25, had stockpiled weapons, ammunition and explosives. He was a first-year student in a Ph.D. neuroscience program at the University of Colorado, Denver, but he failed a year-end exam and withdrew, authorities have said. The shootings came six weeks later. Federal authorities have said Holmes entered the theater with a ticket and is believed to have propped open a door, slipped out to his car and returned with his weapons. Police arrested him outside the theater shortly after the shootings ended. Legal analysts said that evidence appears to be so strong that Holmes may accept a plea agreement before trial. In general, plea agreements help prosecutors avoid costly trials, give the accused a lesser sentence like life in prison rather than the death penalty and spare the victims and their families from the trauma of going through a lengthy trial. Holmes' mental health could be a significant issue in the hearing. His attorneys have told the judge Holmes is mentally ill, but they have not said whether they plan to employ an insanity defense. He had seen a university psychiatrist, and his lawyers have said he tried to call the psychiatrist nine minutes before the killing began. Defense lawyers have said they plan to call at least two witnesses who could testify about Holmes' mental health. Prosecutors asked the judge to block the witnesses, but he refused. Lawyers have been debating what physical evidence should be made available, whether a psychiatrist who met with Holmes is barred from testimony by doctor-patient privilege and other issues. ___ Associated Press writer Dan Elliott contributed. |||||","completion":"During the preliminary hearing in Centennial, Colorado, the prosecutors presented video of terrified moviegoers, described the locations where police recovered bodies, and detailed how each of the 12 slain victims died during the theater-shooting incident involving James Holmes.

Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices.

She led the way into the cheerful schoolroom, where big girls and little girls were sitting about, amusing themselves in the quiet of a long Sunday afternoon. Several of the younger children ran to her as she came in, and stood holding fast to the folds of her black habit, staring up at the strangers, while she explained the kind of instruction given, the system, and the order reigning in each department. Finally, she persuaded a little girl, only six years old, to take her dusky face out of the long flowing veil of the nun, and show how quickly she could read a sentence that Sister Winifred wrote on the blackboard. Then others were called on, and gave examples of their accomplishments in easy arithmetic and spelling. The children must have been very much bored with themselves that stormy Sunday, for they entered into the examination with a quite unnatural zest. Two of the elder girls recited, and some specimens of penmanship and composition were shown. The delicate complexion of the little nun flushed to a pretty wild-rose pink as these pupils of hers won the Colonel's old fashioned compliments.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Lehrer was born in 1928 to a Jewish family and grew up in Manhattan's Upper East Side. Although he was raised Jewish, Lehrer became an agnostic. He began studying classical piano at the age of seven, but was more interested in the popular music of the age. Eventually, his mother also sent him to a popular-music piano teacher. Context: Lehrer earned his Bachelor of Arts in mathematics (magna cum laude) from Harvard University in 1946. He received his MA degree the next year, and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. He taught classes at MIT, Harvard, Wellesley, and the University of California, Santa Cruz. He remained in Harvard's doctoral program for several years, taking time out for his musical career and to work as a researcher at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. He was drafted into the U.S. Army from 1955 to 1957, working at the National Security Agency(NSA). (Lehrer has stated that he invented the Jell-O Shot during this time, as a means of circumventing liquor restrictions.) These experiences became fodder for songs, e.g., \\"The Wild West Is Where I Want to Be\\" and \\"It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier\\". Interestingly, it was many years before Lehrer publicly revealed having been assigned to the NSA, since the mere 'fact-of' its existence was classified at the time: this left him in the interesting position of implicitly using nuclear weapons work as as cover story for something more sensitive. Despite holding a master's degree in an era when American conscripts often lacked a high school diploma, Lehrer served as an enlisted soldier, achieving the rank of Specialist Third Class (later retitled \\"Specialist-4\\" and currently \\"Specialist\\"), which he described as being a \\"corporal without portfolio.\\" In 1960, Lehrer returned to full-time studies at Harvard, but in 1965 gave up on his mathematical dissertation about the subject of modes in statistics, after working on it intermittently for 15 years. From 1962, he taught in the political science department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 1972, he joined the faculty of the University of California, Santa Cruz, teaching an introductory course entitled \\"The Nature of Mathematics\\" to liberal arts majors--\\"Math for Tenors\\", according to Lehrer. He also taught a class in musical theater. He occasionally performed songs in his lectures, primarily those relating to the topic. In 2001, Lehrer taught his last mathematics class (on the topic of infinity) and retired from academia. He has remained in the area, and in 2003 said he still \\"hangs out\\" around the University of California, Santa Cruz. Question: Did Lehrer ever join the military?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Tom Lehrer joined the military. He was drafted into the U.S. Army from 1955 to 1957 and worked at the National Security Agency (NSA) during that time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Who calls Ken? Movie title: In Bruges Movie plot: Carrying out orders to execute a priest, rookie hitman Ray also accidentally kills a young boy. He and his mentor Ken are sent to Bruges, where they are to await further instructions, by their employer Harry. Ken finds the city charming and quaint, while Ray has nothing but contempt for it. One night, Ken indulges Ray's desire to get out of their hotel room, and they explore the city. They chance upon a film shoot involving a dwarf actor, which amuses Ray. Ray approaches ChloÃ«, a local drug dealer moonlighting as a production assistant. He takes her to a fancy restaurant, where he gets into an argument with a couple and ends up knocking them unconscious. ChloÃ« takes Ray to her apartment, but her ex-boyfriend Eirik suddenly appears and threatens Ray with a handgun. Ray disarms him, and fires the gun (which is loaded with blanks) in his face, blinding one of his eyes. ChloÃ« shamefully admits that she and Eirik occasionally rob tourists after she seduces them, insisting she'd told Eirik that Ray was not a target. Ray also becomes acquainted with the dwarf actor, Jimmy, who turns out to be a drug-abusing racist. Harry calls Ken and orders him to kill Ray, on the principle that the killing of a childâeven accidentallyâis unforgivable. With a handgun supplied by Harry's local contact Yuri, Ken tracks Ray to a park and reluctantly prepares to kill him. However, Ray, distraught at his killing of the boy, prepares to kill himself with Eirik's loaded gun. Seeing this, Ken stops Ray, informs him of Harry's order, and tells him to leave Bruges to make a new start elsewhere.

Review: The films of UPA are surprisingly well rated on IMDb despite the fact that the animation quality is light-years behind that of Looney Toons, Disney and MGM at their prime. Sadly, due to rising costs in making pretty cartoons with high frame-rates and lovely backgrounds, the UPA style (which debuted about 1950) began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s. After all, the films were dirt cheap to make and they'd received several Oscars to \\"prove\\" that the cartoons were now mainstream. So as a result, lousy animation was becoming the norm and this trend wasn't reversed until the 1980s. This UPA film is one of the early ones. The characters are very simply drawn (any simpler and they would have used stick figures) and the backgrounds were ugly--simple line drawings with colors added in a very slap-dash manner (often with a sponge and rarely completely filling the items). As for the story, it's a jive story with a strong jazz style attitude. Some will love this, others will just find it very, very loud. It's the traditional \\"Frankie and Johnny\\" story and because of the shootings and all, it's probably not a great film for the kids. Heck, because of the animation and jazz, it's not a particularly good film for me, either! Some will read my review and no doubt think I am a crank (which I am, to a degree). However, I love animated films and a little of this minimalistic UPA style goes a very, very long way and you can't seriously consider them great works of art--just very, very quickly made cartoons. Ignore the Oscars and try watching some classic cartoons or something--anything else! What is the sentiment of this review? Choose your answer from: [i] negative.

Culture: Other 19th-century critics, following Rousseau have accepted this differentiation between higher and lower culture, but have seen the refinement and sophistication of high culture as corrupting and unnatural developments that obscure and distort people's essential nature.

Context: Despite the passport union with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland, Finland could not join the Nordic Council until 1955 because of Soviet fears that Finland might become too close to the West. At that time the Soviet Union saw the Nordic Council as part of NATO of which Denmark, Norway and Iceland were members. That same year Finland joined the United Nations, though it had already been associated with a number of UN specialized organisations. The first Finnish ambassador to the UN was G.A. Gripenberg (1956–1959), followed by Ralph Enckell (1959–1965), Max Jakobson (1965–1972), Aarno Karhilo (1972–1977), Ilkka Pastinen (1977–1983), Keijo Korhonen (1983–1988), Klaus Törnudd (1988–1991), Wilhelm Breitenstein (1991–1998) and Marjatta Rasi (1998–2005). In 1972 Max Jakobson was a candidate for Secretary-General of the UN. In another remarkable event of 1955, the Soviet Union decided to return the Porkkala peninsula to Finland, which had been rented to the Soviet Union in 1948 for 50 years as a military base, a situation which somewhat endangered Finnish sovereignty and neutrality.

Article: If you have a dog, it is important not to call him to where you are. He will be expecting something positive when he comes to you, and may be very disappointed that you called him for something as unpleasant as a bath. It is preferable to either pick him up and carry him to the bathing spot (if he's small enough), or walk him there. You can pick up your cat, but he may run and hide from you if he knows that you are about to give him a bath. Entice him out of his hiding spot with a treat. Do not be surprised if your pet becomes resistant once he realizes where he is going. If this happens, do not raise your voice. Be gentle yet firm with him, since bathing him will be necessary to remove the urine smell. Once you get to the bathing area, it may be helpful to give your pet a treat or two. If you are bathing your pet in the tub, place a towel in the tub before he gets in. Brushing your pet will remove any tangles or matted fur. Doing this before you bathe him is very important—trying to brush through tangles or mattes is next to impossible when your pet's coat is soaked with water. Start from your pet's neck and slowly work your way down to his tail. If your pet's nails have not been trimmed in a while, your pet could easily use his nails to scratch you while you are bathing him. If you are comfortable with doing so, trim your dog's or cat's nails. If you have to use styptic powder on any of the nails to stop bleeding, wait until the bleeding has stopped before bathing him. Keeping water out of your pet's eyes, ears, and face will be important when you are bathing him. If your pet will let you, place one or two cotton balls in each ear. If he doesn't like having cotton balls in his ears, use extra care to avoid getting water in his ears. Remember to take the cotton balls out of his ears when you have finished bathing him. If you are using a hose or handheld shower head to bathe your pet, make sure that the water pressure is not too forceful. You can also use a large plastic pitcher to pour water over him. If you are giving your pet a bath inside, make sure that the water is no hotter than lukewarm. You may not be able to adjust the temperature of the water if you are bathing your pet outside. To get your pet comfortable with the sensation of getting wet, put the water on his back and shoulders first. Once he has relaxed, wet his neck and work your way back to his tail. Place a generous amount of shampoo in your palm and use your fingers to gently work the shampoo into your pet's coat and skin, starting from his neck and working your way back. By working back from his neck, you will prevent any fleas from moving up his body towards his face and head. You will probably need to shampoo your pet more than once to get the urine smell out. Keep in mind that shampoo has the tendency to strip the skin and coat of natural oils, so you do not want to shampoo him too many times. Use a washcloth dampened with plain water (no shampoo- bold) to wash your pet's face. Talking with your pet in calming voice and offering him occasional treats will help make the bathing process more enjoyable for him. Be careful not to get the shampoo in your pet's eyes. Shampoo residue can make your pet feel itchy, so you want to make sure that you rinse out all of the shampoo before drying him. If you are bathing your dog, be mindful that your his hair is thicker than your own, so you will need to take extra time to work your fingers through his hair when rinsing out the shampoo. You will know when you have rinsed out all of the shampoo when you no longer see any suds in the water that you are using to rinse him. Consider giving your pet a quick sniff after you have finished rinsing him to see if you can smell urine. If you still smell urine, consider shampooing and rinsing him again. If you placed a piece of steel wool in the bathtub drain, remove and discard the steel wool after you have finished rinsing him off. If you are bathing your cat, wrap her snugly in a towel and dry her off in a warm, draft-free location in your home. You may need more than one towel to dry off your dog, depending on his size. If you know that your dog is going to want to shake as soon as you finish rinsing him off, you can try gently holding his muzzle with your thumb and forefinger—a dog cannot shake his body if you hold his muzzle still. You can let go of his muzzle once he is at least somewhat dry. If you are using a blow dryer to dry your pet, set it on one of the cooler settings to prevent thermal damage to his skin. Your dog may be tempted to bolt and rub on something (e.g., furniture, carpet, ground) as soon as you have finished drying him off. Consider keeping him in a relatively confined area, such as the kitchen, until he is completely dry. Reward your pet with a generous amount of positive reinforcement. This can be a combination of treats, new toys, verbal praise, and extra playtime. What is a summary?","completion":"Summary: Bathing your pet can be a necessary task to remove unpleasant smells, such as urine. To make the experience better for both you and your pet, approach the bathing process gently and calmly. For dogs, walk or carry them to the bathing area, whereas, for cats, entice them out of hiding with a treat. Prepare the bathing area with a towel and ensure the water is lukewarm. Brush your pet before bathing and trim their nails to avoid scratches. Keep their eyes, ears, and face dry and use a gentle water pressure. Apply enough shampoo to remove the urine smell, and rinse thoroughly.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: A new study done by the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario (HEQCO) shows that it doesn't make much of a difference that parents reward their children with cash for their better marks. Many parents have offered cash to their children in the hope that it would improve marks and possibly raise their children's interest in achieving higher marks. The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Toronto (UT) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to learn more about the potential for financial encouragement as motivation for improved marks, involved first and second year students receiving financial aid in 2008-2009 at the University of Toronto Scarborough. The top students participating in the study who said they were \\"very concerned\\" about having enough money to complete their degrees were to receive 100 for getting a grade of 70 per cent for each one-semester course, plus 20 for every percentage point beyond that.It was imaginable that a student could earn as much as 700 for achieving 100 percent in a course. Harvey Weingarten, president and CEO of HEQCO said, \\"In its efforts to help disadvantaged students by exploring the idea of paying them to attend school, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is asking the same question many other districts are asking about how to improve student participation and performance.Our study and others to date indicate that has little effect if any in those situations where it has been tested.\\" The authors of the study suggest that ineffective study habits may be a barrier to academic achievement and that the real problem may be more a lack of academic preparation than a lack of effort or motivation.They note that the availability of peer advising does not appear to have helped greatly.They conclude that other potential avenues to improving performance, or other approaches of teaching, are needed at the high school and postsecondary levels. Question: The real problem with student participation and performance is most probably a lack of _ . Options: A: academic preparation B: effort or motivation C: teaching methods D: peer advising A:","completion":"The real problem with student participation and performance is most probably a lack of academic preparation. In the given article, it is mentioned that the study conducted by the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario (HEQCO) found that offering cash rewards to students for achieving better marks did not significantly improve their performance. The researchers involved in the study suggest that ineffective study habits may be a factor impacting academic achievement, and they propose that the real issue might be more related to a lack of academic preparation rather than a lack of effort or motivation. They also note that the availability of peer advising does not seem to have helped much, and emphasize the need for exploring alternative methods to improve performance and teaching approaches at both high school and postsecondary levels. Given this information, the correct answer to the question, \\"The real problem with student participation and performance is most probably a lack of _,\\" is option A: academic preparation. The article highlights academic preparation as the primary hindrance to academic achievement, rather than options B: effort or motivation, C: teaching methods, or D: peer advising."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: The Irish Top Gear producer punched by Jeremy Clarkson is suing the presenter and the BBC for racial discrimination.","completion":"Title: Irish Top Gear Producer Sues Jeremy Clarkson and BBC for Racial Discrimination Introduction In a shocking turn of events, the Irish Top Gear producer, who was involved in a highly publicized altercation with Jeremy Clarkson, has decided to file a lawsuit against the former Top Gear presenter and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The producer, Oisin Tymon, alleges that both Clarkson and the BBC are guilty of racial discrimination. Background Back in March 2015, Jeremy Clarkson was involved in a physical and verbal altercation with Oisin Tymon, a Top Gear producer, at a hotel in North Yorkshire. According to reports at the time, Clarkson was upset because he could not get a hot meal after a long day of filming and took out his frustrations on Tymon. The argument resulted in Clarkson punching Tymon, leaving him with a split lip and a trip to the hospital. This incident proved to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, as Clarkson's contract with the BBC was not renewed, effectively putting an end to his tenure with the popular motoring show. The Lawsuit In November 2015, Tymon filed a lawsuit against both Jeremy Clarkson and the BBC, claiming racial discrimination. At the heart of the lawsuit, Tymon alleges that Clarkson used derogatory and offensive language, specifically targeting his Irish nationality, during the heated altercation. Consequently, Tymon asserts that such comments constitute racial discrimination under the United Kingdom's law. Furthermore, Tymon's legal claim against the BBC revolves around the notion that the broadcasting corporation failed to protect him from racial discrimination. Employers in the United Kingdom are obliged to shield their workers from any form of discrimination and foster a safe and inclusive working environment. Tymon's legal team posits that the BBC did not fulfill this obligation. Impact on Clarkson and the BBC The lawsuit brought forth by Tymon has had significant implications for Jeremy Clarkson. Firstly, it is important that the case brings Clarkson's character into question, especially considering his departure from Top Gear and subsequent move to Amazon's motoring show, The Grand Tour. With a reputation marred by controversy, it remains to be seen if the lawsuit will have further consequences on his career. The BBC, on the other hand, has been heavily criticized for the handling of the whole fiasco. While the corporation did not renew Clarkson's contract, it has been accused of not taking adequate measures to address the issue of discrimination in the workplace. The lawsuit sheds light on a potential systemic issue within the BBC, which has faced other allegations of discrimination in the past. Possible Outcomes Depending on the outcome of the lawsuit, both Jeremy Clarkson and the BBC could face significant financial reparations to Tymon if they are found guilty of racial discrimination. Furthermore, the incident could have lasting effects on both parties' reputations and their ability to approach similar situations in the future. It also highlights the importance of addressing racial discrimination in all areas of life, including the entertainment industry. Conclusion The lawsuit filed by the Irish Top Gear producer, Oisin Tymon, against Jeremy Clarkson and the BBC for racial discrimination is a stark reminder that such issues should not be taken lightly. Moreover, it presents an opportunity for the entertainment industry and companies, in general, to reassess and strengthen their policies against discrimination in the workplace. The outcome of this case could have considerable consequences for both Clarkson and the BBC and may serve as a precedent for taking racial discrimination seriously within the industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Let's break down each sentence to analyze them step by step: Sentence 1: As ad hoc efforts, each individual principle addresses a single aspect that is necessary, but is not sufficient for success by itself. This sentence states that: 1. There are individual principles being considered. 2. Each principle addresses a single aspect that is necessary for success. 3. However, each principle by itself is not enough to guarantee success. Sentence 2: Taken alone, each principle is not sufficient to achieve success. This sentence states that: 1. Each principle is being considered individually. 2. When considered individually, each principle is not enough to guarantee success. Now, let's compare the two sentences: Both sentences discuss individual principles being considered alone and how they relate to ensuring success. The first sentence describes these principles as ad hoc efforts, while the second sentence omits this description. The key point in both sentences is that each principle, when taken individually, is not sufficient for success.

Science fiction films that reflect quality are scarce indeed, largely because transposal of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention, and unfortunately for its producers, this work is lacking on both counts, woefully so in the case of the latter. With essentially no budget with which to operate, it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and, in particular, special effects of space opera warfare which appear only clownish, while seeds from the scriptors' imagination lie fallow due to some of the most fatuous misunderstanding of basic scientific principles to be found. Among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment, and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly, but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility. The plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station penal colony to a waste landfill upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to Earth, with some few capable players present who are execrably directed by first-timer Paolo Mazzucato, whose production team wastes effort upon such as holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic requirement for the creation of states of suspense and of impetus.

Susan Magdalane Boyle (born 1 April 1961) is a Scottish singer who came to international attention when she appeared as a contestant on the TV programme Britain's Got Talent on 11 April 2009, singing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" from Les Miserables. Her first album, I Dreamed a Dream, was released in November 2009 and became the UK's best-selling debut album of all time, beating the previous record held by Spirit by Leona Lewis. I Dreamed a Dream set a record for biggest first week sales by a debut album, according to the Official Chart Company in the United Kingdom. Boyle took singing lessons from vocal coach Fred O'Neil. She attended Edinburgh Acting School and took part in the Edinburgh Fringe. She also long participated in her parish church's pilgrimages to the Knock Shrine, County Mayo, Ireland, and sang there at the Marian basilica. In 1995, she auditioned for Michael Barrymore's My Kind of People. In 1999, Boyle submitted a track for a charity CD to commemorate the Millennium produced at a West Lothian school. Only 1,000 copies of the CD, Music for a Millennium Celebration, Sounds of West Lothian, were pressed. An early review by Amber McNaught in the West Lothian Herald & Post said Boyle's rendition of \\"Cry Me a River\\" was \\"heartbreaking\\" and \\"had been on repeat in my CD player ever since I got this CD...\\" The recording found its way onto the internet following her first televised appearance and the New York Post said it showed that Boyle was \\"not a one-trick pony.\\" Hello! said the recording \\"cement[ed] her status\\" as a singing star. In 1998, Boyle recorded three tracks--\\"Cry Me A River\\", \\"Killing Me Softly\\", and \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\"--at Heartbeat Studio, Midlothian. She used all her savings to pay for a professionally cut demo, copies of which she later sent to record companies, radio talent competitions, local and national TV. The demo consisted of her versions of \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\"; the songs were uploaded to the Internet after her BGT audition. After Boyle won several local singing competitions, her mother urged her to enter Britain's Got Talent and take the risk of singing in front of an audience larger than her parish church. Former coach O'Neil said Boyle abandoned an audition for The X Factor because she believed people were being chosen for their looks. She almost abandoned her plan to enter Britain's Got Talent believing she was too old, but O'Neil persuaded her to audition nevertheless.

This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. and the situation: Two competing countries used different energy sources to produce their electricity. Turkey used mostly fossil fuels, while Greece used nuclear power. Answer the following question: Which country caused less acid rain? The answer is:","completion":"Greece caused less acid rain because it relied on nuclear power to produce its electricity. Acid rain is primarily a result of the emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. These emissions mainly come from burning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. When SO2 and NOx react with other substances in the atmosphere, they form acidic compounds that fall to the ground as precipitation, causing acid rain. In the given situation, Turkey primarily used fossil fuels to produce electricity. This means that their power generation process released significant amounts of SO2 and NOx into the atmosphere, contributing to acid rain formation. In contrast, Greece relied on nuclear power, which produces electricity without emitting SO2 and NOx, leading to a drastically lower contribution to acid rain. Though nuclear power is not without its drawbacks, such as the generation of radioactive waste and the risk of nuclear accidents, it does provide an advantage in terms of reduced air pollution and acid rain when compared to fossil fuel-based electricity production.

Please answer this question: where did hurricane irma hit in the us?","completion":"Hurricane Irma, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, wreaked havoc across several parts of the United States in 2017. It exhibited maximum sustained winds of up to 185 mph and continued for a record-breaking 37 hours. Irma's destructive path in the U.S. can be traced to several key regions that were severely impacted by the hurricane. Florida: The state of Florida bore the brunt of Hurricane Irma within the United States. The cyclone made its initial landfall on September 10, 2017, as a Category 4 storm in the Florida Keys at Cudjoe Key. The hurricane then moved towards the northwest and made a second landfall on Marco Island, which lies west of the Florida Peninsula. The hurricane proceeded to move northwards, leading to widespread damage throughout the state. Irma's impact was felt across Florida, affecting major cities like Miami, Tampa, Jacksonville, Orlando, and the surrounding areas. Streets, homes, and businesses were flooded; utility infrastructures were damaged, rendering millions without power, and the storm caused incredible damage to agriculture, marinas, and the natural environment. Georgia: Hurricane Irma impacted the neighboring state of Georgia as well, mostly as a tropical storm after being downgraded from a hurricane. As it moved northwards, Irma's strong winds and rain lashed the state, leading to coastal flooding, property damage, and power outages. The areas impacted in Georgia included the coastal cities of Savannah and Brunswick, as well as the regions of Atlanta and South Georgia. Hundreds of thousands of residents lost power, and there were reports of downed trees, damaged homes, and localized flooding. South Carolina: Moving further north, Hurricane Irma's impact was also felt in South Carolina. While not as severe as in Florida or Georgia, coastal areas and the state's Lowcountry region experienced storm surge-induced flooding, and strong winds led to downed trees, property damage, and power outages. Charleston was notably affected, with knee-high flooding reported in some parts of the city. U.S. Territories in the Caribbean: Before reaching the U.S. mainland, Hurricane Irma had already left a trail of destruction in U.S. territories in the Caribbean. The U.S. Virgin Islands, particularly St. Thomas and St. John, were heavily impacted, experiencing widespread devastation to infrastructure and homes. In Puerto Rico, while the eye of the hurricane did not directly pass over the island, it experienced significant rainfall, flooding, and wind damage. As a result, many structures were damaged, and hundreds of thousands of residents were left without power. In conclusion, Hurricane Irma left a massive trail of destruction across the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the U.S. Caribbean territories. Along its path, millions of lives were disrupted, and the financial, social, and environmental toll from the storm was immense. It will be remembered as one of the most powerful and damaging storms in U.S. history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: Homegrown was scrapped earlier this month 10 days before its opening night. Signatories including Simon Callow and Anish Kapoor said the decision \\"serves only to shut down conversation\\". The play's creators said voices had been \\"silenced\\", but the NYT said the play failed to meet standards. Director Nadia Latif and playwright Omar El-Khairy said earlier this month that they were given no prior warning about the cancellation of the play, which was inspired by three London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria to join Islamic State. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum went missing in February. \\"This show was about having an intelligent conversation around an issue that has hysteria attached, and instead voices have been silenced with no explanation and without the content ever being seen because of this landscape of fear that we live in,\\" they said.

A modern-day love story of a man seeing the girl of his dreams across a New York subway train and tracking her down over the Internet has failed to have a fairytale ending with the relationship over. For Web designer Patrick Moberg, then 21, from Brooklyn, it was love at first sight when he saw a woman on a Manthttan train last November. But he lost her in the crowd so he set up a website with a sketch picture to find her--www.Nygirlofmydreams.com. Unbelievably in a city of 8 million people, it only took Moberg 48 hours to find the woman, with his phone ringing non-stop and email box overflowing. New Yorkers took pity on the subway Romeo and joined his hunt. The mysterious girl was named as Camille Hayton, from Melbourne, Australia, who was working at the magazine Black Book and also lived in Brooklyn. One of her friends saw the sketched picture on the Web site and recognized her. But after finding each other, appearing on TV and getting international press, the couple took their romance out of the public eye, with Moberg closing down the Web site and with both refusing to make any more comments--until now. Hayton told Australian newspaper The Sunday Telegraph that she dated Moberg for about two months but it just didn't work out. \\"I say we dated for a while but now we're just friends,\\" Hayton, now 23, told the newspaper. Hayton said she is still recognized about three times a week on the streets of Manhattan as \\"that girl\\" and the question is always the same: \\"So what happened?\\" \\"I think the situation was so intense that it linked us,\\" she said, adding, \\"it linked us in a way that you could mistake, I guess, for being more romantic than it was. I don't know. But I wanted to give it a go so didn't wonder what if, what if?\\" Hayton told The Sunday Telegraph that she is enjoying single life in New York, keeping busy with acting classes, working in two clothing stores. Last week she had a small role as a waitress in the long-running daytime soap As the World Turns. \\"I just can't believe it happened. It feels like a long time ago,\\" said Hayton. Moberg, however, was still refusing to comment on the relationship. What are the answers to this following set of questions: 1. What is Patrick's profession? 2. How did the relationship end? 3.

When \\"Girlfight\\" came out, the reviews praised it, but I didn't get around to seeing it. I finally saw it when it got released on video, and understand the glowing reviews. The movie opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto. We quickly get introduced to student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). She has a bad-ass expression on her face, and any idea about Diana that we might derive from this expression soon gets corroborated when she gets in a fight. As Diana gets in trouble for this, we then meet her father, an aggressive type in his own right; clearly we can't totally blame Diana for her attitude. But then the movie really picks up, as a new thought germinates in Diana's mind: boxing as a way to escape this grim existence. Her older brother has already gotten into boxing, but her father most likely won't approve. Only Diana herself can decide what to do. Just the first few minutes alone identified that I was in for a very gritty, non-Hollywood movie, but the brief appearance of John Sayles in a supporting role truly affirmed that. Even before they get to any boxing scenes, you feel like you're getting pounded in the face at seeing the ugly life that Diana lives. And when they finally arrive at the film's main story, there's no turning back. All in all, I definitely recommend this movie. I will admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to make something of himself/herself has been sort of a cliché in cinema for many years (\\"Rocky\\", \\"Million Dollar Baby\\"), but I still think that they did a great job with it here. In fact, this may have brought the genre to its apex. Really good. Too bad that Michelle Rodriguez wasted herself in Hollywood movies after this one. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"This review thought positively of the movie \\"Girlfight.\\" The reviewer recommends the movie, praises its gritty, non-Hollywood style, and appreciates the performances and storyline.

Title: great trike! Review: After much searching, we finally found a nice trike for our 2 year old. This bike is sturdily built, relatively easy to assmeble (took my mechanically-inclined husband about 30 minutes to assemble), and has lots of great features.It does appear to be for smaller children. Our son just turned 2, is the size of a 3 year old, and this bike will likely only fit him for 1 year. I wouldn't buy this for an older child (like a 4 year old) unless they are small.The frame adjusts to 4 different sizes, as does the seat. The handle telescopes to 3 different lengths. The push bar isn't quite tall enough to suit us, but we are tall people & for a stroll around the neighborhood, it's comfortable enough.You can lock the steering and the rear wheels (nice for walking the long straight-aways) or you can unlock the rear wheels and the adult controls the steering.This little bike is cute, well built, (it's a Kettler!) and quite reasonable in price.

Please answer the following question: A prospective client sent me a link to this in-depth article on IBM's design thinking revolution, where Phil Gilbert, IBM's General Manager of Design, has hired over 1000 designers into the firm, and pushed for over 8000 of its managers and staff to get 'trained' in design thinking. They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history. However, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago. I'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why. Since design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking. There is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money.... Why did IMB hire so many designers?

Options: - make music - inspiration - musical sounds - making music - dancing Explain why a human would choose \\"inspiration\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"Inspiration is a crucial element not only in playing piano but in any creative activities. The option \\"inspiration\\" could be selected as the answer for numerous reasons. Firstly, it's important to understand that playing the piano goes beyond just the physical aspect of hitting the right keys and creating sounds or music. It necessitates the capacity for creative expression, which can only come from a source—this source is often referred to as inspiration. Inspiration aids in the process of interpreting the emotion and intention behind the pieces, and influences how the pianist makes the piece their own instead of just recreating the sounds or imitating someone else's interpretation. Furthermore, inspiration leads to the creation of original music. A pianist cannot make music without that initial spark that contributes to the creativity process or the ability to put together notes and rhythms into a meaningful composition. This is true not only for piano players but for all musicians and artists. For instance, let's take the example of the great composers in history. Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, and many others each had their unique source and type of inspiration—one that fueled and enhanced their creativity, empowering them to write timeless masterpieces that endure till today. This shows how inspiration is a fundamental aspect when it comes to the creation of music. Moreover, creativity is not limited to the physical actions like \\"making music\\" or \\"dancing\\". Inspiration serves as a starting point, ignites imagination, is a motivator and is also important for personal growth and developing artistic skills. It is often seen as the heart of any creative endeavor. It allows artists to imagine, explore, and experiment with new ideas, sounds, or movements—leading to innovation and growth in their craft. Making music and dancing are part of the process, but they rely heavily on inspiration to fuel and guide the process. While musical sounds are the outcome of playing the piano, they could be considered as a mechanical output if devoid of inspiration or emotion. The same applies to dancing—it is the physical realization of an inspirational idea. Hence, a human might choose \\"inspiration\\" as the best response because it encapsulates a core necessity that is integral to playing the piano and any other creative activity. Inspiration is the catalyst that not only launches but also enhances the artistic and creative process, creating a further rippling effect that influences the artist's work, touching the hearts and minds of those who experience it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Who tests positive for HIV, after only having sex once, with Telly? Movie plot title: Kids Movie plot: In mid-90s Manhattan, the nihilistic Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) is busy deflowering virgins. He doesn't just enjoy the sex and act of taking young girl's virginity though -- he believes that he can avoid STDs this way. After finishing with his latest conquest (Sarah Henderson), Telly bums around town with his friend Casper (Justin Pierce) looking for some kind of distraction .One of Telly's former sex partners, Jennie (Chloë Sevigny), and her friend Ruby (Rosario Dawson) receive mixed news at a public health clinic. The promiscuous Ruby is clean, but Jennie (who has only had sex once, with Telly) is HIV positive. The news devastates Jennie, who will spend much of the film searching for the wandering Telly.Telly & Casper have several adventures: buying weed in the park, shoplifting a \\"40\\" of malt liquor from a Korean Guy (Johnathan Staci Kim) of whom they make fun of, beating up a man who \\"disses\\" them, and finally winding up at a teen party that night. Eventually we find that Telly has seduced a thirteen year old girl, and is busy deflowering her. Jennie (who took a strange drug earlier) arrives and passes out on a couch. A drunken Casper takes advantage of the situation to rape Jennie, perpetuating the HIV cycle.The audience can hear Telly's voice-over explaining that without sex, his life has no purpose.

When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases. Now, I have a new situation: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors. Answer this question please: Which student read more about a greater frequency of collisions?

The Eagles responded in the second quarter with a one-yard touchdown pass from Carson Wentz to Ryan Mathews, cutting the Lions lead to seven points. The Lions added to their lead with a one-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to Marvin Jones. The Eagles responded with a 50-yard field goal from Caleb Sturgis, which made the score 21-10 in favor of the Lions at halftime.

For the third week in a row, the 30-year fixed-rate average did not budge, holding steady at 4.1 percent with an average 0.5 point. It was 4.57 percent a year ago. Since late June, the 30-year fixed rate hasn’t been above 4.14 percent or below 4.1 percent. The 15-year fixed-rate average edged down to 3.24 percent with an average 0.5 point. It was 3.25 percent a week ago and 3.59 percent a year ago. The 15-year fixed rate has drifted between 3.27 percent and 3.22 percent since late June. Hybrid adjustable rate mortgages also were flat. The five-year ARM average was unchanged at 2.97 percent with an average 0.5 point. It was 3.28 percent a year ago. The one-year ARM average inched up to 2.4 percent with an average 0.4 point. It was 2.39 percent a week ago. “Mortgage rates were little changed amid a week of light economic reports,” Frank E. Nothaft, Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist, said in a statement. “Of the few releases, the ISM’s manufacturing index rose to 59 in August from 57.1 the previous month. This was the highest reading of the index since March 2011.” Meanwhile, mortgage applications were flat last week, according to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. The market composite index, a measure of total loan application volume, barely moved, growing 0.2 percent. The refinance index increased 1 percent, while the purchase index fell 2 percent. The refinance share of mortgage activity accounted for 57 percent of all applications, its highest level since March. It also became more difficult to obtain a mortgage in August, according to the MBA. Mortgage credit availability index, a measure that looks at how available mortgage credit is at a point in time, declined 0.3 percentage points to 116.1 last month. A decline in the MCAI indicates that lending standards are tightening. MCAI is calculated using several factors related to borrower eligibility – credit score, loan type, loan-to-value ratio – reported by 85 lenders or investors. “While overall access to credit tightened in August, we did see some loosening in certain segments of the purchase market,” Michael Fratantoni, MBA’s chief economist, said in a statement. “In particular, lenders instituted additional offerings of loan programs like the FHA 203(k) home improvement program and one-time-close programs for financing new construction.” Write a title for it.","completion":"Mortgage Rates Stay Steady, and Home Loans Become a Little Harder to Get"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Boasting a lush indoor garden area and a cascading waterfall, renderings for the futuristic bio-dome have been revealed by architect Moshe Safdie. Bio dome: The glass doughnut-shaped structure will be made out of glass and steel. Shaped like a doughnut, the five-storey glass and steel structure – codenamed Project Jewel – will connect the airports existing three terminals via all-glass walkways. Safdie, who is renowned for his eco-topic buildings, was behind Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands Resort. Project Jewel’s gardens will also include green walls to offset the emissions from the planes overhead, and it is expected to serve nearly 85 million passengers by the time it is completed. Lush interior: The new design for the airport in Singapore features a vast garden area. Although a completion date for the £800m (1.5bn) project has not been released.

In this scenario, we are given details that include the presence of a shirtless black man and two caucasian blonde women. The descriptions provide information about their ethnic backgrounds and also establish some kind of connection or interaction between the individuals. Moreover, the mention of the girl holding the man's head in her hands indicates an additional level of physical contact or intimacy involved. Hypothesis: A white man holding two black women.

Similar to the premise, this statement provides the ethnic background of the individuals involved, and also suggests some connection or interaction between them. Upon comparison, it is noticeable that the premise and hypothesis describe entirely different scenarios. While the premise is about a shirtless black man with two caucasian blondes, the hypothesis involves a white man holding two black women.

He has just been awakened by his housekeeper, Urania (Helene Gerasimidou). \\"This is the last day\\" she says, \\"Let me come with you to the hospital.\\" Alexander, very philosophically, refuses and he thanks her for her three years of faithful service. She leaves the room, but promptly returns for an ultimate glance at Alexander, on the pretext of reminding him that his dog has eaten, before furtively leaving again. Alexander, now alone, finishes his cup of coffee. The camera moves to show the balcony, where the dog is lying down, and the sea panorama.

Step 2: Gather the ingredients and equipment You'll need: - Pound cake mix - Water (as specified on the cake mix package) - Egg whites (as specified on the cake mix package) - A large bowl - An electric mixer or a whisk Step 3: Mix the cake batter In a large bowl, add water to the cake mix as specified on the package and mix thoroughly using an electric mixer or a whisk. Step 4: Beat the egg whites Using a clean bowl and whisk or electric mixer with clean beaters, beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Stiff peaks are formed when the peaks hold their shape and don't fall back into the mixture when the whisk is lifted out. Step 5: Fold the egg whites into the cake batter Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the cake batter. This will give the pound cake a lighter texture that is more similar to a Twinkie.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: How many crew members from the ship that was crushed in January 1914 were eventually rescued? ? The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas, and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued. Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship. Some of the...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: It's 2016: Time for cargo shorts to give up and die The American cargo short is in crisis — and relief doesn't seem to be coming anytime soon. If you've been paying attention to the news this week, you might have noticed a few clickbait stories about a little presidential election and some YMCA summer camp games taking place in Brazil. But beneath all the listicles and the GIFs, a violent skirmish is taking root about one of the greatest social justice issues of our time: the demise of the American cargo short. The nation stands on the precipice of civil war: some want to make cargo shorts \\"great again,\\" while others can't remember when cargo shorts ever were good. And though it can be frightening to take a stand on such a polarizing issue, I feel compelled, dear reader, to make my lonely little voice heard amidst all the screams. The cargo short is sick. The cargo short is violent. The cargo short must die, and it must die today (if not today, tomorrow's totally cool too). As a New Yorker, I know I'm not alone in being biased against cargo shorts and the people who wear them. In the city, cargo shorts are unconsciously banned — and those who do wear them are immediately labeled other/outsider/Midwestern tourist. Only someone who came from Oklahoma, the land of diner booths and wide open parking spaces, could feel so entitled to wear something so loose, so basic, so . . . comfortable. It can be easy, delightful even, to build a profile of the cargo-shorts wearer: the man who chooses Journey on the jukebox, steak tips on the Chili menu, 'Blue Man Group' on the TKTS line. He loves Sirius comedy and hates politicians. Is a big fan of Windows 8. Athletic socks? You bet he's got 'em. Every size and every color of the beautiful white rainbow. He's basic without boundaries, without shame, without spite. And of course, it's unfair to judge people solely on the basis of their terrible, terrible shorts. Blame the short, not the shorts-wearer. See the person beyond the wrench-ready pockets. Perhaps people like me are just jealous of the Cargo Man: entitled to wear something so openly basic, he possesses a liberty that I and other small-pocket folks can only dream of. The right to store fat wallets. The ability to hide his keys. The freedom to take a dump in his pants — and have absolutely no one notice. Blame the short, not the shorts-wearer. See the person beyond the pockets. But just because it's wrong and definitely elitist to criticize the cargo shorts wearer doesn't mean we can't hold cargo shorts accountable for the devastating impact they've had on American life and our cultural imagination. The cargo short, by the very laxness of its construction, lowers our sartorial and behavioral standards while giving us nothing in return. The sag built by choice into the seat of the pant screams: \\"It doesn't matter,\\" \\"Why bother?\\" \\"Can we just have sex in the morning?\\" Excessive pockets are made for excessive consumption. The more you can purchase, the more you can pocket, the greater your material and spiritual worth. You aren't what you eat or what you sow but what you can store near your balls. Excessive pockets are made for excessive consumption Let's not forget where most cargo shorts cut off — right at the knee. Cargo shorts are a part of a long tradition of clothes that shame the inner thigh. In most modern short and skortwear, shorts cut off far above the knee, a place where thighs and stretchmarks can finally peek out and be free. But prurient cargo pants seal one of the sexiest parts of the human body under an amorphous pile of poly-cotton. That's not a problem for most men, but for women — it comes at a tremendous cost. While some women do wear cargo shorts, they often do so at great danger. Head to your nearest Old Navy or Gap and you'll find nothing but line after line of mini-shorts with minipockets that can't hold anything larger than a minigolf pencil. Sure, sometimes women cross the aisle and buy men's cargo pants. And sometimes they are able to find their own in the Women's section of the store. Cargo shorts are fine as long as you're wearing them to Warped Tour — Bobby Big Wheel (@BobbyBigWheel) August 5, 2016 But more often than not, those cargo shorts don't fit right, don't look right, and cost far more than they're worth. Feminism isn't about equality of opportunity; it's about creating better opportunities in the first place. It's not about sharing the cargo wealth, but eliminating the item in the first place. The evidence is in the data. Sales are down. Viral think pieces are up. So many people have complained about their partners use of cargo shorts that, researchers recently found, it has heightened marital dissatisfaction. It can be painful to give up the cargo short collective fantasy we all once shared. The idea that we all looked good in these shorts, should buy these shorts. And while some politicians and writers want you to \\"make cargo shorts great again,\\" remember this: they were never good in the first place. We can build a better world, a world full of tasteful pockets and reasonable seams, zippers that always zip and shorts that cut off just right. Together, we can do this.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: - A mine is excavated in the side of a mountain - Miners enter the mine - Miners remove the coal from the mine - The coal is placed into carts or on a conveyor belt - The coal is moved up to the surface - The coal is loaded onto a truck A:","completion":"The final step of the process after the coal is loaded onto a truck is transporting the coal from the mining site to its destination. This step involves the careful and efficient movement of the coal to power plants, industrial sites, or other locations where the coal will be utilized as a fuel source or for other purposes. It is essential that the coal is handled and transported in a safe and environmentally responsible manner to minimize any potential hazards or negative impacts on the environment. Once the coal is loaded onto the truck, it will typically be taken to a nearby processing facility or directly to the end-user. At the processing facility, the coal may undergo various stages of cleaning, sorting, and grading to remove impurities and ensure that it meets the specific quality standards required by the customer. This process might involve washing, crushing, and other treatments to prepare the coal for its final use. During the transportation process, it is critical that safety and regulatory guidelines are followed to prevent accidents and protect the environment. This may involve securing the coal load properly, adhering to weight restrictions for vehicles, and following designated routes specified by transportation authorities. Drivers who specialize in transporting hazardous materials may be required to obtain proper licenses and certifications to handle and transport the coal legally. In some cases, coal may be transported by other means, such as railways or shipping routes. The decision to use specific transportation methods depends on factors such as distance, cost, and the availability of suitable infrastructure. For instance, a mine located near a port might prefer to export its coal using ships, while a mine in a landlocked region might rely on rail or road transport. Upon arrival at the destination, the coal is unloaded from the truck and either goes through the final stages of processing or is stored temporarily until it is ready to be used. The coal is typically stored in facilities designed to minimize the risk of fire and ensuring the coal remains dry and uncontaminated. Adequate ventilation and monitoring systems are also essential to prevent the accumulation of gases, such as methane, which can pose a significant safety hazard. To summarize, the final step in the coal mining process after the coal is loaded onto a truck involves safely and efficiently transporting the coal from the mine to its destination. This transportation step is critical to ensure the coal reaches the end-user in a timely manner, adhering to safety and environmental regulations. Once the coal arrives at its destination, it either undergoes further processing or is stored until it is ready to be utilized."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How would the previous sentence be correctly capitalized?","completion":"The correct capitalization of the sentence would be, \\"The children found their mother unconscious on the floor. Synøve ended up at the hospital where they thought she had had an epileptic seizure.\\" In English, capitalization rules dictate that the first word of each sentence should begin with a capital letter. However, capitalization doesn't only apply to the first word in a sentence, but also to proper nouns, which are specific names for particular people, places, or things. In this sentence, \\"The children\\" and \\"Synøve\\" are capitalized. \\"The children\\" is capitalized because it is the first phrase of the sentence. In the English language, regardless of the length of the sentence or what it communicates, the initial word is always capitalized. This rule helps identify where one sentence ends and another begins, ensuring clarity and understanding when reading. \\"Synøve\\" is also capitalized, but for a different reason. \\"Synøve\\" is a proper noun, as it is a name given to an individual, in this case, a particular woman involved in the event. All proper nouns, including people's names and place names, must always be capitalized in the English language. All the other words in this sentence are correctly in lower-case letters.

Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a sentence that justifies which noun phrase the pronoun refers to. Correct reasons do not need to use all the knowledge from the sentence. The resolution of the pronoun coreference relations typically involve one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. You should answer 'Correct' if the reasoning made sense, otherwise, you should answer 'Wrong'.

A study into how lazy British people are has found more than half of the adults are so idle that they'd catch the lift rather than climb two flights of stairs. Just over 2,000 people were quizzed by independent researchers at Nuffield Health, Britain's largest health center. The results were extremely surprising. About one in six people questioned said if their remote control was broken, they would continue watching the same channel rather than get up. More than one third of those questioned said they would not run to catch a bus. Worryingly, of the 654 respondents with children, 64% said they were often too tired to play with them. This led the report to conclude that it's no wonder that one in six children in the UK are classified as obese (very fat) before they start school. Dr Sarah Dauncey, medical director of Nuffield Health, said, \\"People need to get fitter, not just for their own sake, but for the sake of their families, friends and evidently (;) their pets too.\\" \\"If we don't start to take control of this problem, a whole generation will become too unfit to perform even the most fundamental tasks.\\" And Scotland's largest city, Glasgow, was shamed as the most idle city in the UK, with 75% questioned admitting they do not get enough exercise, followed closely by Birmingham and Southampton, both with 67%.

William Henry Beveridge, 1st Baron Beveridge, KCB (5 March 1879 - 16 March 1963) was a British economist who was a noted progressive and social reformer. He is best known for his 1942 report Social Insurance and Allied Services (known as the Beveridge Report) which served as the basis for the post-World War II welfare state put in place by the Labour government elected in 1945. He was considered an authority on unemployment insurance from early in his career, served under Winston Churchill on the Board of Trade as Director of the newly created labour exchanges and later as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Food. He was Director of the London School of Economics and Political Science from 1919 until 1937, when he was elected Master of University College, Oxford. After leaving university, Beveridge initially became a lawyer. He became interested in the social services and wrote about the subject for the Morning Post newspaper. His interest in the causes of unemployment began in 1903 when he worked at Toynbee Hall, a settlement house in London. There he worked closely with Sidney Webb and Beatrice Webb and was influenced by their theories of social reform, becoming active in promoting old age pensions, free school meals, and campaigning for a national system of labour exchanges. In 1908, now considered to be the United Kingdom's leading authority on unemployment insurance, he was introduced by Beatrice Webb to Winston Churchill, who had recently been promoted to the Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. Churchill invited Beveridge to join the Board of Trade, and he organised the implementation of the national system of labour exchanges and National Insurance to combat unemployment and poverty. During the First World War he was involved in mobilising and controlling manpower. After the war, he was knighted and made permanent secretary to the Ministry of Food. In 1919 he left the civil service to become director of the London School of Economics and Political Science. Over the next few years he served on several commissions and committees on social policy. He was so highly influenced by the Fabian Society socialists - in particular by Beatrice Webb, with whom he worked on the 1909 Poor Laws report - that he could readily be considered one of their number. He published academic economic works including his early work on unemployment (1909) and a large historical study of prices and wages (1939). The Fabians made him a director of the LSE in 1919, a post he retained until 1937. During his time as Director, he jousted with Edwin Cannan and Lionel Robbins, who were trying to steer the LSE away from its Fabian roots. In 1933 he helped set up the Academic Assistance Council. This helped prominent academics who had been dismissed from their posts on grounds of race, religion or political position to escape Nazi persecution. In 1937, Beveridge was appointed Master of University College, Oxford.","completion":"This text is about William Henry Beveridge, 1st Baron Beveridge, a British economist, progressive, and social reformer.

Movie plot title: Let's Go to Prison Movie plot: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life in prison, serving three different sentences. Each of his three trials were before Judge Nelson Biederman III, who habitually imposed resentfully tough sentences. After being released from his third sentence, John decides to take revenge on Biederman. John tries to determine when Biederman will be presiding over his next case, only to discover that Biederman died three days before John's release. He turns his attention to the judge's brash son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John breaks into Nelson's BMW, wrecks the interior of it and empties Nelson's emergency inhaler. After the ceremony, Nelson drives off and, finding his inhaler empty, panics and hyperventilates. He stops at a pharmacy and frantically searches through the shelves, desperately seeking a replacement for the empty inhaler, which he finds and immediately opens to use. The pharmacy owners think he's a junkie seeking a fix. One owner mistakes the inhaler for a tiny pistol and calls the police. Nelson is arrested and charged with assault and armed robbery. He demands that the Biederman Foundation do everything possible to have him acquitted. The board nearly complies with Nelson's demands, but, as they are fed up of him and his behaviour, they see an opportunity to be rid of him. They get him a terrible defense lawyer for the trial. Nelson is found guilty and sentenced to three to five years. John, not satisfied with Nelson merely going to prison, decides to join him in prison by committing a crime. At his trial before the same judge Nelson had, John pleads guilty and asks for the same sentence (3â5 years) at the same prison that Nelson is in. He manages to become Nelsonâs cellmate, pretends to be his friend, and gives Nelson wrong advice on surviving life in prison. Nelson gets himself out of the many situations that John's misinformation creates. He meets gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), an imposing, brawny gay fellow who engages Nelson into...

The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world. Paragraph: John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which lever would produce smaller increase in force, lever A or lever B?","completion":"Based on the information provided, lever A has an ideal mechanical advantage, meaning it has no friction to overcome. On the other hand, lever B is a real-world lever that does have to overcome some friction. Therefore, lever A would produce a larger increase in force since it does not have to deal with friction. In contrast, lever B would produce a smaller increase in force as it needs to overcome friction. So, the correct answer is lever B would produce a smaller increase in force."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) is an Animal Control Officer and married to Agatha (Virginia Madsen); they have a son, Robin (Logan Lerman). At a bookstore, Agatha begins looking at a book titled The Number 23 written by Topsy Kretts. She later gives Walter the book as a birthday present. Walter starts reading the book, noticing odd similarities between himself and the main character, a detective who refers to himself as \\"Fingerling\\". Walter begins to have dreams of murdering Agatha. Walter tries to warn her about the number being dangerous and how it was going to come after her. She tells him he is crazy. Walter comes to realize that he is Topsy Kretts, having written the book as a way to rid himself of the guilt he felt over murdering a woman named Laura Tollins (Rhona Mitra). He was never suspected of the crime, and a man named Kyle Flinch (Mark Pellegrino) was convicted and imprisoned instead. Fearing he will hurt his family, he leaves home and moves to a hotel. Agatha finds Walter at the hotel and tries to assure him that he is no longer the person he was when he wrote the book. He insists that he is a killer, accepting the fact that he murdered Tollins, and tells Agatha to leave before he kills her, too. Agatha pushes a letter opener into Walter's hand, saying that, if he is indeed a killer, he can easily kill again and dares him to kill her. She tells him that she loves him. Walter tells her that she can't love him because no one can, mirroring an accusation made by Laura on the night of her murder. He leaves the hotel and runs into the street, where he nearly allows himself to be run over by a bus but steps out of the way at the last minute when he realizes his son is watching.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If \\"A gentleman walking in the street.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A gentleman is on his way to a store.\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"A gentleman walking in the street\\" does not necessarily imply that \\"A gentleman is on his way to a store.\\" Though it is possible that the gentleman is, indeed, heading towards a store, this information is not provided in the statement. We can only conclude that the gentleman is walking in the street. Here, it is essential to establish a distinction between the two types of reasoning: deductive and inductive. Deductive reasoning implies the drawing of conclusions based on logical premises and facts. It demands that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be correct. Deductive reasoning requires every tidbit of relevant information, and if the information is accurate, the result should yield definite conclusions. In the case of \\"A gentleman walking in the street,\\" we only know that he is walking, with no further information. We cannot apply deductive reasoning to assert that he is heading towards a store. Thus, the statement does not logically follow deductive reasoning rules. Inductive reasoning, on the other hand, involves drawing conclusions based on incomplete information or patterns of occurrence. In this case, it means that even if the available data is not sufficient to derive a conclusion, we can still attempt to make an educated guess. Inductive reasoning aims to develop the most probable outcome, even though it is not always guaranteed to be accurate. If we were to apply inductive reasoning to the given statement, we might assume that \\"A gentleman is on his way to a store\\" based on our knowledge of common activities while walking in the street. However, this assumption would be nothing more than speculation, as there are countless reasons why a person would be walking in the street: going to work, visiting friends, exercising, or simply because they enjoy walking. In summary, while it is possible to use inductive reasoning to speculate that a gentleman is on his way to a store, this conclusion is not logically supported using deductive reasoning. The premise \\"A gentleman walking in the street\\" gives insufficient information to determine his destination with certainty."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sung by Jagger, the song refers to the Devil, written in the first-person narrative, recounting atrocities committed throughout the history of humanity as if they were somehow \\"inspired\\" (or at least witnessed) by him. Although it has been deemed by some as \\"a homage\\", in reality, no admiration (or even sympathy, for that matter) is declared for the Devil in the song -other than his \\"own\\" request. It is performed in a rock arrangement with a samba rhythm, first appearing as the opening track on their 1968 album Beggars Banquet. Context: The recording of \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" began at London's Olympic Sound Studios on 4 June 1968 and continued into the next day; overdubs were done on 8, 9 and 10 June. Personnel included on the recording include Nicky Hopkins on piano, Rocky Dijon on congas and Bill Wyman on maracas. Marianne Faithfull, Anita Pallenberg, Brian Jones, Charlie Watts, producer Jimmy Miller, Wyman and Richards performed backup vocals, singing the \\"woo woos\\". Richards plays bass on the original recording, and also electric guitar. Brian Jones plays a mostly mixed out acoustic guitar, although in isolated tracks of the studio cut, it is audible playing along with the piano. In the 2003 book According to the Rolling Stones, Watts commented: \\"Sympathy\\" was one of those sort of songs where we tried everything. The first time I ever heard the song was when Mick was playing it at the front door of a house I lived at in Sussex ... He played it entirely on his own ... and it was fantastic. We had a go at loads of different ways of playing it; in the end I just played a jazz Latin feel in the style of Kenny Clarke would have played on \\"A Night in Tunisia\\" - not the actual rhythm he played, but the same styling. On the overall power of the song, Jagger continued in Rolling Stone: It has a very hypnotic groove, a samba, which has a tremendous hypnotic power, rather like good dance music. It doesn't speed up or slow down. It keeps this constant groove. Plus, the actual samba rhythm is a great one to sing on, but it is also got some other suggestions in it, an undercurrent of being primitive--because it is a primitive African, South American, Afro-whatever-you-call-that rhythm (candomble). So to white people, it has a very sinister thing about it. But forgetting the cultural colors, it is a very good vehicle for producing a powerful piece. It becomes less pretentious because it is a very unpretentious groove. If it had been done as a ballad, it wouldn't have been as good. Question: Who produced the song?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The song \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" was produced by Jimmy Miller. He worked with the Rolling Stones on the recording at London's Olympic Sound Studios in June 1968, and he also contributed to the backup vocals, singing the \\"woo woos\\" alongside other band members and personnel."},{"prompt":"Q: Write a correct answer for the question.

So Kathryn stopped and gave a few toys to the kids and played with them for a while. \\"The parents couldn't thank me enough for what I did for their children,\\" she says. On the drive back to Evansville, Kathryn came up with an idea to help more kids. She talked her family, friends and neighbors into joining her and spent the next few months organizing fundraisers.

Dan studied more about the subject, and became very interested to pursue it more in the future. Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. The answer is:","completion":"Bob. The paragraph states that two medical school students named Dan and Bob learned about the human immune system. However, it is specified that Dan studied more about the subject and became very interested in pursuing it further in the future. The hint provided indicates that the body's inflammatory response to pathogens or injuries includes signs such as redness, warmth, and pain at the infected skin area.

Restoration of the elaborate decor of the interior had to be fully redone. In the courtyard, the restorers placed an artificial lake, fountains, and a miniature garden—all of which had been in Horodecki's original plans.The building was opened as a filial \\"Masterpieces of Ukrainian Art\\" of the National Museum of Arts in November 2004. It was expected that the building would serve a dual purpose as a museum and as the presidential meeting place for state visitors.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Humans could not live on Earth if it were not for protists. Why? Plant-like protists produce almost one-half of the oxygen on the planet through photosynthesis. Other protists decompose and recycle nutrients that humans need to live. All protists make up a huge part of the food chain. Q: What produces almost one-half of the earth's oxygen through photosynthesis? Choices: - prokaryotes - algae - arthropods - protists A: Answer:","completion":"Protists From the given paragraph, it can be inferred that plant-like protists are responsible for producing almost one-half of the Earth's oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, which is stored as glucose or other sugars. Oxygen is a byproduct of this process and is essential for the survival of humans and other aerobic organisms on Earth. Protists are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms, including both single-celled and multi-celled life forms. They are not classified under plants, animals, or fungi, but rather belong to their own unique category. Among the various types of protists, the plant-like protists generate significant amounts of oxygen through photosynthesis. These plant-like protists primarily consist of different types of algae, including green algae, red algae, brown algae, and diatoms. Despite the keywords \\"protists\\" and \\"algae\\" both being available as options, it is important to note that algae is a subgroup within the protists, specifically referring to the plant-like protists performing photosynthesis. Although algae do contribute to a significant portion of oxygen production, the correct answer in this context is \\"protists,\\" as it encompasses the entire group of organisms responsible for nearly half of the oxygen production on Earth. In addition, the paragraph also highlights the importance of protists in various aspects of life on Earth, such as decomposing and recycling nutrients and forming a key component of the food chain. This further emphasizes the vital role protists play in maintaining the balance and sustainability of Earth's ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Julian Paul Assange (; ne Hawkins; born 3 July 1971) is an Australian computer programmer and the editor of WikiLeaks. Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006, but came to international attention in 2010, when WikiLeaks published a series of leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). Following the 2010 leaks, the federal government of the United States launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks and asked allied nations for assistance. Assange visited Sweden in August 2010. During his visit, he became the subject of sexual assault allegations from two women with whom he had sex. He was questioned, the case was initially closed, and he was told he could leave the country. In November 2010, however, the case was re-opened by a special prosecutor who said that she wanted to question Assange over two counts of sexual molestation, one count of unlawful coercion and one count of \\"lesser-degree rape\\" (mindre grov valdtakt). Assange denied the allegations and said he was happy to face questions in Britain. In 2010, the prosecutor said Swedish law prevented her from questioning anyone by video link or in the London embassy. In March 2015, after public criticism from other Swedish law practitioners, she changed her mind and agreed to interrogate Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, with interviews finally beginning on 14 November 2016. These interviews involved police, Swedish prosecutors and Ecuadorian officials and were eventually published online. By this time, the statute of limitations had expired on all three of the less serious allegations. Since the Swedish prosecutor had not interviewed Assange by 18 August 2015, the questioning pertained only to the open investigation of \\"lesser degree rape\\", whose statute of limitations is due to expire in 2020. On 19 May 2017, the Swedish authorities dropped their investigation against Assange, claiming they could not expect the Ecuadorian Embassy to communicate reliably with Assange with respect to the case. Chief prosecutor Marianne Ny officially revoked his arrest warrant, but said the investigation could still be resumed if Assange visited Sweden before August 2020. \\"We are not making any pronouncement about guilt\\", she said.

A:","completion":"The song \\"Playing God\\" by the band Paramore is featured on their third studio album, titled \\"Brand New Eyes.\\" It was released on September 29, 2009, through the record label Fueled by Ramen. The album received critical acclaim and achieved significant commercial success, propelling Paramore to new heights in their career.

The writing and recording process for \\"Brand New Eyes\\" turned out to be tumultuous, with tensions arising within the band, particularly between lead vocalist Hayley Williams and guitarist/songwriter Josh Farro. Despite this internal turmoil, the album delivered a compelling mix of the band's catchy pop-punk sound, combined with introspective, emotionally driven lyrics. \\"Brand New Eyes\\" debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 chart upon its release, with over 175,000 copies sold in its first week in the United States.

Following the release of \\"Brand New Eyes,\\" Paramore embarked on a world tour to promote the album, further enhancing their growing fanbase both nationally and internationally. However, the band would later experience lineup changes as guitarist Josh Farro and drummer Zac Farro left the band in December 2010. In conclusion, \\"Playing God\\" is a standout track from Paramore's third studio album, \\"Brand New Eyes,\\" released in 2009 through the record label Fueled by Ramen. It highlights the band's exceptional songwriting and musical capabilities, as well as their emotional depth in their lyrics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. and the situation: Harry and Kim studied ancient humans. Kim studied a 15000 year-old settlement, before humans invented agriculture, while Harry studied a 5000 year-old village. Answer the following question: Which student studied about a village that had a more dependable food supply? A:","completion":"Harry studied a village that had a more dependable food supply. As mentioned in the background information, agriculture was invented around 10,000 years ago and provided humans with a more reliable and abundant food source. This allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time, and consequently, birth rates increased due to the availability of more food and the benefits of a settled life. On the other hand, Kim studied a 15,000-year-old settlement, which predates the invention of agriculture by around 5,000 years. During this time, humans were predominantly hunter-gatherers, relying on foraging, hunting, and fishing for sustenance. This lifestyle did not offer a dependable food supply as resources were seasonal and often required significant effort and mobility to locate. In conclusion, Harry's 5,000-year-old village study provided insights into a time when humans had a more stable and dependable food supply, thanks to the invention of agriculture. Whereas, Kim's study of the 15,000-year-old settlement focused on a period before the onset of agricultural practices, when humans were more reliant on hunting and gathering, which was comparatively less reliable as a food source."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dave Larsen, the sales manager at Doug’s Shoot’n Sports in Salt Lake City told the local Fox TV affiliate that business is off since Trump won. “I did have one gentleman order a gun from me on Tuesday, and then after the election results came in he called me and said, ‘Dave, let’s cancel that order,’” Larsen said. “I asked him point blank, ‘Is this because Donald won?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, kind of.’ ” Larsen said the customer later decided to keep the gun. It’s quite a let down for gun shop owners who saw record sales in October. After posting double-digit declines over the eight trading days since Election Day, Smith & Wesson shares picked up on Monday, jumping 2.2 percent in morning trading, to 24.66.

Article: A volcanic eruption in Iceland has sent ash across northern Europe. Airlines have stopped or changed the flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stuck in airports. Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 metres thick. The hot volcano heats up the ice above it, which then forms a layer of water between glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. As the water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure lifts. The lava from the volcano then comes up to the surface. This is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's biggest airlines, airplanes cannot go under the cloud or over it. Going through the cloud can result in ash getting stuck in the airplane's engines, causing damage to the plane. The eruption has also caused problems for animals in Iceland. The volcano left ash and sharp, glass-like rocks all over the countryside. Farmers are keeping their animals inside to stop them eating ash-covered grass or the sharp objects.

Given the severity of the offense and the urgency to maintain the credibility of the legal system, the judge decided to impose the standard probationary conditions on Young, in addition to the initial 45 days in jail.

Unfortunately, after using the device for a couple of weeks, I was left disappointed by a few glaring issues. Issue 1 - Poor Battery Life: The PhoneX's battery life is abysmal. Even with moderate usage, the phone barely lasts through the day, requiring me to carry a portable charger with me everywhere. The quick charging feature promised in the advertisement doesn't seem to make up for this major drawback. Issue 2 - Unresponsive Touchscreen: To make matters worse, the phone's touchscreen frequently becomes unresponsive, causing delays in basic tasks such as unlocking the device or typing a text message. This has led me to miss important calls and messages, while making me feel frustrated with the overall user experience. Positive Aspects: Despite these issues, I do appreciate the phone's sleek design, and when the touchscreen works, the interface is easy to navigate. The camera quality is also commendable, producing sharp and vibrant images.

They chose this day of all days to deliver a giant calamity of a display, a day when England produced one of their best Tests in years. England were quietly brooding after some bad press, a little angry at the flak sent their way after Italy, maybe a little embarrassed at their slowness in dealing with Italy's tactics, perhaps a tad indignant at all the chat about the revived Scots and how they were heading south to consign 1983 to the dustbin once and for all. The hosts had motivation coming out of their ears. Scotland had weakness coming out of the woodwork. What they need to do now is clear. They need to harness the hurt and use it against Italy in their final match of the Six Nations and the farewell Test in Vern Cotter's reign. They need to do to the Italians what England did to them. Power, pace, deception, invention, tries and more tries. A bonus-point win sends them back up the table from their current slot in fifth. A good season is still there to be secured if the Italians are blasted. The horror of Twickenham can be lessened if Scotland finish third in the table with three wins and a six-point loss in Paris when injury befell them in freakish circumstances. That's definite progress. Twickenham will hang in the air like the dirtiest cloud. That can't be erased, but neither should the victories over Ireland and Wales. Scotland are moving forward, but there was the most brutal reality check on Saturday. When England get it right they're on a different planet. But here's the news. When England get it right they're a match for New Zealand at their ultimate. On Saturday's form, England would happily go toe-to-toe with the All Blacks, home or away, summer, autumn, winter or spring. On Saturday, Scotland have a chance to finish with a flourish, but you have to fear now that terminal damage has been done to their hopes of having a chunky representation on the Lions tour. It was instructive to hear Warren Gatland's words when he visited Scotland last week. The Lions coach spoke of the importance of the game at Twickenham, suggesting that winning matches at home was proof of Scotland's improvement, but that winning games away from home was what he was looking for from the Scotland contenders. Had Scotland lived with England and taken them to the wire then Gatland would have had some interesting decisions to make. He'd have seen players going to an intimidating stadium and standing up to a champion team. They're the kind of customers he needs in New Zealand. The fact that they were brutalised puts an image in the head of the Kiwi taking out a red pen and drawing a line through the names of those Scots who advanced their case so impressively against Ireland and Wales. England will make up the bulk of Gatland's squad, which will number about 38 players. If they go on and win a second Grand Slam while setting a new world record for consecutive Test wins then as many as 20 of Eddie Jones' squad could travel - and they'd go on merit. If they're denied in Dublin then the by-product of that would be more Irishmen on the tour. Either way, it's bad news for Scotland. They had a lamentable day that probably destroyed the Lions chances of all bar three or four, but they've got to go again. The good work they've done this season demands a proper finale against Italy, a resounding response to the nightmare.

In mid-2012, The Wiggles announced that Page, Fatt, and Cook would be retiring from touring with the group; Emma Watkins, the first female member of The Wiggles, replaced Page, Lachlan Gillespie replaced Fatt, and Simon Pryce, who was initially supposed to replace Page in August, replaced Cook. Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children. According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\". Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter. Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed. Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce. The new members, like Moran, who was not approached to return, were salaried employees.The group, for their farewell tour, visited 8 countries and 141 cities, for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640,000 people.

I was entranced by this touching and hilarious film, not to mention surprised. I was also surprised to find that the voice of Paulie was performed by Jay Mohr. The performance was so finely nuanced, neither wavering into schmaltz nor becoming too hard under the New Jersey swagger, that I thought that this must be some unsung old pro, not the baby-faced Mr. Mohr. A very impressive performance, indeed, and it's gratifying to see his talents being taken seriously in a string of quirky, indie films. Choose your answer.
