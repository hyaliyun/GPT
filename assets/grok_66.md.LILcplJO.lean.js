(October 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Lara Brennan (Elizabeth Banks) is convicted of murdering her boss and is sentenced to life in prison. The evidence seems impossible to dispute: many colleagues saw her having a quarrel with the victim, their cars are parked right next to each other, she is seen leaving the crime scene seconds before the body is discovered, the murder weapon (a fire extinguisher) has her fingerprints on it and she has the victim's blood on the back of her overcoat. Following the failure of her appeal, her son Luke[6] ceases to acknowledge her during prison visits. One day, Lara attempts suicide, unwilling to spend the rest of her life in prison. Her husband John Brennan (Russell Crowe), a professor at a community college, becomes obsessed with the idea of breaking her out of jail. John consults Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson), a former convict who escaped prison seven times. Damon gives John advice, along with a warning that the initial escape will be easy compared to evading the police after that. Following Damon's advice, John begins his preparation. He obtains a handgun and fake IDs, and studies the map of Pittsburgh for escape routes. To get money, he sells their house's furniture and personal belongings. John attempts to break Lara out from the prison in which she is held but abandons the plan when he is almost caught testing a self-made \\"bump key\\" on an elevator.

California's drought is proving deadly to the state's trees California’s drought has drained lakes, caused land to subside and forced the state to enact draconian water rules. Now, a new study find the years of little or no rain is taking a heavy toll on the state’s forests. The researchers at Stanford University’s Carnegie Institution for Science concluded that up to 58 million large trees in California experienced water loss that could be life threatening since 2011 due to the state's historic drought. Coupled with higher temperatures and insect outbreaks including from the destructive bark beetle, the drought is increasing the risk of the trees dying that would usher in widespread changes in these ecosystems. Related: When the wells run dry: California drought forcing some families to live in 'Third-World-type conditions \\"California relies on its forests for water provisioning and carbon storage, as well as timber products, tourism, and recreation, so they are tremendously important ecologically, economically, and culturally,\\" Carnegie’s Gregory Asner, a lead author on the study that appeared in the in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \\"The drought put the forests in tremendous peril, a situation that may cause long-term changes in ecosystems that could impact animal habitats and biodiversity.\\" The team's advanced tools showed that about 41,000 square miles of forest containing up to 888 million large trees experienced measurable change in the amount of water stored in the canopy of the trees between 2011 and 2015. Of this group, up to 58 million large trees covering 3,861 square miles reached water loss thresholds that the scientists deemed extremely threatening to long-term forest health. To get an accurate picture of the tree’s health, Asner and his team used the laser-guided, imaging spectrometer – to measure the mass of the water in the canopy – that was mounted on the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO). They combined the data from the CAO, which is directed by Asner, with traditional satellite data going back to 2011. Related: California drought could doom endangered fish caught in the center of state's water battles \\"The Carnegie Airborne Observatory's research provides invaluable insight into the severity of drought impacts in California's iconic forests. It will be important to bring their cutting-edge data and expertise to bear as the state seeks to address the effects of this epidemic of dying trees and aid in the recovery of our forests,\\" Ashley Conrad-Saydah, deputy secretary for climate policy at the California Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement. Anthony Ambrose, a tree biologist at UC Berkeley who did not participate in the study but has researched the impact of the drought on giant sequoias, said the latest findings are “significant because it's the first to utilize high-resolution airborne data to assess and map forest conditions throughout the entire state.” Related: Historic California drought stressing Giant Sequoias, scientists say “The study documents substantial decreases in canopy water content over time,” he told FoxNews.com by email. “The current drought in California has contributed to substantial tree mortality, a trend that will certainly continue into the future. Increasing temperatures will continue to stress trees and forests of the state in the future, and having the ability to periodically monitor forest conditions over large spatial scales is important,” he said. “This information will be extremely useful for both public and private forestland managers in their decision-making process, e.g., for prioritizing areas for prescribed fire or mechanical thinning to reduce competition for water and decrease fire risk.” So far, the hardest hit tree species have been pine including sugar pine and certain types of oaks. Giant Sequoias are doing fine, Asner said, while their research found a mixed picture for coastal redwoods – some south of San Francisco have fared poorly while those in Northern California are doing better Related: Monster El Nino expected to shape this winter's weather “If we have recurring drought and it comes back strong after the El Nino, we predict we are going to have a lot more tree mortality,” Asner said of the weather pattern which is expected to be one of the strongest of its kind in history and bring much needed rain to California in the coming months. “If drought persists and we lose forest, it will be replaced with something. Typically when forests get too dry and they die off, usually shrub lands and grasslands do the replacing,” he said. “That means a major shift in the biodiversity of the system because there are a lot of species that live in forest and not in shrub lands or grasslands. The whole region could undergo a major shift.” Related: California cuts water use amid drought Not only would many animal species suffer but the state would lose a key source for storing carbon and water from snow packs as well as the economic benefits that come from logging and tourism. Thus, the state is going to have to consider managing these forests much differently, Asner said, including how it fights fires and sets prescribed burns. “There are many issues with losing these forests,” he said. “It isn’t about biodiversity but about water services, carbon sequestration, fire flammability … We can’t stop a drought but the measurements we are making today, the maps we are making today are a key way forward for managers to adjust how they manage these forests.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"California's drought is causing trees in the state to experience heavy water loss, which can be life-threatening to the trees and lead to long-term changes in ecosystems that could impact animal habitats and biodiversity.

Question: I can use this background: An optimal decision is a decision that leads to at least as good a known or expected outcome as all other available decision options. It is an important concept in decision theory. In order to compare the different decision outcomes, one commonly assigns a utility value to each of them. If there is uncertainty as to what the outcome will be, then under the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms the optimal decision maximizes the expected utility (a probability–weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision). Now, I have a new situation: John and Keith are playing a decision making game. They have three decisions to make decision A, decision B, and decision C. Decision A and decision B have certain outcome, but decision C's outcome is uncertain. John would apply optimal decision making process while Keith would rather rely on his hunches. Answer this question please: Who would most likely assign a utility value to each of the decisions, John or keith? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, it is clear that John would be the one to most likely assign a utility value to each of the decisions. This is because John is described as following the optimal decision-making process, which relies upon comparing the outcomes of different decisions using a defined utility value. The optimal decision-making process is rooted in decision theory, which is a structured approach to making choices among different options. In John's case, he will strive to make decisions that lead to the best known or expected outcome when compared to all other available decision options (decision A, decision B, and decision C, in this situation). By assigning a utility value to each decision, John is able to quantify the desirability or preference for each outcome and weigh them against one another to identify the optimal choice. For decision A and decision B, which have certain outcomes, John would be able to directly assess the utility values associated with those outcomes. However, for decision C, which has an uncertain outcome, John would apply the expected utility approach under the von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms. This entails calculating a probability-weighted average of utility across all possible outcomes associated with decision C. By doing so, John is able to incorporate the element of uncertainty into his decision-making process, thereby adhering to the principles of the optimal decision-making theory. On the other hand, Keith is described as relying on his hunches, which indicates that he does not follow a structured, logical approach to decision-making but rather bases his choices on intuition or gut feelings. Consequently, it can be inferred that Keith would be less likely to assign a utility value to each decision, as this process would involve a more systematic and analytical approach to determining preferences and weighing alternatives. In conclusion, given the information provided, John would be the one most likely to assign a utility value to each of the decisions in the described situation, due to his adherence to the optimal decision-making process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm as much of a man as you are, my dear.","completion":"The given sentence, \\"I'm as much of a man as you are, my dear,\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Let's analyze the components of this sentence to understand why it is well-structured and meaningful. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language. Examining syntax involves observing grammar, sentence structure, and the use of linguistic elements. The sentence follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure: Subject: I Verb: am (the contracted form \\"I'm\\" includes the subject and the verb) Object: as much of a man as you are Furthermore, we can break down the syntax of the sentence into the following key elements: - Clause: \\"I'm as much of a man as you are\\" (where the comparison is made between the subject and object) - Appellation: \\"my dear\\" (a term used to address or refer to someone in an endearing manner) Additionally, the sentence uses the comparative structure \\"as... as\\" to create a clear and accurate comparison between the subjects. In conclusion, the syntax of the sentence is correct and well-structured, making each component understandable and effectively conveying the intended message. 2. Semantics: Semantics is the study of meaning in language. It deals with the interpretation of words, phrases and sentences in context. When evaluating a sentence for semantic acceptability, it is crucial to ensure that the concepts presented are logically coherent and meaningful. In the given sentence, the speaker is using a comparison to make a statement about their own qualities and the qualities of the person they are addressing. In this scenario, \\"as much of a man\\" implies that the speaker possesses equal attributes typically associated with being a man, to the same degree as the person being addressed. The appellation \\"my dear\\" could be interpreted in a variety of contextual ways, such as endearment, sarcasm, or a form of politeness. Nevertheless, this term adds depth to the interpersonal relationship between the speaker and the person being addressed. Semantically, the sentence is acceptable because it conveys a comprehensible and logical meaning. The meaning imbued within the words and phrases work together cohesively, expressing a clear and relevant idea. In summary, the sentence \\"I'm as much of a man as you are, my dear\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable, as it presents a well-formed structure and a coherent, meaningful message. When understood within the context of a conversation or situation, this sentence can engage readers or listeners effectively while maintaining proper syntax and semantics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Paul Reynolds crisscrossed his sketchbook with furious strokes, filling the pages with images of the vengeance he would take on his former coworkers at Fear and Loading Games. He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning.

Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision.

Here is an article: Diego Maradona launched a blistering attack on Sepp Blatter on Monday saying that Fifa had descended into anarchy with the 79-year-old Swiss as president. With the world governing body’s election less than a month away, Maradona, one of the greatest players to ever grace the game and the inspiration behind Argentina’s 1986 World Cup victory, said the time was long overdue for Blatter to go. He said he would do all he could to help Prince Ali bin al-Hussein win the presidency, even though the 39-year-old Jordanian royal hinted on Monday he might consider pulling out of the contest if he thought one of the other two challengers could win. In a syndicated interview with Guillem Balague, the moderator at the Soccerex Asian Forum at the King Hussein convention centre, 60km from Amman, the Jordanian capital, Maradona pulled no punches and gave his backing to the Jordanian royal. Asked why he replied: “If I didn’t believe that he would be a good president, I wouldn’t be here. “As the football world knows, inside Fifa there is total anarchy, where there is only one man who decides everything. “But he knows absolutely nothing. Therefore it is time for a change. And it is so because even his colleagues should actually advise him to leave.“ Maradona, 54, who was voted along with Pelé the joint-best player of the 20th century by Fifa in 2000, said he believed that the continued presence of Blatter, who is seeking a fifth term as president, would harm football. “He has done a lot of damage to football since he has been there. It’s time for him to step aside and let us, who are full of strength, renovate football.“ Maradona played in the World Cups of 1982, 1986, 1990 and 1994 and later coached Argentina to the World Cup quarter-finals of 2010. He implied he was unhappy about the way things were done at Fifa, particularly regarding the choice of Russia and Qatar for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup finals. “First we didn’t know where the World Cup was going to be held. Then we found out that after Brazil it was Russia and then Qatar. “Without any doubt whatsoever Blatter is scared. Blatter is scared. He’s scared of being left out of his share of the cake. “That is what really annoys someone like me, who has played in four World Cups.

Dimple piercings are fairly risky since you are dealing with an area more prone to infection than most. If done right, though, dimple piercings can partially mimic the look of dimples. Keep the piercings if you want to permanently highlight the dimple area or take them out eventually so that the skin eventually heals, leaving behind a dimple-like indentation. Due to the risks involved with dimple piercing, some professionals do not offer them at all. Others may offer them but often refuse them to anyone under the age of 18, even if that individual has the permission of a legal guardian. Dimple piercings cut through muscle and usually cause some mild form of nerve damage. This nerve damage can help hold the dimples in place even after the piercing closes up, but it can also be risky and could do unforeseen harm. The professional piercer should clean the outside of your cheek and should also instruct you to clean the inside of your mouth before making the dimple piercings. The needle and jewelry should also be sterilized. The piercer will puncture both cheeks symmetrically, right at the spot where natural dimples would fall. Afterward, he or she will place a straight barbell or other piece of piercing jewelry into each hole to prevent it from closing immediately. Your dimple piercings will need to be cleaned multiple times a day with a saline solution to prevent infection from setting in. You can keep the dimple jewelry in permanently if desired, but you can usually take them out after three months have passed. If the piercing did the expected nerve damage, you should have an indentation in your cheek even after the skin heals over the original hole. If you want something that looks more natural and will last for the rest of your life, learn about a plastic surgery procedure that will create dimple-like marks in your cheeks. Cosmetic surgery can be costly and does come with its own set of risks, but this option will give you fake dimples that look more natural than many other methods can. A plastic surgeon will use local anesthesia for the procedure. He or she will make a small incision on the inside of the mouth and into the inner surface of the cheek. Using specialized tools, the surgeon will make an indentation in the cheek muscles and mucosal tissues. Afterward, the dimple divot will be held in place with internal stitches, and external stitches will be used to close the wound in the inner mouth. For larger dimples, a plastic surgeon may perform a punch tissue excision. During this procedure, a portion of the cheek muscle is completely removed, creating a deeper and more obvious indentation. In either case, the procedure will take an hour or less. You should expect some pain, swelling, and bruising immediately after the procedure. The area is also weak to infection afterward, so you will need to carefully and thoroughly follow any instructions provided by the surgeon concerning proper wound care and cleansing. For the first few weeks, your dimple-like indentations will be present at all times. Once your cheek muscles partially heal, though, you should only notice the marks when smiling.","completion":"Dimple piercings, while risky due to potential infection and nerve damage, can create a dimple-like appearance, but plastic surgery offers a more natural-looking and permanent alternative."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer: Often referred to by his initials SRV, Vaughan is best known as a founding member and leader of Double Trouble . Question: what happened to stevie ray vaughan Answer:","completion":"Stevie Ray Vaughan, an iconic American musician, singer, and guitarist, is often recognized by his initials SRV. He was a founding member and leader of the blues-rock band Double Trouble. Commonly regarded as a driving force behind the revival of blues music in the 1980s, Vaughan's talent and influence on the genre remain undeniable. Sadly, Stevie Ray Vaughan's life and career came to an abrupt and tragic end on August 27, 1990, when he was involved in a devastating helicopter crash. Vaughan, along with four other passengers, boarded a Bell 206B Jet Ranger helicopter after performing at a concert in East Troy, Wisconsin. The helicopter was heading to Chicago, but unfortunately, due to poor visibility and foggy conditions, the pilot failed to see the rising terrain ahead and the aircraft crashed into the side of a ski hill shortly after takeoff. All five people on board, including Vaughan, were killed instantly, provoking widespread shock and grief within the music community and among Vaughan's fans. At the time of his death, Stevie Ray Vaughan was just 35 years old and seemed to be stepping into what might have been the most creative and productive phase of his career. Prior to the accident, Vaughan had been experiencing a renaissance both professionally and personally. He had finally overcome his long-standing drug and alcohol addiction issues, and his recent works were being met with critical acclaim. Many anticipated that his music would continue to reach new heights, and the tragedy of his death left a gaping hole in the music industry. Following the accident, there has been a surge of interest in Stevie Ray Vaughan's music, contributions, and legacy. Many artists have cited him as a significant influence on their work, and his status as a blues icon has only grown stronger over time. Vaughan has been honored with various awards and accolades, including being posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. Despite his premature death, Stevie Ray Vaughan left a lasting and profound impact on the world of music, with his passionate performances and exceptional guitar skills continuing to inspire and captivate audiences worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Especially expressions like 2-year spot rate etc. Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from the following. A. no B. yes","completion":"A. No Firstly, let's break down the individual components of your questions. The spot rate refers to the current price in the marketplace to immediately purchase or sell a financial instrument such as currency, commodity, or a bond. It's essentially the price that you would pay (or receive) today, or \\"on the spot\\". The spot rate is determined by supply and demand for the financial instrument in question. In the context of bonds, the spot rate is also considered as the yield to maturity (YTM), which effectively serves as the ‘internal rate of return’. It's the percentage that equates the present value of a bond's future cash flows (payments to bondholder) to its current market price. The term \\"2-year spot rate\\" refers to the yield on a bond that matures in two years if that bond is bought today and held for its entire duration. On the other hand, a future rate is a rate that is agreed upon today for a transaction that will occur at a future date. It's essentially a locked-in price. In the bond market, the future rate often refers to the forward rate, which is a projection for what the interest rate on a bond is expected to be in the future. Both spot and future (forward) rates are important for bond valuation. The relationship between spot rates and future rates is essential to the term structure of interest rates, which is essentially a graphical depiction of interest rates (YTM) on debt for a range of maturities. If the future interest rate is higher than the spot rate, we say that the term structure is upward-sloping, which is typically the case. Conversely, if the future rate is lower than the spot rate, we have a downward-sloping term structure, which is less common but can occur. Now, to answer your question regarding the similarity between the two inquiries. Question one is asking for a definition of 'spot rate'. Question two, however, is more extensive. It is asking for an explanation of how 'spot rate' and 'future rate' are used in relation to bonds, particularly when one hears expressions like '2-year spot rate'. Therefore, while the two questions are related, they are not asking the same thing."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Answer:","completion":"James Glickenhaus and Eric Red are both individuals who have contributed to the automotive industry in different ways; however, only James Glickenhaus can be accurately described as an automotive entrepreneur, while Eric Red is primarily known for his work as a screenwriter and film director but has also dabbled in automotive design. James Glickenhaus is an American investment professional and automotive entrepreneur recognized for his involvement in the supercar industry. He started out as an investment manager and is the founder of Glickenhaus & Co., an investment firm based in New York. His passion for automobiles led him to establish Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus (SCG), a boutique manufacturer of high-performance sports cars and racing cars. SCG focuses on producing limited-run, road-legal supercars with a particular emphasis on the racing heritage of legendary sports car makers like Ferrari. Some of the brand's most famous and notable models include the SCG 003, SCG 004, and SCG 007. These unique creations have garnered critical acclaim and respect in the automotive world, making Glickenhaus a renowned figure in the industry. Eric Red, on the other hand, is an American screenwriter, film director, and author best known for his work in the horror and thriller genres. Some of his most famous projects include the films The Hitcher (1986) and Near Dark (1987), as well as his directorial work in films like Body Parts (1991) and 100 Feet (2008). While Red's main contributions to the world of art and entertainment are in cinema, his endeavors in the automotive industry have been limited to vehicles' conceptual design and artistic renderings. One of Red's most notable forays into automotive design came in the form of the \\"Vampyre\\" concept car. This project, which took inspiration from classic horror films and the 1960s Batmobile, was developed in collaboration with renowned car customizer George Barris. The Vampyre is a one-off design that showcases Red's creative abilities beyond screenplay and filmmaking, but it has not led to any significant entrepreneurial ventures in the automotive industry. In summary, while both James Glickenhaus and Eric Red have made contributions to the automotive world in their respective ways, it is Glickenhaus who is a true automotive entrepreneur. He has established a company focused on producing unique and high-performance vehicles and has made a name for himself in the industry. Eric Red, primarily known for his cinema work, has dabbled in automotive design but has not pursued it as a business or entrepreneurial venture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Identify the common components. - The phrase \\"Two people are eating barbecue ribs\\" is present in both statements. Step 2: Identify the key differences. - In the first statement, the time is specified as \\"at night.\\" - In the second statement, the location is specified as \\"outside.\\" Step 3: Compare the information provided by both statements. - The first statement gives us information on when the action takes place, i.e., during the night.

Article:","completion":"Title: Taulupe Faletau's Hat-Trick Keeps Bath's Premiership Play-Off Hopes Alive and Ends Gloucester's Top-Six Dreams In a thrilling encounter at the Recreation Ground, Bath managed to secure a bonus-point win that not only keeps their hopes for a fourth Premiership play-off spot alive but also ends Gloucester's chances of making it to the top six. The victory is largely attributed to Wales' Taulupe Faletau, who scored a magnificent hat-trick, propelling Bath to triumph in this high stakes match. Under pressure to perform, Bath managed to register a stunning 34-20 victory, thanks to the heroics of number eight, Taulupe Faletau. The Welsh star scored three of the team's five tries, displaying his prowess on the field and cementing his status as one of the top players in the game. Faletau's contributions were instrumental in keeping Bath's chances for a play-off spot alive, as they head into the final day of the competition. Bath started the match with intent, and their determination was evident right from the kickoff. They opened the scoring with an early try by Faletau and continued to dominate proceedings thanks to their strong forward play. Gloucester fought back and managed to match Bath's intensity for a while but ultimately could not stave off defeat. Although the outcome of this match has dashed Gloucester's hopes of finishing in the top six, great credit must go to their players for putting up a brave fight. Despite trailing for most of the match, they never let their heads drop and pressed on till the final whistle. Even though the Premiership season has not panned out as desired, Gloucester can be proud of the effort they have displayed all year long. On the other hand, Bath head coach Stuart Hooper will be delighted with his team's resolve in overcoming a difficult challenge. With multiple injuries impacting their squad over the season, Bath has managed to stay competitive in the race for the top four. The energy exerted by the players in this match was commendable, as they refused to give in to the pressure and played till the end. As the Premiership season approaches its climax, there is still everything to play for. With a critical final day looming, Bath must replicate their impressive display against Gloucester if they wish to secure their spot in the play-offs. The victory will serve as a huge confidence booster, and the team will be looking to carry that momentum forward. Taulupe Faletau's hat-trick, however, must be the highlight of the match. The star player demonstrated his world-class abilities and ensured his team's survival in the race. As Bath look to the final day of the season, their hopes will undoubtedly rest on the shoulders of their talented number eight. With Faletau leading the charge, this ambitious team will undoubtedly believe that anything is possible. In summary, the epic battle between Bath and Gloucester at the Recreation Ground has given fans a match to remember. Despite Gloucester's valiant effort, it was Bath who emerged victorious, ensuring they remain in contention for a top-four finish. Wales' Taulupe Faletau was truly the hero of the match, scoring a hat-trick that will go down in the annals of Premiership history. As Bath's Premiership play-off hopes stay alive, it is safe to say that Faletau's performance will be remembered as a turning point in their season."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Anger rife in flood-hit Malawi Malawians are angry, at least many of those who have been uprooted from their homes by floods after days of heavy rains. They are angry that they did not receive the necessary help from their government or aid agencies when they needed it most. Some have been sleeping rough on top of hills after they fled the rising waters. Others are sleeping on the floors of school classrooms, without food, blankets or dry clothes. The level of anger was evident when we traveled on Friday with the Malawian airforce on a mission to evacuate a group trapped in an area on the outskirts of Nsanje – the most affected district in the country. The airforce and police who accompanied the mission were also hoping to persuade people to move to government shelters situated in the town of Bangula. When we reached Nsanje, we found women cooking in the open. It's also where they'd been sleeping as well. Children were playing in the mud. Inside a crumbling mud-hit, an elderly and clearly unwell woman tried to sleep. Men, tasked with looking after their loved ones were most hostile towards the rescue workers at first. \\"Where were you when our people were dying - when we needed your help\\" one man shouted. After a lot of back and forth, and careful negotiation, some agreed to be airlifted from the site and to the the camp in Bangula. But others stubbornly refused to leave. Those frustrated by the response to their plight are, perhaps, justified. Aid and emergency efforts were slow - and to many it remains so. To be fair a disaster of this magnitude was unexpected even though parts of Malawi are flood prone. Those who live in these zones have often found a way of dealing with the problem after decades of living with it. But these floods were different. The dramatic rains affected more areas than ever, including many areas which usually do not experience floods. Roads and bridges have been washed away, cutting off crucial supply routes. On Tuesday, President Peter Mutharika declared a state of emergency in fifteen districts and appealed for help from the international community. The death toll now stands at 176 with more than 200,000 people displaced. The government is trying to ensure that the displaced are fed as a priority. At this point, they are receiving mostly maize and beans, but there are children under five and elderly people who need special meals. It is clear that Malawi cannot deal with this disaster all on its own. This Southern African country is one of the poorest in the world and the government simply does not have enough money to even properly run its administration. As is it stands, international donors have withheld 40 percent of their budgetary support of the nation after a corruption scandal in 2013 - in which more than 30m was stolen from government coffers. The scandal almost brought Malawi to its knees and the effects are being felt to date. So this disaster will only add further strain to an already struggling state. Help is coming though – albeit slowly. The World Food Programme (WFP) plans to airlift more than 100 metric tonnes of high energy biscuits. This will be enough to meet immediate food needs of 77,000 people. But we have not even started talking about other basic supplies that are still not available: blankets, mosquito nets, mattresses, clothes, cooking utensils. Most people came to the shelters with nothing. And rescue workers are still trying to reach those who are trapped, but getting supplies to these people is a logistical nightmare. Authorities are using boats and two military helicopters to try and reach the ones most in need. There's also the very real threat of water-borne diseases like cholera both in the shelters and villages. Robert Kisyula, national director of NGO World Vision, told me that the camps are crowding fast and sanitation facilities are hardly enough. \\"We need to prepare better, get everyone on board. If the rains continue and we experience more flooding I'm afraid the situation will be catastrophic.\\" he said.

In conformity with the custom of designating areas of Jewish settlement with biblical names, Spain was denominated Sefarad (Obadiah 20), France was called Tsarefat (1 Kings 17:9), and Bohemia was called the Land of Canaan. By the high medieval period, Talmudic commentators like Rashi began to use Ashkenaz/Eretz Ashkenaz to designate Germany, earlier known as Loter, where, especially in the Rhineland communities of Speyer, Worms and Mainz, the most important Jewish communities arose. Rashi uses leshon Ashkenaz (Ashkenazi language) to describe German speech, and Byzantium and Syrian Jewish letters referred to the Crusaders as Ashkenazim. Given the close links between the Jewish communities of France and Germany following the Carolingian unification, the term Ashkenazi came to refer to both the Jews of medieval Germany and France. How did Byzantium and Syrian Jewish letters refer to the Crusaders?","completion":"Byzantium and Syrian Jewish letters referred to the Crusaders as Ashkenazim."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What diocese was divided for owing to English reformation? The township of Crompton was originally within the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham in the Diocese of Lichfield, until 1541, when, owing to the English Reformation, this diocese was divided and Crompton became part of the Diocese of Chester. This in turn was divided in 1847, when the present Diocese of Manchester was created.The exact date of the establishment of a place of worship in Crompton is uncertain. Although Shaw Chapel is certain to have been in existence since the early 16th century, it has been put that \\"Shaw Chapel is even more ancient than Oldham Old Church\\", as evidenced by the ancient toponymy of the area. Shaw Chapel was anciently known as St Patrick's Chapel-on-the-Moor, and during the reign of James I of England, \\"it was situate in the midst of the common called Shaw Moor, not a single habitation being near it\\". It is thought to have been constructed following an increase in wealth produced by the localisation of the woollen trade during a very bleak period, although, in 1552 it was noted that it had no endowment, and its ornaments were in poor condition. It was rebuilt in 1739 and enlarged in 1798, and rebuilt again in 1870. It is now known as the Church of Holy Trinity.Shaw and Crompton has three Church of England ecclesiastic parishes: Shaw, High Crompton, and East Crompton. In addition to the established church, a variety of Reformed denominations, particularly Nonconformism and Methodism, have been practiced in Shaw and Crompton. Presbyterian ministers were recorded preaching at Shaw Chapel in as early as the 1650s. The Religious Society of Friends held conventicles in Whitfield in 1660s and 1670s.The following is a table of churches presently in Shaw and Crompton, as of 2018. Most of the above churches participate in Shaw's annual Whit Walks event, when congregations, choirs, and brass bands parade through the streets from their respective churches before taking part in one large, communal, inter-church service. The town centre is also home to a small mosque. Answer:","completion":"Diocese of Lichfield"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Is it “John” with an “h”? “Thanh Ha” with three “hs?” It’s all part of Starbucks’ effort to personalize things. But one barista got a little too personal, when a customer named Virginia ordered a drink from a Starbucks in Hong Kong. According to the woman’s sister, the drink came with Virginia’s name scrawled as “Vagina.” “This is my sister’s cuppa from your HKU branch,” the woman, Veronica Goh, posted on the Starbucks Hong Kong Facebook page, according to various news sites. Goh included a photo of the offending coffee drink. “Fancy your staff not being able to spell an American name like Virginia.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Information: - A hobby is a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time. Hobbies can include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. A list of hobbies is lengthy and always changing as interests and fashions change. By continually participating in a particular hobby, one can acquire substantial skill and knowledge in that area. Engagement in hobbies has increased since the late nineteenth century as workers have more leisure time and advancing production and technology have provided more support for leisure activities. As some hobbies have become less popular, like stamp collecting, others have been created following technological advances, like video games. - Model building as a hobby involves the creation of models either from kits or from materials and components acquired by the builder . Categories of modelling include : Scale model building Live steam models Matchstick models Military models Model aircraft Model cars Model commercial vehicles Model construction vehicles Building models Architectural models Model figures Model military vehicles Rail transport modelling Model rockets Model ships Freelance model Cardboard engineering Firearm models ( See Airsoft guns ) Gundam Models - The hobby of collecting includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining whatever items are of interest to the individual collector. The scope of collecting is unlimited: \\"If something exists, somebody somewhere collects them.\\" - Leisure has been defined as a quality of experience or as free time. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - Stamp collecting is the collecting of postage stamps and related objects. It is related to philately which is the study of stamps. It has been one of the world's most popular hobbies since the late nineteenth century with the rapid growth of the postal service, but is now in decline with the rise of the internet which has sharply reduced the number of postal items arriving in households. Stamp collecting proved to be an almost perfect hobby for collectors because there was a never ending stream of new stamps as each country sought to advertise its distinctiveness through its stamps. Because some stamps became rare, a thriving international trade in stamps was created. While stamp collectors are of all ages, it has been particularly popular hobby among children, many of whom continued the hobby as adults. After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'model building' with the relationship of 'subclass of'. Choices: - activity - animal - art - collecting - computer monitor - country - display - display device - electronic game - game - hobby - interface - international trade - internet - leisure - perfect - philately - postal service - service - skill - technology - trade - type - user - user interface - video - video game The answer is:","completion":"hobby"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He questioned why the government should remain closed if both sides agreed to engage in good-faith negotiations on the budget, according to a Democratic source briefed on the meeting. (WATCH: 10 great quotes on debt ceiling fight) The meeting was described by both sides as cordial but inconclusive. Obama acknowledged to Republicans that notable progress had been made. Sources described the meeting without attribution, because the meeting was private. Aides will continue the discussion through the night to see if they could find common ground on how to move forward on the debt limit and government funding. The short-term debt hike — which was originally proposed at the closed GOP meeting Thursday — did not include plans to reopen the government. Obama agreed to review the House Republican proposal for reopening the government, but reiterated that he wouldn’t pay a ransom, the Democratic source said. At the meeting, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) described the Republicans’ process as being two steps: passing the debt ceiling bill, and then opening a broad budget conference before the government can be reopened. (PHOTOS: 18 times the government has shut down) Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew that this was a “good-faith” effort by Republicans. Ryan said both sides should “put their guns back in their holsters” — a bid to reach an agreement to avoid default, reopen the government and start broader budget talks. Biden was mostly quiet in the meeting but did say at one point that Obama has made concessions as president that he hasn’t seen in 36 years in the Senate. Publicly, House Republicans were mum when they returned to the Capitol. “We had a very useful meeting,” Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said, upon returning from the White House Thursday evening. “It was clarifying I think for both sides as to where we are and the takeaway from the meeting was, our teams are going to be talking further tonight, we’ll have more discussion, we’ll come back to have more discussion. The president said that he would go and consult with the administration folks and hopefully we can see a way forward after that.” (PHOTOS: Debt ceiling fight: 20 great quotes) A senior House GOP aide said Obama “did not say yes or no to House Republicans’ offer.” Both sides are continuing talks tonight, according to the aide. The White House said Obama had a “good meeting” with House Republican leaders that lasted about 90 minutes. “After a discussion about potential paths forward, no specific determination was made,” according to a White House readout. “The President looks forward to making continued progress with members on both sides of the aisle.” For much of Thursday, it appeared that Washington slowly edged away from a potential default on Thursday as congressional leaders crafted plans to raise the debt ceiling ahead of the Oct. 17 deadline. Wall Street liked the apparent legislative movement: The Dow Industrial Average soared 323 points Thursday. (POLITICO's full government shutdown coverage) Obama met separately with Senate Democrats and House Republicans at the White House. Senate Republicans will meet with Obama on Friday morning. The talk in the House GOP visit centered around Speaker John Boehner’s proposed measure to lift the debt ceiling through Nov. 22, while banning Treasury from employing so-called extraordinary measures to keep paying the nation’s bills. The legislation had no corresponding spending cuts, as other debt ceiling bills had. The legislation would also set up a negotiation over the borrowing cap and government funding. At this time, there are no spending cuts attached to the legislation. There is also no vote scheduled. If Obama buys into the GOP plan, senior Republican sources say that Boehner could have enough internal political capital to move a bill next week to reopen government until Nov. 22. Across the Capitol, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is taking the temperature of his own GOP colleagues on ways to reopen the government — which has been shuttered for 10 days — and raise the debt ceiling. Among the options under consideration is a proposal building on the work of Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) that would raise the limit for two months and reopen the government for six months in return for a repeal of Obamacare’s medical device tax, a requirement to means test those seeking Obamacare subsidies and provide more flexibility for agencies to maneuver around the sequester. Though ideas to move on from the budget mess are growing, there’s no consensus yet. A White House official sounded cool to the House GOP plan and offered support for a Senate Democratic proposal to raise the debt ceiling through the end of 2014, reiterating that the government should reopen and the debt ceiling be raised ahead of any talks.

Obama was accompanied by Vice President Biden, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough and deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors. The White House statement said the administration officials “listened to the Republicans present their proposal,” adding that Obama’s goal remains to both raise the debt ceiling and reopen the government. House Republican leaders initially offered a six-week increase in the federal debt ceiling in exchange for negotiations with President Obama on longer-term “pressing problems,” but they stopped short of agreeing to end a government shutdown now in its 10th day. Later in the day, Senate Republicans put forward a plan that would reopen the government and raise the federal debt limit for as long as three months. Returning to the Capitol after meeting with Obama at the White House, members of a 20-strong House Republican delegation described the session as a good first step. The White House denied a news report that Obama had rejected the House GOP’s proposal outright, saying that “no specific determination was made” after Obama, Vice President Biden and top officials listened to the presentation. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said the gathering was “a very useful meeting” and indicated that conversations would continue into the evening. “It was clarifying, I think, for both sides as to where we are,” he said. “We put an offer on the table,” Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Budget Committee, told reporters. Obama “didn’t say yes; he didn’t say no,” Ryan said. “We’re continuing to negotiate this evening.” Earlier, in a news briefing following a closed-door meeting of House Republicans to present a plan to raise the debt limit temporarily, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said, “What we want to do is offer the president today the ability to move a temporary increase in the debt ceiling.” He described the offer as a “good-faith effort on our part to move halfway to what he’s demanded in order to have these conversations begin.” Obama is “happy” that House Republicans agree a federal debt default is not an option, but he would prefer a longer extension of the debt limit, White House spokesman Jay Carney said after the plan was disclosed. Boehner did not immediately tell reporters specifics of the plan. But the speaker made clear that House Republicans were not agreeing to Obama’s demand that they pass legislation to fund the government without partisan riders, thereby ending the first government shutdown in 17 years. [See the latest updates on the shutdown.] In any case, Boehner’s proposal fell flat in the Senate, where members of both parties were clamoring to end the shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), speaking to reporters after a White House meeting between Obama and Senate Democrats, said the shutdown must end and the debt ceiling must be raised ahead of negotiations with the Republicans, who he complained keep changing their demands. “This is a situation where they do not know what they want,” Reid said. His message to the GOP: “Open the government. Pay our bills. We’ll negotiate with you about anything.” Reid also said that Senate Democrats would “look at anything [House Republicans] send us,” but when asked about negotiating with them before reopening the government, he replied: “Not going to happen.” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), meanwhile, was consulting fellow Republican senators to develop a proposal, advanced by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), to end the shutdown and raise the federal debt limit for as long as three months. The package sparked the first bipartisan negotiations since the standoff began in early September. But Collins’s proposal called for Democratic concessions including repeal of a tax on medical devices needed to fund Obama’s health-care initiative, and it would maintain deep budget cuts known sequestration through at least March. The House GOP plan would suspend the debt limit until Nov. 22, the Friday before Thanksgiving, while also forbidding Treasury Secretary Jack Lew from using “extraordinary measures” that his department has used in recent years to extend his borrowing authority for weeks after the ceiling is reached, according to a senior GOP aide who was in the room. This creates a hard “X date,” as financial analysts call the issue, leaving no wiggle room beyond that day. The House Republicans essentially are offering a “clean” debt-limit increase in exchange for negotiations over reopening the government, aides said. The government shutdown would not end until Obama agreed to “structural reforms” to the tax code and federal health programs. The Republican plan for a six-week increase in the debt limit, without conservative strings attached, was aimed chiefly at calming jittery financial markets, according to senior GOP advisers. Financial markets soared earlier Thursday on the first sign of optimistic news out of Washington in almost a month, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 169 points in the first 15 minutes of trading. The rally continued when Boehner confirmed the plan at an 11 a.m. press briefing, and by 1:30 p.m. the Dow was up more than 225 points. The plan was presented to the House GOP caucus Thursday morning after Lew warned lawmakers that he would be unable to guarantee payments to any group — whether Social Security recipients or U.S. bondholders — unless Congress raises the federal debt ceiling. If the GOP plan goes over well with rank-and-file Republicans, Boehner could put the legislation on the floor for a vote late Thursday, aides said. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) described the plan at the news briefing as “a temporary extension of the debt ceiling in exchange for a real commitment by the president and the Senate majority leader to sit down and talk about the pressing problems” facing the country. Rep. Kevin McCarty (R-Calif.), the House majority whip, characterized these problems as “drivers” of increasing federal debt. Obama has indicated he could support a short-term debt-limit hike, but he has also demanded that Republicans allow the government to reopen before he would negotiate with the GOP. If the Republicans want to negotiate, they should “reopen the government, extend the debt ceiling,” Obama said last week. “If they can’t do it for a long time, do it for the period of time in which these negotiations are taking place.” Carney, the White House spokesman, told reporters Thursday afternoon: “The president is happy that cooler heads at least seem to be prevailing in the House, that there at least seems to be a recognition that default is not an option.” However, Obama “believes it would be far better . . . to raise the debt ceiling for an extended period of time,” as Senate Democrats are proposing. “It would be far better for the economy if we stopped this episodic brinksmanship and . . . mothballed the nuclear weapon here, which is the threat of default, for a longer duration,” Carney said. “But it is certainly at least an encouraging sign that . . . they are not listening to the debt-limit and default deniers.” If Republicans now recognize that default cannot be permitted, he added, “why keep the nuclear weapon in your back pocket?” [Members of Congress are collecting pay during the shutdown.] The first reactions from Republican House members appeared generally positive. But several insisted they would back the measure only with a commitment from the president to open negotiations over the next debt-ceiling hike. “All we’re doing is saying, if the president hasn’t come towards us, we’ll just move the deadline out and offer it again,” said Rep. John Fleming (R-La.). “We haven’t changed our position. We’ve just changed the timeline.” Fleming rejected the idea that the proposal represents a concession from Republicans. “Not really, if we get a concession from the president, to sit down and negotiate. If he doesn’t agree to that, I won’t agree to the debt ceiling.” Meanwhile, several of the House’s most conservative members withheld comment about the proposal. “I’m not very enthusiastic,” Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said without elaborating. Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, was noncommittal when asked about the plan and said his support depends on what happens in the meeting with the president Thursday. “Some of this involves a conversation with the president,” Scalise said. “There’s nothing unilateral that can be done. It’s going to involve having the president finally put some things on the table of his own.” Heritage Action for America, a conservative advocacy group influential with tea party Republicans, said Thursday that while it remains committed to fighting Obama’s health-care law and opposes “clean debt ceiling increases,” it wants to give House GOP leaders “the flexibility they need to refocus the debate on Obamacare.” Therefore, the group said, it will not include votes in favor of the proposal in its rankings of lawmakers’ conservatism. The plan would meet Obama’s demand for an increase in Treasury’s borrowing authority without any legislative attachments. But it would set the stage for tough negotiations, possibly lasting until Thanksgiving, over bigger fiscal matters, since the tentative plan calls for only a six-week increase of the debt limit. Advisers cautioned that Boehner’s often unruly caucus, which has repeatedly rejected leadership initiatives in the past, needs to sign off on the plan before it can advance. Reacting to the GOP proposal, a White House official said: “It is better for economic certainty for Congress to take the threat of default off the table for as long as possible, which is why we support the Senate Democrats’ efforts to raise the debt limit for a year with no extraneous political strings attached.” Obama also wants House Republicans to allow a vote on the “clean” government funding bill that has been passed by the Senate, the official said. “Once Republicans in Congress act to remove the threat of default and end this harmful government shutdown, the president will be willing to negotiate on a broader budget agreement,” the official added. “While we are willing to look at any proposal Congress puts forward to end these manufactured crises, we will not allow a faction of the Republicans in the House to hold the economy hostage to its extraneous and extreme political demands. Congress needs to pass a clean debt-limit increase and a funding bill to reopen the government.” Financial experts much prefer a longer-term extension of the debt ceiling, but even a brief extension would ease some of the turmoil that has been brewing on Wall Street. By the time markets closed Monday afternoon, the Dow had dropped 900 points in 14 trading days, losing almost 6 percent of its value. Just three weeks ago, Boehner’s leadership team presented a plan to lift the debt ceiling accompanied by a one-year delay of Obama’s health-care law and a litany of other conservative domestic policy demands. With Washington in gridlock and a key deadline in the debt-limit debate just one week away, Lew told the Senate Finance Committee Thursday morning that he would do all he can to minimize the pain of breaching the 16.7 trillion debt limit. But Lew also told the senators that in an unprecedented situation in which he would be relying entirely on the erratic flow of incoming revenue, the economy would suffer and there would not even be certainty that the government could make all interest and principal payments. “No credible economist or business leader thinks that defaulting is good for job creation or economic growth,” Lew said. “If Congress fails to meet its responsibility, it could be deeply damaging to the financial markets, the ongoing economic recovery, and the jobs and savings of millions of Americans.” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a key conservative with ties to leadership and more junior tea party-backed colleagues, said Thursday morning that he and his colleagues “potentially” could support the new GOP debt-ceiling plan. “We think there needs to be some movement in dealing with the overall problem,” he said. “It’d be nice to get some dollar-to-dollar cuts there.” Asked whether he could support a short-term increase without related cuts, Jordan said he expected that question would be the primary topic of conversation among House Republicans on Thursday. Amid growing anxiety about a debt default, Republicans in the House and the Senate floated ideas Wednesday for raising the debt limit — if only for a short time — in hopes of forcing Obama to the negotiating table. One of the most significant ideas was brewing in the House, Ryan briefed conservatives on a plan to raise the debt limit for six weeks, which would give party leaders time to negotiate a broad agreement to overhaul the tax code and trim federal health-care and retirement spending. The plan, which Ryan sketched in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece Wednesday, was short on details. And it called for spending cuts of roughly 200 billion to cover the cost of raising the debt limit even in the near term — although senior GOP advisers said late Wednesday that they were also considering an increase with no strings attached. Lew’s appearance is the first public confrontation between a senior administration official and Republicans since the fiscal showdown began last month. The meeting comes as some lawmakers on Capitol Hill are questioning whether the administration has been too alarmist about the threat of going past an Oct. 17 deadline to raise the debt ceiling. Republicans have cited reports by credit-rating firms saying that the United States would not technically default unless it fails to make interest payments on its debt — which they regard as unlikely. Echoing points made by Republican presidents and officials in prior administrations, Lew is tried to counter that argument by highlighting the broad risks of leaving the government with no borrowing authority. “Certain members of the House and Senate believe that it is possible to protect our economy by simply paying only the interest on our debts, while stopping or delaying payments on a number of our other legal commitments,” Lew said. “The United States should not be put in a position of making such perilous choices for our economy and our citizens. There is no way of knowing the irrevocable damage such an approach would have on our economy and financial markets.” For example, officials say, Lew pointed out that the Treasury routinely refinances about 100 billion in debt every week, paying back principal and taking on new debt. He noted that should investors back away from Treasury debt, it could make refinancing difficult and throw the country’s financial markets into even greater chaos. Lew said the administration will face a series of difficult decisions even if Treasury can avoid what the credit-rating firms consider a default. In a scenario where federal spending will far exceed revenue, he said, the administration would have only imperfect options in deciding whom to pay. Officials say Lew will try to push Republicans to decide whom they wouldn’t pay — Social Security recipients or veterans. “We are relying on investors from all over the world to continue to hold U.S. bonds . . .,” Lew said. “If U.S. bondholders decided that they wanted to be repaid rather than continuing to roll-over their Treasury investments, we could unexpectedly dissipate our entire cash balance.” A Treasury official said Wednesday night that Obama would have to make the final decision in such a scenario. Lew confronted a Senate Finance Committee stocked with Republicans who have been skeptical about the administration’s claims that breaching the debt limit would be catastrophic. Among the committee’s members is Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), who has championed the notion that the Treasury Department could avoid chaos in financial markets by continuing to make interest payments to investors. The senior Republican on the panel, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), has also expressed doubts about the risk of a debt-ceiling breach. But on Wednesday, Hatch acknowledged that blowing the Oct. 17 deadline would “scare the hell out of people.” And while Treasury might be able to pay interest on the debt, Hatch said, “the real question is whether it’s going to tank the stock market.” Obama, when he meets Thursday with House GOP leaders, is planning to emphasize his refusal to “pay ransom” to avoid default and reopen the government. Ryan, nonetheless, held out hope that the “meeting at the White House will allow us to work together and find common ground.” Thursday’s meeting is the second in a series the White House announced Wednesday aimed at breaking the impasse, reopening the government and raising the 16.7 trillion debt limit. Obama met first with House Democrats late Wednesday and plans to meet with each party in the Senate in the coming days, starting with a meeting with the Senate Democratic caucus Thursday. Obama invited the entire 233-member GOP House conference to join him at the White House, but Republicans decided to send only an 18-member group comprising top leaders and key committee chairmen, including Ryan, Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers (Ky.) and Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (Mich.). “Nine days into a government shutdown and a week away from breaching the debt ceiling, a meeting is only worthwhile if it is focused on finding a solution,” Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Boehner, said in a statement. “That’s why the House Republican Conference will instead be represented by a smaller group of negotiators.” The White House said Obama is “disappointed” by Boehner’s decision to limit Republican attendance and emphasized that Obama will not be negotiating. “The president thought it was important to talk directly with the members who forced this economic crisis on the country about how the shutdown and a failure to pay the country’s bills could devastate the economy,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. Obama “will talk to anyone anytime . . . but will not pay the Republicans ransom for doing their job,” Carney said. “If the Republicans want to have a real discussion, they should open the government and take the threat of default off the table.” Republicans on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, circulated a memo from one of the nation’s leading credit-rating agencies that seemed to play down the threat of default. In the memo, Moody’s Investors Service said the Treasury Department is likely to continue paying interest on the government’s debt even if Congress refuses to lift the limit on borrowing, preserving the nation’s sterling AAA credit rating. “We believe the government would continue to pay interest and principal on its debt even in the event that the debt limit is not raised, leaving its creditworthiness intact,” said the Oct. 7 memo. “The debt limit restricts government expenditures to the amount of its incoming revenues; it does not prohibit the government from servicing its debt. There is no direct connection between the debt limit (actually the exhaustion of the Treasury’s extraordinary measures to raise funds) and a default.” The memo offered a starkly different view of the consequences of breaching the debt limit than is held by the White House, many policymakers and other financial analysts. Over the weekend, economists at Goldman Sachs said the economy would take a devastating hit even if Treasury kept making payments on the debt, because the pullback in federal spending would amount to roughly 175 billion, or 4.2 percentage points of gross domestic product. Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive of PIMCO, the world’s largest bond company, agreed that the administration could take steps to contain the worst damage. But, he said, there would still be severe consequences. “It would avoid a series of major and cascading disruptions to the functioning of a financial market that is at the heart of the core of the global financial system,” he said. “Having said that, equities and other risk assets would still likely sell off hard.” Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) noted that Moody’s analysis is geared toward the well-being of its own investors, not average Americans. “When they say their clients will be okay, they’re not talking about people on Society Security, Medicare or our troops in the field. Moody’s doesn’t give a damn about any of those people.” William Branigin, Rosalind S. Helderman and Scott Wilson contributed to this report. ||||| Still, the House Republican offer represented a potentially significant breakthrough. Even if Democrats found fault with the Republicans’ immediate proposal — for example, it would prevent the Treasury secretary from engaging in accounting maneuvers to stave off potential default — it was seen as an opening gambit in the legislative dance toward some resolution before the government is expected to breach its debt limit on Thursday. Even before the meeting, the White House and its Democratic allies in Congress were all but declaring victory at the evidence that Republicans — suffering the most in polls, and pressured by business allies and donors not to provoke a government default — were seeking a way out of the impasse. After some fretful weeks, the Democrats believe, Mr. Obama was seeing some payoff for his big gamble this year. Burned by his experience with House Republicans in mid-2011, when brinkmanship over the debt limit hobbled the already weak economy, Mr. Obama began his second term vowing never again to negotiate over raising the ceiling or to give any concessions to Republicans for performing an act that is their constitutional responsibility. “The good news is that Republicans have accepted the principle that they’re not going to attach conditions to the debt ceiling,” said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee. “The bad news is they’ve only extended the debt ceiling for six weeks.” Photo For House Republicans, the maneuvers represented a near-reversal of their original strategy in September of going to the mat over the debt limit but not shutting down the government. Now, under pressure from falling poll numbers and angry business supporters, they are seeking a compromise on the debt ceiling. Yet for now, they are still refusing to finance and reopen the government without some concessions. Mr. Boehner and his colleagues left the White House without speaking to waiting reporters, and quickly gathered in his Capitol suite for further discussion. Their debt limit proposal could come to a vote as soon as Friday. Before the White House meeting, administration and Congressional Democrats said they were skeptical that House Republican leaders could pass the proposal. A large faction of Tea Party conservatives campaigned on promises never to vote to increase the nation’s debt limit. And Congressional Democrats vowed to oppose any proposal that did not also fully finance a government now shuttered since the fiscal year began Oct. 1.

Senate Democrats had their own White House meeting with Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. three hours before the House Republicans arrived, and the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, declined to embrace the Republicans’ debt limit proposal until he saw it. He told reporters that Democrats would not negotiate on further deficit reductions until House Republicans agreed to the measure passed by the Senate to finance and open the government through mid-November. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “Not going to happen,” Mr. Reid said. “Open the government,” he added. “There is so much pain and suffering out there. It is really tear-jerking, to say the least.” Separately, members of the Senate’s Republican minority, who are to meet with Mr. Obama on Friday, worked on a proposal for full-year government funding — at levels reflecting the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration, but giving agencies flexibility to shift money around. They are considering adding it to any short-term debt limit increase that the House might pass and send to the Senate. Mr. Ryan said before the White House meeting that Republicans were now willing to formally negotiate with Senate Democrats over a long-term, comprehensive budget framework. The Republicans have resisted such a move since April, fearing that it would require compromises, like raising additional tax revenues, that would enrage the party’s conservative base heading into the 2014 midterm elections. Many House Republicans, leaving a closed-door party caucus earlier Thursday that at times grew contentious, said they would support their leadership’s short-term debt limit proposal. But they said they would do so only if Mr. Obama agreed to negotiate a broader deficit reduction deal, with big savings from entitlement programs. The president has insisted he will not agree to significant reductions in projected Medicare and Medicaid spending — even his own tentative proposals — unless Republicans agree to raise revenues by curbing tax breaks for corporations and wealthy individuals. And Mr. Boehner in recent days reaffirmed the party’s anti-tax stance, which suggests that future talks could founder. Economists across a broad spectrum agree that breaching the debt limit would damage the economy. The new Republican proposal could temporarily remove that threat. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"House Republicans clashed with President Barack Obama over reopening the government while offering a temporary increase to the debt limit.

Options: - supermarket - jar - backpack - wal-mart - container The answer is:","completion":"To answer this question step by step: 1. Analyze the question: The question asks about where homemade food is often stored. 2. Review and evaluate each option: a. Supermarket - Homemade food usually isn't stored in supermarkets as it is not a commercial product made by companies for sale. b. Jar - A jar is a common storage method for some types of homemade food, like jam or pickles. Therefore, this option is plausible. c. Backpack - While a backpack may be used for temporary storage of homemade food, like taking lunch to work or school, it's not typically where the food is primarily stored. d. Wal-mart - Similar to a supermarket, homemade food isn't stored in Wal-mart as it is not a commercial product made by companies for sale. e. Container - Containers are common for storing various types of homemade food, both in the fridge and the pantry. This option also makes sense. 3. Compare the plausible options: Between a jar and a container, a container is a more general option for storing a wider range of homemade food. While jar storage could be applicable for certain foods, a container can hold many types of homemade dishes. 4.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. When glider pilots look at the sky and see lenticular clouds, they know the flying will be good. The stationary, lens-shaped clouds - often mistaken for UFOs - tend to provide very smooth and strong lift, enabling gliders to fly vast distances. Skilled pilots can surf these \\"waves\\" in the sky for hours - until the lift or the light runs out. On Wednesday, strong north-westerly winds set up a series of giant \\"ripples\\" across the skies of Scotland and two pilots managed to break through the 1,000km (621 miles) barrier. John Williams, who lives near Scotlandwell in Perth and Kinross, said it was an \\"exceptionally good wave day\\" - the sort of day that only comes along every few years. He took off from the Scottish Gliding Centre's Portmoak airfield in his Antares glider at 06:50 and remained in the air for 11 hours and 38 minutes. He flew 1,684km - \\"which nicely puts it just over a thousand miles\\" - harnessing the power of the atmosphere alone. \\"When you get a wind from the north-west blowing across the mountains of Scotland, you get big ripples in the air set up. That's when you see these long, white lenticular clouds,\\" he told the BBC. \\"You can fly right along the edge of these clouds, just like a surfer on a beach. It's great fun.\\" The 63-year-old flew up to Killin, by Loch Tay, and then on to Aberdeenshire. He repeated the Killin to Aberdeenshire leg three times before flipping around and returning to his home airfield. \\"My first leg was a bit slower than I was hoping for, so I thought, I could do better than that, so I tried it again,\\" he said. \\"And then I tried it again which is a bit unusual.\\" His average speed on the middle run, which was the fastest, was 184km/h (114mph). To an untrained eye, it might appear that glider pilots are randomly floating around, but they're actually engaged in a constant search for lift and the best line to take them further and faster. It's something that becomes even more critical at the speeds Mr Williams was travelling. The pilot said he finds it an \\"endlessly fascinating\\" mental challenge, and one which enables him to concentrate hard for long periods of time. Mr Williams already holds the UK gliding distance record - 1,108km (688 miles) - which he set almost exactly 10 years ago. He said Wednesday's feat will not count as an official UK record, as the rules state you cannot repeat legs during the flight. But his achievement has still been noted as a \\"significant achievement\\" by members of the UK gliding community. \\"John is an exceptional pilot,\\" says Sant Cervantes, who holds four UK gliding records. \\"He's set the bar for people like myself to follow.\\" Mr Cervantes, 66, set off from Portmoak in a much smaller glider on Wednesday. He spent less time in the air, but still managed to fly 1,009km (627 miles) and reached an altitude of 13,000ft (3,962m). He followed a similar route to Mr Williams, who said it was the first time anyone had achieved such a distance in a glider that size. Mr Cervantes, a retired airline pilot, said there were only a handful of days each year which delivered really good wave days. But Scotland has more days like this than many countries and is generally recognised as having some of the best gliding conditions in Europe - which is why many committed gliders end up moving here. Mr Cervantes came to Scotland in 1972 and Mr Williams in 1997. Both of them now live conveniently close to the Portmoak airfield and devote much of their time to the world of gliding. \\"Your glider is extension of your personality,\\" Mr Cervantes told the BBC. \\"What you've got out there is an ocean of air and each day is different. It's a voyage of discovery - of the sky and yourself.\\" Each flight might be different, but days like Wednesday can live in a pilot's memory for a long time, the 66-year-old said. \\"If you're competent then you get in the zone like an athlete. You've got the conditions, you've got the glider and you've got yourself. \\"When you get it right you feel like you're in harmony with the environment. You're on a knife edge and you just shoot along. It's fantastic.\\" Summary:","completion":"Two pilots in Scotland successfully glided over 1,000 km each by utilizing strong north-westerly winds and lenticular clouds, showcasing the country's exceptional gliding conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"Title: A Solid Accessibility Tool with Minor Room for Improvement Review: As a user who relies on accessibility tools, I recently downloaded the com.google.android.marvin.talkback app to my Android device. Overall, I have had a positive experience with this app, and I would like to give it a well-deserved 4-star rating. First and foremost, I appreciate the dedication of the developers to continually update and improve the app. The app offers a wide range of useful features to make smartphones more accessible for visually impaired users, such as the option for audio description and navigation assistance. The built-in text-to-speech engine is of high quality, making it easy to understand announcements and read-outs. In addition to the text-to-speech capabilities, this app also includes a feature called Explore by Touch. This allows users to glide their fingers over the screen and receive auditory feedback on the items they encounter, giving them a way to conveniently interact with their devices. Furthermore, I was amazed by the gesture-based navigation system. With just a swipe or tap of the finger, I could access different functions and features without any difficulty. The app also supports external switches, which opens the door for more users to take advantage of its functions. However, there were some areas where I felt the app could be improved. For instance, although the app claims to work seamlessly with most popular Android apps, I encountered some occasions where the talkback failed to function properly. This required me to restart the app to make it work again. While it is not a major issue, it did cause a bit of inconvenience. I also noticed that while using this app, my device's battery seemed to drain faster than usual. I understand this might be due to the additional processing required to support the accessibility features, but hopefully, future updates could optimize the app's efficiency to mitigate this issue. Lastly, while the app's gesture-based navigation does usually work well, there were some instances where the app failed to recognize my gestures accurately. Fine-tuning the gesture recognition might be beneficial in future updates. In conclusion, the com.google.android.marvin.talkback app is a valuable accessibility tool that helps make Android devices more user-friendly for those with visual impairments. With its extensive features and mostly seamless integration, it earns a solid 4-star rating. While there are some minor issues that can be addressed in future updates, I do recommend this app for anyone in need of its accessibility functions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress. Guess a valid title for it!

It is most often found in the form of sweetened condensed milk (SCM), with sugar added, and the two terms \\"condensed milk\\" and \\"sweetened condensed milk\\" are often used synonymously today. Sweetened condensed milk is a very thick, sweet product which when canned can last for years without refrigeration if not opened. Condensed milk is used in numerous dessert dishes in many countries. - Theobroma is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae, that is sometimes classified as a member of Sterculiaceae. It contains roughly 20 species of small understory trees native to the tropical forests of Central and South America. The generic name is derived from the Greek words (\\"theos\\"), meaning \\"god,\\" and (\\"broma\\"), meaning \\"food\\". It translates to \\"food of the gods.\\" - The Brigadeiro ( Portuguese for Brigadier ; also known in some southern Brazilian states as negrinho , literally \`\` blackie '' ) is a common Brazilian delicacy , created in 1940 . It is common throughout the entire country , as well as in Portugal , and is present in practically all the major Brazilian celebrations . Other types of Brazilian delicacies are Cajuzinho and Beijinho . The Brigadeiro is made from condensed milk , powdered chocolate , butter and chocolate sprinkles to cover the outside layer . It can be cooked in the oven or the microwave , in the form of individual little balls . It can also be eaten straight from the pot once it is done cooking . The information regarding when and where the Brigadeiro was invented is uncertain . As far as the creators of this treat , it is also uncertain of the nationality of the individuals . - Guatemala (, or ), officially the Republic of Guatemala, is a country in Central America bordered by Mexico to the north and west, the Pacific Ocean to the southwest, Belize to the northeast, the Caribbean to the east, Honduras to the east and El Salvador to the southeast. With an estimated population of around 15.8 million, it is the most populated state in Central America. A representative democracy, Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as Guatemala City. - Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - The Aztec people were certain ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 14th to 16th centuries. The Nahuatl words \\"aztecatl\\" (singular) and \\"aztecah\\" (plural) mean \\"people from Aztlan\\", a mythological place for the Nahuatl-speaking culture of the time, and later adopted as the word to define the Mexica people. Often the term \\"Aztec\\" refers exclusively to the Mexica people of Tenochtitlan (now the location of Mexico City), situated on an island in Lake Texcoco, who referred to themselves as \\"Mxihcah Tenochcah\\" or \\"Clhuah Mexihcah\\" . - Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus \\"Vanilla\\", primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (\\"V. planifolia\\"). The word \\"vanilla\\", derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word (\\"vaina\\" itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as \\"little pod\\". Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called \\"tlilxochitl\\" by the Aztecs. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s. - Theobroma cacao is the taxonomic classification for the plant also called the cacao tree and the cocoa tree, which is a small (tall) evergreen tree in the family Malvaceae, native to the deep tropical regions of Central and South America. Its seeds, cocoa beans, are used to make cocoa mass, cocoa powder, confectionery, ganache and chocolate. - Mesoamerica was a region and cultural area in the Americas, extending approximately from central Mexico to Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and northern Costa Rica, within which pre-Columbian societies flourished before the Spanish colonization of the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries. It is one of six areas in the world where ancient civilization arose independently, and the second in the Americas along with Norte Chico (Caral-Supe) in present-day northern coastal Peru. - Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of \\"Theobroma cacao\\" seeds, roasted and ground, and often flavored with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BCE. In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as \\"xocoltl\\" , a Nahuatl word meaning \\"bitter water\\". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. - Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners.

Created in 1997, Laika is positioned behind the cosmonauts with her ears erect. The Monument to the Conquerors of Space, constructed in 1964, also includes Laika. On 11 April 2008 at the military research facility where staff had been responsible for readying Laika for the flight, officials unveiled a monument of her poised on top of a space rocket. Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.Future space missions carrying dogs would be designed to be recovered. Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.Although never shown, Laika is prominently mentioned in the 1985 film My Life as a Dog, in which the main character (a young Swedish boy in the late 1950s) identifies strongly with the dog. Laika, a 2007 graphic novel by Nick Abadzis giving a fictionalized account of Laika's life, won the Eisner Award for Best Publication for Teens.

In Colombia, the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19, which Castro has clearly backed. Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel. \\"If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them,\\" he told the Journal's David Asman recently. The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing. This week, the government arrested Jose Abello Silva, said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader. He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived. Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized. Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid.

Detailed Instructions: Read an exchange between SENDER A and SENDER B, and answer whether SENDER A is a 'Bot' or a 'Human'. There are only a maximum of two senders (A and B) per conversation, and there are no conversations where SENDER A and SENDER B are both bots, or both humans; only one sender per conversation can be a bot, and only one can be a human. Knowing this, need only to classify whether SENDER A is 'Human' or 'Bot'; you do not need to write anything about SENDER B. Typically, bots will have a more disjointed manner of speaking, and will make statements that don't relate to each other, don't make coherent sense, or otherwise appear unnatural. Humans will make statements in a more or less coherent and logical way, potentially including asking the bot why the bot is not making sense or contradicting itself.

Solution:","completion":"Task Explanation: The task requires determining if SENDER A is a 'Bot' or a 'Human' based on the given conversation exchange. The conversation involves SENDER A and SENDER B, where only one of them is a bot, and the other is a human. Bots typically have a disjointed manner of speaking and make unrelated or incoherent statements, while humans will communicate more logically and coherently. Solution: Analyzing the conversation, SENDER A provides inconsistent and unrelated responses to SENDER B's questions and statements. For example, SENDER B asks about SENDER A's hand injury, but SENDER A keeps changing topics without addressing the question. Therefore, SENDER A can be classified as a 'Bot'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. My mother’s first career was as a beautician. Growing up, she cut everyone in our family’s hair; she dyed mine whenever I wanted, and whatever crazy color I wanted, too. Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon. I don’t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked. Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station. Now, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So … I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too. My mom was mortified and the stylist couldn’t figure out what in the heck I was doing. Mom calls out, “No, Jennifer … you sit in the chair.” I look over my shoulder at her and then realize what I’ve done. Red-faced, I stand up and then turn around to sit and lean back in the chair. I honestly wanted to die right there. I’m pretty sure the stylist thought I was developmentally delayed or something because she talked to me for the rest of the time like one would talk to a three-year-old. Mom tried to explain that I’d never been to a salon before, but I think that just made the situation worse. Thankfully I’ve been to many salons now and understand how everything works, but I’ve never returned to THAT one.

Article 2 of Brazil's Constitution defined the roles of both the Emperor and the Assembleia Geral (General Assembly or Parliament), which in 1824 was composed of 50 senators and 102 general deputies, as the nation's representatives. The Constitution endowed the Assembly with both status and authority, and created legislative, moderating, executive and judicial branches as \\"delegations of the nation\\" with the separation of those powers envisaged as providing balances in support of the Constitution and the rights it enshrined.The prerogatives and authority granted to the legislature within the Constitution meant that it could and would play a major and indispensable role in the functioning of the government—it was not just a rubber stamp. The General Assembly alone could enact, revoke, interpret and suspend laws under Article 13 of the Constitution. The legislature also held the power of the purse and was required to annually authorize expenditures and taxes. It alone approved and exercised oversight of government loans and debts. Other responsibilities entrusted to the Assembly included setting the size of the military's forces, the creation of offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare and ensuring that the government was being run in conformity to the Constitution. This last provision allowed the legislature wide authority to examine and debate government policy and conduct. Regarding matters of foreign policy, the Constitution (under Article 102) required that the General Assembly be consulted about declarations of war, treaties and the conduct of international relations. A determined legislator could exploit these Constitutional provisions to block or limit government decisions, influence appointments and force reconsideration of policies.During its annual four-month sessions the Assembly conducted public debates.

Although the two movements agreed on many issues of theology, some unresolved differences kept them separate. A long-standing resentment between the German states and the Swiss Confederation led to heated debate over how much Zwingli owed his ideas to Lutheranism. The German Prince Philip of Hesse saw potential in creating an alliance between Zwingli and Luther.

Options: - liquid nitrogen - steam room - tidal waves - ocean - crushed ice Explain why a human would choose \\"crushed ice\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"crushed ice\\" To make a cup of water colder, a human would choose crushed ice over the other options - liquid nitrogen, steam room, tidal waves, and ocean - for several reasons. These reasons include safety, accessibility, practicality, and effectiveness. 1. Safety: Using crushed ice to cool a cup of water is the safest option among those given. Liquid nitrogen, being an extremely cold substance, has the risk of causing frostbite or other injuries if not handled properly. Also, due to the Leidenfrost effect, adding liquid nitrogen to water may result in an explosion. A steam room would not lower the water temperature, but rather increase it, as it uses hot steam to warm up the room. Tidal waves and ocean would not be relevant options for cooling water and can pose potential danger or inconvenience to humans. 2. Accessibility: Crushed ice is widely available and easy to obtain. It can be found in ice trays at home, purchased from stores, or sourced from ice machines at social facilities. On the other hand, liquid nitrogen requires special handling, and acquiring it might not be feasible for daily use. A steam room, being a specific type of room designed for relaxation and an increased room temperature, eliminates this choice as an option. Furthermore, ocean and tidal waves are natural phenomena that don't directly apply to the context of cooling a cup of water. 3. Practicality: The process of cooling water using crushed ice is convenient and straightforward. Simply adding crushed ice into a cup of water will effectively lower its temperature as the ice melts and absorbs the heat from the water. Meanwhile, liquid nitrogen demands technical expertise, protective gear, and specialized equipment for safe handling. A steam room, again, is not suitable due to its function of raising a room's temperature instead of lowering it. Lastly, ocean and tidal waves are not practical options for cooling down a single cup of water. 4. Effectiveness: Crushed ice is effective in cooling water due to the process of heat transfer. When the ice interacts with water, it absorbs heat from the water, causing the ice to melt and the water temperature to decrease. This leads to a quick and efficient cooling of the water. Conversely, liquid nitrogen, although effective in cooling, poses a significant risk due to its extreme temperature and handling difficulties. A steam room would not provide any cooling effect on the water, while ocean and tidal waves don't offer a direct, effective method to cool a cup of water. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"crushed ice\\" to cool down a cup of water as it is the safest, most accessible, practical, and effective option among those provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(2) To carry well, i.e. to hold the head high, with arching neck., does the word hold mean the same thing?","completion":"In the two sentences provided, the word \\"hold\\" does not share the exact same meaning. However, both meanings do have a common foundation in the sense of maintaining control, stability, or position. Let's break down the differences and similarities in the meanings of \\"hold\\" in each sentence. 1. \\"He can hold his liquor.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"hold\\" refers to the ability to maintain control or stability in the face of a challenge or influence, in this case, alcohol. When someone says that a person can \\"hold their liquor,\\" it means that despite consuming alcohol, the person is still able to maintain a level of composure, mental clarity, and physical control. They may not get as visibly drunk or impaired as others might after consuming the same quantity of alcohol. 2. \\"To carry well, i.e., to hold the head high, with an arching neck.\\" In this instance, the word \\"hold\\" is used with a more physical connotation, referring to the manner in which one maintains their posture or position. When applied to holding the head high and having an arching neck, it conveys a sense of grace, confidence, and poise. Here, \\"hold\\" signifies the act of maintaining a specific physical stance, suggesting a conscious effort or exercise of control to achieve or maintain that stance. While there is a common theme of control and stability in both cases, the application and context are different. In the first sentence, \\"hold\\" relates to how well someone can manage the effects of alcohol on their body and maintain the appropriate behavior. In the second sentence, \\"hold\\" pertains to the physical aspect of maintaining a certain posture or position with one's head and neck. In summary, although the word \\"hold\\" in both sentences retains a certain level of control, stability, or position, their meanings don't align exactly. The first sentence involves controlling the effects of an external influence (alcohol), while the second sentence pertains to the conscious effort of maintaining a specific physical posture or stance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A mother has released harrowing footage which shows the moment her motorcyclist son was killed instantly in a 97mph crash. David Holmes, 38, was killed in June last year when a car turned into his path on the A47 in Honingham, Norfolk, where the speed limit is 60mph. The devastating moment was captured on the camera which he wore on his crash helmet. Mr Holmes's last word, uttered seconds before impact, was 'whoa'. Now his mother Brenda, 62, has decided to release the footage in a bid to stop others going through the same agony of losing a family member. Scroll down for video. A mother has released harrowing footage showing the moment her motorcyclist son was killed in 97mph crash on the A47 in Honingham, Norfolk. The devastating moment was captured by the camera which he wore on his crash helmet. The car is seen turning into his path as Mr Holmes drives along the road. The last word that he utters seconds before the impact - 'whoa' - can be heard on camera. The retired nurse wants both motorcyclists and drivers to be more aware of each other on the roads, to stop more crashes like this taking place. She said that the driver - who has since admitted causing death by careless driving - did not see the motorcyclist, but that Mr Holmes, who was driving nearly 40mph over the speed limit, also did not have time to take 'evasive action'. She said: 'I want to be involved in this campaign because I feel something positive can come out of his loss. 'If we can prevent one accident; one family going through what we have been through then David would not have died in vain. It is not easy to do but I hope somebody benefits from seeing it.' Mr Holmes was travelling back from King's Lynn, Norfolk, where he had been with colleagues. He overtook several cars on his powerful bike in the minutes leading up to the fatal crash. He was thrown from his Yamaha FJR1300 into the trees and pronounced dead at the scene. The car then drives into Mr Holmes's path, killing him instantly on impact. Mr Holmes was thrown from his Yamaha FJR1300 into the trees and pronounced dead at the scene. Speaking about the crash, his mother said: 'I know he rode fast that day. He loved speed and motorbikes. 'The driver did not see him and turned right across his path. David did not have time to take evasive action.' In the video, Mrs Holmes tells how her son, who worked at the British Antarctic Survey and had recently returned from The Antarctic, was first bought a motorbike for his 16th birthday. She said: 'We brought it back home in the back of his Dad's truck, He was jumping up and down with excitement. It was fabulous. A lovely, lovely memory. Mr Holmes, who worked at the British Antarctic Survey, was first bought a motorbike for his 16th birthday. His mother Brenda, 62, has agreed for the footage to be released as part of a police road safety campaign. 'Although his father said he wishes he had never bought him that first bike, I would not have deprived David his 22 years of riding.' She said he was 'the most wonderful son' and was described by his friends as a 'gentleman and a legend'. Chief Inspector Chris Spinks, head of the Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing Unit, said he was 'confident' that the clip would save a life. In just three days, the video, recorded on the motocyclist's camera, has been watched by almost 4.5million people. He said: 'David's family have always been of the belief that if this video could save just one life then it would be worth it. 'Unfortunately, we'll never know if we have achieved this but I'm confident, with the level of interest that we will.' Benjamin Austin, the driver of the Renault car that struck Mr Holmes, pictured, pleaded guilty to causing a death by careless driving. In April this year, Benjamin Austin, the driver of the Renault car that struck Mr Holmes, pleaded guilty to causing a death by careless driving. He was subsequently ordered to perform 130 hours of unpaid work. His driving licence was also suspended for 18 months. The court heard Austin admitted he had not seen Mr Holmes before making the turn. In passing sentence, Judge Veits said no one had suggested Austin had been driving dangerously, but he had made a mistake that 'sadly' too many other drivers also make, of 'simply' not seeing the motorcycle. Headded: 'Nothing I can impose can turn the clock back and undo the tragic consequences of the accident that sadly took away the life of Mr Holmes. I only hope the family of Mr Holmes can now move on as this case is concluded and attempt to rebuild their lives.'

Gaius Julius Caesar (Latin: CAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR, , born: 13 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC), usually called Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician and general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. He is also known as a notable author of Latin prose. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power as \\"Populares\\" were opposed by the \\"Optimates\\" within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero. Caesar's victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC, extended Rome's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine. Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both the Channel and the Rhine, when he built a bridge across the Rhine and crossed the Channel to invade Britain. These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. Caesar refused the order, and instead marked his defiance in 49 BC by crossing the Rubicon with the 13th Legion, leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms. Civil war resulted, and Caesar's victory in the war put him in an unrivalled position of power and influence. Answer this series of questions: 1. Name one person in an alliance with Caesar? 2.

Please answer the following question: What is the name of the person who warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that \\"I shan't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts\\"? Answer the above question based on the context below: Tchaikovsky remained abroad for a year after the disintegration of his marriage. During this time, he completed Eugene Onegin, orchestrated his Fourth Symphony, and composed the Violin Concerto. He returned briefly to the Moscow Conservatory in the autumn of 1879. For the next few years, assured of a regular income from von Meck, he traveled incessantly throughout Europe and rural Russia, mainly alone, and avoided social contact whenever possible. During this time, Tchaikovsky's foreign reputation grew and a positive reassessment of his music also took place in Russia, thanks in part to Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky's call for \\"universal unity\\" with the West at the unveiling of the Pushkin Monument in Moscow in 1880. Before Dostoyevsky's speech, Tchaikovsky's music had been considered \\"overly dependent on the West\\". As Dostoyevsky's message spread throughout Russia, this stigma toward Tchaikovsky's music evaporated. An unprecedented acclaim for him even drew a cult following among the young intelligentsia of Saint Petersburg, including Alexandre Benois, Léon Bakst and Sergei Diaghilev.Two musical works from this period stand out. With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing completion in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the 1812 Overture, would be \\"very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore there will probably be no artistic merits in it\\".

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person whose art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh? Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts. The answer is:","completion":"The first name of the person whose art bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh is Tom.

Mr Barnes managed to enter the device's software innards via connections found on its base. He said taking over the device was \\"trivial\\" once an attacker had access to an Echo. Amazon's Echo uses artificial intelligence (AI) to respond to voice commands from users to carry out many different functions, including answering queries, playing songs and ordering goods from a retailer. The hack started by peeling off the rubber base of the Echo to expose a grid of electrical contacts, wrote the researcher from MWR Info Security in a blog. Connecting to one of the contacts let Mr Barnes watch the Echo's boot-up procedure and work out how it was configured. Armed with this knowledge Mr Barnes wrote software that, once loaded on a small memory card and connected to one contact pad, gave him control over the device. Using this he examined how it handled audio and then created attack code which forwarded everything it heard to a remote server. That deep access meant he had complete control over the code the device ran and what it did with customer data, he said. Amazon did not comment directly on Mr Barnes' findings but said in a statement: \\"Customer trust is very important to us. \\"To help ensure the latest safeguards are in place, as a general rule, we recommend customers purchase Amazon devices from Amazon or a trusted retailer and that they keep their software up-to-date.\\" The security researcher acknowledged that the requirement to get physical access to the device to carry out the attack was a \\"major limitation\\". However, he added, it was possible that Echo owners would take their devices with them on holidays or business trips - situations that could expose them to attack. Second-hand devices may also be compromised in some way. The attack was carried out on the versions of the Echo that were released in 2015 and 2016. More recent versions of the Echo are not susceptible to the same attack. Mr Barnes recommended that hardware makers start assessing novel gadgets on their ability to resist physical attacks \\"as early as possible\\". \\"Product recalls and modifications can be expensive in post-production, so physical security should be considered throughout the development life cycle,\\" he said.","completion":"A man named Mark Barnes found a way to control some older versions of a device called the Echo.

It claims Jaws allowed politicians in WA to promote the killing of sharks. Jaws instilled the idea that killing 'the shark' was the only solution.","completion":"Title: Jaws Movie Made People Think It's Okay to Kill Sharks, Even for Leaders! Have you ever seen the movie Jaws? It's a story about a big, scary shark that scares a lot of people. Well, this movie has changed how some grown-ups think about sharks. They saw the movie and thought that the only way to solve the problem of sharks is by getting rid of them. This research showed that Jaws has influenced leaders in a place called Western Australia (that's a state in a country called Australia). After the movie Jaws came out, some politicians or leaders in Western Australia started saying that it's okay to kill sharks because they are dangerous. Even though there are many kinds of sharks and not all of them are scary or harmful, people still got scared because of that movie. So, those politicians thought that they had to do something, and they did what they saw in the movie - they wanted to find and kill sharks. Many people today still think that the only solution to the shark situation is to catch and kill them, all because of that movie! But actually, sharks are important for our oceans. They help to keep the seas healthy and can balance the food chain. In conclusion, the movie Jaws made people think that killing sharks is the right thing to do, even when they aren't hurting anyone. It's important for us to remember that sharks are important, and rather than being scared of them, we should learn more about them and how to live with them safely."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"The missing first step of the following process is: \\"Blood containing waste products is circulated through the body.\\" Justification: 1. Blood containing waste products is circulated through the body: This step is essential because it explains how waste reaches the kidneys in the first place. The waste products are produced as a result of normal cellular processes, and the blood carries them to the kidneys for filtration and removal. 2. Waste enters the kidneys: The waste-carrying blood arrives at the kidneys, where the filtration process begins. 3. A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass: During this step, the waste and fluids are separated from the blood in the kidneys. 4. Prevents larger molecules to pass: The kidney's filtration system prevents larger molecules, like proteins and blood cells, from passing through, ensuring that only waste and excess fluid are filtered out. 5. Fluid goes back to the bloodstream: The filtered fluid, which contains important nutrients and electrolytes, is reabsorbed into the bloodstream to maintain overall body health and balance. 6. Bad waste is removed: The unwanted waste and excess fluid not reabsorbed into the bloodstream are collected and processed further in the kidneys. 7.

Available choices: 1). unacceptable. 2). acceptable.","completion":"The test sentence, \\"We abandoned the area,\\" is an acceptable English sentence in terms of grammar. Let's dissect the sentence and analyze its grammatical components: 1. Subject: \\"We\\" is a pronoun that serves as the subject of the sentence. In this case, \\"we\\" refers to two or more people, implying that a collective decision lies behind the action. 2. Verb: \\"abandoned\\" is the past simple tense of the verb \\"abandon.\\" The verb in this sentence agrees with the subject in terms of grammatical number, as it affects a plural subject. Moreover, using the past tense properly indicates that the action occurred in the past. 3. Object: \\"the area\\" serves as the object of the sentence, which receives the action of the verb. The definite article \\"the\\" points to a specific area, while \\"area\\" operates as a noun that gives context to the abandonment. In addition to satisfying the rules of grammar, the sentence is concise and conveys a clear meaning. The actions taken and the context are both easily understood.

He was a Navy veteran and native of New York. (Several items in this photo gallery have been updated and corrected.) Sept. 16, 2013 Aaron Alexis, 34, was the gunman. He was a Navy veteran and native of New York. (Several items in this photo gallery have been updated and corrected.) Fort Worth Police Department/via AP Standing at an ATM in the first-floor atrium of the building where she works at the Washington Navy Yard, Patricia Ward was startled by a rapid succession of sharp noises that seemed to come from overhead. Bam, bam, bam . . . It was about 8:15 a.m. Monday in Building 197, a brick edifice that houses employees of the Naval Sea Systems Command. “Was that a gunshot?” one of Ward’s companions wondered aloud. They were on their way to have breakfast in the cafeteria nearby. More loud cracks came almost instantly. “We knew it then,” Ward said. “We just started running.” So began a morning of tragedy and terror: a mass shooting that killed a dozen victims and injured eight others at the historic facility. Authorities said a 34-year-old Texas man apparently armed with high-powered guns opened fire, leaving a trail of bodies before he died, too, either from police bullets or his own hand. His motive remains a mystery, and the precise sequence of events has yet to become clear. But for those who survived, who saw or heard what happened from narrow vantage points — crouched under a desk, standing flat against a wall, prostrate on the floor beneath a table — the memory is indelible. A crisp September morning, Indian summer: At 8 a.m., reveille crackled over loudspeakers at the Navy Yard as two sailors hoisted an American flag up a pole, marking the official start of the workweek. This being a military installation, many on the grounds, on the north bank of the Anacostia River, had already been busy for a while. Tim Birkenbuel, a Navy contractor, was in his second-floor office when he heard what sounded “like a table falling on concrete.” He heard the same sound again, and again — what turned out to be several gunshots in rapid succession. Some of his co-workers ran to the glass panels that surround the building’s atrium to see what was going on. Birkenbuel then barricaded them in the office for safety. And they waited. Mark Vandroff, a retired Navy captain, had arrived by Metro from his home in Bethesda at 5:50 a.m. He had already worked out in the Navy Yard’s gym, showered and read through his e-mails. He was on the third floor, preparing for a meeting about the planned purchase of Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers. A floor above him, Anthony Salemi, a logistics expert, was settling in at his desk. Down the hall, a dozen top civilian officials of the Navy’s Senior Executive Service were scheduled to soon meet for a briefing on billions of dollars’ worth of purchases. Then came the sound. A conference table falling, Salemi thought. “We’re always setting up for seminars and things like that,” he said. “I figured the leg had collapsed and one had fallen.” But: “I heard someone yell, ‘Call 911!’ And I knew it was a shooting.” He headed toward a staircase. Then, like Patricia Ward, Salemi heard a second series of sharp cracks — bang, bang, bang — and he broke into a sprint. Vandroff had heard the initial noise, too, and like the others, he wondered what it was. “The first sound that I heard, that I now think was gunfire . . . was a loud sound shortly after 8,” Vandroff recalled. “It sounded unusual, and we all looked at each other around the table, like, ‘What the heck was that?’ And then, the second sound — that was definitely gunfire. That was the unmistakable sound of gunfire. And it was very, very loud. . . . “After that, people started screaming: ‘Close the doors! Close the doors!’ ” Vandroff and eight others in the third-floor conference room stood up. Someone shut the door, but it didn’t have a lock. They decided to barricade themselves in. They flipped the conference table on its side. They wedged it under the door handle and packed chairs behind it. Then they got down on the floor. Another burst of gunfire sounded, this one closer. Vandroff said he buried his head, then looked up when the sound stopped. There were two bullet holes near the top of a wall, as the gunfire continued. “At different points, you couldn’t really tell where it was coming from,” he said. “The shot that when we looked up and saw the bullet holes in the wall was definitely close.” Rick Mason, a program management analyst, told the Associated Press that a gunman was shooting from a fourth-floor overlook in the hallway outside his office. He said the shooter aimed at people in the first-floor cafeteria. Navy Cmdr. Tim Jirus said that as he was leaving the building, he saw a co-worker who had been shot getting into a police car, and he heard more shots from inside his workplace. Jirus went to an alley where he thought he would be safe and spoke briefly with a man there about what was going on. Jirus said he heard two gunshots, loudly echoing off the building. He spun toward the sound. When he turned back, the man he had been talking with was lying on the ground, shot in the head. Uncertain where the shooter was, Jirus ran. “I was just lucky,” he said. “The other person was shorter than me. There were two shots. He got that guy. He didn’t get me. . . . The randomness of it — standing right next to me, one person gets shot.” David Stevens, a Navy contractor, was on the phone when he heard an initial volley of gunfire and people shouting that a shooter was on the fourth floor. He said he ran to the edge of the atrium and glanced up. Then he heard a “second deluge” of shots. The fire alarm sounded. The first call to D.C. police came about 8:15 a.m., and Chief of Police Cathy L. Lanier said officers arrived at the Navy Yard “within literally two to three minutes.” “Internal security had already . . . identified and engaged the suspect,” Lanier said — meaning they were trading shots with him. “We already had victims down at that point,” she said. “Within seven minutes, we had active-shooter teams inside the building, moving through the building.” Quickly, District police were joined by U.S. Marshals, U.S. Capitol Police and U.S. Park Police, who entered the building and, talking on one radio frequency, began moving floor to floor, helping victims and securing rooms. A Park Police helicopter airlifted an injured D.C. police officer from atop the building, while a helicopter from another agency circled to search for possible other suspects. The FBI arrived a bit later. At 8:28 a.m., an e-mail went out to Navy Yard workers: “ALL HANDS on WNY Shelter in place.” Twenty minutes later, another e-mail: “All Commands on WNY report accountability of your personnel.” Then, at 9:15 a.m.: “Shelter in Place and or a Lockdown is security posture taken to protect personnel. Stay indoors, if outside, get within a building. Stay away from windows or open buildings, Remain indoors until the ‘all clear’ is given. Secure doors and windows.” And a half-hour after that: “ALL PERSONNEL ON WASHINGTON NAVY YARD CONTINUE SHELTER IN PLACE. REMAIN CLEAR OF ALL WINDOWS.” Lanier said officers eventually encountered the gunman. “There was a gunfight with the suspect,” she said. And the suspect “was eventually deceased.” ||||| Alex Wong/Getty Images WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 16: Emergency vehicles and law enforcement personnel respond to a reported shooting at an entrance to the Washington Navy Yard September 16, 2013 in Washington, DC. According to the latest news report, several people were shot with the shooter still possibly active. WASHINGTON — Two workers at the Washington Navy Yard who came face to face with a gunman in a dimly lit hallway recounted Monday how he silently raised his rifle and opened fire on them. \\"We're lucky he was far enough away he was a bad shot,\\" said Terrie Durham, a civilian employee in the Office of Naval Sea Systems Command. Her co-worker, Todd Brundidge, said the shots didn't come with a warning. Don Andres, a legislative aide to Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., describes to MSNBC's Chris Jansing the scene near the Washington Navy Yard, where 12 were wounded and at least four people died after a shooting at the headquarters of the Naval Sea Systems Command. \\"No words. He raised the gun and started firing,\\" he said. More than a dozen people were shot in the Monday morning rampage, including a man who was standing next to Navy Commander Tim Jirus. Jirus said he had fled the building and was in a back alley when a worker from a maintenance facility approached, asked what was going on — and was shot right there. \\"He just came up and was like, 'Hey I understand you have a shooter in your building,'\\" Jirus said. \\"I said I heard some things earlier, I don't know if they were gun shots. And then I heard two more gunshots and it hit the guy next to me and not me.\\" He said the man fell to the ground and he took off. Speaking about the deadly shooting at a Washington D.C., area Navy Yard, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus says, \\"The Navy family has suffered an horrific attack.\\" \\"We know people we work with were shot and they're on the way to the hospital and we don't know if they're going to make it or not make it,\\" Jirus said. \\"I consider myself very lucky.\\" Jirus didn't see the shooter, but Durham and co-worker Brundidge had a terrifying closeup. The pair were in their third-floor office when an alarm went off about 8:15 a.m., followed by an announcement of a fire emergency and orders to leave the building. \\"I was on the phone and someone came up to my desk and said, 'This is not a drill. Someone had just been shot. There are shots in the building,'\\" Brundidge said. \\"So I hung up the phone and started to try to get people out of the building.\\" Durham said she wasn't exactly sure what was happening but knew it was a dire situation. \\"Our wardens came running, yelling for everyone to get out of the building,\\" Durham said. \\"We were standing right outside the door to go to the exit and we saw a man standing down the hall,\\" she said. Dr. Janis Orlowski, the Chief medical officer at Medstar Washington Hospital Center, says, the three shooting victims in the deadly attack that left 13 people dead are \\"doing well.\\" He was about 40 yards away but close enough for them to see he was clad in blue and had a weapon. 'He aimed at us and shot but missed' \\"He was a tall man, appeared to have dark skin, looked like he was in some kind of uniform and he had a rifle,\\" Durham said. \\"And he aimed at us and shot but missed, thank God.\\" Before the shots, there was silence. \\"He said nothing,\\" Brundidge said. The stairwell was dimly lit so they didn't get a good look at the gunman's face, but Durham could see how close they came to being shot. \\"He aimed high and missed,\\" she said. \\"I saw where the shot missed. It was a few feet ahead of us and a foot or above where we would have been standing.\\" She said she ran for her life, yelling to everyone else on the stairwell, \\"There is a man shooting in the building, get out, get out!\\" Brundidge and Durham are among thousands of people who work at the Washington Navy Yard, a sprawling facility that is home to several naval commands. Ameisha Boatwright arrived for a job interview only to find police and fire trucks with sirens screaming. \\"I told myself, I'm getting outta here,\\" she said. \\"I can do this interview another day. I'm just going home now — I'm scared.\\" NBC News Doug Hughes, a project engineer at the Washington Navy Yard. Hours after the gunfire ended, relatives of Navy Yard employees were still waiting for word on their loved ones. Jacqueline Alston, who works for the National Parks Service, was hoping for a reunion with her husband, Earnest Johnson, who is an office cleaner in the building where the gunman stalked the halls.

It was really frustrating,\\" she said, adding she was on her way home to her children. \\"Today was hell, I didn't wake up this morning to experience this.\\" 'This is not good' Dr. Janis Orlwoski, chief medical officer at Washington Medical Center, said she spoke to the three wounded victims taken to her hospital, who were described as in stable condition. \\"There is something evil in our society that we as Americans have to try to eradicate,\\" Orlwoski said. \\"I may see this every day, I may be the chief medical officer of a major medical center, but there's something wrong here when we have these multiple shootings. ... \\"We have to work together to get rid of it.

Her two best friends Annie Brackett (Nancy Loomis) and Lynda van der Klok (P. J. Soles) dismiss Laurie's concerns that someone is following her. Michael's psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), having anticipated Michael's return home, goes to the local cemetery and finds Judith Myers' headstone missing. Loomis meets with Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers) and monitors the local neighborhood to keep an eye out for Michael. When Annie's boyfriend Paul calls her to come pick him up, she takes Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards) to the Doyle house, just across the street, to spend the night with Laurie and Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews). Michael strangles Annie after she gets into her car. While playing hide-and-seek with Lindsey, Tommy sees Michael carrying Annie's body into the Wallace house, and, believing he's the \\"boogeyman\\", tries to tell a skeptical Laurie about what he saw. Later, Lynda and her boyfriend Bob enter the Wallace house to spend the night together. After having sex, Bob goes downstairs to get a beer for Lynda, but Michael ambushes and impales him.

Movie title: Aladdin Movie plot: The story begins with a young boy named Aladdin, trying to make money by being a servant for a day, with no success. Meanwhile, a shifty man named Hassim, who has journeyed from Marrakesh, visits the local medicine woman, Fatima, who tells Hassim that in order to reach a certain treasure that he wants, he needs Aladdin. Hassim visits Aladdin and his mother, claiming that he's Aladdin's long lost uncle, and says that he can make them rich beyond their wildest dreams. The next day, Hassim and Aladdin travel outside the city to the location of the treasure. When they arrive, Hassim begins an incantation to open the cave; Aladdin finds out that Hassim isn't his uncle, and that he only brought Aladdin to this spot because he is the only one that can enter the corridors of a dark cave and claim the treasure inside: an old oil lamp. Aladdin reluctantly steps inside and walks past the traps within, leading him to a beautiful garden with friendly animals. He eventually finds the lamp; he pauses to pick flowers from a tree for his mother, which instantly turn into jewels, so he takes a whole sack full. Aladdin makes it back to Hassim, but fears that he may be killed after Hassim takes the lamp away from him, and so he refuses to give it to him. Enraged, Hassim uses his powers to close the entrance of the cave forever, trapping Aladdin. Aladdin kneels to pray and accidentally rubs the lamp, releasing a powerful genie inside, who can grant any wish. Aladdin wishes that he was out of the cave and back home. Aladdin tries showing his mother the magic lamp, but she fears it is too dangerous and wants him to put the lamp away and remain silent about it. Cut to four years later, Aladdin and his mother must hide indoors for the sultan and his daughter Layla are being escorted to the bathing house and the sultan orders that no one looks upon his daughter, or the punishment is death. Curious by the sultan's order, Aladdin sneaks out while his mother sleeps. He sneaks into the bathing house and sees Layla from inside, and is... A:","completion":"Hassim closed the cave in an attempt to prevent Aladdin from escaping with the magical lamp. As the plot unfolds, we learn that Hassim, driven by his greed for the enormous treasure, had come from Marrakesh to acquire the powerful lamp through any means necessary. His intentions were to manipulate and deceive, in order to take the treasure for himself without facing any danger. He then went to Fatima, the local medicine woman, who revealed to Hassim that Aladdin would be the key to obtaining the lamp. Hassim approached Aladdin with lies, claiming to be his long-lost uncle and promising him and his mother a life of wealth beyond their wildest dreams. To execute his plan, Hassim brought Aladdin to the cave containing the treasure, knowing that Aladdin was the only one who could enter it and retrieve the lamp. Aladdin's role in this scheme was to brave the dangerous corridors and traps within the cave, ultimately delivering the lamp safely to Hassim. As events unfolded, Aladdin discovered Hassim's true intentions and rightfully decided not to hand over the lamp to him. Aladdin's courageous act of defiance enraged Hassim, who had gone to great lengths to deceive Aladdin and his mother to satisfy his greed for power and wealth. In a fit of anger and to ensure that he would not lose the treasure forever, Hassim used his powers to close the entrance of the cave, trapping Aladdin inside, hoping to either force him to comply or prevent anyone else from discovering the powerful secrets contained within. Fortunately for Aladdin, as he knelt to pray while trapped in the cave, he inadvertently discovered the power of the lamp he had found, releasing a powerful genie capable of granting any wish. Thanks to the genie, Aladdin was able to escape the cave and return home with the lamp, preventing Hassim from achieving his malevolent goals. In conclusion, Hassim closed the cave as a desperate measure to retain control over the valuable treasure and keep Aladdin confined, preventing him from exposing Hassim's true intentions and treacherous machinations. This crucial moment in the film's plot showcases the conflict between Aladdin, an innocent and resourceful young boy, and Hassim, a deceitful and greedy antagonist, setting the stage for the movie's ensuing dramas, challenges, and adventures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Say you need to vent about the breakup. Have this friend listen as you reflect on the breakup. Make sure you select a friend who is a good listener. A friend who tends to interrupt, or give advice, is not the best option. Self-reflection can help you understand the loss. As you go over the relationship with a friend, you may begin to see what went wrong. You can process the information out loud, which can allow you to see something you missed before. Let your friend know exactly what you need from them. Whether it's a shoulder to cry on, someone to bring you out for a good time, or a fellow person to be angry with, your friend should know what you want from them. For example, you could say, \\"Thanks for listening to me, Jen. I know I've talked a lot about this breakup with you, and I really appreciate that you're taking the time to listen. I need to talk this through again to help me understand what happened.\\" As with talking, writing is a great form of self reflection. Try writing down your thoughts in a journal.

You can express anything you wanted to say to your ex but could not. Talk about what you loved about the relationship, but also what was frustrating. Do not censor yourself.

Were the two of you really in love? Love does fade over time. It's possible the passion had drained from the relationship. Were there any differences you missed before? Some differences and disagreements are hard to reconcile. It's not always possible to understand why a relationship ended. Human beings are complicated. You may not get an understandable answer, even if you were able to speak to your ex. Try to come to terms with the fact there will always be confusion surrounding a breakup. Even if your ex were to explain, there's a chance you would not understand or accept his explanation. Remember, you can heal from the breakup without closure.

It's been a long time since I've had a really good, knock off my boots and keep them off!!!, ribeye. This place really surprised me with the quality of their steak since it's mostly famous for it's stone crab. -bone-in ribeye: Yah, I splurged for the bone and honestly, I don't know if it would've made a difference.

My only gripe about this dish is that they took the belly, and all the tasty little bones away =( My little heart cried when the waiter took that platter away ='((( -swordfish with mint pesto: This was a special that night and it was overcooked. My friend really should've sent it back for a new one but she didn't. The presentation was lovely though. -creamed spinach: This was very good. It had a good spinach flavor and wasn't overloaded with cream. -Jennie's potaoes: Honestly, I don't see the draw of this dish. It was just whipped potatoes and it seemed to have lacked butter and salt in it. -mac and cheese: This was okay, loved that they used shells though =d -oysters on a half shell: Their shucking skillz weren't too bad.

When recommending an app to a friend, it is crucial to consider their needs and preferences. In this case, the reviewer appears to have found significant educational value in the app, describing it as an \\"ocean of knowledge.\\" This implies that the app may have a vast database of information or a diverse range of subjects covered, making it suitable for individuals seeking to learn from a seemingly inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, the reviewer's statement, \\"I like it,\\" highlights that they find the app enjoyable and engaging.

(CNN) -- The threatening calls reportedly came one after the other to Mexico's main Catholic seminary. Callers, claiming to be from one of the country's feared drug cartels, offered an ominous warning: Pay up if you value the safety of your priests. \\"They called several times. They identified themselves as the Familia Michoacana, but who knows?\\" Cardinal Norberto Rivera, archbishop of Mexico City, revealed at a Mass this week. \\"I spoke with the authorities. We made the appropriate report. Because they wanted us to pay. Because if not, they would kill one of us. They wanted to extort 60,000 pesos (4,600).\\" Reports of extortion have become increasingly common as drug cartels expand their reach in Mexico. But public denouncements of such attempts are rare. Rivera called on parishioners to report extortion to authorities, and he urged them not to pay. His description Sunday of the extortion attempts and a statement denouncing drug violence give a glimpse into the problems faced by a Catholic Church often caught in the crossfire of warring cartels and government efforts to stop them. In the country's capital alone, more than 10 priests have been threatened with extortion, said the Reverend Hugo Valdemar Romero, a spokesman for the archdiocese. \\"None of them have paid,\\" he told CNN. \\"Last year, two extortionists were arrested.\\" It's not uncommon for individual parishes to face extortion threats, he said.

Russia had already sent 177,000 soldiers to Manchuria, nominally to protect its railways under construction. The troops of the Qing Empire and the participants of the Boxer Rebellion could do nothing against such a massive army and were ejected from Manchuria. After the Boxer Rebellion, 100,000 Russian soldiers were stationed in Manchuria.

Woodworking typically involves processes such as cutting, shaping, or assembling wooden materials to create furniture, cabinetry, or other items. The question presented asks us to conclude whether \\"The man is fixing a plumbing issue.\\" Given the information provided, we are not able to make this determination. A plumbing issue would involve problems with water supply, drainage systems, or fixtures such as pipes, taps, or other plumbing apparatus. These tasks would likely be undertaken by a plumber or someone with expertise in fixing such problems, rather than a woodworking professional. Furthermore, the location of the man, a wood shop, does not suggest that he is currently dealing with a plumbing issue. A wood shop typically entails an environment dedicated to woodworking tasks, and it is unlikely that fixing a plumbing issue would be a priority in such a place. Considering the information available, the appropriate answer is: --no.

OPT: 1. yes 2. it is not possible to tell 3. no","completion":"Option 2: It is not possible to tell The initial sentence \\"A person carrying a child piggyback style on a beach chasing a frisbee rolling toward the water.\\" does not provide information that allows us to definitively say whether the child is reaching out to catch the frisbee. In the original statement, we learn that there is a person carrying a child on their back, known as piggyback style, on a beach. The only actions attributed to them in the statement are that they are chasing a frisbee that’s rolling toward the water. While it's reasonable to guess that the child would reach out to try and catch the frisbee, it is not guaranteed. The child might be too scared to reach out, they might not be interested in the frisbee, or they might not have the physical capability to catch the frisbee due to their position on the adult's back. Overall, the statement does not present sufficient data about the child's actions. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively answer whether the sentence \\"The child reaches out to catch the frisbee.\\" is accurate. Any answer beyond this would be speculation.

Context: As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes.

Title: Keep it in the store Review: Santa brought my daughter the Runway Disco, and after much fumbling and putting the same piece together ten times I found it unworthy of the high cost. The plastic is cheap and the pieces do not stay together. It is not worth one tenth the cost of the item. Keep it in the store. MGA should re-evaluate this item. Is the review positive or negative?","completion":"The review provided is negative. The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with the Runway Disco toy that their daughter received as a Santa gift. Their main concerns revolve around the quality of the product and its high cost, which lead them to believe it is not a worthy purchase. The reviewer starts by sharing their personal experience with the toy, highlighting the difficulties they had in assembling the product. They mention that they had to put the same piece together ten times, suggesting that the process was frustrating, time-consuming, and likely complicated. This is an indication of poor design or unclear instructions and contributes to the overall negative impression of the toy. One of the major complaints in the review is the perceived poor quality of the materials used in the toy. Specifically, the reviewer feels that the plastic is cheap and the pieces do not stay together as they should. This further adds to the dissatisfaction, as buyers expect a product to be well-made and durable, particularly when it comes at a high cost. In terms of the toy’s value, the reviewer argues that it is not worth one-tenth of its cost, indicating that they find the price to be exorbitant in comparison to the actual quality and enjoyment provided by the toy. This is a strong critique, as it suggests that the product may potentially feel like a waste of money for other buyers considering the purchase. The review concludes with a stern recommendation for potential buyers to keep the product in the store, essentially advising against purchasing it. Additionally, the reviewer suggests that the manufacturer MGA should re-evaluate the item, which affirms the dissatisfaction with the toy and promotes the idea that it should be improved. In conclusion, the review is decidedly negative, as it showcases dissatisfaction with various aspects of the Runway Disco toy – its assembly process, overall quality and durability, and its price. The reviewer not only would not recommend the product but also calls for the manufacturer to take action and reassess the item's design and materials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: This game was a must-win for the Redskins in order to maintain their playoff hopes. During the first quarter, the Redskins appeared to be in the position to score after Fred Smoot intercepted Tarvaris Jackson and returned the interception deep into Viking territory. However, the Redskins' offense was unable to score a touchdown. Mike Sellers appeared to score a touchdown on 4th and goal, but a replay challenge by Brad Childress nullified the touchdown and gave the Vikings the ball. However, the Redskins immediately tackled Tony Richardson in the end zone for a safety. Following the subsequent free kick, the Redskins marched down the field and took a 9-0 lead on a 33-yard pass from Todd Collins to Chris Cooley. In the 2nd quarter, the Redskins expanded their lead to 16-0 on a 32-yard pass from Todd Collins to Santana Moss. Later in the quarter, the Redskins took a 22-0 lead when Clinton Portis took a handoff from Todd Collins and threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Antwaan Randle-El in the end zone. Although the Redskins were not successful on the 2-point conversion attempt, they had a commanding lead at this point in the game, and the previously rowdy Metrodome crowd was very disheartened and silent at this point. The Redskins stretched their lead to 25-0 on a 26-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham. Later in the quarter, the Vikings got the crowd back in the game when Tarvaris Jackson threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jim Kleinsasser, cutting the Redskins' lead to 25-7. The Vikings further cut into the Redskins' lead around the 10-minute mark of the fourth quarter when Tarvaris Jackson scored on a 6-yard run, making the lead 25-14. The Metrodome crowd began sensing a comeback as momentum appeared to turn in the Vikings' favor. This came to a head midway through the fourth quarter when the Redskins appeared to complete a long pass to Santana Moss. Though initially ruled a catch by a referee on the sideline, the call was considered questionable by the game's announcers since Moss had to drag his toes to stay in-bounds as he caught the pass. Sensing an impending challenge by Childress, the Redskins raced down the field to snap the ball&#8212;since a play cannot be challenged after the ball has been snapped for the next play. However, the snap was fumbled and it appeared to be Vikings' ball after it was recovered by Vikings' defensive tackle Kevin Williams. As the Vikings rushed onto the field to take over on offense, coach Joe Gibbs challenged that Minnesota had twelve defensive players on the field at the time the Redskins snapped the ball and fumbled it. After review, Gibbs' challenge was upheld and the call on the field was reversed&#8212;a five-yard penalty was assessed to the Vikings for having too many men on the field and the Redskins maintained possession. After the Redskins had retain possession of the football they had eventually scored on a 13-yard touchdown run by Clinton Portis, making the score 32-14 capping off a 75-yard drive. Although Tarvaris Jackson later scored on a 1-yard touchdown run to make the score 32-21, the Vikings were unable to score again, and the Redskins emerged with a victory.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. In case B, would the number of mesopredators be less or more than in case A? John was studying the species in Siberia. He found that the Siberian tiger is an apex predator. It had a pretty stable population during the sixteenth century. He noted that information as case A. Then with the introduction of guns the number of Siberian tigers decreased in the seventeenth century. He noted that information as case B. Hint: Apex predators can have profound effects on ecosystems, as the consequences of both controlling prey density and restricting smaller predators, and may be capable of self-regulation. They are central to the functioning of ecosystems, the regulation of disease, and the maintenance of biodiversity. When introduced to subarctic islands, for example, Arctic foxes' predation of seabirds has been shown to turn grassland into tundra. Such wide-ranging effects on lower levels of an ecosystem are termed trophic cascades. The removal of top-level predators, often through human agency, can cause or disrupt trophic cascades. For example, reduction in the population of sperm whales, apex predators with a fractional trophic level of 4.7, by hunting has caused an increase in the population of large squid, trophic level over 4 (carnivores that eat other carnivores).

Step 1: Understand the given information - Case A: Stable population of Siberian tigers (apex predator) in the sixteenth century - Case B: Decreased population of Siberian tigers in the seventeenth century due to the introduction of guns Step 2: Consider the hint provided and relate it to the cases - Apex predators have profound effects on ecosystems, including controlling prey density and restricting smaller predators - Removal of top-level predators can cause or disrupt trophic cascades and lead to mesopredator release Step 3: Apply the hint to the cases - In case A, the stable population of apex predators (Siberian tigers) would keep the number of mesopredators in check - In case B, the decreased population of apex predators (Siberian tigers) due to human intervention (guns) would lead to mesopredator release Step 4: Conclude - In case B, the number of mesopredators would be more than in case A due to the decreased population of Siberian tigers leading to mesopredator release."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The location of the Acra is important for understanding how events unfolded in Jerusalem during the struggle between Maccabean and Seleucid forces. This has been the subject of debate among modern scholars. The most detailed ancient description of the nature and location of the Acra is found in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, where it is described as residing in the Lower City, upon a hill overlooking the Temple enclosure: ...and when he had overthrown the city walls, he built a citadel [Greek: Acra] in the lower part of the city, for the place was high, and overlooked the temple; on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers, and put into it a garrison of Macedonians. However, in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the multitude, from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities. The location of the \\"lower part of the city\\", elsewhere referred to as the \\"Lower City\\", at the time of Josephus (1st century CE) is accepted to be Jerusalem's south-eastern hill, the original urban center traditionally known as the City of David. Lying to the south of the Temple Mount, however, the area exposed today is significantly lower than the Mount itself. The top of the Mount is approximately 30 metres (98 ft) above the ground level at the southern retaining wall of the later Herodian-era expansion of the Temple enclosure. The elevation decreases to the south of this point. Josephus, a native of Jerusalem, would have been well aware of this discrepancy, yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how Simon had razed both the Acra and the hill on which it had stood. Archaeological research south of the Temple Mount, however, has failed to locate any evidence for such large-scale quarrying. On the contrary, excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium BCE down to Roman times, casting doubt on the suggestion that during Hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would Martin not know that that was not the case? How would Martin or anyone else know his intentions based on his actions? On a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\", how closely does the first sentence resemble the second one?","completion":"In order to answer the question, a deeper understanding of the context is essential. However, I will try to provide a general overview of how Martin (or anyone) might not know something, and how it can be difficult to discern intentions based on actions. 1. How would Martin not know that that was not the case? There are several ways Martin might not be aware of a certain fact or situation. These reasons can be based on individual characteristics, external factors, or even the nature of the information itself. a. Lack of information or exposure: If Martin hasn't been exposed to the information required to know that something is not the case, he will remain unaware. This could be due to limited access to resources or the fact that no one has communicated the information to him. b. Misinterpretation or misunderstanding: Martin might have the relevant information but may have misunderstood or misinterpreted it, leading him to believe something different. c. Cognitive biases: People are subject to various cognitive biases that can affect their understanding or perception of a situation. Martin might be influenced by a bias that makes it difficult for him to recognize the truth of the matter. d. Willful ignorance: In some cases, people might actively choose not to know about a specific situation or topic. If Martin has some motivation to avoid certain information, he might remain intentionally uninformed. 2. How would Martin or anyone else know his intentions based on his actions? Understanding someone's intentions based on their actions can be challenging, as actions often don't convey the full depth of an individual's thoughts, feelings, or motivations. Here are some factors that can contribute to this complexity: a. Multiple interpretations: One action can often be interpreted in various ways, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact motivation behind the behavior. b. Unconscious motivations: People may sometimes act without being fully aware of their intentions, making it challenging for both themselves and others to determine the true driving force behind their actions. c. Disguised intentions: In some instances, individuals may intentionally hide their true intentions, acting in a way that is purposefully misleading. d. Cultural differences: People from different cultural backgrounds might interpret actions differently based on their unique cultural norms, making it challenging to understand someone's intentions universally. 3. On a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\", how closely does the first sentence resemble the second one? After a careful analysis of both sentences, I would rate their similarity at around 2. While both sentences focus on the theme of uncertainty and understanding, they delve into distinct aspects of these concepts. The first sentence concerns Martin's lack of knowledge about a specific situation or fact, whereas the second one tackles the question of understanding intentions based on actions. While these ideas are somewhat related, they do not convey the same meaning, hence the rating of 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Australia's Northern Territory became the first legal authority in the world to perform euthanasia --that's to say, doctors are permitted to take the lives of incurably ill patients who wish to die. Word that the law was passed by the vote of 15 to 10 immediately flashed on the Internet and was picked up by John, the director of the Right to Die Society of Canada, who posted it on the group's homepage online, saying, \\"This isn't merely something that happened in Australia. It's world history.\\" The NT Rights of the Terminally Ill Law has left physicians and citizens trying to deal with its moral and practical influence. Some have breathed sighs of relief; but others, including churches, right to life groups and the Australian Medical Association, bitterly attacked the law. But the tide is unlikely to turn back. In Australia--where an aging population, life-extending technology and changing community attitudes have all played their part--other states are going to consider making a similar law. In the U. S. and Canada, where the right to die movement is gathering strength, _ . Under the new Northern Territory law, an adult patient can request death--probably by a deadly injection or pill--to end suffering. The patient must be diagnosed as incurably ill by two doctors. After a \\"cooling off\\" period of seven days, the patient can sign a certificate of request. After 48 hours the wish for death can be met. For Lloyd, a 54-year-old Darwin resident suffering from lung cancer, the NT Rights of Terminally Ill Law means he can get on with living without the disturbing fear of his suffering: a terrifying death from his breathing condition. \\"I' m not afraid of dying from a spiritual point of view, but what I was afraid of was how I'd go, because I've watched people die in the hospital fighting for oxygen and clawing at their masks,\\" he says. Question: According to the text, which of the following statements is TURE? - Patients will ask their doctors for euthanasia if they are afraid of illness. - Australia, Canada and the US speak highly of the law of euthanasia. - All people in Australia don't share the positive attitude to euthanasia - If a patient requests death, he should sign a certificate after 48 hours.

Title: Frost/Nixon Movie plot: After the Watergate scandal of 1972 and his subsequent resignation in 1974, 400 million worldwide watch Nixon leave the White House. Among them is British journalist David Frost, currently recording a talk show in Australia, who decides to interview Nixon. Nixonâs literary agent, Irving \\"Swifty\\" Lazar, believes the interview would be an opportunity for Nixon to salvage his reputation, and to make some money. Nixon ultimately demands 600,000, and Frost accepts. After persuading his friend and producer John Birt that the interviews would be a success, Frost and Birt travel to California to meet with Nixon. On the plane to California, Frost flirts with a young woman called Caroline Cushing, and they begin a relationship. Frost struggles to sell the interviews to U.S. networks, and decides to finance the project with private money and syndicate the broadcast of the interviews. He hires two investigators â Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr. â to help him prepare, along with Birt. Frost is not clear on what he wants from the interview, and Reston encourages him to aim for a confession from Nixon. Under the watchful eye of Nixon's post-presidential chief of staff, Jack Brennan, Frost and Nixon embark on the first three recording sessions. Restricted by an agreed-upon timeframe and under pressure from his own team to ask the tough questions, Frost struggles to get a word in as Nixon dominates with lengthy and self-serving monologues, fencing ably on Vietnam and boasting about his achievements in foreign policy. Behind the scenes, Frost's editorial team is nervous about his interviewing technique, and angry that Nixon appears to be exonerating himself. Four days before the final session, which will center on Watergate, Frost receives a phonecall from an inebriated Nixon. In a drunken rant, Nixon declares that they both know the final interview will make or break their careers, and compares himself to Frost, insisting that they both came from humble backgrounds and had to battle the elite to make it to the top of...

The film also has comedic elements, including repeatedly frustrated attempts by the newlywed couple to find a moment alone with each other. The story begins when Peter is sent to Manhattan to retrieve his playboy cousin Keith (Ellison) and immediately falls in love with Francey. After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn).

Given the question: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"In order to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, it's essential to examine the logical connection or implication shared between the two statements. The premise is: \\"I want you to take a moment to look at this pie chart.\\" This statement implies that the speaker is requesting the listener to direct their attention towards a specific pie chart and spend a brief moment analyzing it. The premise establishes the context for an ensuing discussion or inquiry, as it creates the expectation that the listener will engage with the pie chart's visual representation of data. This is evident through the use of words such as \\"take a moment\\" and \\"look,\\" which denote attention, contemplation, and focus. On the other hand, the hypothesis is: \\"Quit looking at that pie chart.\\" The hypothesis proposes an instruction to disengage or stop paying attention to the pie chart. The directive \\"quit looking\\" signifies an abrupt cessation of the action of \\"looking,\\" implying that there is a contrasting situation at hand—a situation where the listener was previously engaged with the chart but is now asked to discontinue that engagement. Upon comparing the two statements, it becomes apparent that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. While the premise encourages the listener to focus on the pie chart, the hypothesis suggests the listener should disengage from it. These two instructions are contradictory, meaning that they cannot both be valid within the same context. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"Quit looking at that pie chart\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"I want you to take a moment to look at this pie chart\\" because the actions suggested in the two statements are contradictory and cannot logically coexist in the same context. The lack of logical connection or implication between the two statements means that the hypothesis does not follow from the premise."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms.

Should you see this film? YES It is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of Asian cinema. The shocking moments are there to illustrate what goers on in the world of these characters. If you like this make sure you catch Dead or Alive which is very similar (barring the insane ending in DOA of course). Great for Japan that they have a talent like Miike working at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. The best chance of seeing this film outside a Takashi Miike retrospective at a film festival is on DVD.

A study in 2007 by Mark Long, an economics professor at the University of Washington, demonstrated that the alternatives of affirmative action proved ineffective in restoring minority enrollment in public flagship universities in California, Texas, and Washington. More specifically, apparent rebounds of minority enrollment can be explained by increasing minority enrollment in high schools of those states, and the beneficiaries of class-based (not race) affirmative action would be white students. At the same time, affirmative action itself is both morally and materially costly: 52 percent of white populace (compared to 14 percent of black) thought it should be abolished, implying white distaste of using racial identity, and full-file review is expected to cost the universities an additional 1.5 million to 2 million per year, excluding possible cost of litigation.

He's dedicated to his job and rarely takes any time off for personal enjoyment. Mike's best friend, Trent, is a fun-loving, charismatic individual who believes that life should be a non-stop party. Trent feels that Mike needs to loosen up and enjoy life more. As the birthday gift, Trent plans the ultimate Vegas trip for them both. One day, Mike returns home to find Trent waiting for him with two tickets in hand. He talks Mike into taking an impromptu weekend trip to Las Vegas, selling it as a once-in-a-lifetime adventure that could completely change their lives. Mike hesitantly agrees and packs his bags. Act 2 Upon arriving in Vegas, Mike and Trent dive headfirst into the wild nightlife, with Trent leading Mike through a series of extravagant, luxurious parties. Intrigued and drawn in by the electrifying atmosphere of the city, Mike starts to let go of his rigid, driven nature and embraces an entirely new side of himself. During their adventures, Mike meets and falls for a captivating and fascinating local artist named Lily. Meanwhile, Trent, known for his insatiable gambling adrenaline, takes Mike on a lucky streak in the casinos where they win big. Slowly, Mike starts to realize that there is more to life than just work and finds himself embracing the carefree attitude that Trent has always espoused. Act 3 As their trip comes to an end, Mike and Trent prepare to return to Los Angeles. But a sudden twist of fate changes everything: Trent loses all their winnings in one last ill-advised bet. Mike starts to question Trent's excessively relaxed approach to life, realizing that maybe he's been irresponsible as well. The duo must now find a way to get back to Los Angeles, brokered and stranded in Las Vegas. As they hustle and rely on each other through a series of comical misadventures, they learn valuable life lessons about the balance between responsibility and letting loose. In the end, Mike and Trent manage to get back home, thanks to their newfound resourcefulness and a little help from kind-hearted Lily. As they recover from their wild trip, both friends genuinely appreciate the life-changing experience and vow to find a better balance in their daily lives. Back in Los Angeles, Mike begins dating Lily, both embracing his work and enjoying life more fully with a newfound sense of balance. Trent, while still the life of the party, becomes more mindful of his actions and chooses to give in to his reckless impulses more sparingly. \\"Vegas, Baby!\\" is a journey where two best friends learn to balance the extremes of their outlooks on life, while discovering the value of cherishing the simple pleasures and joys that friendship and love can bring."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After removing the torte from the freezer, spread the whipping cream mixture all of the top using a loaf pan.; (B). After removing the torte from the freezer, spread the whipping cream mixture all of the top using an offset spatula.;","completion":"Option B is the correct choice for spreading frosting on a creamy chocolate toffee torte. To spread frosting on a creamy chocolate toffee torte, you should follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Prepare all necessary ingredients: Ensure that you have prepared the chocolate toffee torte, the frosting (typically a whipped cream or buttercream), and any additional toppings (such as crumbled toffee bits, chocolate shavings, or chopped nuts) as per your recipe. 2. Freeze the torte: To help prevent the torte from becoming too soft or falling apart during decoration, most recipes will require you to freeze the torte for at least one hour or until it has firmed up. 3. Collect your tools: For this task, you will need an offset spatula (option B) and a cake stand or a serving platter. An offset spatula is a versatile tool that is ideal for frosting cakes due to its angled handle, allowing better control and precision when spreading the frosting. 4. Place the torte on a cake stand or serving platter: Carefully transfer the frozen torte from the freezer to the cake stand or platter. This will make it easier for you to apply the frosting and create a visually appealing presentation. 5. Apply a crumb coat: If your torte has loose crumbs on the surface, you can apply a thin layer of frosting (known as a crumb coat) to the entire cake. This layer will trap any crumbs and set a smooth base for the final frosting. After applying this layer, chill the torte in the refrigerator for about 15-30 minutes. 6. Spread the frosting: After removing the torte from the refrigerator (or freezer if not applying a crumb coat), place a dollop of the whipping cream mixture onto the center of the torte. Using the offset spatula, spread the frosting evenly across the top of the torte, working from the center outwards in smooth, sweeping motions. As you frost the cake, rotate the turntable (if using one) or the cake stand to access all angles. 7. Frost the sides: To frost the sides of the torte, scoop a generous amount of the remaining frosting onto the offset spatula, and gently spread it around the torte's sides using smooth, even strokes. Ensure that the frosting is uniformly spread, from top to bottom. 8. Smooth the surface: Once the torte is completely covered in frosting, use the offset spatula to go over the top and sides again, smoothing any ridges or imperfections. This will give you a polished, professional appearance. 9. Add additional toppings: If desired, sprinkle crumbled toffee bits, chocolate shavings, or chopped nuts over the top of the torte to enhance the overall appearance and taste. You can also add designs with a piping bag for a more elaborate presentation. 10. Allow the torte to set: To ensure that the frosting adheres properly and sets firmly, return the cake to the refrigerator for at least 30-60 minutes, or until the frosting is firm to the touch. Once this process is complete, your delicious creamy chocolate toffee torte, beautifully frosted using an offset spatula (option B), will be ready to serve and enjoy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered, but 1969's \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time. Directed by John Schlesinger and written by Waldo Salt, the movie seems to be a product of its time, the late 1960's when American films were especially expressionistic, but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period. The film's cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in Ang Lee's \\"Brokeback Mountain\\". The meandering plot follows Joe Buck, a naive, young Texan who decides to move to Manhattan to become a stud-for-hire for rich women. Full of energy but lacking any savvy, he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances. He meets a cynical, sickly petty thief named \\"Ratso\\" Rizzo, who first sees Joe as an easy pawn. The two become dependent on one another, and Rizzo begins to manage Joe. Things come to a head at a psychedelic, drug-infested party where Joe finally lands a paying client. Meanwhile, Rizzo becomes sicker, and the two set off for Florida to seek a better life. This is not a story that will appeal to everyone, in fact, some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures, yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic. In his first major role, Jon Voight is ideally cast as he brings out Joe's paper-thin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities. As Rizzo, Dustin Hoffman successfully upends his clean, post-college image from \\"The Graduate\\" and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to Joe. The honesty of their portrayals is complemented by Schlesinger's film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the Times Square district at the time. The director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the character's fragile psyches. Credit also needs to go to Salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story. The other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters, including Brenda Vaccaro as the woman Joe meets at the party, Sylvia Miles as a blowsy matron, John McGiver as a religious zealot and Barnard Hughes as a lonely out-of-towner. The two-disc 2006 DVD package contains a pristine print transfer of the 1994 restoration and informative commentary from producer Jerome Hellman since unfortunately neither Schlesinger nor Salt are still living. There are three terrific featurettes on the second disc - a look-back documentary, \\"After Midnight: Reflections on a Classic 35 Years Later\\", which features comments from Hellman, Hoffman, Voight and others, as well as clips and related archive footage such as Voight's screen test; \\"Controversy and Acclaim\\", which examines the genesis of the movie's initial 'X' rating and public response to the film; and a tribute to the director, \\"Celebrating Schlesinger\\".

Paragraph: The Bush administration did not develop new diplomatic initiatives on al Qaeda with the Saudi government before 9/11. Vice President Cheney called Crown Prince Abdullah on July 5, 2001, to seek Saudi help in preventing threatened attacks on American facilities in the Kingdom. Secretary of State Powell met with the crown prince twice before 9/11. They discussed topics like Iraq, not al Qaeda.U.S.-Saudi relations in the summer of 2001 were marked by sometimes heated disagreements about ongoing Israeli- Palestinian violence, not about Bin Laden. The confirmation of the Pentagon's new leadership was a lengthy process. Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz was confirmed in March 2001 and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith in July. Though the new officials were briefed about terrorism and some of the earlier planning, including that for Operation Infinite Resolve, they were focused, as Secretary Rumsfeld told us, on creating a twenty-first-century military. At the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton did not recall much interest by the new administration in military options against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He could not recall any specific guidance on the topic from the secretary. Brian Sheridan-the outgoing assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict (SOLIC), the key counterterrorism policy office in the Pentagon-never briefed Rumsfeld. He departed on January 20; he had not been replaced by 9/11. Rumsfeld noted to us his own interest in terrorism, which came up often in his regular meetings with Tenet. He thought that the Defense Department, before 9/11, was not organized adequately or prepared to deal with new threats like terrorism. But his time was consumed with getting new officials in place and working on the foundation documents of a new defense policy, the quadrennial defense review, the defense planning guidance, and the existing contingency plans. He did not recall any particular counterterrorism issue that engaged his attention before 9/11, other than the development of the Predator unmanned aircraft system. The commander of Central Command, General Franks, told us that he did not regard the existing plans as serious. To him a real military plan to address al Qaeda would need to go all the way, following through the details of a full campaign (including the political-military issues of where operations would be based) and securing the rights to fly over neighboring countries. The draft presidential directive circulated in June 2001 began its discussion of the military by reiterating the Defense Department's lead role in protecting its forces abroad. Question: \\"What position was vacant from January 2001 and had not been replaced before 9/11?\\" Answer: \\"Commander\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"No, the answer is incorrect.

Article: Electricity, like clean water, is a resource that's often taken for granted. But last summer, when blackouts struck much of the northeastern US, Ontario and Rome, consumers on two continents were given a painful reminder of just how easily broken electricity supplies can be. The massive disorder stranded commuters, stopped freezers, shut down businesses and refocused attention on where most of the planet's power comes from:oil-and-gas-fired generators and nuclear plants, These sources not only pollute the environment but also make many consumers feel unacceptable health risks. Companies are trying to offer an alternative, clean energy from renewable resources that's plentiful and portable. Lifton's Medis Technologies, as well as companies like Hydrogenics and Nanosys, is tapping into fuel cells and dolor panels to give people power whenever and wherever they want it, free from dependence on local grids . The search for alternative energy is nothing new, but the current trend of innovators is focusing on the goal of making clean and sustainable power a mainstream commodity. For example, the fuel cell, which produces electricity from the chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen, has been around for about 150 years, though its commercial development did not begin until the 1960s and then only as part of NASA spacecraft. Today this technology is coming down to Earth in places like Tokyo; in nine European cities, from Stockholm to Porto, each operating three hydrogen-fuel-cell buses; and in Iceland, which is trying to create the first fuel free hydrogen economy by 2030. When hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine, the reaction produces heat and water. Fuel cells use this reaction to generate electricity. With the cell phone and gadget market in mind, Medis has developed a fuel cell with cheap components that produces little heat and effortlessly reduces waste water without turning to energy consuming pumps. Question: Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage? - Lifton's Medis Technologies is tapping into fuel cells and solar panels. - The fuel cell has been around for about 150 years. - The fuel cell's commercial development did not begin until the 1960s. - When hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine, the reaction produces o2 and H2O.

(CNN) -- If this is an indication of what Roger Federer will do at Wimbledon, his opponents had better watch out. Federer recorded the second double bagel of his career when he defeated wildcard Mischa Zverev 6-0 6-0 on Friday to reach the semifinals of a Wimbledon warm-up in Halle, Germany. The only other time Federer didn't drop a game in a match was at the year-end championships in 2005 against clay-court specialist Gaston Gaudio. \\"You never go to court aiming for such a score,\\" Federer, who turns 32 in August, told reporters. \\"I'm surprised to have managed it today.\\" At Wimbledon, which begins on June 24, Federer will be bidding to advance to a first grand slam final since claiming a seventh title on the","completion":"London grass in 2012. The Swiss maestro, ranked No. 3 in the world, has been showing glimpses of his vintage best in recent months, winning titles in Dubai and Miami, and reaching the semifinals in Indian Wells and Madrid. As the championships draw closer, expectations are high for Federer to bring his A-game to the All England Club. This scintillating performance at Halle, where he has already won the Gerry Weber Open a record nine times, could be just the confidence boost he needs to perform exceptionally well on his favorite surface, grass. Federer's early exit at the French Open this year raised a few questions about his ability to challenge for major titles at 32. However, this win over Zverev proves that he cannot be written off just yet. Moving into the Wimbledon fortnight, Federer's main challengers are likely to be his arch rivals, world No. 1 Novak Djokovic and 12-time French Open winner Rafael Nadal. Djokovic recently defeated Federer in the thrilling final of the Australian Open, while Nadal triumphed on his favorite surface at Roland Garros. However, Andy Murray, a two-time Wimbledon champion, and rising stars like Alexander Zverev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, can't be ignored. These young talents have shown great promise and could pose a significant threat to the veterans of the game. Federer's fans will be eagerly looking forward to another potential classic between the Swiss legend and the top players in the game. The ultimate dream showdown would be a repeat of the epic 2008 Wimbledon final between Federer and Nadal, often regarded as one of the greatest matches of all time. In order to achieve this dream final, Federer will have to navigate his way through the typically star-studded Wimbledon draw and overcome formidable opponents during the two-week championship. Regardless of the outcome at Wimbledon, Federer's unrivaled career, which includes a record 20 Grand Slam titles, has already secured his place in tennis history. His incredible consistency over two decades and unmatched longevity make him one of the most iconic figures in the world of sports. It remains to be seen whether Federer can defy time once again and lift the coveted trophy at Wimbledon, or if a new champion will step up and claim the throne. But one thing is clear - this year's Wimbledon Championships promise to be a thrilling and unforgettable event for tennis fans around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Researchers excavate a Neanderthal dwelling site called El Salt in southeastern Spain. (Photo: Courtesy of Ainara Sistiaga) Maybe archaeologists should watch where they step. Researchers have stumbled across what may be the world's oldest human poop, deposited by Neanderthals about 50,000 years ago atop an ancient campfire in Spain. If the discovery is truly a prehistoric latrine – a claim that has provoked skepticism among other researchers – it contradicts the pop-culture image of Neanderthals as hunters who subsisted on hunks of flesh. Two of the new poop samples contain the chemical footprints of both meat and plant consumption, providing the earliest known evidence that humans were omnivores who ate significant quantities of plant-based food. To the uneducated eye, the newfound Pleistocene poop doesn't look like poop except for its light-brown color, and the scientists who found it weren't looking for coprolites – preserved dung – at all. They were poking around rudimentary hearths at the Neanderthal site known as El Salt, hoping to find evidence of food preparation. \\"I thought they were cooking in there, so I was looking for lipids from cooking,\\" says Ainara Sistiaga of Spain's University of La Laguna, one of the scientists reporting the new discovery in Wednesday's PLOS ONE. Instead, analysis revealed traces of an activity that doesn't usually take place atop a blazing fire, but \\"I don't think they were using (the site as a toilet) when the fire was active.\\" Closeup of what the scientists say is a miniature sample of Neanderthal poop. (Photo: Courtesy of Carolina Mallol) The poop samples come from rock layers dated to roughly 50,000 years ago. That's far older than other ancient wastes, such as those found at Turkey's Catalhöyük, one of the world's earliest large villages, dating back 6,000 to 7,000 years, and what might be 14,000-year-old human coprolites at a cave in Oregon. Three of the five Neanderthal samples contained high levels of compounds created by the breakdown of cholesterol, which is found in animal foods. But two additional samples contained those same compounds as well as those produced by the breakdown of molecules found in plant-based foods. The ratio of the different compounds points to a human origin, the researchers say. The researchers haven't calculated the percentage of vegetable matter in these ancient dinners, but Sistiaga speculates that they could have been up to 25% plant-based. Previous studies have shown that Neanderthals ate deer and horse as well as roots, tubers and fruit. Other researchers call the new study intriguing but far from airtight. The compounds measured by Sistiaga and her colleagues have probably degraded over time, making them unreliable as indicators of human feces, says Michael Richards of the University of British Columbia. The study does not rule out bears, which are also omnivorous, as the source of the coprolites, says Hervé Bocherens of the University of Tübingen in Germany. The new method described in the paper is \\"very exciting,\\" says Amanda Henry of Germany's Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. But \\"they have not managed to convince me yet that the coprolite they're looking at is actually human.\\" Sistiaga responds that as far as she knows, bears don't produce the same chemical from cholesterol that humans do. She also says degradation would not affect her results and that prehistoric poop may not be all that rare. \\"No one has been looking for it,\\" she says. \\"It's not because it's not there.\\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1v6Wz7n ||||| Bones can only tell us so much. Experts often assume or make educated guesses to fill in the gaps in mankind's family tree, and to develop a sense what our ancestors may have looked like. Judging from skull and mandible fragments found in a cave in Israel in 1969, this young female Homo sapien lived between 100,000 and 90,000 years ago. Her bones indicate she was about 20 years old. Her shattered skull was found among the remains of 20 others in a shallow grave. The skull and jaw of this female \\"hobbit\\" was found in Liang Bua, Flores, Indonesia, in 2003. She was about 1 meter tall (about 3'3\\") and lived about 18,000 years ago. The discovery of her species, Homo floresiensis, brought into question the belief that Homo sapiens was the only form of mankind for the past 30,000 years. Scientists are still debating whether Homo floresiensis was its own species, or merely a group of diseased modern humans. Evidence is mounting that these small beings were, in fact, a distinct human species. The \\"Old Man of La Chapelle\\" was recreated from the skull and jaw of a Homo neanderthalensis male found near La Chapelle-aux-Saints, in France in 1908. He lived 56,000 years ago. His relatively old age, thought to be between 40 to 50 years old, indicates he was well looked after by a clan. The old man's skeleton indicates he suffered from a number of afflictions, including arthritis, and had numerous broken bones. Scientists at first did not realize the age and afflicted state of this specimen when he was first discovered. This led them to incorrectly theorize that male Neanderthals were hunched over when they walked. This adult male, Homo heidelbergensis, was discovered in in Sima de los Huesos, Spain in 1993. Judging by the skull and cranium, scientists believe he probably died from a massive infection that caused a facial deformation. The model, shown here, does not include the deformity. This species is believed to be an ancestor of Neanderthals, as seen in the shape of his face. \\"Miquelon,\\" the nickname of \\"Atapuerca 5\\", lived about 500,000 to 350,000 years ago and fossils of this species have been found in Italy, France and Greece. The almost perfectly preserved skeleton of the \\"Turkana Boy\\" is one of the most spectacular discoveries in paleoanthropology. Judging from his anatomy, scientists believe this Homo ergaster was a tall youth about 13 to 15 years old. According to research, the boy died beside a shallow river delta, where he was covered by alluvial sediments. Comparing the shape of the skull and teeth, H. ergaster had a similiar head structure to the Asian Homo erectus. This model of a sub-human species -- Homo rudolfensis -- was made from bone fragments found in Koobi Fora, Kenya, in 1972. The adult male is believed to have lived about 1.8 million years ago. He used stone tools and ate meat and plants. H. Rudolfensis' distinctive features include a flatter, broader face and broader postcanine teeth, with more complex crowns and roots. He is also recognized as having a larger cranium than his contemporaries. Researchers shaped this skull of \\"Zinj,\\" found in 1959. The adult male lived 1.8 million years ago in the Olduvai Gorge of Tanzania. His scientific name is Paranthropus boisei, though he was originally called Zinjanthropus boisei -- hence the nickname. First discovered by anthropologist Mary Leakey, the well-preserved cranium has a small brain cavity. He would have eaten seeds, plants and roots which he probably dug with sticks or bones. The skull of this male adult was found on the western shore of Lake Turkana in Kenya in 1985. The shape of the mouth indicates that he had a strong bite and could chew plants. He is believed to have lived in 2.5 million years ago and is classified as Paranthropus aethiopicus. Much is still unknown about this species because so few reamins of P. aethiopicus have been found. Meet \\"Mrs. Ples,\\" the popular nickname for the most complete skull of an Australopithecus africanus, unearthed in Sterkfontein, South Africa in 1947. It is believed she lived 2.5 million years ago (although the sex of the fossil is not entirely certain). Crystals found on her skull suggest that she died after falling into a chalk pit, which was later filled with sediment. A. africanus has long puzzled scientists because of its massive jaws and teeth, but they now believe the species' skull design was optimal for cracking nuts and seeds. With each new discovery, paleoanthropologists have to rewrite the origins of man's ancestors, adding on new branches and tracking when species split. This model was fashioned from pieces of a skull and jaw found among the remains of 17 pre-humans (nine adults, three adolescents and five children) which were discovered in the Afar Region of Ethiopia in 1975. The ape-man species, Australopithecus afarensis, is believed to have lived 3.2 million years ago. Several more bones from this species have been found in Ethiopia, including the famed \\"Lucy,\\" a nearly complete A. afarensis skeleton found in Hadar. To put a human face on our ancestors, scientists from the Senckenberg Research Institute used sophisticated methods to form 27 model heads based on tiny bone fragments, teeth and skulls collected from across the globe. The heads are on display for the first time together at the Senckenberg Natural History Museum in Frankfurt, Germany. This model is Sahelanthropus tchadensis, also nicknamed \\"Toumai,\\" who lived 6.8 million years ago. Parts of its jaw bone and teeth were found nine years ago in the Djurab desert in Chad. It's one of the oldest hominid specimens ever found. Neanderthals in Spain weren't just meat eaters, suggests the first direct evidence of their omnivorous diet. An analysis of 50,000-year-old feces -- likely the oldest known human poop -- suggest they ate tubers, berries and nuts as well as meat. Researchers from MIT and the University of La Laguna say we've probably overemphasized the role of meat in the Neanderthal diet based on traces of plant matter found in samples from a site in El Salt, Spain. Previous research showed what sorts of prey Neanderthals consumed -- pigs vs. cows, for example -- and depicted Neanderthals as exclusively carnivorous. Later studies found plant remains in the teeth of Neanderthals, but that might also be misleading. \\"Sometimes in prehistoric societies, they used their teeth as tools, biting plants, among other things,\\" said Ainara Sistiaga, a graduate student at the University of La Laguna who led the study as a visiting student at MIT, in a statement. \\"We can't assume they were actually eating the plants based on finding microfossils in their teeth.\\" So the researchers decided to take a more direct approach. \\"This study represents the first approach to Neanderthal diet through the analysis of fecal markers\\" found in soil, Sistiaga said. The research shows Neanderthals ate meat as their primary food source, but the discovery of a compound from plant sources called 5β-stigmastanol shows that plants added variety to their diet that was previously unproven. Every sample studied showed signs of meat consumption, and some samples showed signs of plant matter. \\"It's important to understand all aspects of why humanity has come to dominate the planet the way it does,\\" said co-author Roger Summons, a professor of geobiology at MIT. \\"A lot of that has to do with improved nutrition over time.\\" Photo: iStock ||||| Summary:","completion":"Researchers have discovered 50,000-year-old feces, likely the oldest known human poop, which provides the earliest known evidence that Neanderthals were omnivores who consumed both meat and plant-based foods.

De Blasio rules out canceling J'Ouvert amid calls for its end Mayor de Blasio ruled out cancelling the predawn festival on Tuesday, a day after two people were killed by errant bullets during the Brooklyn event. It appeared on Monday that nixing the violence-marred street event was a possibility when Hizzoner said “all options are on the table.” Pols say N.Y.'s tough laws can't stop guns from entering state “J’Ouvert will continue. It’s an event that’s very important to the community,” de Blasio said. “We were not including the option of ending something that has gone on for decades.” A handful of other elected officials disagreed, saying J’Ouvert — which floods streets in Crown Heights and Flatbush — needed to be suspended or significantly restricted. The deaths of Tyreke Borel, 17, and Tiarah Poyau, 22, at J’Ouvert came despite a massive deployment of cops designed to prevent bloodshed. The fatal shootings at J’Ouvert came nearly a year after Carey Gabay, 43, an aide to Gov. Cuomo, was shot and killed in a gang crossfire during the same event. Four shot, two fatally, in J’Ouvert parade violence “It is with a heavy heart that I call on a suspension of the J’Ouvert celebration,” said Assemblyman Walter Mosley (D-Brooklyn) whose district includes Prospect Heights and parts of Crown Heights.

NYPD safety upgrades fail to prevent J’Ouvert shooting “The only way you could cancel J’Ouvert and all those different elements is if you placed a curfew on people and enforced it with the Police Department, martial law, or the National Guard,” Councilwoman Laurie Cumbo (D-Brooklyn) said.

Translate to English.","completion":"Alyssonlago: I had always wondered how American gymnastics is to receive basketball and hockey games. Translation: Alyssonlago is expressing curiosity about how gymnastics in the United States is connected or related to basketball and hockey games. To answer this question, let's first look at American gymnastics, basketball, and hockey as separate sports and then discuss how they can intersect or be related to each other. American Gymnastics: Gymnastics is a sport that involves a variety of physical exercises and performances, where athletes test their strength, flexibility, balance, and control through a range of events. In the United States, gymnastics is a popular sport that is particularly known for its success in the Olympic Games. It is governed by USA Gymnastics, which is responsible for overseeing the selection and training of national teams and the organization of national and international competitions. Basketball and Hockey: Basketball and hockey are both team sports played in the United States and around the world. Basketball is played by two teams of five players each, with the objective of scoring points by shooting a ball through a hoop placed at each end of the court. It is governed by USA Basketball and the NBA. On the other hand, hockey is played on ice and involves two teams of six players (including a goaltender) trying to score goals by shooting a puck into the opposing team's net. It is governed by USA Hockey and the NHL. Connections between Gymnastics, Basketball, and Hockey: While gymnastics, basketball, and hockey appear to be quite distinct sports with different focuses and a unique set of skills required, there are some ways in which they can be connected or related to each other. 1. Athleticism: All three sports require a certain level of athleticism, including strength, flexibility, agility, and endurance. In addition, many athletes often engage in cross-training to improve their overall performance, and gymnastics can be a beneficial form of cross-training for both basketball and hockey players. Gymnastics training can help improve balance, flexibility, and body control, which can benefit athletes in other sports. 2. Sports facilities: Highly developed sports facilities can often accommodate different sports under one roof. For example, a large sports complex might include a gymnasium for gymnastics events and separate courts or rinks for basketball and hockey games. In this sense, gymnastics can share the same space as basketball and hockey matches when it comes to utilizing sports facilities. 3. Seasonal overlap: Although gymnastics, basketball, and hockey seasons may not align perfectly, they can have some overlap. For example, both basketball and gymnastics typically have competitive seasons during the winter months, which may coincide with hockey games. This seasonal overlap could lead to increased attendance at all three events, as sports enthusiasts look to enjoy various athletic competitions in the colder months. 4. Sponsorship and marketing: Sports, in general, rely on sponsorship and marketing to generate revenue and promote their respective organizations and athletes. Gymnastics, basketball, and hockey organizations might collaborate, partner, or share sponsors and marketing strategies to support and grow their respective disciplines. For example, a sports apparel company may sponsor athletes from all three sports and use them together in advertising campaigns. In conclusion, while American gymnastics, basketball, and hockey are distinct sports, they share common elements and opportunities for collaboration. These connections can include cross-training benefits, shared sports facilities, seasonal overlap, and joint marketing and sponsorship strategies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

'Hate Speech' is kind of a threating statement or sometimes include call for violence while 'offensive' statement just offensds someone. 'Neither' is when it doesn't fall into Hate Speech or Offensive category. Problem:&#8220;@DrMalvo: @woods_lamar http://t.co/ChNxcPLZWR&#8221; Hidey hidey hoe! White folk be all noyvous round coloreds Solution:","completion":"Upon analyzing the given tweet, it seems like the user is portraying a certain stereotype about racial groups. This can be seen where they mimic a statement involving \\"white folk\\" and \\"coloreds\\". Although the tweet is not issuing any direct threats or calling for violence, the racial comments could be seen as offensive by some. Therefore, it falls in the category of 'Offensive'. Step 1: Analyze the tweet for any explicit threats or calls for violence. I found none, hence it doesn't fall in the 'Hate Speech' category. Step 2: Examine the tweet for any offensive language or portrayal of stereotypes. The tweet uses the terms \\"white folk\\" and \\"coloreds\\", this could be seen as perpetuating racial stereotypes and might offend people who belong to those groups. Step 3: After analyzing the above steps, I concluded that it doesn't fall into 'Neither' category as it could be offensive to some individuals. Justification: Tweets or statements are usually categorized as offensive if they include disrespectful or insulting remarks, especially if these comments involve individuals or groups (based on race, religion, etc.). This tweet could potentially offend or insult some individuals due to its underlying racial undertone.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. perlite for high temperature applications in the steel and foundry industries Make this proper case.","completion":"Perlite is a versatile, naturally occurring siliceous volcanic rock that has found its way into numerous applications across various industries, including the high-temperature domains of steel and foundry industries. When subjected to heating at temperatures around 850-900 degrees Celsius, perlite expands into a lightweight, porous structure, a process known as exfoliation. This striking property of perlite has made it an invaluable resource in both the steel and foundry industries, which rely significantly on high-temperature applications. Here are some key advantages and uses of perlite in steel and foundry industries: 1. High-temperature insulation: Perlite has a low thermal conductivity, making it an excellent high-temperature insulator. Expanded perlite is often used to insulate industrial furnaces, ladles and other high-temperature containment vessels. The perlite's thermal efficiency helps in minimizing heat loss, reduces fuel consumption and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. 2. Low density: Expanded perlite, due to its porous structure, has a low bulk density, which, when used in insulating applications, helps in reducing the overall weight of the equipment or structure being insulated. This light weight can lead to reduced transportation and installation costs. 3. Fire resistance: Perlite's chemical composition makes it resistant to fire and high temperatures. Its melting point is higher than the temperatures typically encountered in most industrial processes. This fire resistance makes it an ideal candidate for use in steel and foundry industries where high-temperature operations are commonplace. 4. Refractory applications: Some perlite products are designed specifically for use in refractory applications. Perlite-based materials can be used in the production of refractory bricks, linings and other high-temperature-resistant structures. 5. Slag coagulant: In the steel-making process, perlite is often employed as a slag coagulant, which helps minimize the amount of slag carryover from the furnace to the ladle. The expanded perlite's porous nature and glassy structure cause it to adsorb and trap the liquid slag from the molten steel. The end result is a cleaner steel product and less need for post-processing treatments. 6. Foundry core and mold making: Due to its lightweight nature, low thermal conductivity, and ability to withstand high temperatures, perlite is commonly used as a core or mold material in the foundry industry. It can be mixed with binders to create intricately shaped molds or cores that maintain their strength and shape during the high-temperature casting process. The perlite also aids in the even distribution of heat, ensuring that castings cool uniformly, reducing the risk of defects and cracking. 7. Alloy and flux additive: Expanded perlite can be added into metallurgical fluxes for increased efficiency in the high-temperature smelting and refining processes. The fluxes and protective gases containing perlite aid in refining, deoxidizing and degassing the molten materials, ultimately improving the quality of the finished product. In conclusion, perlite has proven to be an invaluable resource in various high-temperature applications across the steel and foundry industries. Offering excellent thermal insulation, fire resistance and lightweight properties, perlite plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency, safety, and quality of high-temperature operations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to make a classic vinaigrette","completion":"To determine which solution is better for making a classic vinaigrette, we must first examine the steps involved in each solution. Solution 1: 1. Gather ingredients: extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, honey, salt, and pepper. 2. Measure the ingredients according to desired ratios: 3 parts oil, 1 part vinegar, a small spoon of Dijon mustard, a pinch of salt and pepper, and a drizzle of honey. 3. Combine the ingredients in a small glass or stainless-steel bowl. 4. Whisk the ingredients together until emulsified. 5. Taste and adjust the flavor as needed (e.g., adding more honey for sweetness or more salt and pepper for seasoning). Solution 2: 1. Gather ingredients: extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. 2. Measure the ingredients according to desired ratios: approximately 3 parts oil, 1 part vinegar, a small spoon of Dijon mustard, and a pinch of salt and pepper. 3. Combine the ingredients in a jar with a tight-fitting lid (e.g., mason jar). 4. Shake the jar vigorously until emulsified. 5. Taste and adjust the flavor as needed (e.g., adding more mustard for tanginess or more salt and pepper for seasoning). Comparison: Both solutions involve similar steps in terms of gathering and measuring ingredients, combining them, and adjusting the flavor as needed. However, there are differences in the techniques used for combining and emulsifying the ingredients (whisking vs. shaking), as well as your choice of honey in the first solution. Justification: Solution 1 might be better for those who prefer a sweeter vinaigrette, as it includes honey as one of the ingredients. Whisking the ingredients in a bowl allows for more control over the emulsification process, which may result in a smoother, more homogenous vinaigrette. Solution 2 might be more suited for those who prefer a tangier, more traditional vinaigrette, since it omits honey. Shaking the ingredients in a jar with a lid is a faster, more convenient way to emulsify the mixture without the need for a separate whisk and bowl. Overall, both solutions are viable for making a classic vinaigrette, but the choice between them depends on personal preference regarding flavor and technique."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They fly the Odyssey through the supergate to the Ori galaxy. Accompanying them are Marrick (Currie Graham), a representative of the IOA, the international body that oversees the Stargate program, and Tomin (Tim Guinee), a renegade commander of the Ori forces. Tomin, like Teal'c (Christopher Judge) in the early seasons of Stargate SG-1, is tormented by the wrongs he did for his evil masters. Teal'c pitilessly tells Tomin that Tomin will never forgive himself, but he must nevertheless work to help others.Working on a tip from the anti-Ori resistance, SG-1 beams down to the Ori planet Celestis to look for the ark, but Lt.

Validity of the claim: Assess whether the claim is based on genuine grounds and supported by evidence. The claim should be related to a breach of contract, tort, or other legitimate reasons. 2. Restitution: Determine if the purpose of the civil action is to recover damages or losses suffered by the claimant. The compensation should be proportionate to the harm or losses incurred. 3. Proportionality: Consider whether initiating a civil action is proportional to the harm suffered. If the harm done is minor and the costs associated with the legal process is significantly higher, it may not be reasonable to pursue the case. 4. Alternatives: Evaluate if alternatives to litigation, such as mediation, arbitration, or negotiation, can be used to settle the matter. If an amicable resolution can be reached without a trial, it may be fair to choose these methods over legal proceedings. 5. Anger and confusion: Avoid making decisions influenced by anger, frustration, or confusion. A rational assessment of the situation and potential outcomes is essential to determine if pursuing a civil action is fair. 6. Precedent: Consider if your case aligns with previous similar cases that were deemed fair to pursue. This can provide guidance on whether your civil action would be considered fair by the judicial system. Ultimately, determining the fairness of instituting a civil action requires a careful assessment of the specific circumstances and potential outcomes.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: With the development of society and economy, animals and their habitats are getting pushed aside as households decrease in size and increase in number. Small numbers of people per household on average use more energy and goods per person. Greater numbers of households require more natural resources for construction. The possible result of this problem may be _ natural resources to meet consumer demand without endangering habitats important to biodiversity. Personal freedom and social choice may come at huge environmental cost. Direct costs include visible damage to animal habitats and plant life. Indirect costs include the release of more greenhouse gases. The effects of such \\"personal freedom and social choice\\" have already surfaced in south-west China's Wolong Nature Reserve. In Wolong, they found that a reduced average household size was directly tied to an increase in homes, and thus an increase in the amount of firewood consumed for cooking and heating. The rise in wood fuel use has contributed to disappearance of forests and to the loss of habitats for giant pandas. Curious about whether other parts of the world were experiencing similar phenomena, they got the support of a team of researchers including Stanford's Paul Ehrlich, well-known for his population studies, to find out the household dynamics in 141 countries between 1985 and 2000. Their study proved that the difficult choice of Wolong is part of a global trend. In the 76 countries considered biodiversity \\"hotspots\\", such as the United States, Brazil, Australia, and Kenya, the number of households grew by 3.1% every year, while the population increased just 1.8%. Meanwhile, the number of people per home dropped from 4.7 to 4.0. The decline in household size has resulted in 155 million additional households in hotspot countries, almost always limiting biodiversity.

St Kilda (Scottish Gaelic: Hiort) is an isolated archipelago situated 64 kilometres (40 mi) west-northwest of North Uist, in the North Atlantic Ocean. It contains the westernmost islands of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The largest island is Hirta, whose sea cliffs are the highest in the United Kingdom. Three other islands (Dùn, Soay and Boreray) were also used for grazing and seabird hunting. The islands are administratively a part of the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar local authority area.The origin of the name St Kilda is a matter of conjecture. The islands' human heritage includes numerous unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods, although the earliest written records of island life date from the Late Middle Ages. The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century, but illnesses brought by increased external contacts through tourism, and the upheaval of the First World War contributed to the island's evacuation in 1930. The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations, including Michael Powell's film The Edge of the World and an opera.Permanent habitation on the islands possibly extends back at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (and certainly no more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was evacuated from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. The islands house a unique form of stone structure known as cleitean. A cleit is a stone storage hut or bothy; whilst many are still to be found, they are slowly falling into disrepair. There are known to be 1,260 cleitean on Hirta and a further 170 on the other group islands. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months.The entire archipelago is owned by the National Trust for Scotland. It became one of Scotland's six World Heritage Sites in 1986, and is one of the few in the world to hold mixed status for both its natural and cultural qualities....

Ford has recalled more than 10 million vehicles in past decade. CNN in 2005 began airing investigative reports on sudden fires in Ford vehicles.","completion":"Title: Ford Cruise Control Switch Controversy: Understanding the Faulty Component and its Impact Introduction: A recent controversy has arisen over a faulty cruise control switch in Ford vehicles. Earl Mohlis, who lost his wife in a fire, claims that the switch was responsible for causing the blaze that led to her tragic death. Ford, however, has denied these allegations and stated that the switch was not the cause of the fire. Although Mohlis' lawsuit was eventually settled by the company, the issue continues to create concerns among Ford vehicle owners, particularly given the reports of sudden fires in some of their vehicles. 1. Earl Mohlis' Tragic Loss and Accusation: In a heartbreaking incident, Earl Mohlis lost his wife when their Ford vehicle caught fire due to a faulty cruise control switch. Mohlis claimed that it was this defect that led to the massive blaze that engulfed his wife. He sought justice by filing a lawsuit against Ford, aiming to shed light on the potential dangers that this switch posed to vehicle owners. 2. Ford's Stance on the Issue: Despite the grief and anger expressed by Mohlis, Ford has maintained that the cruise control switch is not responsible for starting the fire in question. The company contends that there is no concrete evidence linking the faulty switch to the blaze that ultimately killed Mohlis' wife. Ultimately, Ford opted to settle the lawsuit, but this decision does not seem to reflect an admission of guilt or responsibility on the company's part. 3. Extensive Recall of Ford Vehicles: Over the past decade, Ford has recalled more than 10 million vehicles for a variety of reasons. While this might be seen as a commitment to quality control and ensuring the safety of its customers, it also tends to heighten concerns around the reliability of the vehicles and the potential risk posed by faulty components. In the case of the cruise control switch, it is vital to examine whether these concerns are warranted and explore any available data on similar incidents. 4. Investigative Reports of Sudden Fires in Ford Vehicles: Adding fuel to the already burning controversy was a series of investigative reports by CNN in 2005, which highlighted the problem of sudden fires in Ford vehicles. These reports revealed that there was a potential issue with some of their vehicles catching fire without warning, potentially placing owners in grave danger. While no conclusive evidence has yet been presented that directly links the cruise control switch to these fires, the concerns raised by these reports cannot be dismissed out of hand. Conclusion: The controversy surrounding the faulty cruise control switch in Ford vehicles is undoubtedly a matter of significant concern for both the company and its customers. The devastating loss faced by Earl Mohlis serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers that faulty automotive components can pose. While Ford denies any responsibility for the incident, it is essential that further investigations are carried out to determine the root cause of such fires and ensure that the necessary steps are taken to guarantee the safety of all vehicle owners."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Two medical school students named Dan and Bob learned about the human immune system. Dan studied more about the subject, and became very interested to pursue it more in the future. Which student learned that the infected skin area may become painful? Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.

Scottish charity Quarriers commissioned a study of experiences of epilepsy, which surveyed 505 people across the UK. One woman in Glasgow said she was mugged while having a seizure. More than two-thirds of the 505 people interviewed in the ComRes poll admitted to worrying what members of the public would say or do if they had a seizure. A third admitted this concern led to anxiety about whether to leave the house, while just over half believed discrimination was widespread.

Options： A. go to church B. speak to god C. praise god D. kneel E. sincere The answer is:","completion":"B. speak to god When you pray, even if you are paralyzed, the most suitable option is to speak to God. Prayer is an essential way through which people connect with the divine, regardless of their physical abilities or limitations. Speaking to God can be done silently, in a whisper, or aloud, depending on the individual's preferences and capabilities. Prayer is a personal and intimate connection with the divine. Although going to church (option A) can provide a supportive and spiritual environment for praying, those who are paralyzed may not always be able to attend services or travel to a house of worship. Nonetheless, prayer can be done from anywhere, since it is a conversation between a person and the divine. Kneeling (option D) can be a symbol of humility and submission during prayer, but it is not a mandatory physical action, especially for people with paralysis. It is important to remember that the essence of prayer lies in the individual's sincerity and devotion, rather than outward actions. Praising God (option C) is one aspect of prayer, but it does not encompass the entire experience of prayer. In many religious traditions, prayer consists of multiple components, such as praise, repentance, thanksgiving, and requests for guidance or help. Thus, limiting prayer only to praising God may not fully address a person's spiritual needs. Sincerity (option E) is a crucial element of prayer, but it does not specifically answer the question of what one does when they pray. Moreover, being sincere should be a natural part of the prayer experience and does not need to be singled out as an exclusive option. In conclusion, the most suitable option for answering the question \\"What do you do when you pray, even if you are paralyzed?\\" is \\"B. speak to god.\\" Praying involves talking with God, expressing thoughts, emotions, gratitude, and requests, regardless of physical limitations. This intimate and personal connection transcends physical boundaries and reinforces the significance of spirituality in an individual's life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain (born Lawrence Joshua Chamberlain, September 8, 1828 - February 24, 1914) was an American college professor from the State of Maine, who volunteered during the American Civil War to join the Union Army. He became a highly respected and decorated Union officer, reaching the rank of brigadier general (and brevet major general). He is best known for his gallantry at the Battle of Gettysburg, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. Chamberlain was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment in 1862 and fought at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Chamberlain was born in Brewer, Maine, the son of Sarah Dupee (nee Brastow) and Joshua Chamberlain on September 8, 1828. Chamberlain was of English ancestry, and could trace his family line back to twelfth century England, during the reign of King Stephen. He was the oldest of five children. It is said that he was his mother's favorite while his father was tough on him. He was very involved in his church, mostly singing in the choir. His mother encouraged him to become a preacher while his father wanted him to join the military, but he felt a reluctance towards both options. He suffered a speech impediment until shortly after graduating from Bowdoin College. He entered Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, in 1848 with the help of a local tutor, professor William Hyde. Chamberlain learned to read Ancient Greek and Latin in order to pass the entrance exam. While at Bowdoin he met many people who would influence his life, including Harriet Beecher Stowe, the wife of Bowdoin professor Calvin Stowe. Chamberlain would often go to listen to her read passages from what would later become her celebrated novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin. He also joined the Peucinian Society, a group of students with Federalist leanings. A member of the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society and a brother of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, Chamberlain graduated in 1852. He married Fanny Adams, cousin and adopted daughter of a local clergyman, in 1855, and they had five children, one of whom was born too prematurely to survive and two of whom died in infancy. Chamberlain studied for three additional years at Bangor Theological Seminary in Bangor, Maine, returned to Bowdoin, and began a career in education as a professor of rhetoric. He eventually went on to teach every subject in the curriculum with the exception of science and mathematics. In 1861 he was appointed Professor of Modern Languages. He was fluent in nine languages other than English: Greek, Latin, Spanish, German, French, Italian, Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac. Chamberlain's great-grandfathers were soldiers in the American Revolutionary War. One, Franklin Chamberlain, was a sergeant at the Siege of Yorktown. His grandfather, also named Joshua Chamberlain, was a colonel in the local militia during the War of 1812 and was court-martialed (but exonerated) for his part in the humiliating Battle of Hampden, which led to the sacking of Bangor and Brewer by British forces. His father also had served during the abortive Aroostook War of 1839. Entity:","completion":"Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Luciano has just finished writing a novel based on a mysterious tale of lost treasure and betrayal set in his hometown of Venice, Italy. He returns to this captivating city to promote his latest work through a series of events, including book signings, media interviews, and public readings. As Luciano delves deeper into the world of his latest creation, he starts noticing strange coincidences that connect the characters in his book to his own life. As though guided by fate itself, Luciano meets the enigmatic and beautiful Sofia Castiglione (played by Monica Bellucci), an art historian who has recently returned to Venice to solve a centuries-old mystery surrounding the disappearance of her ancestors' priceless art collection. As Luciano and Sofia's paths interweave, their mutual curiosity towards each other's passion creates a magnetic attraction between them – sparking a passionate affair. However, unbeknownst to Luciano, a dangerous individual from his family's past becomes aware of his return to Venice and seeks vengeance. While on his promotional tour, Luciano is confronted with a series of anonymous threats that not only endanger his life but also the people he cares about – including Sofia. As the threats become more vicious, Luciano is forced to confront the skeletons in his family's closet – unraveling a complex web of mystery that intertwines family betrayal and long-forgotten secrets. To put an end to this dangerous game, Luciano and Sofia must race against time as they journey through the breathtaking canals, museums, and majestic landmarks of Venice. They must decipher hidden clues and retrace the steps of historic figures – all in pursuit of uncovering the truth. As they discover a world of art theft, family betrayal, and a menacing conspiracy, Luciano and Sofia must find the strength within them to solve the mystery before time runs out. In a thrilling climax, Luciano must confront the antagonist (played by Giancarlo Giannini), who holds deep-seated resentment for the D'Ambrosio family, unveiling the true motive behind his sinister actions. While the clash unravels, Luciano and Sofia find the answers they seek, which ultimately leads them to a hidden treasure buried deep within the city – the very inspiration for Luciano's book. As the danger subsides, Luciano releases the weight of his family's secrets and welcomes new love with Sofia. Amidst the grandeur of Venice, they embrace their new beginnings – celebrating love, redemption, and the beauty of the city that brought them together. The film ends with the release of Luciano's latest work, Echoes of Venezia, becoming a bestseller – earning its place in history as a timeless tale of mystery, love, and courage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. The way you handle your hair makes a big difference in its texture and appearance. When you're rough with your hair, it can frizz up and start looking dull. Hair is a fragile material that should be handled with care, just like a delicate piece of fabric. Here's what to keep in mind: When you shampoo your hair don't roughly scrub it. Massage the shampoo into your hair and distribute it with your fingers. Rinse your conditioner in the coldest water you can stand. The cold temperature seals the cuticle and helps your hair look shiny, while hot water will cause it to frizz up and look dull. Gently squeeze the water from your hair and pat it dry with a towel instead of twisting and wringing it out. Shampooing your hair every single day causes it to dry out and become brittle. The natural oil your scalp produces to nourish your hair gets rinsed away before it can do its job. If you want your hair to stay healthy and shiny, you only really need to wash it once or twice a week, depending on your hair type. When you first cut back on how often you wash your hair, you may notice it looking oilier than normal. Your scalp is producing oil on overdrive since it's used to everyday washings. After a week or two things will balance out and your hair will look cleaner, longer. On days in between washings, when you need to perk up your hair, try dry shampoo. It's a powder you sprinkle, or an aerosol you spray, on your hair to absorb the oil, and it works like a charm. The best way to keep your hair healthy is to let it dry naturally instead of using a hair dryer. The heat from the hair dryer damages the hair shaft, and if you do it every day you'll definitely see damage over time. Put that hair dryer away and let your hair dry the natural way. The same goes for other heat styling tools, like curling irons, straightening irons, and hot rollers. On days when you do want to use a hair dryer or other styling tools, apply a heat protectant serum to your hair so it doesn't get quite as damaged. Running a plastic-bristled brush through your hair, especially when it's wet, is almost guaranteed to cause some damage. Brushing tends to rip your hair, while combing removes the tangles without pulling it out. Use a wide-tooth comb and work out the tangles starting close to the tips and moving up to the roots. Dyeing, bleaching, chemically straightening, and chemically curling your hair all damage the shaft. For the healthiest possible hair, it's best to stop these treatments and let your hair take on its natural color and texture. Your hair might not be the exact color you want, but it will be healthy, shiny and silky. If you do want to dye your hair, look into henna, honey, or tea dyeing. These natural dyes actually restore shine to your hair, rather than damaging it. You won't be able to achieve a dramatic color change, but you can go a few shades lighter or darker. Waves, wefts, dreads, and other styles that require permanently pulling your hair into a tight position can cause damage and hair loss. While some types of weaves are less damaging than others (sewn weaves are usually better than glue-ins, for example) your hair will be healthier if you forego them altogether.","completion":"Handle hair gently, shampoo less frequently, avoid heat styling and chemical treatments, and utilize natural alternatives to maintain its health, shine, and texture."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Once he returned to the United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons.

After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Roshanak in Bactrian) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent. He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now Pakistan, to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis(Indian name Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \\"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold\\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality. On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC. In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos. The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to Curtius, \\"Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble\\". A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.

I have a new situation: Scientists studied water stratification in two saltwater lakes. they were trying to find out why the fish population decreased in Long lake, and was very healthy and abundant in Shoal lake. They found out the phenomenon occurred more often in Long lake, leading to very many unpleasant chain effects. But I can use this background: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] What is an answer for this question: Which lake had a lower net productivity?","completion":"Based on the provided information, Long Lake had a lower net productivity compared to Shoal Lake. This conclusion is drawn from the observation that the fish population in Long Lake had decreased, while the fish population in Shoal Lake was healthy and abundant. The phenomenon of water stratification, which occurs more often in Long Lake, plays a significant role in the lower net productivity of the lake. As a result of stratification, layers of water with different properties - such as salinity, oxygenation, density, and temperature - form barriers to water mixing, potentially leading to anoxia or euxinia. These barriers prevent the efficient mixing of nutrients between the layers, which affects primary production by limiting photosynthetic processes. In the case of Long Lake, the observed water stratification would restrict the transport of nutrients from the benthos to the photic zone. This nutrient limitation causes a decrease in phytoplankton abundance, leading to a reduction in primary production. Lower primary production, in turn, results in lower net productivity within the water, as fewer resources are available for organisms higher in the food chain, including fish populations. In contrast, Shoal Lake, which does not experience the same degree of water stratification, maintains a healthy and abundant fish population. The absence or reduced levels of water stratification in Shoal Lake allows for a more effective nutrient mixing between the layers, increasing primary production and providing a more favorable environment for the growth and survival of fish populations. Thus, it can be concluded that Shoal Lake has a higher net productivity compared to Long Lake."},{"prompt":"Background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life.

Answer: No, it is not safe to sleep with a candle lit. Justification: 1. A lit candle could tip over and start a fire, possibly causing damage to property or harm to the people inside. 2. Even if the candle is placed in a secure holder, the flame could still ignite nearby flammable materials, such as curtains, bedding, or clothing. 3.

Answer: To make candles with tallow, follow these steps: 1. Gather materials: Tallow (rendered animal fat, usually beef or sheep), a large pot or double boiler, candle wicks (with metal tabs for stability), mason jars or candle molds, a wooden spoon, and a thermometer. 2. Melt the tallow: Place the tallow into the pot or double boiler and heat it on a low setting on the stove until it melts completely. Keep an eye on the temperature, as tallow's ideal melting point is around 130°F to 140°F (54°C to 60°C). 3. Prepare the molds or jars: While the tallow is melting, arrange the molds or mason jars on a flat surface. Place a wick with a metal tab into each container's center. 4. Pour the melted tallow: Once the tallow reaches the ideal melting point, carefully pour it into each jar or mold containing the wick. Leave about ½ inch (1.27 cm) of space at the top for a more polished look. 5. Allow the tallow to cool: Let the candles cool undisturbed for several hours or overnight, until they solidify. As the tallow cools and hardens, the color will change from clear to opaque. 6. Trim the wicks: Once the candles are fully hardened, trim the wicks to about ¼ inch (0.6 cm) in length.

But. in the video, which shows Ms Mills sitting next to the offending boot,. the former glamour model dismisses the claims of abuse as 'tabloid rubbish'. She said: 'I never physically touched her. 'The reports that she begged me not to hit her are tabloid rubbish.' At the end of the rant she concludes:. 'It seems to me in the years that I was trying to do this for Britain,. Sylvana Mestre had it in for me and wanted me out.' But in the video, which shows Ms Mills sitting next to the offending boot, the former glamour model dismisses the claims as 'rubbish' Mills' management said that wearing the boot cover, which locks to her left leg below the knee, causes a large amount of friction, painful inflammation and blisters.

The leg was approved for use but the IPC said she had not submitted her new boot for ratification and would have to revert to standard equipment until it had been passed for use in competition. She was about to qualify for a place in next year's Paralympic Games when the row erupted. She was told she must wear a cover. over her boot and prosthetic leg to comply with international rules.

Mills’ management said that wearing the boot cover, which locks to her left. leg below the knee, causes a large amount of friction, painful. inflammation and blisters. She claimed that she had been 'asked to do the video' to explain her disqualification. She. said: ''While I was skiing in Pitztal last week, I was on inspection,. and I noticed Sylvana Mestre following me down the mountain, but didn't. think anything of it at the time. 'The next thing I get a phone call from my GB coach Tony saying I was disqualified. Ms. Mills said she then attended a competition technical meeting in which. her use of an unapproved prosthetic leg was being discussed, despite the. fact she was not supposed to have attended. She then claims that Ms Mestre 'stormed over', saying 'The rules are the rules', and informed her she was disqualified. She added: 'I stayed quiet... I put my hand on her shoulder to try and. explain but she just said \\"I don't care\\" and stormed back to the table.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Natural theology was not a unified doctrine, and while some such as Louis Agassiz were strongly opposed to the ideas in the book, others sought a reconciliation in which evolution was seen as purposeful. In the Church of England, some liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as \\"just as noble a conception of Deity\\". In the second edition of January 1860, Darwin quoted Kingsley as \\"a celebrated cleric\\", and added the phrase \\"by the Creator\\" to the closing sentence, which from then on read \\"life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one\\". While some commentators have taken this as a concession to religion that Darwin later regretted, Darwin's view at the time was of God creating life through the laws of nature, and even in the first edition there are several references to \\"creation\\". If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did some commentators think about Darwin changing the phrasing in his book?","completion":"Some commentators think that Darwin's decision to change the phrasing in his book, particularly by adding the phrase \\"by the Creator\\" to the closing sentence, was an attempt to appease religious critics and make his theory of evolution more palatable to a wider audience. They believe that by making this change, Darwin sought to find common ground with religiously inclined individuals who might otherwise reject his ideas or view them as a direct attack on their faith. This interpretation suggests that Darwin was being pragmatic and wanted to avoid unnecessary controversy that could hinder the acceptance of his theory. By framing evolution as a process designed or set into motion by a divine Creator, he allowed for the possibility that religious believers could reconcile their understanding of God with the idea of evolution by natural selection. However, other commentators argue that Darwin genuinely believed in a Creator who had established the laws of nature, in which evolution by natural selection operated as an integral part of those laws. From this perspective, Darwin's amendment to the text was not merely a concession to his critics or an attempt to appease religious sensibilities, but rather a genuine expression of his own beliefs about the relationship between science and religion. In either case, it is clear that Darwin's revisions to his work did influence how his ideas were received and interpreted by various groups, both religious and secular, allowing for a broader acceptance of the theory of evolution as a whole in the years that followed. Nonetheless, the debate about the extent to which Darwin intended to reconcile or challenge religious beliefs with his evolutionary theory continues among commentators today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: \\"Home Room\\" came as a total surprise. Not having a clue as to what it was all about, it paid off big time because it doesn't hold any punches and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who decided to victimize his class mates, who are the innocent victims of his rash actions. Paul Ryan, the director, who is working and editing his own material, is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing acting all around by his cast. Alicia Browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate high school. She has been away a couple of years and doesn't seem to be in the same wave length of the other students. For one, she is a rebel with a punk look, lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to come near her orbit. Alicia was among the students in the home room where nine students have died, supposedly killed by her boyfriend. Alicia, we realize, is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life, but we are not given any clues to that effect. What follows is the aftermath of the tragedy, as it concentrates on a young woman who has survived it. Deanna Cartwright is a wealthy teen ager who shouldn't have been at the school, at all. When a ricochet bullet hit her, she is hospitalized with more than a wound. She is trying to get over this dark period in her mind but the nightmares don't let her forget. Alicia is made to go to the hospital by the school principal. Since she doesn't cooperate with the police, the head of the school wants her to see Deanna in her terrible state and perhaps she will soften up and will tell the authorities what she knows. Alicia dislikes Deanna, but in a matter of days, both girls will make peace. We don't realize until the last sequence what really happened that horrible day in school. Busy Phillips makes an excellent Alicia and Erika Christiansen is equally good as Deanna. Victor Garber, James Pinkins, Taylor Holland, and the rest of the cast play as an ensemble. The film has an intensity because it's not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred, which helps the tone that Mr. Ryan wanted to give this movie.","completion":"To analyze the sentiment of this review, I will break it down into sections and evaluate the tone and opinion expressed in each. 1. The beginning describes the movie as a \\"total surprise\\" and mentions that it \\"paid off big time,\\" indicating a positive sentiment due to the unexpected quality of the movie. 2. The review praises Paul Ryan, the director, and the cast's acting, which is another positive sentiment. 3. In discussing the character Alicia Browning, the review doesn't seem to have any strong positive or negative sentiment, as it mainly focuses on describing the character without expressing a clear opinion about her. 4. The review then covers the movie's progression and aftermath, mentioning that it concentrates on a young woman who survived the tragedy. The sentiment is neutral here, as the reviewer is providing a summary of the plot rather than expressing an opinion. 5. The reviewer discusses the principal's intentions and the growing relationship between the two main characters without expressing strong sentiment, maintaining a neutral tone. 6. There is praise for the performances of the main actors, Busy Phillips and Erika Christiansen, conveying a positive sentiment. 7. The review ends by stating that the film has an intensity due to the way the shooting is portrayed and how it aligns with the director's intentions, which seems to be another positive sentiment.

This time, Pagan could not do anything to retake Martaban because it was facing an existential threat from the north. The Mongols demanded tribute, in 1271 and again in 1273. When Narathihapate refused both times, the Mongols systematically invaded the country. The first invasion in 1277 defeated the Burmese at the battle of Ngasaunggyan, and secured their hold of Kanngai . In 1283-1285, their forces moved south and occupied down to Tagaung and Hanlin. The king fled to Lower Burma in 1285 before agreeing to submit to the Mongols in June 1286. Soon after the agreement was finalised, the king was assassinated in July 1287.

On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogoro shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited.

The term \\"nun\\" is applicable to Catholics (eastern and western traditions), Orthodox Christians, Anglicans, Lutherans, Jains, Buddhists, Taoists, Hindus and some other religious traditions. - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church. - A convent is either a community of priests, religious brothers or religious sisters (nuns); or the building used by the community, particularly in the Roman Catholic Church and in the Anglican Communion.

Summarize this article: Taylor's 88th-minute decider came after Vale's JJ Hooper had cancelled out Aaron Phillips' opener for the hosts, with all three goals coming in the final half-hour. It was Northampton's third win on the trot and lifted them 11 points clear of fourth-bottom Vale, who themselves are now five points adrift of safety after relegation rivals Oldham defeated Oxford. Cobblers started brightly, with Michael Smith and Keshi Anderson firing over, while Luke Williams was also off target with another effort. Leonardo Fasan pulled off a smart save to deny Anderson from the edge of the box as Northampton made all the running, with John-Joe O'Toole also failing to hit the target for the hosts. Fasan denied Marc Richards in another Northampton attack before Vale created their first opening just before the break when Anton Forrester was denied by Adam Smith. After the restart, Sam Foley fired wide for Vale before the home side created further chances, Richards failing to hit the target from a tight angle in the six-yard box and Taylor having a shot blocked. It was going to take something special to break the deadlock and it came in the 63rd minute when an intended cross from full-back Phillips beat Fasan and found the top corner of the net. Boosted by the breakthrough, Cobblers went in search of the crucial second goal. Smith went close with a header, while Richards blazed over from close range before then firing wide from the edge of the box. But it was Vale who struck next, getting back on level terms in the 73rd minute when Northampton failed to deal with a corner and Hooper beat Smith from 15 yards. Vale began to get on top in the closing stages but Northampton could have reclaimed their lead only for substitute Hiram Boateng to head wide from close range. The home fans need not have worried, though, as two minutes from the end Taylor caught out Fasan from 30 yards to net home the match-winning strike. Match report supplied by the Press Association.

At the White House on Wednesday, Trump continued to speak cautiously about the coming summit, even while praising the North Korean leader for the prisoner release. “Everything can be scuttled,” Trump told reporters. “A lot of things can happen — a lot of good things can happen, [and] a lot of bad things can happen.” North Korea on Wednesday granted amnesty to three Americans of Korean descent. They had been accused of espionage or trying to overthrow the government, charges widely seen as bogus. Pyongyang has detained at least 16 Americans over the past two decades, often attempting to use them as bargaining chips. All were eventually released, although Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old college student, died shortly after returning to the United States last year. A White House statement Wednesday praised North Korea’s latest prisoner release as a “positive gesture of goodwill” ahead of the Trump-Kim summit, which is expected to take place as soon as next month. South Korea’s presidential office said Pyongyang’s decision was a “very positive” sign for a successful North Korea-U.S. meeting. The freeing of the prisoners coincided with a visit to Pyongyang by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who declined to say whether the release was a U.S. precondition for holding talks with the North. “I don’t know the answer to that,” Pompeo told reporters on the flight home. “It would have been more difficult [had the prisoners not been released]. ... I’m glad that we don’t have to confront that.” It’s not clear what, if anything, the U.S. gave up in exchange for the prisoners. It’s not even clear a concession was needed, since North Korea has for decades sought the presumed legitimacy provided by a summit with a sitting U.S. president.

If your starting chemical is something like crude oil, you'll need to use distillation or fractional distillation to separate it into parts. See if the starting and target chemicals have any groups in common.","completion":"This provides a foundation for determining if any possible reactions or mechanisms will require significantly less energy or steps, as structurally similar compounds often undergo similar reactions or pathways. Next, assess which functional groups need to be converted or added to achieve the desired structure. This will allow you to identify which reagents, solvents, and catalysts may be necessary for the synthesis. Additionally, consider the stereochemistry involved in the target molecule, as it plays a crucial role in the effectiveness and desired properties of the final compound. Ensure that any transformations carried out maintain or achieve the correct stereochemistry through appropriate reaction conditions and choice of catalysts or reagents. Furthermore, evaluate if the reaction conditions will influence the regiochemistry, which concerns the specific region of the molecule undergoing transformation. This is particularly important for reactions involving larger or more complex starting materials, as regioselective reactions can greatly enhance the efficiency and yield of the final product. To guide the synthesis process, try using retrosynthetic analysis, which involves working backwards from the target molecule to visualize and plan the steps required for the synthesis. This method helps in identifying potential synthetic routes and any challenges that may arise during the process. Research and review existing literature about the synthesis of similar compounds or transformations that closely resemble your target reaction. This can provide valuable information about tested methods and possible reaction conditions that yield successful results. Moreover, ensure that the chosen synthetic route can be achieved safely, as some organic reactions may involve hazardous materials or produce toxic byproducts. Always practice safe laboratory techniques, wear appropriate protective equipment, and work in a well-ventilated area or fume hood. After designing a synthesis route, perform the reactions in the lab cautiously, starting with small-scale experiments to confirm the effectiveness and validity of the chosen synthetic route. Conduct thorough analyses of the reaction products, such as purification and characterization, utilizing techniques such as chromatography, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy. Analyzing the results and data, refine the synthesis route if necessary, making adjustments to reagents, concentrations, or conditions to optimize the yield and purity of the target compound. Lastly, be prepared for setbacks or unexpected results in the process of synthesizing an organic compound. Organic synthesis can be a complex and iterative process, with multiple rounds of experimentation and analysis required to achieve the desired outcome. Remaining patient, flexible, and open to alternative approaches will ultimately contribute to success in the synthesis of your target organic compound."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What were the major contributions of the political leaders during WW1, and how are the compared to the ones during the Seven Year War? What were the major contributions of the political leaders during WW1, and how are they compared to the ones during other major armed conflicts? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Options are: (a). no; (b). yes;","completion":"(a). No Although the two questions may seem similar, they have differences in terms of focus and the conflicts they ask to compare. The first question specifically asks about the major contributions of political leaders during World War 1 (WW1) and how they compare to the ones during the Seven Years' War. To answer this question, we need to discuss the contributions of political leaders in both conflicts and compare them. Major Contributions during WW1: 1. Woodrow Wilson (US President) - His role was crucial in shaping the post-WW1 world and establishing the League of Nations. He outlined his famous Fourteen Points, which became the blueprint for the Treaty of Versailles. 2. David Lloyd George (British Prime Minister) - A skilful negotiator, George was instrumental in forging the alliance between Britain, France, and the United States. He played a key role in shaping terms of the Treaty of Versailles and securing British interests after the war. 3. Georges Clemenceau (French Prime Minister) - As the leader of France, Clemenceau ensured that the nation remained committed to a total victory against Germany. He was instrumental in shaping the Treaty of Versailles, focusing on ensuring the security for France in the post-war world. 4. Kaiser Wilhelm II (German Emperor) - He played a major role in the inception and escalation of the war. His policies and leadership led to the eventual collapse of Germany's war effort and the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. Major Contributions during the Seven Years' War: 1. William Pitt the Elder (British Prime Minister) - He oversaw Britain's strategic decisions, sought to win the war by undermining the economic power of France and Spain and expanded Britain's influence. 2. Frederick the Great (King of Prussia) - His military genius saw Prussia emerge as a major power in Europe, as he embarked on successful campaigns against Austria, France, and Russia. 3. Empress Maria Theresa (Austrian Empress) - She persisted in reclaiming the territories captured by Prussia and was instrumental in organizing the large coalition against Prussia. 4. Tsarina Elizabeth (Russian Empress) - She was crucial in building a coalition against Prussia, and her support helped turn the tide against Frederick the Great for a period of time. Comparison: During WW1, political leaders played significant roles in diplomacy and influencing the post-war world's shape, which were different from the leaders' involvement during the Seven Years' War, where political leaders focused on personal military efforts and the expansion of their empires. The second question, on the other hand, refers to the major contributions of political leaders during WW1 and how they compare to other major armed conflicts. In this case, the comparison could involve any significant conflict from history, including but not limited to the Seven Years' War. The scope of comparison is broader in the second question, as it would require an analysis of various conflicts and their political leaders, leading to a different discussion than addressing the first question only."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

More rarely, brown, white, lavender, and dark purple peppers can be seen, depending on the variety. Most typically, unripe fruits are green or, less commonly, pale yellow or purple. Red bell peppers are simply ripened green peppers, although the Permagreen variety maintains its green color even when fully ripe. As such, mixed colored peppers also exist during parts of the ripening process. Green peppers are less sweet and slightly more bitter than yellow or orange peppers, with red bell peppers being the sweetest. The taste of ripe peppers can also vary with growing conditions and post-harvest storage treatment; the sweetest fruits are allowed to ripen fully on the plant in full sunshine, while fruit harvested green and after-ripened in storage is less sweet. are green bell peppers just unripe red bell peppers?","completion":"Yes, that's right! Green bell peppers are just unripe red bell peppers. As the green bell peppers keep growing on the plant, they gradually turn into yellow, orange, and eventually red bell peppers.

Make use of the article to answer the questions. Milk is a white liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for infant mammals (including humans who breastfeed) before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrum, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. It contains many other nutrients including protein and lactose. As an agricultural product, milk is extracted from non-human mammals during or soon after pregnancy. Dairy farms produced about 730 million tonnes of milk in 2011, from 260 million dairy cows. India is the world's largest producer of milk, and is the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder, yet it exports few other milk products. The ever increasing rise in domestic demand for dairy products and a large demand-supply gap could lead to India being a net importer of dairy products in the future. The United States, India, China and Brazil are the world's largest exporters of milk and milk products. China and Russia were the world's largest importers of milk and milk products until 2016 when both countries became self-sufficient, contributing to a worldwide glut of milk.

Is Samsung About To Nail Apple In Retail? NEW YORK - OCTOBER 14: People shop in a Apple store . (Image credit: Getty Images via @daylife) Apple’s retail strategy has been one of its great successes. In fact Apple has done to retail what it did to mobile – shown other companies the way. In total, they now have around 400 stores, the majority of them in the USA, and they are wildly successful. But is it enough? Phones, the actual smart devices, are now of less importance as a differentiator than in the recent past. Everyone makes a great phone, and that’s why BlackBerry saw its share price sink, Friday. Nice phone but what else do you excel at? Apple and Samsung excel at phones, have equally phenomenal supply chains, great marketing and equally good innovation capabilities. What matters also is how you sell. Hence retail could be the next significant battleground between these two. In 2012 Apple opened 41 new stores. It is using its store openings to help develop new markets and gradually the number of international retail stores has grown – 82% of 2012 openings were international last year. But let’s be clear, that’s only about 32 stores. A recent study showed that “The percentage of sales from Apple Stores (compared to all sales) has actually dropped from 17 percent in 2007 to 12 percent in 2012.” The conclusion you can draw from that is stores don’t matter because Apple has such a great distribution network, or Apple ‘s retail strategy is lagging its overall development. Analysts Asymco point out that as sales have increased in the past five years, store openings have slowed proportionally. Yet when Apple doubled its stores in China it also doubled sales. Still Apple’s own retail presence in China is negligible (3% of stores) and in India non-existent, as yet, though Apple has added two distributors there and offers an iPhone for 98 down payment. Let’s look at arch competitor, Samsung, and evidence that you cannot afford to slouch for one minute. All this activity comes from a six month period in 2012. Samsung announced the opening of its first “Samsung Mobile Brand Store” in Delhi, in April 2012. They launched their first concept store in Pakistan also in April. The Samsung Concept Shop is a One-Stop venue for all Samsung products – Samsung 3D Smart TV’s, LED and LCD TV’s, Monitors, Plasma Display Panels, IT products, Cameras, Mobile phones, and Home Appliances. In March 2012 they partnered with mobile operator MTS in Russia to sell handsets and tablet computers on contract in MTS’s 2,000 shops. They also announced they will open 10 of their own stores in Russia’s biggest cities, In July they opened their first North American retail store, and a very Apple-like experience, in Vancouver, Canada. The store was “flooded with clean, bright lighting, a minimalist layout of products and even blue-clad Samsung ‘geniuses’ on deck to help out customers”. Also in 2012 they began an own store strategy in China aiming to develop in the second and third tier cities with a strategy of hiring local Chinese managers. In addition, they opened the first China Samsung Experience “shop-in-shop” with retailer Suning in, Pudong, Shanghai, August 2012. In regards to the future cooperation of the two parties, Suning plans to set up no less than 100 Samsung Experience Shops in its flagship stores across China. At present, the Chinese retailer is planning Samsung Experience Shops in nearly 30 outlets in Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Chongqing. They also opened a concept store in Sydney, Australia, in August 2012 just down the road from Apple. undefined They announced a partnership with Singapore’s Challenger, the leading IT retailer, to open “experience corners” in Challenger outlets. The first one opened in October 2012 and has 1500 square feet dedicated to Samsung phones, computing, and cameras. They partnered with Tesco in Malaysia in March 2012 with a shop-in-shop concept called “Samsung World”. And with Phones4Us in the UK – began a “store-in-store” program in March 2012 Apple is not standing entirely on its laurels. (Distribution) Outlets in China selling the iPhone rose to 17,000 in the period that ended Dec. 29, from 7,000 a year earlier, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said on a conference call yesterday. That helped Apple boost sales in the Greater China region to 6.83 billion, from 4.08 billion a year earlier. When Samsung opened its first store in North America the tech press accused it of copying the Apple way. And there is some truth in that. But the Korean company has a diversified strategy. It has an own-store program in key markets like India and China, and of course North America. And it has at least two different store-in-store concepts that it is pushing with major retail outlets in key growth markets. What it gets up to in North America is not its central retail strategy. Yes, it will do concept stores but its bigger push is into volume – hundreds of in-store corners and concept areas to push the Samsung brand and product quickly Samsung’s objective is to increase sales competitively, as soon as possible. Will we see Apple,, with its higher concept retail approach, accelerate its store openings in response? Follow me on Twitter @haydn1701 or join me on Facebook. I am here on Google What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the retail strategies of Apple and Samsung and speculates on whether Samsung might overtake Apple in terms of retail success. It outlines the history of Apple's retail success, with approximately 400 stores, mostly in the USA. It suggests that retail may become a crucial battlefield for these two corporations, as smartphones have become less of a differentiator in the market. The article then turns to Samsung, outlining its aggressive approach in various markets. It highlights specific instances of Samsung opening its own brand stores in places like Delhi, Russia, Vancouver, and Australia. Samsung is also partnering with other retailers to open \\"experience corners\\", where customers can try Samsung products. Finally, the article points out that Apple is not idle. It has boosted the outlets selling iPhones in China from 7,000 to 17,000. The article concludes by suggesting that while Samsung is pursuing a diversifed strategy, it's uncertain how Apple will respond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I have been the brunt of cruelty from a doctor a number of times but I will relate one that has always stayed with me since I was a child. I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again. She found another doctor that actually treated us like we were human. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

În acelaşi timp, trebuie să luăm în considerare plata bonusurilor bancherilor, o problemă care a devenit un subiect deosebit de important în Estonia. Translate this to English?","completion":"At the same time, we must take into consideration the payment of bankers' bonuses, an issue that has become particularly important in Estonia. The issue of paying bonuses to bankers has attracted significant attention in Estonia and has led to various discussions and debates. As one delves deeper into the matter, it becomes essential to consider several aspects including the circumstances surrounding these bonuses, their impact on the banking industry, and potential alternatives and solutions to address the issue. Firstly, it is important to understand the context and reasoning behind the payment of bankers' bonuses. In most cases, bonuses are awarded to employees as a form of incentive to encourage them to perform well and be more productive. Such incentives are designed to motivate employees by recognizing their efforts and achievements. The banking industry, like many other sectors, operates in a competitive environment, and banks must attract and retain highly skilled professionals to deliver quality services to their customers. Some argue that the payment of bonuses is justified as it helps retain and attract talent, ensuring that banks maintain a competitive edge. By offering attractive compensation packages, banks are able to secure the loyalty and services of professionals who help drive the overall success of the institution. In this sense, bonuses can be seen as a necessary investment in human capital, which eventually results in increased productivity and growth. However, critics of this system argue that the payment of excessive bonuses can encourage excessive risk-taking within the financial sector, ultimately leading to destabilization and potential crises. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, many countries implemented regulations aimed at curbing excessive bonus payments and linking them to long-term performance. These measures were taken to prevent a recurrence of the reckless behavior that contributed to the crisis. In Estonia, the debate on bankers' bonuses has highlighted the need for a more balanced approach to remuneration. Financial institutions must strike an equilibrium between providing sufficient incentives to employees and ensuring responsible behavior in the banking industry. To this end, several possible solutions have been proposed, ranging from the implementation of stricter regulatory frameworks to the adoption of alternative remuneration models that emphasize long-term performance and sustainability. A potential solution involves setting caps on bonus payments, preventing them from exceeding a certain percentage of an employee's base salary. By doing so, banks could continue to offer incentives while limiting their scale, thereby reducing the risk of financial instability. Additionally, linking bonuses to long-term performance can further promote a responsible approach, as employees would be rewarded based on the sustained success of their actions, rather than short-term gains. Alternatives to traditional bonus payments could include offering additional benefits and perks to employees. These could range from providing extra vacation days, offering flexible work arrangements, and promoting a stronger work-life balance. Implementing a more comprehensive incentive package that encompasses various aspects of an employee's life could lead to greater satisfaction and loyalty, without the potential hazards associated with excessive bonus payments. In conclusion, the issue of paying bankers' bonuses in Estonia is a complex and multifaceted matter that warrants careful consideration. While bonuses can be effective in motivating employees and securing talent, they also carry risks and potential negative consequences. By striking a balance between incentivizing employees and promoting responsible behavior, Estonia can ensure the long-term success and stability of its banking industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Teenagers who drink alcohol are at higher risk of becoming victims of violence, a Cardiff University study has found. A team from the School of Dentistry's Violence Research Group studied drinking habits in children aged 11 - 16 in England. They found not only a link between drink and violence but also that children who drank were more likely to be hit, even if they weren't violent themselves. The researchers are now calling for measures to prevent alcohol misuse to reduce injury risk. Current policy focuses on reducing aggression but this research shows that there should be equal effort to reduce victimization. More than 4,000 children were surveyed at 13 schools at four local authorities in the North, the Midlands, London, and the South. The study found that 25% of 11-year-olds were drinking monthly and 3.6% daily, with 12.8% admitting to getting drunk 3 to 5 times a year. By the age of 16, 40% were drinking weekly and 6.2% were drinking every day. The research also showed 22.6% of 16-year-olds were getting drunk more than 21 times a year. The study, which has just been published in the Journal of Adolescence, found a strong link between frequency of drinking and frequency of hitting other people. However, children who reported drinking monthly were also three times more likely to be hit. Adolescents who drank but didn't get into fights were more likely to be hit than those who did fight. Professor Jonathan Shepherd, who led the research, said a lot of previous alcohol-related violence work had focused on the offenders rather than the victims. His team is calling for more prevention work from parents and teachers in the first two years of secondary school by taking advantage of the \\"teachable moment\\", that is, immediately after a student has missed school because of drunkenness. Previous work by Professor Jonathan Shepherd has shown drinkers may be more at risk of violence because of reduced physical co-ordination, poor decision-making in threatening situations and isolation while out late at night.

Write highlights for this article: Two stories of America -- one about its sometimes perverse capacity for reinvention, the other about the most tragic period in the country's history -- were among the leaders Thursday for the nominations for the 86th Academy Awards. \\"American Hustle,\\" a story about con artists based loosely on the late 1970s Abscam scandal, tied for the lead with 10 nominations. The movie was nominated in several major categories, including picture, director (David O. Russell), actor (Christian Bale), actress (Amy Adams), supporting actor (Bradley Cooper), supporting actress (Jennifer Lawrence) and adapted screenplay. And \\"12 Years a Slave,\\" based on Solomon Northup's 19th-century narrative about being taken from freedom into slavery, earned nine nods, including picks for best picture, best director (Steve McQueen), best actor (Chiwetel Ejiofor), best supporting actor (Michael Fassbender) and best supporting actress (Lupita Nyong'o). \\"This has been an amazing ride, and to receive nine nominations from the academy is testament to all of the hard work. And for that I am truly grateful,\\" McQueen said. The complete list of nominees. \\"Gravity,\\" about a space mission gone wrong, also received 10 nominations, including picks for best picture, best director (Alfonso Cuaron) and best actress (Sandra Bullock). \\"I am particularly moved by Sandy's nomination,\\" said Cuaron in a statement. \\"She is the heartbeat of our film. I thank her for her grace, her trust and her dedication to finding the truth of this character.\\" The academy nominated nine films for best picture overall. They are \\"American Hustle,\\" \\"Captain Phillips,\\" \\"Dallas Buyers Club,\\" \\"Gravity,\\" \\"Her,\\" \\"Nebraska,\\" \\"Philomena,\\" \\"12 Years a Slave\\" and \\"The Wolf of Wall Street.\\" CNN Oscar ballot: Make your choices, share your picks. \\"The Wolf of Wall Street\\" had divided critics -- and, more to the point, industry audiences -- with its relentless depiction of hedonism among financial traders in 1990s New York. In one instance, according to a story that quickly gained currency in Hollywood, an academy member heckled director Martin Scorsese after a screening. But Oscar sided with the film, giving it five nominations, all in big categories: best picture, best director, best actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), best supporting actor (Jonah Hill) and best adapted screenplay (Terence Winter). 5 things we learned from Oscar nominations. Love for 'Dallas Buyers Club' There was also good news for \\"Dallas Buyers Club,\\" the story of an HIV-positive man in the 1980s who rallies others to battle the AIDS crisis. The low-budget film, which cost 5 million, received six nominations, tying it with \\"Nebraska\\" and \\"Captain Phillips.\\" Matthew McConaughey, who won a Golden Globe for a performance that required him to lose 45 pounds, was among the best actor nominees. The film was also nominated for best supporting actor (Jared Leto, another Globe winner) and best original screenplay, along with best picture. The academy also smiled on director Alexander Payne, a two-time Oscar winner whose films include \\"Sideways,\\" \\"The Descendants\\" and \\"About Schmidt.\\" His \\"Nebraska,\\" the story of a curmudgeon and his son who make a trip to the Cornhusker State in the possible vain pursuit of a sweepstakes prize, included nominations for picture, director, original screenplay, supporting actress (June Squibb) and best actor. The last went to 77-year-old film veteran Bruce Dern, whose only other nomination was for 1978's \\"Coming Home.\\" Another sleeper, \\"Philomena,\\" received nominations for picture, adapted screenplay and star Judi Dench as well as music (original score). As expected, Cate Blanchett also was nominated for best actress as a modern-day Blanche DuBois in \\"Blue Jasmine.\\" She already has won the Golden Globe (drama), National Society of Film Critics Award and New York Film Critics Circle Award for her role in the Woody Allen film. The tireless Meryl Streep was recognized yet again by the academy, receiving a best actress nomination for \\"August: Osage County.\\" It's Streep's 18th nomination. She has three wins, for \\"Kramer vs. Kramer,\\" \\"Sophie's Choice\\" and \\"The Iron Lady.\\" Hanks, Oprah missing. But not everyone ended up touched by Oscar's golden glow. Perhaps the biggest shocker was the lack of a nomination for Tom Hanks, who pretty much carries \\"Captain Phillips\\" as the titular seaman. The film did receive nominations for best picture, best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor (for former limo driver and Somalia native Barkhad Abdi), but neither Hanks nor director Paul Greengrass ended up with nods. (It also was nominated for film editing, sound editing and sound mixing.) Hanks' other major film, \\"Saving Mr. Banks,\\" was almost entirely snubbed. Though Emma Thompson was nominated for a Golden Globe for her portrayal of \\"Mary Poppins\\" author P.L. Travers, the academy overlooked her in the best actress race, and the film failed to earn a best picture nomination. Oprah Winfrey and the film she starred in, \\"Lee Daniels' The Butler,\\" also came up empty. And Robert Redford was expected to make a run at best actor for his almost wordless performance in \\"All Is Lost,\\" about a lone sailor lost at sea when his boat is damaged. But the 77-year-old actor didn't get a nomination. Pixar, which once a sure thing in the animated feature category, was left off the nominations list again. The nominees for best animated feature are \\"The Croods,\\" \\"Despicable Me 2,\\" \\"Frozen,\\" \\"The Wind Rises\\" and \\"Ernest & Celestine.\\" DeGeneres promises fun again as Oscar host. The Oscar race now shapes up as a battle between \\"Hustle\\" and \\"12 Years.\\" Both have their critics. For all the praise \\"Hustle\\" has received -- including a Golden Globe for best musical or comedy film -- it's been called slick and hammy. McQueen's \\"12 Years\\" (which received the Golden Globe for best drama) has fewer naysayers, but even those who liked the film noted it's difficult to watch. Slate's Dana Stevens described it as \\"overpowering,\\" and admitted she was having a hard time finding critical distance from the film's portrayal of brutality. Awards season: Does diversity matter more than wins? \\"Buyers Club\\" could sneak in. Like \\"12 Years,\\" it has a high-minded subject the Oscars tend to like, and McConaughey and Leto have been widely touted for their performances. \\"Gravity\\" may be a longer shot for best picture, but Cuaron's amazing direction -- juggling state-of-the-art, computer-generated imagery with moving performances by Bullock and George Clooney -- has been greatly admired. Of course, as much as the Oscar is about designating the best of Hollywood, it's also supposed to be an entertaining show. This year, Ellen DeGeneres returns as host, and given a short ad shown just before the nominations announcement -- which featured DeGeneres dancing through a back lot accompanied by a growing army of tuxedoed dancers -- it could be a lot of fun.

Read this article and answer this question Hoping to rebound from their home loss to the Eagles, the Vikings stayed at home and played a Week 9 interconference game against the San Diego Chargers. The two teams were level by the end of the first quarter, following 1-yard touchdown runs from both Chargers running back LaDainian Tomlinson and the Vikings' Adrian Peterson. The second quarter then went scoreless until the very last play of the half, when kicker Ryan Longwell came up short on a 57-yard field goal attempt, which Antonio Cromartie returned 109&#160;yards for a touchdown, the longest possible play in the game. The Vikings scored a pair of long touchdowns in the third quarter, as Peterson scored on a 64-yard run, followed by a 40-yard pass from Brooks Bollinger to Sidney Rice. The Chargers narrowed the Vikings' lead to four points in the fourth quarter on a 36-yard field goal by Nate Kaeding, but another long touchdown run of 46 yards from Peterson and a 2-yard score from fellow running back Chester Taylor sealed a 35-17 win for the Vikings. Peterson had 30 carries for 296 rushing yards, setting a new single-game league record, along with three touchdowns.

Unfortunately, millions of kids can't hear what their teachers are saying. And it's not because these students are _ . Often, it's the room's fault. Building architecture and building design can createecho -filled classrooms that make hearing difficult. Children with hearingimpairments suffer most from noisy classrooms. They sometimes can't hear questions that other students ask in class. Compared with kids with healthy hearing, they have a harder time picking up new vocabulary words by hearing them in talking. Even kids with normal hearing have a harder time in the classroom when there's too much noise. Younger children in particular have trouble separating important sounds - like a teacher's voice - from background noise. Kids with learning disabilities and speechimpediments and kids for whom English is a second language also have a harder time learning in noisy situations. In recent years, scientists who study sound have been asking schools to reduce background noise, which may include loud air-conditioners and pipes. They're also targeting outdoor noises, such as highway traffic. Noise reduction is a big deal. Why? Because quieter classrooms might make you smarter by letting you hear your lessons better. \\"It's so obvious that we should have quiet rooms that allow for access to the lesson,\\" says Dan Ostergren, a hearing scientist. \\"Sometimes it surprises me that we spend so much time discussing this topic.

Fortnite: Battle Royale is a free-to-play game mode that gained immense popularity since its release, and it is based on the main Fortnite game, Fortnite: Save the World, which was released on July 25, 2017. Fortnite: Battle Royale is a highly competitive game that pits 100 players against each other on an ever-shrinking island until only one player or team remains. It combines elements of shooting, survival, and building to create a unique and exhilarating gaming experience. The game has continuously evolved through various seasons and updates, which introduced new gameplay features, in-game cosmetics, and overall improvements. These changes have made the game stay fresh and engaging for millions of players around the world. Over time, the Fortnite community has reminisced on earlier versions of the game, particularly the earlier seasons. These versions had a less complicated meta-game and map, with fewer items and mechanics, which some players preferred. In response to the interest in the older version of Fortnite, Epic Games introduced a limited-time mode called Classic, where players could experience the gameplay of the first two seasons. However, there hasn't been a complete return to the old version of Fortnite, as Epic Games continuously updates the game to provide new experiences and adapt to player feedback.

I wish I got the awesome host's name because she was super helpful to me the whole time I was there. Whenever I looked like I didn't know what I was doing she would come over and help me out. I also wish there was a tip jar in front because I would have loved to tip her for her awesome customer service! This place not only had great customer service, but also great food! I got my food to-go but this is pretty much how the place works: you have different options on the size of the bowl you can get to fill up. I got the small bowl but it was enough for two meals for me. They have good meat choices, yes the meat is raw and cold but that is why it stays fresh! Then they have different veggies to choose from and 3 types of noodles. You pile as much food as you can inside that bowl and they actually encourage you to cheat to get more food! They give you pieces of wax paper so that you can literally smash the food down and fit more inside the bowl. You can pile it up as high as you want...just as long as it isn't spilling all over the place. Then there is the AWESOME sauce bar. You can make your own sauce by mixing them together, or you can follow their easy instructions that show you how to make specific sauces! I told the cook that I was allergic to peanuts and without hesitation he cleaned the entire grill for me to make sure I didn't get any traces in my food. I also got one box to take either brown rice or white rice home and to-go soup bowl for a side of soup (the spicy beef was soooo good) and a drink.

Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin. - In chemistry, pH (potential of hydrogen) is a numeric scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. It is approximately the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the molar concentration, measured in units of moles per liter, of hydrogen ions. More precisely it is the negative of the logarithm to base 10 of the activity of the hydrogen ion. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. Pure water is neutral, at pH 7, being neither an acid nor a base. Contrary to popular belief, the pH value can be less than 0 or greater than 14 for very strong acids and bases respectively. - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. - In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simple cases the logarithm counts factors in multiplication. For example, the base logarithm of is , as to the power is; 10 is used as a factor three times. More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers and where is not equal to . The logarithm of to \\"base\\" , denoted , is the unique real number such that For example, as , then: - Petroleum (from : \\"rock\\" + \\"oleum\\": \\"oil\\". ) is a naturally occurring, yellow-to-black liquid found in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface, which is commonly refined into various types of fuels. Components of petroleum are separated using a technique called fractional distillation. - Sunset Yellow FCF ( also known as Orange Yellow S , or C.I. 15985 ) is a petroleum - derived orange azo dye with a pH dependent maximum absorption at about 480 nm at pH 1 and 443 nm at pH 13 with a shoulder at 500 nm . When added to foods sold in the US it is known as FD&C Yellow 6 ; when sold in Europe , it is denoted by E Number E110 . - Fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component parts, or fractions, separating chemical compounds by their boiling point by heating them to a temperature at which one or more fractions of the compound will vaporize. It uses distillation to fractionate. Generally the component parts have boiling points that differ by less than 25 °C from each other under a pressure of one atmosphere. If the difference in boiling points is greater than 25 °C, a simple distillation is typically used. - A hydrogen ion is created when a hydrogen atom loses or gains an electron. A lone positively charged hydrogen ion (or proton) can readily combine with other particles and therefore is only seen isolated when it is in a gaseous state or a nearly particle free space. Due to its extremely high charge density of approximately 2×10 times that of a sodium ion, the bare hydrogen ion cannot exist freely in solution as it readily hydrates, i.e., bonds quickly. The hydrogen ion is recommended by IUPAC as a general term for all ions of hydrogen and its isotopes. Depending on the charge of the ion, two different classes can be distinguished: positively charged ions and negatively charged ions. - Distillation is a process of separating the component or substances from a liquid mixture by selective evaporation and condensation. Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components of the mixture. In either case the process exploits differences in the volatility of the mixture's components. In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process and not a chemical reaction. - A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena. - A mordant or dye fixative is a substance used to set dyes on fabrics or tissue sections by forming a coordination complex with the dye which then attaches to the fabric or tissue. It may be used for dyeing fabrics, or for intensifying stains in cell or tissue preparations. The term mordant comes from the present participle of French \\"mordre\\", \\"to bite\\". In the past, it was thought that a mordant helped the dye bite onto the fiber so that it would hold fast during washing. A mordant is often a polyvalent metal ion. The resulting coordination complex of dye and ion is colloidal and can be either acidic or alkaline. - Molar concentration, also called molarity, amount concentration or substance concentration, is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution, or of any chemical species, in terms of amount of substance in a given volume. A commonly used unit for molar concentration used in chemistry is mol/L. A solution of concentration 1 mol/L is also denoted as 1 molar (1 ). - A dye is a colored substance that has an affinity to the substrate to which it is being applied. The dye is generally applied in an aqueous solution, and may require a mordant to improve the fastness of the dye on the fiber. - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. - An aqueous solution is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is usually shown in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant chemical formula. For example, a solution of table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), in water would be represented as Na(aq) + Cl(aq). The word \\"aqueous\\" means pertaining to, related to, similar to, or dissolved in water. As water is an excellent solvent and is also naturally abundant, it is a ubiquitous solvent in chemistry. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Oleum (Latin \\"oleum\\" = \\"oil\\"), or fuming sulfuric acid, is a solution of various compositions of sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid, or sometimes more specifically to disulfuric acid (also known as pyrosulfuric acid). Oleum is idenfied by the CAS number 8014-95-7. - In computer science, ACID (\\"Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability\\") is a set of properties of database transactions. In the context of databases, a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction. - E numbers are codes for substances that are permitted to be used as food additives for use within the European Union and Switzerland. The \\"E\\" stands for \\"Europe\\". Commonly found on food labels, their safety assessment and approval are the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority. - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I can use this background: Like water in the ocean, air in the atmosphere exerts pressure that increases with depth. Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth’s surface by gravity. As a result, air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and then more slowly at higher altitudes. This is illustrated in Figure below . Air pressure is greatest at sea level, where the depth of the atmosphere is greatest. At higher altitudes, the pressure is less because the depth of the atmosphere is less. For example, on top of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level. At such high altitudes, low air pressure makes it hard to breathe and is dangerous to human health. Now, I have a new situation: There are two neighboring cities, Brampton and Filtroy. The two towns depend on each other by trading supplies and goods regularly. Filtroy is located on top of a very tall mountain, and Brampton is situated at the base of this hill. For this reason, it can sometimes be difficult to traverse the roads to trade goods, but it's important to do it so both cities can thrive. Answer this question please: Which city has lower air pressure? The answer is:","completion":"Filtroy has lower air pressure. This conclusion can be drawn from the information provided in the background text on air pressure and the given situation of the two neighboring cities, Brampton and Filtroy. To better understand why Filtroy experiences lower air pressure, let's revisit some key points about air pressure and altitude. Air pressure is the force exerted by the weight of air molecules on a given area. In the Earth's atmosphere, most of these gas molecules are pulled close to the surface due to the force of gravity. As you ascend or move to higher altitudes, for instance, when climbing a mountain, the number of air molecules above you decreases. Consequently, the air pressure at higher altitudes is less than that at lower altitudes, since there is less atmosphere pressing down upon you. Coming back to the situation of Brampton and Filtroy, it is mentioned that Brampton is located at the base of the mountain, while Filtroy is situated at the top of the mountain. Based on the relationship between altitude and air pressure, it is evident that Filtroy, being at a higher altitude than Brampton, experiences lower air pressure due to its elevation. In addition to the lower air pressure, the residents of Filtroy may experience difficulty in breathing and other altitude-related health issues. This is because, as mentioned in the background text, at high altitudes, low air pressure can make it hard to breathe and pose a danger to human health. Therefore, it is important to be mindful of these health risks when traveling between the two cities, especially for those journeying to Filtroy from Brampton. In conclusion, the city of Filtroy, which is at a higher altitude atop the mountain, experiences lower air pressure compared to Brampton, which is situated at the base of the mountain. This difference in air pressure is related to the altitude and consequently impacts human health and well-being in the two cities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's the step-by-step solution: 1. The original equation is: 13 = 4*w + 25 2. We need to get rid of the constant term 25 on the right side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 25 from both sides of the equation: 13 - 25 = 4*w + 25 - 25 3. Performing the subtraction on both sides, we get: -12 = 4*w 4. Now, we have only the term with the variable w on the right side of the equation. To isolate w, we need to divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable w, which is 4: (-12) / 4 = 4*w / 4 5.

Question: Information: - Gaius Julius Caesar (13 July 100 BC 15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC. - Eppillus ( Celtic : \`\` little horse '' ) was the name of a Roman client king of the Atrebates tribe of the British Iron Age . He was the son of Commius , the Gaulish former ally of Julius Caesar who fled to Britain following the uprising of Vercingetorix , or possibly of his son . After Commius 's death in about 20 BC , based on numismatic evidence , Eppillus seems to have ruled jointly with his brother , Tincomarus . Eppillus 's capital was Noviomagus ( Chichester ) in the south of the kingdom , while Tincomarus ruled from Calleva Atrebatum ( Silchester ) in the north . Eppillus became ruler of the whole territory a little before AD 7 , and Tincomarus appears as a supplicant to the emperor Augustus in his Res Gestae , so he would seem to have been driven out in some sort of domestic intrigue . After this , Eppillus 's coins are marked \`\` Rex '' , indicating that he was recognised as king by Rome . In about AD 15 Eppillus was succeeded as king of the Atrebates by another brother , Verica . At about the same time coins of the Cantiaci stamped with the name Eppillus start to appear in Kent , replacing those of Dubnovellaunus . It is possible that Eppillus was deposed by Verica , fled to Kent and established himself as king there , but equally possible that he was invited to become king by the Cantiaci , peacefully handing the rule of the Atrebates to his brother , or that he died and was succeeded by Verica , and that Eppillus of Kent was another man of the same name . - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - Archaeology, or archeology, is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, and cultural landscapes. Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities. In North America, archaeology is considered a sub-field of anthropology, while in Europe archaeology is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines. - Vercingetorix (or 82 BC 46 BC) was a king and chieftain of the Arverni tribe; he united the Gauls in a revolt against Roman forces during the last phase of Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars. - The Atrebates (singular \\"Atrebas\\") were a Belgic tribe of Gaul and Britain before the Roman conquests. However it is possible that the Atrebates were a family of rulers (dynasty), as there is no evidence for a major migration from Belgium to Britain. - A dynasty is a sequence of rulers from the same family, usually in the context of a feudal or monarchical system but sometimes also appearing in elective republics. The dynastic family or lineage may be known as a \\"house\\"; which may be styled \\"royal\\", \\"princely\\", \\"comital\\", etc., depending upon the chief or present title borne by its members. Historians periodize the histories of many sovereign states, such as Ancient Egypt, the Carolingian Empire and Imperial China, using a framework of successive dynasties. As such, the term \\"dynasty\\" may be used to delimit the era during which the family reigned and to describe events, trends, and artifacts of that period (\\"a Ming-dynasty vase\\"). The word \\"dynasty\\" itself is often dropped from such adjectival references (\\"a Ming vase\\"). - Commius (Commios, Comius, Comnios) was a historical king of the Belgic nation of the Atrebates, initially in Gaul, then in Britain, in the 1st century BC. - The Iron Age is an archaeological era, referring to a period of time in the prehistory and protohistory of the Old World (Afro-Eurasia) when the dominant toolmaking material was iron. It is commonly preceded by the Bronze Age in Europe and Asia with exceptions and the Stone Age in Africa. Meteoric iron has been used by humans since at least 3200 BC, but ancient iron production did not become widespread until the ability to smelt iron ore, remove impurities and regulate the amount of carbon in the alloy were developed. The start of the Iron Age proper is considered by many to fall between around 1200 BC to 600 BC, depending on the region. In most parts of the world, its end is defined by the widespread adoption of writing, and therefore marks the transition from prehistory to history. - The British Iron Age is a conventional name used in the archaeology of Great Britain, referring to the prehistoric and protohistoric phases of the Iron Age culture of the main island and the smaller islands, typically excluding prehistoric Ireland, which had an independent Iron Age culture of its own. The parallel phase of Irish archaeology is termed the Irish Iron Age. The Iron Age is not an archaeological horizon of common artefacts, but is rather a locally diverse cultural phase. - The Gallic Wars were a series of military campaigns waged by the Roman proconsul Julius Caesar against several Gallic tribes. Rome's war against the Gallic tribes lasted from 58 BC to 50 BC and culminated in the decisive Battle of Alesia in 52 BC, in which a complete Roman victory resulted in the expansion of the Roman Republic over the whole of Gaul (mainly present-day France and Belgium). While militarily just as strong as the Romans, the internal division between the Gallic tribes helped ease victory for Caesar, and Vercingetorix's attempt to unite the Gauls against Roman invasion came too late. The wars paved the way for Julius Caesar to become the sole ruler of the Roman Republic. - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\" Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'occupation'.

(CNN) -- I had hopes that with the talent of the two leads and the good buzz on director Ruben Fleischer's previous film, \\"Zombieland,\\" \\"30 Minutes or Less\\" would be more than it eventually ended up being, which is an occasionally funny, more often stupid, diversion. It's a decent way to spend 90 minutes if you have nothing else to do, but it doesn't exactly scream \\"See me in the theater!\\" The story is simple enough. Jesse Eisenberg's Nick delivers pizzas for a living, committing every moving violation in the book to get the pies to their destination on time, even when the location is clearly miles away. If he doesn't, it comes out of his pay, and one has to imagine that his pay isn't very high.","completion":"One day, Nick receives a mysterious delivery order to a remote location, where he encounters two bumbling criminals, Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson). The duo, harboring delusions of grandeur, have concocted an elaborate plan to force Nick into robbing a bank for them by strapping a bomb to his chest. Threatened with his life, Nick reluctantly agrees and recruits his best friend, Chet (Aziz Ansari), a well-intentioned but bungling school teacher, to help him pull off the improbable heist. As Nick and Chet embark on their frantic race against the clock, the dynamic between the two friends is tested at every turn, offering a few genuine laugh-out-loud moments amid the high stakes. Meanwhile, Dwayne and Travis struggle with their own ineptitude, further complicating an already chaotic scenario. Deeper into their chaotic journey, it becomes apparent that the key to overcoming this seemingly insurmountable challenge might just lie in the friendship and trust forged between Nick and Chet. Throughout their ordeal, they learn to rely on one another, even as the tension between them reaches new heights. While \\"30 Minutes or Less\\" falls short of reaching the comedic heights of director Ruben Fleischer's previous hit, \\"Zombieland,\\" it does manage to deliver its fair share of chuckles. The chemistry between Eisenberg and Ansari is solid, if not occasionally overshadowed by the outrageous antics of McBride and Swardson. Although it doesn't quite succeed in replicating the magic of its predecessor, it does offer enough laughs to make it a passable distraction. Despite its shortcomings, \\"30 Minutes or Less\\" manages to entertain with its fast-paced action sequences, coupled with a touch of heart through the friendship between its protagonists. Unfortunately, the film misses the mark when it comes to generating genuine excitement or memorable moments, ultimately relegating itself to the category of \\"mindless entertainment.\\" As the credits roll on \\"30 Minutes or Less,\\" one can't help but feel slightly disappointed, given the raw talent on display and the potential for a truly great comedy. Instead, we're left with an acceptable, if forgettable, cinematic experience that falls short of greatness. Nevertheless, for those in search of a lighthearted, humorous escape, \\"30 Minutes or Less\\" will provide a sufficient dose of laughs and mindless action – just don't expect a masterpiece."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Washington (CNN) -- Preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon is a national security interest of both Israel and the United States, President Barack Obama said Sunday in calling for continued diplomatic efforts but also pledging that all options -- including a military effort -- remain viable. \\"All elements of American power\\" remain an option to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear power, including \\"a military effort to be prepared for any contingency,\\" Obama told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobby group. At the same time, Obama made clear that he preferred diplomacy over war both as a principle and in the case of Iran, and he warned that \\"too much loose talk of war\\" with Iran only benefits the Iranian government by driving up the price of oil. Israel \\"does not seek\\" war,","completion":"but it will also do whatever is necessary to protect itself, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in response to Obama's speech. The two leaders agreed on the importance of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and pledged to continue close cooperation and diplomatic efforts. Over the next several months, diplomatic efforts between the United States, Israel, and Iran intensified. Sanctions on Iran were tightened, further crippling its economy. These increased pressures sparked internal protests and criticism of the Iranian regime's pursuit of a nuclear program. Realizing that their position was becoming increasingly untenable, Iranian leaders reluctantly agreed to engage in negotiations with the international community. With the United States and Israel maintaining a strong military presence nearby as a deterrent, a series of tense negotiations took place. Various leaders within the European Union and the United Nations joined the discussion to solidify a united front against Iran's nuclear ambitions. After several weeks of negotiation, a breakthrough occurred: Iran agreed to halt uranium enrichment and dismantle key aspects of its nuclear program. In return, the United States, Israel, and the European Union agreed to gradually lift economic sanctions on Iran, allowing the country's economy to recover from years of isolation. This agreement, which many deemed a near-impossible feat, was hailed as a significant diplomatic success. Yet, the agreement was met with skepticism among some international observers who worried that Iran might secretly continue its nuclear program. To address these concerns, the deal included a comprehensive inspection regime to verify Iran's compliance with the agreement. Struggling to regain its footing, Iran's economy slowly started to recover as they abided by the terms of the agreement. The success of the diplomatic efforts helped reduce tensions in the region, and the possibility of an armed conflict involving Iran, the United States, and Israel began to recede. Years later, it became clear that the diplomatic efforts made at that time had, indeed, averted the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the Middle East. The world had narrowly avoided the brink of a devastating conflict, and as a result, a relatively more peaceful era in Middle Eastern relations had begun."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Striking the wasps can greatly alter the effectiveness of your insecticide. Providing a flying strike allows you to quickly injure the wasps.. (2). The wasps you encounter won't be harmed by the flyswatter, so you are happy to swat them back. Wasps are called ticks because they possess special electrodes that you placed around their backs that utilize the fly-control function.. (3). Note that this is a very risky tactic, however. Wasps are quick, and if you have slow reflexes, you are likely to get stung when the wasp flies away and tries to defend itself.. (4). Swatting wasps with a flyswatter essentially will not only hurt them, but may even.

Continue writing the following text. Felicia asked Lindsey to go the basement for her because Possible answers: a. Felicia isn't scared of it.. b. Lindsey isn't scared of it..","completion":"Felicia asked Lindsey to go to the basement for her because Lindsey isn't scared of it. Unlike Felicia, who always felt a shiver down her spine when she thought about venturing into the dark, damp space beneath their house, Lindsey approached it with an air of casual confidence. To Lindsey, the basement was just another part of their home that served a practical purpose, aiding in her understanding of the request. Throughout their childhood, the two girls had always had contrasting attitudes towards the basement. For Felicia, it harbored an unsettling energy that seemed to emanate from the darkness that enveloped the room. She vividly remembered the stories her older siblings told her about creatures lurking in the shadows and how she, as the youngest child at the time, was their most vulnerable target. These childhood fears continued to linger, and even though Felicia now understood that those tales were nothing more than fabrications meant to scare her, she still couldn't suppress her discomfort whenever the basement was mentioned. On the other hand, Lindsey had never been one to back down from a challenge, and she considered the basement to be just that. In her mind, the basement represented a space of independence and resourcefulness. She had spent hours down there, searching for makeshift materials to craft into something new and exciting. Lindsey relished the idea of exploring the unknown, and to her, the basement was her own personal sanctuary in which to do so; an underground maze filled with potential treasures waiting to be discovered. Their differences, in many ways, proved to be an advantage as they learned to divide and conquer various household tasks. In times when something needed to be retrieved from or stored in the basement, Lindsey was always the first to take on the responsibility. Likewise, Felicia tackled tasks with which Lindsey was less comfortable. The two complemented each other well, each balancing out the other's reservations. This particular day was no exception. As Lindsey descended the creaky wooden stairs into the basement, she thought about her sister upstairs. At the request of their parents, the girls had been asked to retrieve some important documents stored in a box in one of the basement's many nooks. Although Felicia had initially fought to overcome her fear, it was clear that her heart just wasn't in it. And so, in the spirit of sisterly protection, Lindsey graciously volunteered to be the one to venture down instead. It wasn't long before Lindsey found the desired box, and with a satisfied grin, she began her ascent back up the stairs. With pride and courage, she carried the documents back up to the safety of the main floor, where Felicia eagerly awaited her return. Grateful for her sister's bravery and reassured by her safe arrival, Felicia thanked Lindsey sincerely. In the end, it was not about who was scared of the basement or who was not. It was about two sisters knowing and understanding each other's fears and capabilities, and supporting each other when needed. This shared experience, along with many others, helped Felicia and Lindsey form an unbreakable bond, one that they would cherish throughout their lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While this would be an appropriate place to find a toilet for public use, the term \\"stall\\" refers more to the enclosure rather than the entire accessible area where the public can find and use the toilet. 4. Hospital: A hospital is a medical facility where toilets are available, but they are primarily intended for patients, staff, and visitors. Some hospitals might have public restrooms, but since hospitals are mainly focused on providing healthcare services, it is not the primary place people would think of when looking for a public restroom. 5. Rest area: A rest area is a facility usually found along highways or major roads, designed for travelers to pull over and take a break, use restroom facilities, and access other amenities such as vending machines or picnic areas. Public restrooms are one of the main features of rest areas, making them the best choice for finding a toilet that anyone can use. These restrooms are designed specifically to cater to the needs of travelers and are maintained by responsible authorities to ensure cleanliness and accessibility for all users."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Harry Reid, retiring but betting big on Nevada for Democratic Senate majority LAS VEGAS — The formidable political machine Harry M. Reid built in Nevada will face its most difficult task to date when it tries to hold on to the Senate seat being vacated by the retiring minority leader next year. After getting crushed in the 2014 midterm elections, Senate Democrats have a chance to win back the majority a year from now. If successful, they would set the chamber’s agenda and, more important in the short run, control the nomination process for the next president’s Cabinet. That would require a four-seat gain if the Democratic candidate wins the presidency or a five-seat gain if the GOP retakes the White House. With Reid’s retirement, Nevada has the only Democratic-held seat in jeopardy in 2016, and if Democrats can retain it, a lot of pressure would be placed on the five freshman Republicans who are seeking reelection in states that President Obama won twice: Illinois, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Replacing Reid on the ballot will be Catherine Cortez Masto, a former state attorney general whose campaign will rely heavily on the political infrastructure the outgoing senator assembled in the past decade. The collection of labor unions, particularly casino workers, and burgeoning populations of Hispanics and Asian Americans have turned a state that traditionally tilted Republican in presidential elections toward Democrats in recent years. The question is whether the machine can deliver the state’s electoral votes for the Democratic presidential nominee for a third straight election, while also retaining the Senate seat with Masto, a political figure who represents a sharp departure from Reid. There’s no doubt that Reid, 75, a Mormon with more than four decades of statewide campaigns under his belt, presents a different profile from Masto, 51, who is attempting to become the first Latina elected to the U.S. Senate. “I’m younger and Latino with a different voice and different issues that we’ve worked on,” Masto said recently at the state party’s headquarters south of this city’s famed Strip. Those differences became clear Monday, when Masto broke from Obama and congressional Democratic leaders to “share the concerns of some Republicans in Congress” about the vetting process for Syrian refugees, in light of Friday’s attacks in Paris and the potential connection of terrorists exploiting the refu­gee crisis to move into western Europe. In the interview, she signaled a more hawkish foreign policy than Obama or her mentor, Reid, supporting a more robust arming of rebels, such as the Kurds in Iraq. That position will test whether this next-generation candidate can maintain the same support as Reid and Obama, while distancing herself from them on certain issues to demonstrate her independence. Given the stakes, Republicans in Nevada are just as energized. A GOP win here by their likely candidate, Rep. Joe Heck, would probably ensure their majority for two more years. And there is no discounting the desire among some Republicans for the symbolic victory of grabbing the seat held by a political enemy for the past 12 years. Party leaders would like to play down that notion, however. “I don’t think of it in those terms,” said Sen. Roger Wicker (Miss.), chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “I think it’s a great opportunity for a pickup. We’re looking at defending our majority and building on it. It’s a very important seat for that reason.” The climate of the 2016 Senate race is relatively rare; Reid and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is leaving the Senate to run for president, are the only two senators retiring from competitive swing seats. Most critical races will feature a first-term Republican trying to win reelection in a much different climate from the 2010 midterms, when the GOP seized the House majority and cut deep into Reid’s majority at the time. To some degree, Reid is back where he started as the Democratic leader in 2005, serving in the minority trying to regain the majority while also trying to shore up his home flank. He said that he is “devoting a huge amount of my time” to helping Masto win at home and to assure that his likely successor, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), takes the baton from Reid with a new majority. “It’s so much better to be majority leader than minority leader,” Reid said at The Washington Post’s “2016 Pregame” event on the eve of last month’s presidential debate here. [Watch Harry Reid discuss the 2016 races and Nevada’s role in national politics] Although Reid won reelection in 2004, President George W. Bush also was reelected and carried Nevada, the eighth Republican in the previous 10 presidential campaigns to do so. Republicans held a slight edge in voter registration at the time, and Reid realized he needed to rebuild the state’s Democratic Party. His idea was to push Nevada from the middle of the pack on the presidential primary and caucus calendar closer to the front of the line. Officially, the effort was about placing a diverse western state and a heavily African American state, South Carolina, behind the small states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Those two traditional early-voting states did not, Reid explained, “demonstrate what America is all about, for a lot of different reasons. Nevada does that.” Not only was Nevada early on the calendar in the 2008 contest, it became a brutal primary battle between Obama and then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.), in which each candidate raced to register as many new voters as possible, particularly Latino workers in Las Vegas who had never been considered part of a crucial voting bloc. By the end of the 2008 primary season, Democrats held a voter registration edge of more than 100,000 over Nevada Republicans, a stunning turnaround that played a key role in giving Obama a 12 percentage-point victory in the general election. Moreover, that effort, led by Reid’s top political adviser Rebecca Lambe, fortified his own advantage heading into the 2010 election, which Reid won handily. In 2014, however, the state was less friendly toward Democrats. Republicans won the most prominent statewide offices and the GOP has cut the voter registration deficit to less than 60,000. If Heck becomes the Senate nominee, Republicans will have landed a candidate who will run more heavily on his biography than on his experience serving three terms in the House. “A general, a doctor, small-business person, a great legislator, a good vote-getter in a swing district,” Wicker said, rattling off the résumé of the brigadier general in the Army Reserve. “I like our chances.” Masto, however, intends to make the race very much about Heck’s record in Washington, particularly the positions he has taken on immigration. Hispanics now account for about 15 percent of the votes in Nevada — and nearly 30 percent of the entire population — so Heck’s support for revoking birthright citizenship for all immigrants will be a frequent refrain from Masto and her outside supporters. Heck has opposed efforts to block Obama’s executive action that stopped the deportation of children brought to the United States illegally by adults, trying to walk a fine line between that and opposing other immigration-related executive orders. She wants to focus the race on her record as attorney general of prosecuting sex traffickers and business fraud that led to the mortgage crisis. Republicans accuse her of marching to Reid’s orders in at least one instance, the prosecution of a Republican in a corruption case that was later dropped, when that GOP official was considering challenging Reid in 2010. Back then, Reid benefited from a far-right conservative opponent, Sharron Angle, who won a heavily contested primary; Democrats are again trying to bait Angle into a primary campaign against Heck. Two years later, in 2012, Sen. Dean Heller (R) edged his way past the Reid machine in a presidential election year, defeating Democrat Shelley Berkley by 1 percent. In that case, Berkley was battling ethics issues and Heller’s plurality victory, at 46 percent, was aided by an unusual state law that allows Nevadans to vote “none of the above.” Ultimately, Masto is trying to thread the needle to run under the full auspices of that massive political infrastructure Reid built for Democrats, but also run as her own person. “I’m a different voice,” she said.

Dip the strands into a small bowl of baking soda for a few minutes. Step 1: Assess the situation and gather required materials The first step is to determine the extent of gum stuck in the hair and gather the necessary materials, such as a small bowl, baking soda, water, and a comb. Step 2: Create a baking soda paste Mix baking soda and water in a small bowl to form a paste. The consistency should be thick enough to stick to the hair without dripping. Step 3: Apply the baking soda paste to the gum-infested hair Using your fingers or a small brush, gently apply the baking soda paste to the gum-infested hair strands. Make sure to cover the gum entirely with the paste, as well as the hair around the gum to ease removal. Step 4: Let the paste sit for a few minutes Allow the baking soda paste to work on the gum for a few minutes. The baking soda helps to break down the sticky residue while also making the gum more brittle so that it is easier to remove. Step 5: Gently comb out the gum Using a comb or your fingers, gently start to comb or slide out the gum from the hair strands. Be patient and take your time to avoid damaging the hair. Step 6: Rinse and wash the hair Once the gum is successfully removed, rinse and wash the hair to remove any remaining baking soda paste. Make sure to condition the hair after washing, as the baking soda can sometimes be drying."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please briefly summarize this news article: Review of Louie season 3 premiere, \\"Something Is Wrong\\" Louis CK and Gaby Hoffmann in the season premiere. Spoilers for last night’s Louie below: In “Something Is Wrong,” the the season premiere of Louie, Louis CK’s alter ego protagonist bought himself a motorcycle. I’ve seen the first five episodes of the third season by now, and it’s clear that Louis CK is driving a powerful vehicle, as well, and the accelerator is jammed: after an already strong second season (#1 on my best-shows list for 2011), each episode is better than the previous one. I am beginning to worry that if it gets any better, it will break my TV. The return episode is strong enough in its own right, and plays like a kind of sampler of Louie’s strengths. I was weeping at the opening masturbation / reading glasses joke, capped off by the guilty assumption about the sales clerk at the pharmacy. (“You ain’t readin’ shit!”). There was the surreal comedy of the parking gag, with the just-ever-so-off street signs. There was the midlife-crisis and physical comedy with the motorcycle (accompanied by one of the show’s occasional montage-love-letters to Manhattan). And above all, there was the brilliant breakup exchange in the diner, with Louie’s girlfriend guessing that he wants to split, and Louie only able to confirm that she’s right–or realize that she’s right only because she brought it up?–only through his silence. From the conversation, we get that April and Louie have been a thing for a while, though he’s been hesitant to get too serious. But the genius of the scene is how the dialogue–or near-monologue–gives us the sense, just through the language, of how old and tiring this relationship is, even though we’ve just been dropped in the middle of it. (“Oh, god, why does it have to be like this? What is this, a game of relationship charades?”) It’s a fine performance by Gaby Hoffmann as April, and another good example of how well the show casts actors who look and sound like everyday Manhattanites. It may be a stretch to say that individual seasons of Louie are “about” something. But if the first season was one in which we met the character, adjusting to life after divorce (the guy we saw start crying on a date), and the second showed Louie gaining confidence as a single father and expanding the community around him, the third seems to show him putting himself out there, dating and venturing into the larger world. (Again, I’ve seen five episodes, but won’t spoil anything for you from them.) After Louie wipes out on his bike (an accident he admits to his ex-wife but is too embarrassed to relate to April), one of the last things April tells him is that he could spare them both a few years of their lives wasted by being honest about his feelings before he commits. Which is to say that getting back on that bike—literally, or metaphorically in dating—means exposing himself to the possibility of injury, either physical or emotional. It may not be painless for Louie, but it’s exciting for us. Over two previous seasons, Louis CK has built himself quite the machine here. Let’s see what this baby can do. A quick hail of bullets: * We see Louie’s ex-wife for the first time, which is quite a surprise since we’ve never seen her before and also because she’s black. (Hispanic? In any case, darker-complected than we would expect from his sister’s description of the ex in last season’s “Pregnant” as a “pasty, big-titted, black-eyed guinea bitch.” When I interviewed Louis CK last year, he said he deliberately avoided showing his character’s ex on the show at the time, and that he took care to change real-life details in any references to her, so as not to seem to depicting his actual ex-wife. I suspected when I first watched the episode that the color-blind casting was a distancing attempt for that reason–and/or an outgrowth of the fact that he’s never cared a lot about some elements of continuity. In an interview with Indiewire, his explanation is a little of both—that, he says, and he simply really liked Susan Kelechi Watson’s audition. * Speaking of continuity, or lack thereof: his niece? Not around, as far as we can see. Pamela? Still off somewhere, or out of the picture? * Having dropped a giant water jug through the roof of a car its first season, Louie now destroys one with construction equipment. Here’s hoping they find another way to wreck a car next season. (And given the show’s tiny budget, good thing the first take evidently worked.) * As mentioned before, I’m on vacation, and Robo-James is posting this while I’m away. So I probably won’t be able to join in the comments section, but have at it. Summary:","completion":"In the season 3 premiere of Louie, titled \\"Something is Wrong,\\" protagonist Louie, played by Louis CK, buys a motorcycle and faces the consequences of his actions. The episode showcases the show's strengths, including moments of both surreal comedy and heartfelt drama. In the episode's most notable scene, Louie goes through a realistic and relatable breakup with his girlfriend, portrayed by Gaby Hoffmann. As the third season progresses, the show explores Louie's growth as a single father, dating, and venturing into the world. The premiere introduces Louie's ex-wife, who viewers had yet to see and serves as an example of the show's excellent casting choices. Overall, the season 3 premiere is a powerful and promising opening for the critically acclaimed show."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton's lead over Sen. Barack Obama, her chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, is growing among African-American voters who are registered Democrats, and particularly among black women, a poll said Wednesday. Sen. Hillary Clinton is the top choice of African-American Democrats, a new poll suggests. Among black registered Democrats overall, Clinton had a 57 percent to 33 percent lead over Obama. That's up from 53 percent for Clinton and 36 percent for Obama in a poll carried out in April. The 26-point difference between black women and men underscores the fact that the nation's vote is divided not only by race, but also by gender, said CNN political analyst Bill Schneider. \\"Black women don't just vote their black identity,\\" he said. \\"They also vote their identity as women.\\" Watch","completion":"Bill Schneider discuss the poll results and the impact on the Democratic race The increasing gap between Clinton and Obama in the African-American voter demographic can be attributed to a variety of factors. One such factor is the appeal of Clinton's policies and history to black women, who identify with her both as a woman and as a politician supporting their interests. This goes to show that as the Democratic race heats up, candidates need to consider the intersectionality of voters' identities in order to effectively appeal to their target electorate. As the campaign progresses, ensuring African-American voters’ concerns and needs are addressed will be crucial for both candidates, recognizing the importance of winning over this demographic for the Democratic nomination.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Children are known to be very keen observers and once they are interested in something, it is very likely to stay with them for life. They tend to look at life through the eyes of the person they are close to or want to be like. If their role model is optimistic, there are more chances of them optimistic. The role model becomes their standard of measurement. Because they follow the actions of their role models so closely, children adopt the personality and attitude of their role models. Children learn to like or dislike certain things by _ the personality and attitude of the people they admire. One reason why children keep changing their answers to \\"what would you like to be when you grow up\\" is that they are influenced by individuals in a certain field. Children view the social relationships (family or public) mainly in the light of the importance these relationships hold in the life of their role models. Their expression of their feelings is many times a reflection of their role model's outlook. According to a study, around 56% of teenagers identified with the role models. Out of these, those having personal or direct contact with their role models had higher self-esteem and were better at academics compared to those who didn't. As such, children who have positive role models, have more self-confidence and are more optimistic about their future. They learn to handle themselves well in social settings and positively interact with those around them. Of course, children who have their parents as positive role models have a well-rounded outlook towards life. They find it easier to deal with the highs and lows of life because they have seen their parents do it before. They find a sense of stability and security knowing that they will overcome failures just like their parents before them. Besides, it becomes easier for parents to discipline and guide children. So it is no wonder why children who have parents as their role models have fewer behavioral issues. Question: This article is mainly about _ .

Regardless, Haley said, US patience with North Korea is \\"not unlimited.\\" \\"Only the strongest sanctions will enable us to resolve this problem through diplomacy,\\" she told her colleagues on the security council. \\"We have kicked the can down the road long enough.

Haley's comments came during an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, where she urged for the \\"strongest possible measures\\" against North Korea. Nuclear Test On Sunday, North Korea conducted a nuclear test by detonating a thermonuclear warhead underground. Expert analysis suggests that the explosive had a power range of between 50 and 150 kilotons. This is a significant increase in comparison to the power of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima at the end of World War II. Pyongyang's Claims North Korea claims to have the capability to reduce the size of the warhead and attach it to an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the US mainland. Some analysts, however, are skeptical about the truthfulness of this claim. US Response In response to the latest test, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis stated that the US will respond to North Korean threats with a \\"massive military response – a response both effective and overwhelming.\\" Ambassador Haley emphasized that US patience with North Korea is \\"not unlimited.\\" Sanctions and Diplomacy Haley called for the strongest sanctions possible to help resolve the issue through diplomacy. \\"Enough is enough,\\" she said, acknowledging that the incremental approach taken thus far has failed. \\"We have kicked the can down the road long enough. There is no more road left.\\" Conclusion As tensions continue to rise, recent events emphasize the urgency for an international diplomatic solution. The UN Security Council will need to carefully consider the best course of action, taking into account the implications on global security and the dangerous potential of further provocations."},{"prompt":"When Patch finally found his way out of the seed-pod, Toro was gone, and there were rats all around him.

There was another smell too, mixed with that of the rats. The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey. \\"What do you want?\\" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods.

There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so did all other animals.

George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade.

Write an article based on this summary: A property developer who illegally altered a 16th Century Monmouthshire mansion had wall plaques that appeared to be made from children's gravestones, a court has been told. Article:","completion":"Title: Monmouthshire Mansion Renovation Scandal: Developer's Use of Alleged Children's Gravestones for Wall Plaques Introduction A shocking discovery has been revealed in the ongoing criminal trial involving a property developer who stands accused of illegally altering a 16th-century Monmouthshire mansion. The court was told that wall plaques found on the premises appeared to have been made from children's gravestones, adding a layer of macabre to an already contentious case. This article delves into the details of this deeply disturbing incident, shedding light on an unconscionable act that has shaken the community and sparked widespread outrage. The Mansion and its Historic Significance The Monmouthshire mansion in question, a magnificent structure dating back to the 16th century, has captured the imagination of historians and architecture enthusiasts alike. Its storied past and architectural grandeur make it an invaluable piece of British heritage. Consequently, any attempts to alter or renovate such a structure must adhere strictly to preservation guidelines set forth by local authorities to maintain its historical integrity. The Property Developer's Unscrupulous Actions The defendant at the center of this unfolding scandal is a property developer who reportedly disregarded these guidelines in a relentless pursuit of profit. The court heard allegations of unauthorized alterations and renovation work carried out on the historic mansion, including demolitions of sections deemed to be of significant historical value. These acts of destruction were allegedly carried out without obtaining the necessary permissions from local authorities, rendering them unlawful in addition to being deeply disrespectful of the mansion's unique place in history. Gravestone Wall Plaques: A Morbid Discovery During the investigation into the property developer's actions, a shocking revelation emerged: wall plaques found inside the mansion appeared to be made from children's gravestones. This disturbing discovery adds an even darker element to this already sordid tale. The utilization of what are widely considered sacred memorials of the deceased for decorative purposes not only raises serious ethical questions but also may have legal ramifications for the defendant. If proven true, this would be a callous display of utter disrespect for the sanctity of life. Community Reaction and Legal Implications The shocking details of this case have caused ripples of anger and disbelief throughout the local community and beyond. Historians and preservation experts have expressed dismay at the defendant's blatant disregard for the historical importance of the Monmouthshire mansion. Similarly, residents are not only appalled by the illegal renovations but are also horrified by the alleged use of children's gravestones as mere decorative items. Legally, the defendant faces numerous charges related to breaching preservation guidelines and carrying out unauthorized alterations to a historic building. Additionally, if it is proven that the gravestones were indeed acquired and repurposed illegally, further charges may be levied against the defendant. Conclusion The case of the Monmouthshire mansion and its desecrated gravestone wall plaques serve as a harrowing reminder of the lengths some individuals may go to in the name of profit. This disturbing event highlights the importance of vigilant oversight and preservation efforts to protect invaluable historical structures from the unsavory acts of unscrupulous individuals. As this case continues to unfold, it stands as a testament to the fact that the allure of financial gain can sometimes overshadow the most basic principles of human decency and respect for history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"What error of attribution was made by Chesterfield, Warburton, and others?\\" Context: \\"Burke claimed that Bolingbroke's arguments against revealed religion could apply to all social and civil institutions as well. Lord Chesterfield and Bishop Warburton (and others) initially thought that the work was genuinely by Bolingbroke rather than a satire. All the reviews of the work were positive, with critics especially appreciative of Burke's quality of writing. Some reviewers failed to notice the ironic nature of the book, which led to Burke stating in the preface to the second edition (1757) that it was a satire.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The error of attribution made by Lord Chesterfield, Bishop Warburton, and others concerning the work of Edmund Burke lies in their mistaken belief that the authorship belonged to Lord Bolingbroke rather than recognizing it as a satire by Burke. To provide a comprehensive understanding of this error, we need to delve into the context in which these misattributions took place. In 1756, Edmund Burke wrote a book titled \\"A Vindication of Natural Society,\\" which served as a satirical critique of Lord Bolingbroke's ideas. Lord Bolingbroke was a prominent British statesman and political philosopher who voiced strong criticisms against revealed religion, arguing that religious doctrines should be derived merely from reason and the observation of nature. Burke employed satire to expand Bolingbroke's arguments beyond religion, demonstrating that if Bolingbroke's rationalistic approach were applied to other social and civil institutions, it would lead to the collapse of organized society. However, this satirical intent was not immediately evident to some readers, including Lord Chesterfield and Bishop Warburton. They wrongly believed that the work was an authentic representation of Bolingbroke's ideology, displaying an error of attribution by crediting the book's authorship to the wrong individual. The failure to recognize the satirical nature of the work is an example of \\"irony blindness,\\" where some individuals struggle to discern underlying irony in a text or statement. The reviews of \\"A Vindication of Natural Society\\" were generally positive, with many critics praising the quality of Burke's writing. However, even some reviewers overlooked the ironical nature of the book, which might have contributed to the confusion surrounding authorship. To clarify the true intent of his work, Burke added a preface to the second edition in 1757, explicitly stating that the book was a satire. In conclusion, the error of attribution made by Chesterfield, Warburton, and others regarding Burke's work can be attributed to irony blindness and the failure to recognize the text as a satirical critique of Lord Bolingbroke's ideas. Consequently, they mistakenly identified Bolingbroke as the author instead of the true author, Edmund Burke."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In Rebecca's case, she had a bad home life which made it difficult for her to stay any longer than necessary. Growing up, she constantly experienced volatile situations that left her feeling unsafe and uncomfortable, longing for stability and a sense of normalcy. Rebecca's bad home life stemmed from a variety of factors, including her parents' tumultuous relationship, emotional and verbal abuse, and a feeling of utter neglect. Unable to cope with the constant stress and anxiety that these issues burdened her with, she knew that the only way to escape was by leaving as soon as she could. On the other hand, Monica had her own set of challenges that made her home life unbearable too. Although her circumstances were different from Rebecca's, the outcome was still the same - the desire to flee from a toxic environment. In Monica's situation, her parents were overly critical and controlling, never respecting her autonomy or allowing her to make her own decisions. As an older sister, Monica always tried to protect and support Rebecca, even while dealing with her own struggles.

According to reports, suspect Fernando Castro, 19, was killed in a shootout with Search for kidnapped Vallejo girl shifts to Sonoma County coast The search for a kidnapped Vallejo girl shifted to the Sonoma County coastal town of Jenner on Friday, a day after the suspect in her abduction was killed in a police shootout nearly 400 miles to the south in Santa Barbara County. Solano County Sheriff’s Department officials worked with the Sonoma County Sheriff’s office to conduct a search for 15-year-old Pearl Pinson in an area near Willow Creek Road in Jenner, said sheriff’s Deputy Christine Castillo, a spokeswoman for the agency. Castillo would only say that the focus of the search shifted to Jenner “based on information we have received during our investigation.” She declined to discuss what evidence investigators uncovered that prompted them to search in Jenner. Earlier Friday, investigators were combing an area under the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, where a security camera caught Pearl’s alleged abductor, Fernando Castro, 19, driving around Thursday — hours before he was killed in a Santa Barbara County gunbattle with police. Solano County Sheriff’s Department officials said Castro was spotted about 9:30 a.m. Thursday driving a 1997 Saturn in the area of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard near the Marin County side of the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge. An automatic license plate reader triggered a traffic camera to pick up the car in the area after an Amber Alert was issued for Pearl and authorities sent out an all-points-bulletin with a photo of the Saturn and its license plate number, said Solano County Sheriff Tom Ferrara. The security footage showed Castro apparently alone in the car, but officials said the missing girl could have been lying down in the back seat and not visible to the camera. Detectives spent Friday morning in the area searching for more surveillance footage, hoping it will help them find Pearl alive. Pearl never made it to school Wednesday morning and was last seen about 7 a.m. She was wearing a black-and-turquoise backpack, according to the Solano County Sheriff’s Office. Later Wednesday morning, several witnesses called police and reported seeing a girl bleeding, screaming and being dragged into a car on the Interstate 780 overpass near Home Acres and Taylor avenues. Police said witnesses saw the abductor holding a gun. Officials believe Castro and Pearl were acquainted. “I’m overwhelmed and I’m worried sick about her,” Rose Pinson, a sister of the missing girl, told reporters at a vigil in Vallejo Thursday night. “So much is going through my mind, I don’t know what to believe. I just want her found.” On Thursday afternoon sheriff deputies in Santa Barbara spotted Castro driving alone around Solvang and gave chase. He drove into a mobile home park, where he jumped into another vehicle and fired shots at law enforcement officers before being fatally shot by return fire, authorities said. “Obviously, this ramps up the search efforts,” Ferrara said Thursday. “We continue our search and hope Pearl Pinson is alive.” Anyone with information can call Solano County sheriff’s deputies at (707) 784-1963, and urgent matters can be directed to (707) 421-7090 or 911.

The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk?

Given the question: The night when she thought she would finally be a star, Maria Isabella du'l Cielo struggled to calm the trembling of her hands, reached over to cut the tether that tied her to the ground, and thought of that morning many years before when she'd first caught a glimpse of Lorenzo du Vicenzio ei Salvadore: tall, thick-browed and handsome, his eyes closed, oblivious to the cacophony of the accident waiting to occur around him. Maria Isabella had just turned sixteen then, and each set of her padrinos had given her (along with the sequined brida du caballo, the dresses of rare tulle, organza, and seda, and the diadema floral du'l dama -- the requisite floral circlet of young womanhood) a purse filled with coins to spend on anything she wanted. And so she'd gone past the Calle du Leones (where sleek cats of various pedigrees sometimes allowed themselves to be purchased, though if so, only until they tired of their new owners), walked through the Avenida du'l Conquistadores (where the statues of the conquerors of Ciudad Meiora lined the entirety of the broad promenade) and made her way to the Encantu lu Caminata (that maze-like series of interconnected streets, each leading to some wonder or marvel for sale), where little musical conch shells from the islets near Palao'an could be found. Those she liked very much. In the vicinity of the Plaza Emperyal, she saw a young man dressed in a coat embroidered with stars walk almost surely to his death. In that instant, Maria Isabella knew two things with the conviction reserved only for the very young: first, that she almost certainly loved this reckless man; and second, that if she simply stepped on a dog's tail -- the very dog watching the same scene unfold right next to her -- she could avert the man's seemingly senseless death.

At 18 years old, one year older than Edward was when he became a vampire, Bella expresses her dislike to the idea of marrying so young, though Edward refuses to turn her into a vampire until they are married, his argument being that she should have various human experiences she would otherwise miss. While Charlie Swan investigates the disappearance of Riley Biers, Edward suspects his disappearance was caused by Victoria and her newborn's army, furthering his suspicions is Riley's intrusion into Bella's room. Bella insists that Jacob Black and the rest of the werewolf pack would never harm her. Bella wants to go to Jacob's home even though Edward expresses his dislike and concern for her safety, but she returns unharmed. During one of her visits, Jacob confesses that he is in love with Bella, and forcefully kisses her. Furious, she punches him and sprains her hand, and Edward later threatens Jacob and tells him to only kiss her if she asks him to. Bella even revokes the invitations of Jacob and his pack members to her graduation party, but when Jacob apologizes for his behavior, she forgives him.

Frog X was found in a pond in the forest and has a parasite in it. Frog Y was found just outside the laboratory and is missing one eye. The employees at the lab weren't planning on analyzing any frogs, but when they found the one outside their front door they changed their mind. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which frog is less likely to contract an illness? Hint: They feed on living hosts. As parasites , fungi live in or on other organisms and get their nutrients from their host. Parasitic fungi use enzymes to break down living tissue, which may causes illness in the host. Disease-causing fungi are parasitic. Recall that parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship between organisms of different species in which one, the parasite, benefits from a close association with the other, the host, which is harmed.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: How does Sam know the person who gets his head crushed by a statue? , can you please find it? Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated,\\" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense. Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand.

Choose from: A). place a clean pan on the burner of your stove and, after turning on the stove, heat up food or drink in it; B). place a clean pan on the burner of your stove and, before turning on the stove, heat up food or drink in it;","completion":"Option A is the better solution for achieving the goal of using a pan, which involves cooking or heating up food or drink in the pan. To fully understand why this is the case, we will go into detail on both of the steps involved in the two options. Option A: Step 1 - Place a clean pan on the burner of your stove Step 2 - After turning on the stove, heat up food or drink in it Option B: Step 1 - Place a clean pan on the burner of your stove Step 2 - Before turning on the stove, heat up food or drink in it Let's examine each step in both options and compare them for effectiveness in achieving the goal. In Option A, placing a clean pan on the burner of your stove ensures that the pan is ready to begin cooking and that there is no leftover residue from previous cooking sessions. This helps to maintain the quality of the food and ensures that it is prepared in a clean and safe environment. In the second step of Option A, turning on the stove and then heating the food or drink in the pan is the correct method for cooking. When the stove is turned on, the burner heats up, and the heat is then transferred to the bottom of the pan, raising the temperature of the pan and its contents. As the heat continues to increase, the food or drink in the pan will cook, achieving the goal of using the pan. In Option B, the first step of placing the clean pan on the burner of the stove is the same as Option A, providing a clean and ready-to-cook surface. However, the second step of Option B is problematic, as it suggests heating up food or drink in the pan before turning on the stove. Without a heat source, it is not possible to cook, warm up or achieve the desired temperature for the food or drink that is placed in the pan. This method would render the pan useless for achieving the goal of using it. In conclusion, considering the effectiveness of each option in reaching the goal of using a pan to cook or heat up food or drink, Option A is clearly the better solution. This method includes placing a clean pan on the burner of your stove and then turning on the stove to heat up the food or drink in the pan properly, enabling efficient cooking and achieving the desired results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the evolutionary significance of communisim and how has it changed modern society? What is the evolutionary significance of marketing and how has it changed modern society? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Step 1: Understand the tasks The tasks given are to discuss the evolutionary significance of communism and marketing and how they have changed modern society. Step 2: Clarify the concepts and questions In order to perform the task, it's important to have a good understanding of communism, marketing, and the concept of evolutionary significance. Communism: A political and economic system where the means of production are publicly owned, and wealth is distributed according to the needs of individuals. Marketing: The process of promoting, selling, and distributing a product or service to consumers. Evolutionary significance: Refers to how a certain characteristic, behavior, or phenomenon has influenced or impacted the development or progress of a species or society over time. Considering these definitions, the given questions are: - What is the evolutionary significance of communism, and how has it changed modern society? - What is the evolutionary significance of marketing, and how has it changed modern society? Step 3: Analyze the questions It is clear that the two questions are not paraphrases of each other since they refer to different phenomena (communism and marketing). However, they do share a common structure. Both questions are asking about the evolutionary significance of a particular phenomenon and how that phenomenon has impacted modern society. Step 4: Perform the task Discussing the evolutionary significance of communism and how it has changed modern society: Communism has had a significant impact on human societies, particularly during the 20th century. Its evolutionary significance lies mainly in its attempts to challenge and overturn existing power structures and create a more equitable society. In this regard, communism has served as an alternative model to capitalism, contributing to the development of different political and economic systems. The spread of communist ideas, however, has also led to conflict and competition between nations, effecting the global political landscape. Discussing the evolutionary significance of marketing and how it has changed modern society: Marketing has a strong evolutionary significance, as it has its roots in human communication and social interaction. It has driven competition and growth in economic systems and has a critical role in the dissemination of ideas, products, and services. Marketing has become an integral part of modern society, shaping consumer behavior, influencing economies, and connecting people around the world. Through its evolution, marketing has contributed to the globalization of products and services and has fostered rapid technological advancement by creating demand for innovative solutions and improvements. As a conclusion, both communism and marketing have their own evolutionary significance and impact on modern society. They are distinct and unrelated phenomena, addressing different aspects of human society and development."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Generate a detailed description of this data.","completion":"The given data represents a golf player's performance in a sports event, breaking down the scores obtained in each round and calculating the total score. The player in question here is Grégory Havret, a professional golfer. He has finished the competition tied for the 4th (T4) place. Let's break down the data and analyze it further: 1. Score breakdown: The data provides us with three individual scores: 73, 71, and 69. These are likely the number of strokes Grégory Havret took in three different rounds of the competition. Golf scoring is based on the number of strokes a player takes to complete each hole, with the objective being to complete the course in the lowest possible number of strokes. - The first round score is 73, meaning Grégory took 73 strokes to finish the first round. - The second round score is 71, indicating he took 71 strokes to complete the second round. - The third round score is 69, in which Grégory took 69 strokes to conclude the third round. 2. Total score calculation: The data provides us with the combined sum of the scores from all three rounds, which is 213. This means that Grégory Havret needed a total of 213 strokes to complete the entire event. - Formula for calculating the total score: 73 (First Round) + 71 (Second Round) + 69 (Third Round) = 213 3. Acronyms and placements: There are two abbreviations mentioned in the data, which provide additional context to Grégory Havret's performance: - TO_PAR E: This signifies that Grégory Havret's total score is 'Even' (E) in relation to the course 'par,' meaning his cumulative score is equal to the expected total score (par) for the entire course. Generally, the term 'par' refers to the number of strokes that an expert golfer is expected to take to complete a hole or round. - T4: This acronym indicates that Grégory Havret has finished the event in a tie for the 4th (T4) place. T4 means that Grégory Havret and some other players shared the cumulative score of 213, resulting in a tie for the same position, which, in this case, is the 4th place. In conclusion, the given data describes the performance of professional golfer Grégory Havret in a sports event. During the competition, he played three rounds, achieving scores of 73, 71, and 69 strokes, respectively. His total score for the event was 213 strokes, which placed him in a tie for the 4th place. This performance is considered 'Even' in relation to the course par, indicating that Grégory finished the course with the expected expert golfer score."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, to further his research, and found these two villages situated 10 miles from each other. The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest. Was the breakdown of complex molecules lesser or greater in Valley Forest? A:","completion":"The breakdown of complex molecules in Valley Forest would be lesser compared to Peak Forest. This is because the rate of wood decay is significantly reduced in Valley Forest due to the drier conditions and the efficient drainage system composed of ditches. In contrast, Peak Forest has a higher rate of decay in wood due to the greater water saturation, providing more suitable conditions for fungi to thrive. Fungi play a crucial role in breaking down complex organic molecules like cellulose and lignin found in wood, which means that the higher presence of fungi in Peak Forest will contribute to a greater breakdown of complex molecules.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"What the fuck\\" The answer is:","completion":"Given that the review, \\"What the fuck\\", lacks any specific detail or context regarding the object being reviewed, it is challenging to accurately assign a star rating based purely on this comment. The sentiment expressed in the comment is clearly negative, thus implying a less than favorable experience with the product, service, or whatever the subject of the review is. However, star ratings typically reflect multiple factors such as quality, usability, performance, value, etc. and are expected to be derived from a more comprehensive assessment. This review offers none of that detail. Based on traditional review scales, a one-star rating or ★ is usually the lowest, which denotes a very poor experience. But considering the vagueness and distinct lack of information in the comment, assigning this as a definitive rating could be inaccurate. Therefore, while the review certainly expresses dissatisfaction, without further context or explicitly clarified sentiments, it's not entirely feasible to definitively assign a ★-rating to this review. In a practical scenario, reviews like these might not even be considered valid due to their lack of specificity. Websites and service providers often encourage users to provide balanced, detailed reviews as they offer more value to others who rely on these reviews for information. Therefore, it's important that ratings or reviews accurately reflect the experience and are informative enough for potential future customers or users. It's also worth mentioning that reviews filled with expletives or abusive language may go against the guidelines set by many platforms, possibly leading to the removal of the review, or it being replaced or hidden for violating rules of conduct. In conclusion, if faced with a review such as \\"What the fuck\\", the most rational decision would be to request further context or explanation from the reviewer, or to disqualify the comment as a valid review due to the lack of constructive input and explicit language. Only with this additional information could an accurate ★-rating be applied."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:I can use this background: Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol. Now, I have a new situation: Manny and Joe checked their cholesterol levels.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Process: - Pollution enters natural water sources such as rivers and lakes - The pollution negatively affects the water quality - The pollution negatively affects the health of plants and animals - The plants and animals have shorter, less healthy lives - The plants and animals do not reproduce very well - The number of plants and animals decreases over time - The quality of water gets worse and worse as there are no plants or animals to clean it - Eventually there is nothing living in the water and it is unusable - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is less cleanup in water happens, how will it affect LESS bad effects of pollution. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having less cleanup in water can have a direct and indirect effect on the process of pollution and its impact on the natural water sources, ultimately worsening the pollution issue. Here's how it would affect the existing process: 1. Less Cleanup: With less emphasis on water cleanup efforts, the pollution levels in natural water sources like rivers and lakes could increase more rapidly, both in the short and long term. 2. Increased Negative Effects on Water Quality: The more polluted water becomes, the more unstable and altered its chemical and physical properties become. This affects the water's oxygen levels, temperature, and the ability to support life. 3. Greater Impact on Plant and Animal Health: As pollution levels rise, it would become increasingly difficult for plants and animals to survive and thrive. They might suffer from deteriorating health conditions, genetic mutations, or diseases. 4. Reduced Reproduction Rates: With worsening pollution levels and increased stress on plants and animals, their ability to reproduce effectively could be hampered, leading to a decline in their population over time. 5. Decline in Water Ecosystem: The interconnectedness of natural water sources means that an imbalance or decline in one area has the potential to spread and cause a ripple effect on other connected ecosystems. 6. Further Decline in Water Quality: With fewer organisms available to remove contaminants and balance the ecosystem, the water quality will continue to decline, worsening the whole situation. In conclusion, a perturbation such as less cleanup in water sources would make the consequences of pollution even more pronounced, causing significant harm to the environment and water ecosystems. Increased pollution levels, coupled with less efficient removal mechanisms, would eventually lead to severely degraded water quality and negatively impact biodiversity. This could have far-reaching effects on the overall health of the environment, and it highlights the importance of both preventing pollution and ensuring proper remediation efforts are in place to mitigate its consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Gordon Hendrick (February 16, 1949) is a former Republican member of the Montana Legislature. He was elected to House District 14 which represents the Superior area. Due to Montana's term limits, he was ineligible to run for re-election in 2012. He was succeeded by Republican candidate Nicholas Schwaderer for the 2013 legislature cycle.

Gordon Hendrick voted against legalizing weed","completion":"To draw a conclusion about Gordon Hendrick's stance on legalizing weed, we would need to gather more information about his political beliefs and voting record on the issue. The provided information only mentions his tenure in the Montana Legislature and term limits. Let's consider the steps to find out Hendrick's stance on legalizing weed: 1. Research Gordon Hendrick's political beliefs and history: Since he is a Republican, we can possibly infer some broad political beliefs, but that doesn't necessarily pinpoint his stance on marijuana legalization. 2. Investigate House District 14's constituency views: We can study the views of the constituents in House District 14, which may give some clues on what issues were important to them and, consequently, their elected representative. This might not be entirely accurate, as representatives do not always align with their constituents on every issue. 3. Find specific legislation and votes related to weed legalization: We need to find any bills or measures related to weed legalization during Hendrick's time in office (prior to the end of 2012) and his voting record on those issues. 4. Check public statements or interviews: We can look for any public statements or interviews where Gordon Hendrick directly addressed the issue of marijuana legalization to get a clearer idea of his stance. Without performing these steps and gathering the appropriate information, we cannot conclusively determine whether Gordon Hendrick voted against legalizing weed during his time in the Montana Legislature."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that the band that released an album in 1983 did not choose to use for the cover design?, what is it ?

Movie title: Buddha Mar Gaya Movie plot: Laxmikant Kabadiya (Anupam Kher) is one of India's richest industrialists, a self made man who's risen from selling scrap to become a construction magnate. His conglomerate is on the verge of a 5000 crore (1 billion) IPO that should make them one of the largest companies in the country. LK's family - his spinster twin sister Prerna (Mahabanoo Mody-Kotwal), his two sons Ranjeet and Sameer (Mukesh Tiwari), their wives Shruti and Anju (Mona Ambegaonkar) respectively and Ranjeet's daughters Sanjana and Namrata, and Sameer's son, Pawan, can't stop salivating at the thought of all that money. Unfortunately for all of them fate displays a wicked sense of humour. On the night before the IPO opens, LK dies while copulating with a starlet Kim (Rakhi Sawant), who's aspiring to become the heroine of a film that LK plans to produce. The family is distraught and horrified. Not because a loved one has died but because now no one will buy their shares. So, on the advice of their family guru - Vidyut Baba (Om Puri), the family decides to hide the death of LK for a period of two days till the shares are all sold out. Little do they realize the crazy series of events that will follow on account of this duplicity. After all, hiding the death of a man as famous as LK is a Herculean task. To make matters worse, every time they're ready to announce LK's death, fate intervenes forcing them to keep his death hidden for another couple of days. This results in them having to announce the death of a fictitious friend or relative of LK and stage fake funerals. Which of course means generating dead bodies and, worse, getting the dead LK to make appearances at these funerals. Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Buddha Mar Gaya,\\" the character who dies the night before the IPO opens is Laxmikant Kabadiya (played by Anupam Kher).

The U.S. also negotiated quotas or volume limits on other countries, such as South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil, instead of tariffs, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also told reporters Thursday by telephone. China's foreign ministry said on Friday all countries should protect the normal trade order, when asked about U.S. decision. President Donald Trump said Thursday that the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of in trade deals \\"are over'\\" in a harshly worded statement responding to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's criticism of new steel and aluminum tariffs. He intensified his criticism of Canada Friday for what he says are the country's \\"highly restrictive\\" trade practices. Trump has repeatedly said measures such as tariffs are necessary to protect American jobs and industries in key manufacturing sectors. \\"The president's actions are about protecting American steel, American aluminum,\\" a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, said on Fox News. \\"They're critical for national security.\\" But the negative reaction from some of America's most important strategic allies has been quick and fierce.

Short movie review: this too-long , spoofy update Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the short movie review provided, it appears that the critic had a negative opinion of the movie. Several clues point to this conclusion: 1. \\"Too-long\\": The phrase \\"too-long\\" suggests that the critic feels the movie overstayed its welcome and would have been better if it were shorter. This indicates dissatisfaction with the pacing and editing of the film. 2. \\"Spoofy\\": This term is often used to describe films that are parodies or comedic imitations of other works. While \\"spoofy\\" could be seen as a positive term if the critic enjoys parodies, the overall negative tone of the review indicates that they found this particular spoof to be unsuccessful or uninspired. 3. \\"Update\\": The inclusion of this term implies that the movie being reviewed is a new version, remake, or adaptation of an older work. When viewed alongside the other negative comments in the review, it gives the impression that the critic was disappointed with the way the story was updated or reimagined. 4. Lack of positive descriptors: The review lacks any explicitly positive terms, which makes it more difficult to interpret it as a positive assessment of the film. On the other hand, the inclusion of negative words like \\"too-long\\" and the potentially negative connotation of \\"spoofy\\" further support the notion that the critic's opinion of the movie is unfavorable. To summarize, the short movie review appears to convey a negative opinion of the film. The critic implies that the movie was too long, that the spoof or parody elements were unsuccessful, and that the updated version of the story was disappointing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would-be MP: Clive Lewis has urged union bosses to use Press law to silence critical newspapers. A Labour candidate has urged union bosses to use new Press regulations to launch class action complaints against newspapers who criticise them. Clive Lewis – who is a member of three unions – criticised the Daily Mail’s exposure of bullying by Unite thugs. In a chilling insight into the way Left-wingers plan to use the Royal Charter, the would-be MP said unions should get together to file complaints to combat ‘scurrilous’ reporting. He told a new trade union think tank that in the past, only people specifically affected by a news story have been able to launch a grievance against a newspaper. But under the terms of the Royal Charter – approved by the Privy Council last month to the delight of the Hacked Off pressure group – third party groups will be able to complain en masse in so-called class action cases. The measure has been opposed by newspaper industry groups, who say it is likely to be used by activists to deter legitimate investigative journalism. The Mail revealed how Unite thugs targeted the families and neighbours of staff at the Grangemouth petrochemical plant in Scotland during strike action last month. The paper has also led the way in covering the scandal in Falkirk, where Unite was accused of seeking to rig a Labour candidate selection. Critical: Mr Lewis has criticised the Daily Mail's exposure of bullying by Unite thugs. Above, Saturday's Mail. Stephen Deans, the Unite boss in Scotland who was also chairman of Falkirk West Labour Party, has now lost his job at Grangemouth and the local party has been taken into special measures. However, Labour candidate Mr Lewis has sought to paint Mr Deans – whose fight with the owners of Grangemouth nearly led to the plant closing – as a wronged man. In a speech to the Unite-sponsored Centre for Labour and Social Studies (Class), he said: ‘Let’s take for example the case of the chap who has had his life ruined by scurrilous accusations and innuendo in the Daily Mail. 'Under the new Royal Charter, his trade. union, as an interested third party, could say actually, “We now have an. interest in this. Bullying: The Mail revealed how Unite thugs targeted the families and neighbours of staff at the Grangemouth petrochemical plant, pictured, in Scotland during strike action last month. Unite boss Stephen Deans, left, who was also chairman of Falkirk West Labour Party, has now lost his job at Grangemouth, while Ed Miliband, right, is refusing to open his party's inquiry into the Falkirk scandal. 'We think this generalisation affects not just him but all the trade union movement and its members and we are going to put in an official complaint and take this through the process”.’ Mr Lewis, the candidate for Norwich South, describes himself on his Twitter account as a ‘proud socialist’ and former BBC reporter. He is a member of three unions – Unite, the GMB and the National Union of Journalists. Shipley MP Philip Davies, one of 15. Conservatives who voted against the Charter earlier this year, said the. unions will use their financial muscle to ‘bully hard-pressed. newspapers’. ‘All that will happen is that newspapers will be afraid to publish things that are in the public interest,’ he said. Mr Davies also praised the Mail’s reporting of Unite’s activities, adding: ‘Not only are they intimidating people in industrial disputes they’re now trying to intimidate people who write about it.’ Kent MP Tracey Crouch, another Charter Tory rebel, said: ‘It is just the sort of behaviour that newspapers have warned about.’ Yesterday Ed Miliband again refused to re-open his party’s inquiry into Falkirk, calling for people to ‘move on’ – despite the evidence that his officials never got to the bottom of what happened.

Follow these steps to solve: Step 1: First, combine the terms with the variable d on the same side of the equation. Current equation: -602*d - 35954 = 2305*d + 263467 Add 602*d to both sides of the equation to combine the d terms: -35954 = 2305*d + 263467 + 602*d Step 2: Combine the d terms: 2305*d + 602*d = 2907*d So, the equation is now: -35954 = 2907*d + 263467 Step 3: Next, isolate the term with d (2907*d) by removing the constant term from the right side of the equation. Subtract 263467 from both sides of the equation: -35954 - 263467 = 2907*d Step 4: Now, combine the constant terms on the left side of the equation: -299421 = 2907*d Step 5: To solve for d, divide both sides of the equation by 2907: -299421 / 2907 = d Step 6: Calculate the result: d = -103 So, the value of d is -103."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Tabraiz Hussain has been jailed after he was found covered in £16,000 of heroin after trying - and failing - to get rid of his stash during a car chase. A drug dealer has been jailed after he was found covered in £16,000 of heroin after trying - and failing - to get rid of his stash during a car chase. Tabraiz Hussain became involved in a police chase while driving to an address in the Park End area of Middlesbrough, on September 8 last year. Teesside Crown Court heard how Hussain was followed by police before he then led them on a pursuit round a 'heavily-populated estate' for several minutes before trying to throw the class A drug out of the window. The drug then burst all over him, his car and the pavement in a snow-like covering as he tried to get rid of it. Prosecuting Aisha Wadoodi told the court: 'The defendant refused to stop, exceeding the speed limit and driving on the wrong side of the road. 'He only stopped once he mounted the pavement after a close collision with parked cars.' Police used vacuum cleaners to suck up the drugs scattered on the road and from the defendant's clothes. Once measured, they estimated the drugs to amount to one kilo, with a street value of almost £16,000. The 34-year-old, admitted he was in possession of class A but claimed he was instructed by someone else to collect the package, and was paid £300. A pair of gloves and three tampered mobile phones were also recovered. The court heard how months earlier the father-of-two had arranged for a taxi to transport an associate to collect a supply of heroin from Manchester. The trip had been organised through a long-term friend of the defendant who paid £220 for the fare. The court heard that during the journey, at least 13 calls were made between the defendant and his co-conspirator who exchanged passwords and a postcode. Scroll down for video. Pictured is the car covered in heroin. Police used vacuum cleaners to suck up the drugs scattered on the road and the defendant. On the way back to Middlesbrough, police stopped the car and recovered just under two kilos of heroin, with a street value of about £97,000, which was stored in a McDonald's paper bag. Hussain initially denied conspiracy to supply class A drugs but changed his plea to guilty on the day of his trial. He also pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply class A and dangerous driving. Hussain became involved in a police chase while driving to an address in the Park End area of Middlesbrough, on September 8 last year. The drugs can be seen scattered. Once measured, they estimated the drugs to amount to one kilo, with a street value of almost £16,000. Pictured is scattered debris from the drugs haul. Defending Rachael Sewell said her client 'accepted fully' that he organised a taxi in order to pick up drugs but did not accept that he was person who was leading the trip. She said: 'The defendant's role was linked to the taxi only. He did not play a lead role.' Sentencing him to eight years and six months in prison Judge Bourne-Arton, the Recorder of Middlesbrough, said: 'You, on two occasions were involved in the supply of class A drugs and involved to a significant extent. And it may well be that your involvement may stretch beyond these two incidents. On the way back to Middlesbrough, police stopped the car and recovered just under two kilos of heroin, with a street value of about £97,000, which was stored in a McDonald's paper bag. 'You were involved in the transportation of heroin, which on one occasion was just short of 2kg and the other occasion had an estimated amount of 1kg. 'Those involved in supplying drugs of course play different roles, but those closest to the source are the ones who are closest to the final retail on the street. 'There is an unhappy chain of drugs coming from the Manchester area to this area and I am determined to do all that I can to stamp it out.' The case has echoes of scenes in Hollywood blockbuster True Romance. A character, played by Bronson Pinchot, tries to evade police by chucking cocaine from the window of his moving car, only for it bounce back and cover him. He is stopped for speeding but ultimately arrested for drug possession as an officer is faced with the grinning white faced defendant. And in Woody Allen's Annie Hall, Allen - playing the nervy Alvy Singer - covers himself in 'cocaine' after accidentally sneezing into a tray of the drug while at a party. Highlights:","completion":"A man named Tabraiz Hussain was driving his car when the police started to chase him.

Please briefly summarize this news article: On the Exterior of Jetliners, a Parade of Plain Vanilla As domestic airlines have taken a more sober approach to the business of flying, fancy fuselages and lively paint jobs have faded away. The color of choice these days is white. Airplanes have become just as bland on the outside as they are on the inside. After decades of frenzied competition and staggering losses, domestic airlines have taken a more sober approach to the business of flying, with their first priority making money. And so the fancy fuselages and lively paint jobs — remember TWA’s bold red lines? — have gone the way of free meals, pillows and checked bags. The color of choice these days is sensible white. White does not fade as fast in the sun and requires fewer touchups. And without the added flash of color, less paint is needed, making planes lighter and saving fuel. “There used to be romance in air travel,” said Steve Cone, a marketing expert who helped create the first frequent-flier programs. “The airlines were run by dreamers, creative types and entrepreneurs. They’ve been replaced by penny-pinchers who don’t think about the real estate outside of the plane.” The staid designs reflect the current state of the industry. Unlike in their heyday in the 1970s, the airlines today have little reason to stand out. With just a handful of carriers still standing after dozens of mergers and bankruptcies, the survivors would rather focus their limited resources on improving business class, for instance. Nor are people wowed by flying anymore. Few airports have kept observation decks, allowing travelers to marvel at planes taking off and landing. And with enclosed boarding ramps, passengers rarely even see the aircraft they board. True, airlines still distinguish themselves with the design on their planes’ tails. But in an age when airline executives resist the idea that seats are mere commodities, the industry is becoming a lot more standardized. “Nowadays, people want reassurance,” said Michael Bierut, a partner at Pentagram, a design firm that collaborated with United Airlines for years until it merged with Continental last year. “That’s why there is a trend industrywide to err on the side of caution.” At the dawn of commercial aviation, from the 1920s to the 1940s, manufacturers provided planes already painted, and airlines simply added their logos. After World War II, commercial aviation boomed. Airlines sought to customize their looks and often had a different design for each model of airplane. Until government controls on prices and routes were lifted in 1978, airlines had no incentives to compete on fares and focused instead on their service and image. That was when Braniff Airways hired artists like Alexander Calder to paint its fleet in a rainbow of colors, and Pan Am turned to the Hollywood costumer Edith Head to design uniforms for its flight attendants. Airlines do not break out how much it costs to repaint a single plane, but it is a laborious business. The aircraft is grounded for days at a net loss. Depending on the size of the plane and the complexity of the design, it can take six to 14 days to repaint one. A Boeing 737, the most common single-aisle plane, requires 60 gallons of paint, while the Boeing 747 jumbo jet needs more than 250 gallons. US Airways is one airline that has shifted to a white design in recent years. The carrier is the result of a long string of mergers between airlines, each with its own colorful past, including Allegheny, Mohawk and Pacific Southwest. US Airways was acquired in 2005 by America West, which kept the US Airways name but got rid of the dark blue design as the carrier’s network expanded to the sunnier Southwest. Delta Air Lines introduced its latest design in 2007 as it emerged from bankruptcy. The design featured a white fuselage and just four colors, instead of the eight used in its previous one, nicknamed “Color in Motion.” It returned the triangle shape on the vertical stabilizers, a throwback to the airline’s origins in the Mississippi Delta. The design helped the carrier trim its costs by shaving a whole day in the painting cycle for each plane. Still, it took four years to repaint more than a thousand planes, including those of Northwest Airlines, which Delta acquired in the meantime. Summary:","completion":"The trend towards flashy paint jobs and fancy fuselages on aircraft has faded due to a shift in the airline industry's approach to business focused on greater financial realism. The primary concern in the industry now is profitability, and as such, many prior aesthetic flourishes have been abandoned. The favored color for aircraft today is white, which doesn't fade quickly in the sunlight, necessitating fewer touch-ups, and requires less paint, reducing aircraft weight and fuel expenditure. These conservative designs reflect the industry's pragmatic focus on factors like improving business class rather than distinguishing themselves through exterior aesthetics. Historically, from the 1920s to the 40s, airlines were provided painted aircraft onto which they added their logos. During the post-WWII boom in commercial aviation, airlines sought to individualize their fleet designs. Incentives to compete on fare prices didn't exist until 1978, so airlines initially focused on service and image. Yet, painting aircraft is a costly and time-consuming process, grounding a plane for between six to fourteen days depending on its size and paint design complexity. It requires 60 gallons of paint for a Boeing 737 and over 250 gallons for a Boeing 747 jumbo jet. In recent years, airlines like US Airways and Delta Air Lines have adopted more minimalist, white designs as a cost reduction strategy. US Airways shrugged off their previous dark blue design when they started covering the sunny Southwest region after their acquisition by America West in 2005. Delta Air Lines unveiled its latest design in 2007, favoring a white fuselage and only four colors, saving a day in the repainting cycle for each jet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Charlie Ward Jr. (born October 12, 1970) is a retired American professional NBA basketball player, college football Heisman Trophy winner, Davey O'Brien Award winner and a Major League Baseball draftee. Despite his NCAA football success, Ward was one of the very few players who won a Heisman trophy but was not drafted in the NFL draft. He won the College Football National Championship Game with the Florida State University Seminoles. Ward played several years with the New York Knicks and started in the NBA Finals. Ward won the 1993 Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, and Davey O'Brien Award as a quarterback for Florida State University, and subsequently led the Seminoles to their first-ever National Championship when FSU defeated Nebraska 18-16 in the 1993 Orange Bowl. The Seminoles had suffered their only defeat of the season to a second-ranked Notre Dame team, but their path to the National Championship was cleared a week later when the Irish were upset at home by Boston College. Ward holds the third-largest margin of victory in the history of Heisman trophy balloting, with a 1,622-point difference, third only to O.J. Simpson's 1,750-point win in 1968 and Troy Smith's 1,662-point win in 2006. He was also the only Heisman winner to play in the NBA. In 1993, Charlie Ward won the James E. Sullivan Award from the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) as the most outstanding amateur athlete in the United States. Though Ward did not play baseball in college, he was drafted as a pitcher by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 59th round of the 1993 free agent draft and in the 18th round by the New York Yankees in 1994. An avid tennis player, Ward also shone in the Arthur Ashe Amateur Tennis Tournament in 1994. Ward was a model student-athlete at Florida State. As a senior and captain of the team in 1993, he voluntarily approached Seminoles head coach Bobby Bowden about a difficult situation surrounding incoming freshman Warrick Dunn, whose mother, policewoman Betty Smothers, was killed in the line of duty during Dunn's senior year of high school in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Charlie served as a surrogate big brother to Dunn during the latter's first year in Tallahassee, helping him through a trying time by becoming his roommate and friend. With Ward's help on and off the field, Dunn eventually became one of the better running backs in the country and a first-round NFL draft pick. Ward also played basketball for four years at Florida State University (FSU). Former teammates included future NBA players Bob Sura, Doug Edwards, and Sam Cassell. His 1993 team made it to the Southeast Regional Final where they lost to Kentucky 106-81 with the winner advancing to the Final Four. Ward's 1992 team made the Sweet Sixteen. He made the game-winning shot in its Metro Conference Tournament Championship game win over Louisville in 1991. Ward still holds FSU basketball records for career steals at 236, steals in one game at 9 and still ranks sixth all-time in assists at 396. He played a shortened season his senior year, joining the basketball team just 15 days after winning the Heisman Trophy. He started 16 games at the point guard position that year, and averaged a college career high of 10.5 points and 4.9 assists for the season. In his senior year at Florida State, he also served as Student Government Vice-President, after he was asked to run by the Monarchy Party, a student government reform organization.

Article: A deadly strain of avian flu may have passed between people for the first time, experts believe.The avian influenza A (H7N9) virus is thought to have been transmitted between father and daughter in eastern China, according to research published online by the British Medical Journal (BMJ). The findings provide the strongest evidence yet of H7N9 transmission between humans since its discover in February, but its ability to transmit itself _ \\"limited and non-sustainable\\" by the Chinese researchers behind the study.At the end of June 133 cases had been reported, including 43 deaths. Most infections have been among people visiting markets, selling live birds or among those who had contact with live poultry in the seven to 10 days before becoming ill. The latest study examined the case of a 60-year-old father who regularly visited a live poultry market and became ill five to six days after his last visit in March. He was admitted to hospital with fever, cough and shortness of breath. Despite intensive care treatment he died of multiple organ failure on 4 May. His 32-year-old daughter, who was previously healthy, looked after him at his bedside before he was admitted to intensive care. She had no known exposure to live poultry before falling ill with a very high temperature, cough and fever. The daughter developed symptoms six days after her last contact with her father and was admitted to hospital where she died of multiple organ failure on 24 April. Follow-up investigations uncovered almost genetically identical virus strains from each patient, suggesting transmission from father to daughter. Another 43 people were also tested who had had close contact with the father, daughter or both. Dr Peter Horby, senior clinical research fellow at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Hanoi, Vietnam, said of the study: \\"The most likely source of infection for the daughter was her father, during the period that she cared for him while he was ill. \\"He said \\"limited person to person transmission had been reported...

PRETORIA, South Africa — The trial of Oscar Pistorius on murder charges began Monday, with a neighbor of the South African double-amputee track star saying that she heard “bloodcurdling screams” shortly before Mr. Pistorius’s girlfriend was shot and killed. On a drizzly, gray day in Pretoria, Mr. Pistorius appeared before the court to deny that he had murdered his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, saying in a clear but soft voice that he was not guilty. He also denied several firearms offenses. On the murder charge, Judge Thokozile Masipa asked if he understood the accusation. “I do, I do, my lady,” Mr. Pistorius replied. A lawyer reading a statement by Mr. Pistorius said later that the allegation of murder “could not be further from the truth.” He also accused the police of contaminating the crime scene at Mr. Pistorius’s villa in a gated complex here and denied prosecution assertions that Mr. Pistorius and Ms. Steenkamp had argued on the night of her killing. But the first witness, Michelle Burger, who lived near Mr. Pistorius at the time of the shooting on Feb. 14, 2013, said that she heard a man and a woman screaming before the gunshots. Photo “It was very traumatic for me,” Ms. Burger said. “You could hear that it was bloodcurdling screams. It leaves you cold. You can’t translate it into words, the anxiousness in her voice and fear.” Ms. Burger described the sound of the gunfire as a first shot, then a pause and three shots in quick succession. According to testimony in preliminary hearings, Mr. Pistorius fired four shots through a closed bathroom door. At least three bullets struck Ms. Steenkamp, in the head, arm and hip, vaulting Mr. Pistorius into the notorious ranks of celebrity murder defendants. Mr. Pistorius’s lead defense counsel, Barry Roux, cross-examined Ms. Burger aggressively, at times sounding impatient, even exasperated, and dwelling on whether she and her husband might have influenced each other’s testimony. Mr. Roux also questioned whether Ms. Burger was changing or at least adding to her story from an earlier statement and whether the sounds she described as gunshots were actually made by Mr. Pistorius breaking down the bathroom door with a cricket bat. He even raised the issue of whether the high-pitched screams that Ms. Burger said she heard were not a woman’s but his client’s voice rising from anxiety. The witness said repeatedly that she heard two different voices. Defense lawyers have portrayed Ms. Steenkamp’s death as an accident, but prosecutors have not accepted Mr. Pistorius’s explanation that he believed he was shooting a burglar. South Africa is plagued by violent crime, and home invasions are a common fear. Earlier, Mr. Pistorius, 27, said in an affidavit that he had been terrified. Vulnerable without his prosthetic legs, he said, he rashly fired through the bathroom door, only to find later that he had killed his girlfriend. “I approached the bathroom door armed with my firearm so I could defend Reeva and I,” Mr. Pistorius said in the statement read by one of his lawyers on Monday. “I believed Reeva was still in bed.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story There is no death penalty in South Africa, but premeditated murder carries a minimum sentence of 25 years. As he awaited the start of the trial, Mr. Pistorius, wearing a dark suit and black tie, perched on a cushion on his chair. Photographs showed June Steenkamp, the mother of the victim, weeping. She has told South African reporters that she wants him to look her in the eye. Photo “Oscar’s Date With Destiny” read a headline in red ink on the front page of The Pretoria News. After more than a year of preparation, during which Mr. Pistorius has mostly been free on bail, more than a hundred witnesses may be called during the trial, including forensics and ballistics experts. Since there are no jury trials in South Africa, Judge Masipa will decide his guilt or innocence, assisted by two assessors whom she swore in at the beginning of the hearing. The judge, a former crime reporter, is known locally for handing down long sentences in cases of crimes against women. The case has been compared to the O. J. Simpson murder trial that transfixed Americans in the 1990s. Mr. Pistorius and Ms. Steenkamp were a celebrity couple in South Africa. Mr. Pistorius, known as Blade Runner for the flexible, sickle-shaped carbon-fiber prosthetic legs he uses to compete, achieved worldwide fame by challenging able-bodied athletes. Ms. Steenkamp, who was 29 at the time of her death, was a budding reality television star, a model and a law school graduate. After the killing, however, news reports built a different portrait of Mr. Pistorius — that of a reckless, jealous young man with a passion for guns and a history of mishandling them. Ms. Steenkamp told her mother that they had quarreled a lot, according to some news reports. Journalists from around the world have gathered to cover the trial, which will be a highly public test for the South African justice system, even more so after a judge ruled last week that much of it would be broadcast live on television. Live images of testimony by Mr. Pistorius and witnesses called by the defense will not be shown, but the audio from all hearings will be broadcast. The prosecution may have an uphill battle against Mr. Pistorius’s expensive team of lawyers and experts after the lead investigator on the case, Detective Warrant Officer Hilton Botha, resigned last year, acknowledging mistakes in the police work. A magistrate later said he had blundered in gathering evidence. In the statement read in court, Mr. Pistorius said that the crime scene had been “contaminated, disturbed and tampered with.” As a sprinter, Mr. Pistorius, who was born without fibulas and had both legs amputated below the knee before he was a year old, won two gold medals and a silver at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London after competing at the Olympics a few weeks earlier, though without winning medals. The repercussions continue to echo for family and friends of Ms. Steenkamp. Her father, Barry Steenkamp, was reported to have had a stroke recently while reading an article about the case. ||||| The murder trial of Oscar Pistorius begins today as South Africa prepares for what is expected to be a marathon legal battle that throws a spotlight not just on the world-famous double-amputee athlete, but on his homeland's criminal justice system and gun culture. The trial, which has been compared to that of the OJ Simpson case in the United States 20 years ago, has led to the establishement in South Africa of a unique cable television channel dedicated to it. The 24-hour channel, called The Oscar Pistorius Trial – A Carte Blanche Channel, launched on Sunday night with footage of the sportsman's girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, who was shot dead by him in the early hours of the morning on February 14 last year at his home. While the Olymian denies murder and says that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder, the prosecution maintains that he intentionally shot her several times after an argument. State prosecutors are expected to paint an unflattering portrait of Pistorius as reckless, hot-headed and obsessed with guns, and have lined up 107 witnesses for the trial, including Pistorius's ex-girlfriends Melissa Rom and Samantha Taylor, whose mother welcomed the end of their relationship. Erin Stear, who has denied reports she had an affair with Pistorius, will also take the stand, as will the former footballer Mark Batchelor, who has claimed that Pistorius threatened to \\"break my legs\\" because he was a close friend of Steenkamp, a law graduate, model and reality TV star. Police have said they found unlicensed .38-calibre ammunition in Pistorius's house, while his Twitter account revealed he had boasted of going into \\"full attack recon mode in the pantry\\" after thinking an intruder was in his home. The court will hear how, in one incident, Pistorius accidentally discharged a pistol under the table in a Johannesburg restaurant. He also put a bullet through the sunroof of a girlfriend's car in a fit of rage. Pistorius will also come face to face with Steenkamp's mother, June, who made her feelings clear in a TV interview last year, recalling an incident in which Steenkamp phoned her from Pistorius's car. \\"She was afraid,\\" June said. \\"She was so afraid. She said, 'Mummy, I'm in the car with Oscar and he's driving like a lunatic. Like a lunatic.' So I said, 'Will you just give him the phone?' She gave the phone to Oscar straight away. And I said, 'If you hurt my baby, I will have you wiped out.'\\" Mobile phone records could be key during the trial, potentially indicating evidence of a fight. Steenkamp is said to have had her phone with her in the toilet when she was shot. Police have been trying to gain access to Pistorius's iPhone, which might contain evidence of a fight in the form of text messages. Another key piece of evidence, according to experts, may be the blood-spatter analysis of the inside of the toilet cubicle, which could give an indication of Steenkamp's position when she was shot, including whether she was sitting on the toilet, or hiding behind the door, as prosecutors suspect. Pistorius faces charges of murder, illegal possession of ammunition, and two additional counts relating to shooting a gun in public in two separate incidents before last year's Valentine's Day killing. Criminal law experts believe that if the prosecution fails to prove premeditated murder, firing several shots through a closed door could bring a conviction for the lesser charge of culpable homicide, a South African equivalent of manslaughter covering unintentional deaths through negligence. Sentences in such cases range from fines to prison. They are left to courts to determine and are not set by fixed guidelines. ||||| FILE : In this Monday, Aug. 19, 2013 file photo, double-amputee Olympian Oscar Pistorius, left, talks with his lawyer, Kenny Oldwage, right, at the magistrates court in Pretoria, South Africa, where Pistorius... (Associated Press) PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) — A cable TV channel devoted to the Oscar Pistorius murder trial went on air in South Africa on Sunday night showing footage of the blonde model the world-famous athlete shot dead at his home a year ago. The video includes footage of her playing with dolphins. The 24-hour channel began broadcasting just over 12 hours before Pistorius is expected in court for the start of his trial. Dedicated completely to the trial, some of its early programming focused on the life of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, the model and reality TV star Pistorius killed on Valentine's Day last year when he fired shots through a toilet door at his house. In one video taken by security camera, a smiling Steenkamp is seen arriving at the gated community where Pistorius lived just hours before she was killed. There was also video of her swimming with dolphins while shooting a reality TV show for South African television. At one point, two dolphins tap their snouts on her cheeks. As Pistorius' trial starts on Monday, live television pictures and a live audio feed will be broadcast from the courtroom at North Gauteng High Court in the South African capital, Pretoria, after permission was granted by a judge. Pistorius' lawyers opposed the applications to broadcast the trial on television and radio. The channel, called \\"The Oscar Pistorius Trial - A Carte Blanche channel\\" is on South Africa's most popular cable TV network which is one of the three broadcasters which asked the judge to allow live coverage of the trial. Three remote-controlled cameras have been installed in the courtroom. There are some restrictions on the live broadcasts of the trial. Testimony by Pistorius and defense witnesses will not be shown because of objections by his defense team. Some prosecution witnesses can also ask for their testimony not to be shown and the trial judge, Thokozile Masipa, has the option of stopping the live coverage if it becomes intrusive. Pistorius faces charges of murder, illegal possession of ammunition and two additional counts relating to shooting a gun in public in two separate incidents before the Valentine's Day slaying of Steenkamp last year. Pistorius denies murder and says he shot Steenkamp after mistaking her for a dangerous intruder inside a toilet cubicle in his bathroom during the night. ___ Gerald Imray is on Twitter at www.twitter.com/GeraldImrayAP ||||| PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) — A female judge will ultimately decide Oscar Pistorius' fate and pronounce him innocent or guilty of murder in his girlfriend's shooting death on Valentine's Day last year.

(Associated Press) ___ THE JUDGE: Judge Thokozile Masipa will preside over the biggest and most closely-watched case in her career when Pistorius goes on trial for murder in Reeva Steenkamp's shooting death. Masipa has 15 years' experience as a judge, but was once a reporter with a South African newspaper before turning to law. Her appointment to oversee and ultimately judge Pistorius' case will satisfy both prosecution and defense, legal experts say, because of her reputation for being unwaveringly fair. She was the second black woman to be appointed a judge in South Africa, according to the South African Press Association. While she has become a figure of intense interest, South Africa's department of justice has warned reporters not to attempt to contact her during Pistorius' trial. Masipa will be aided by two assessors whom she has appointed but who have not yet been named. In South Africa, judges are sometimes helped by assessors, often experts in criminal law who can help the judge reach a verdict but have limited roles in the trial. South Africa abolished juries in criminal trials in 1969. ___ THE PROSECUTION: Gerrie Nel is considered South Africa's top state prosecutor. He secured a conviction for corruption against former South African police chief Jackie Selebi, one of the country's biggest cases before Pistorius killed Steenkamp. Nel is described as a master of presenting evidence by legal analysts. In Pistorius' bail hearing last year, Nel painted a picture of Pistorius as a man who was \\"willing and ready to fire and kill\\" and Steenkamp as cowering, terrified and hiding in the toilet before Pistorius shot through the toilet door to kill her. \\"She couldn't go anywhere,\\" Nel said in court last February. \\"It must have been horrific.\\" ___ THE DEFENSE: Described even by other attorneys as South Africa's best defense lawyer, Barry Roux's cross-examination of police detective Hilton Botha in Pistorius' bail hearing last February was so extensive that Botha, who was later removed from the case, had to concede that nothing about Pistorius' version of events could be disproved at the time. Roux, an attorney for about 30 years, also succeeded in getting the court to agree to release Pistorius on bail of 1 million rand (then 113,000) despite the fact that the double-amputee athlete was charged with premeditated murder. He also got another court to relax some of Pistorius' strict bail conditions on appeal. ___ THE GUNMAN: Oscar Pistorius is now probably the world's best-known track athlete. Initially a poster boy for disabled sport, Pistorius' ability to also run alongside the best able-bodied athletes made him a sportsman whose endorsement was purchased by international brands like Nike. A multiple Paralympic champion and record-breaker, Pistorius is still the only amputee to run at the world championships and the Olympics. He is also the defendant in a murder trial and faces a possible life sentence with a minimum of 25 years in prison before the possibility of parole if convicted. Other aspects of Pistorius' life have been scrutinized since he killed Steenkamp, especially that he was also a gun enthusiast and collector and owned a 9 mm Parabellum pistol for self-defense and was pursuing licenses for six more guns, including an assault rifle. ___ THE VICTIM: Reeva Steenkamp was a model and reality TV star, but also a law graduate. The 29-year-old had been dating Pistorius for only a few months when she was killed by the Olympic athlete. They were introduced by mutual friends in late 2012 and decided to attend an awards ceremony together the day after. Steenkamp's parents, Barry and June, have talked about her dedication to fighting domestic abuse rather than her modeling career and said she intended to open a shelter for abused women. Her parents will now start a foundation to help \\"the poor and abused\\" in her memory, they said. ___ THE TOP COP: After Hilton Botha's bungled testimony in the bail hearing and the revelation that he was facing charges of attempted murder himself, Lt. Gen. Vinesh Moonoo was appointed to take over as the head police investigator in the Pistorius shooting. Moonoo was described by South Africa's national police commissioner as the country's No. 1 detective. He is not listed by the prosecution as one of its witnesses but has overseen the investigation for the last year. He is renowned for avoiding the limelight, according to South African crime reporters who say he has rarely given media interviews. ___ Gerald Imray is on Twitter at www.twitter.com/GeraldImrayAP ||||| Media caption LIVE: BBC coverage of Oscar Pistorius murder trial South African athlete Oscar Pistorius has pleaded not guilty at the start of his trial for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Mr Pistorius shot Ms Steenkamp, 29, a model and reality TV star, at his home in Pretoria on 14 February 2013. State prosecutors allege the killing was premeditated, but he claims he mistook her for an intruder. For the first time in South Africa, parts of the trial will be televised live. Media interest is high. The state's case - and the memorably hapless performance of now ex-lead detective Hilton Botha - took a battering at [Mr Pistorius's bail] hearing. Did the state have more compelling evidence that it chose not to reveal? The battle ahead The arrest of the national sporting hero astounded South Africa. The 27-year-old double amputee won gold at the London 2012 Paralympic Games and also competed at the Olympics. 'Heard screaming' Mr Pistorius pleaded not guilty to all charges, including the \\"wilful and intentional murder of Reeva Steenkamp\\" as the trial began. His lawyer read out a statement from the athlete, giving his version of events of how Ms Steenkamp died, saying he believed his girlfriend was in bed when he shot at the toilet door in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year. The start to proceedings at the court in the capital were delayed by 90 minutes as an Afrikaans translator was absent. The BBC's Andrew Harding in the courtroom says Mr Pistorius looked calm, or at least neutral as he arrived in court - a far cry from the emotional wreck he seemed at the bail hearing last year. Mr Pistorius's uncle, brother and sister are also in court; next to them on the relatives' bench is the family of Ms Steenkamp, including her mother June, our correspondent says.

She says she awoke hearing a woman's screams and heard a call for help. Clickable 3D model of Oscar Pistorius' house What happened on the night? Our correspondent says Mr Nel, who has begun to lay out the state's case, is a quiet, determined figure - \\"fox-like\\", according to a friend and fellow-lawyer. State prosecutors say Mr Pistorius planned the killing and shot Ms Steenkamp after a row. But Mr Pistorius says he shot his girlfriend through the bathroom door of his home in Pretoria after mistaking her for a burglar. If found guilty of premeditated murder, he could face life imprisonment. He has also been charged with illegally possessing ammunition. There are no juries at trials in South Africa, and his fate will ultimately be decided by Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa. Much of the case will depend on ballistic evidence from the scene of the shooting, correspondents say. On the anniversary of the shooting, Mr Pistorius released a rare statement in which he said: \\"The loss of Reeva and the complete trauma of that day, I will carry with me for the rest of my life.\\" Media caption Reeva Steenkamp's friend Gwyn Guscott: \\"We just need to know what happened\\" Last week, a judge ruled that an audio feed of the whole trial could be broadcast. Some parts will also be televised, including opening arguments, evidence of experts, police witnesses and closing arguments. The testimony of the accused and his witnesses is exempt. One South African TV station, MultiChoice, has set up a dedicated Oscar Pistorius Trial channel to provide 24-hour coverage. It is due to begin broadcasting on Sunday. Defence lawyers had said it would prejudice proceedings. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"South African double-amputee track star Oscar Pistorius has pleaded not guilty at the start of his trial for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2013. The trial, in which Pistorius claims he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder and killed her accidentally, is presided over by Judge Thokozile Masipa and is South Africa's first trial to be partially televised, reflecting significant media interest in the case. Pistorius denies all charges, including the deliberate murder of Steenkamp, illegal possession of ammunition, and two counts relating to shooting a gun in public before the incident. If he is found guilty of premeditated murder, Pistorius could face a minimum sentence of 25 years before the possibility of parole as there is no death penalty in South Africa. The trial will feature over a hundred witnesses, including forensics and ballistics experts, who will testify before Judge Masipa; she will have the final say as South Africa abolished juries in criminal trials in 1969. The prosecution is expected to present evidence to paint Pistorius as reckless and obsessed with guns, while the defense contends that Pistorius, vulnerable without his prosthetic legs, fired in fear of a perceived intruder. This case has significant implications for Pistorius, who rose to fame as an Olympic athlete, achieving worldwide recognition for challenging able-bodied competitors. It also spotlights South Africa's justice system and the nation's issues with violent crime and gun culture. As the case unfolds, the focus is not only on Pistorius' actions but also on examining the surrounding societal issues that may have contributed to this tragic event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's analyze the given sentence step by step: 1. \\"It was several young students.\\" 2. \\"in that the policeman met.\\" 3. \\"the park last night.\\" Each of these segments carry a certain degree of meaningfulness when taken individually. However, when these segments are combined the way they have been in the sentence, they no longer make sense from a syntactical or semantic viewpoint. In terms of syntax, the sentence is incorrect because it does not follow regular English sentence structure norms. Additionally, it is difficult to determine what is meant to relate to what in the sentence, hence concluding that the sentence is also semantically unacceptable. A more acceptable version of the sentence could be: \\"It was several young students that the policeman met in the park last night.\\" In this revised sentence, syntactical rules are observed as each part of the sentence relates logically and grammatically to another. Semantically, it's clear that the policeman met several young students in the park the previous night, leading the reader or listener to have a clear understanding of what occurred.

Which country had fewer people with whooping cough? Hint: Many respiratory diseases are caused by pathogens. A pathogen is an organism that causes disease in another organism. Certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi are pathogens of the respiratory system. The common cold and flu are caused by viruses. The influenza virus that causes the flu is pictured below ( Figure below ). Tuberculosis, whooping cough, and acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria. The pathogens that cause colds, flu, and TB can be passed from person to person by coughing, sneezing, and spitting. Illnesses caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics. Those caused by viruses cannot. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Iraq had fewer cases of whooping cough as compared to Iran. This can be explained by the fact that whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. As mentioned in the passage, Iran predominantly had respiratory diseases caused by fungi and viruses, whereas Iraq had more cases of respiratory diseases stemming from bacterial infections. Since whooping cough is a bacterial infection, it is more likely that Iraq had a higher number of cases compared to Iran, resulting in fewer whooping cough cases in Iran. Additionally, it is worth noting that bacterial infections such as whooping cough can be effectively treated using antibiotics. Though antibiotics do not guarantee complete eradication of the disease, the availability and effectiveness of these medications can help manage and reduce the spread of whooping cough in a population. In contrast, illnesses caused by viruses have limited treatment options and cannot be cured through antibiotics, which may contribute to a higher prevalence of these types of infections in the population. In summary, based on the prevalence of bacterial infections in Iraq and the nature of whooping cough as a bacterial infection, it can be deduced that Iraq had fewer cases of whooping cough in comparison to Iran."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For instance, they may want a particular file size or format, or they may want you to style them in a particular way. It will also tell you how they prefer for you to submit and how much they pay. If you can't find submission guidelines, you can still submit to the magazine by finding an email or physical address. Generally, you can find this information on their website. When looking through staff members' emails, look for the photo editor or art director, and direct your query to that person, if the magazine is big enough to have such a person. Get an idea of what kind of photos they want, so you know what to submit. Make sure they are good quality and fit the style and subject matter of the magazine. If you don't have any that fit their style, choose another magazine, or try a photo shoot to capture what they want. The letter should explain who you are and what you want (to have your photos printed or to receive future assignments or both). You can do so in print or online but follow any guidelines the magazine offers. If you submit in print, be sure to include both printed images and a CD with high-resolution images, so they are ready to go if the magazine wants them. You should also include a thumbnail page, a caption sheet, and a picture of yourself. You can also send a sample of your work so you are placed on their mailing list. You show a collection of your photos, and they may contact you when they have assignments. Keep your letter professional and to the point. For instance, you could write something like: \\"Dear Ms. (name), My name is Jo Jones, and I am a freelance photographer. I have been a fan of your magazine for over 10 years.

The Met's parliamentary liaison and investigation team saw cases of hate-filled messages, harassment and criminal damage between August and early February.

Continue writing the following text. The soothsayer said Emily had more fantastical dreams than Cynthia because Options are: (1). Emily had a more vivid imagination.; (2). Cynthia had a more vivid imagination.;","completion":"The soothsayer said Emily had more fantastical dreams than Cynthia because Emily had a more vivid imagination. This doesn't undermine Cynthia's imaginative prowess at all, but it was merely the level of vividness in their imaginative capacity that set them apart, especially in creating fantasy. This difference was quite trackable in the way their dreams materialized and how they recounted each episode. Imagination, as it pertains to Emily and Cynthia, needs to be understood as a spectrum rather than an absolute capability. Each individual dream they chalked down on the canvas of their subconscious was a direct reflection of their imagination at that time. Like two artists with different styles, the differences between Emily and Cynthia's dreams were not indicative of a greater or lesser ability, simply a different methodology. Emily's dreams were sculpted with a vibrant shade of inventive brilliance, encapsulating eccentricities, and intricate details that seemed plucked from the pure ether of fantasy. Her dreams weren't just stories; they were rich narratives brimming with a multitude of diverse characters, otherworldly landscapes, and unpredictable events. These details sprouted from a vivid imagination that worked overtime, weaving an elaborate tapestry of different elements, all contributing to the conception of a spectacularly fantastical world within her mind. Her dreams were like grand epics, fantasy fiction novels that wove an intricate tale of mysterious creatures and mythical landscapes. The soothsayer took note of the astounding detail, the remarkable coherence, and the gripping suspense that characterized Emily's dreams. This isn't to say that Cynthia lacked an imaginative spirit. Cynthia, too, had a remarkable capability to dream up scenarios and weave stories from her subconscious. Her dreams, however, ran on a different wavelength. They were more rooted and grounded in reality, with an artistic interpretation of the metaphorical aspect of existence. Cynthia's dreams had a kind of mystical realism. They were nuanced versions of reality with surreal tinges, emphasizing more on emotional depth, metaphorical interpretations, and psychological elements. Cynthia's imagination was more oriented toward introspective thought and abstract concepts. To sum it up, Emily and Cynthia were two sides of the same coin. Emily adorned the side of vibrant extensive imagination that crafted vast, grand, and detailed fantasies, while Cynthia represented the other side, with grounded, in-depth, and introspective dreams highlighting elements of life and the self's abstract aspects. It was this difference between Emily's vibrantly vivid fantasies and Cynthia's more grounded imaginative dreams that led the soothsayer to make his observation. The amalgamation of Emily's unconventional plots with those of Cynthia's introspective themes creates a comprehensive representation of the wonders of human imagination. This combination serves as a reminder that creativity and imagination know no boundaries; whether fantastical or introspective, each dream carries its unique beauty, starring as a testament to the boundless potentials of the human mind."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Bowie declared himself gay in an interview with Michael Watts for a 1972 issue of Melody Maker, coinciding with his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust.

But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me.\\" His first wife, Angie, supports his claim of bisexuality and alleges that Bowie had a relationship with Mick Jagger.In a 1983 interview with Rolling Stone, Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was \\"the biggest mistake I ever made\\" and \\"I was always a closet heterosexual.\\" On other occasions, he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than of his own feelings.Blender asked Bowie in 2002 whether he still believed his public declaration was his biggest mistake.

The lead vocalist and primary member responsible for this song is Theodore \\"Volume 10\\" Dudley, who is supported by his fellow group members. \\"Pistol Grip Pump\\" was initially released as a single in 1993 and later appeared on Volume 10's debut album, \\"Hip-Hopera,\\" which was released in 1994. The song quickly gained prominence due to its unique sound and hard-hitting lyrics. Volume 10's \\"Pistol Grip Pump\\" is known for its catchy beat, infectious hook, and aggressive lyrics that portray street life in Los Angeles during the 1990s. The song's title refers to the type of shotgun grip, hinting at the firearm's presence as a constant companion for protection in the rough urban landscape. This theme resonated with many listeners at the time, leading to its popularity within the West Coast hip-hop community and beyond.

Amy ran from the police officers.. (b). Megan ran from the police officers..","completion":"(b). Megan ran from the police officers. This sentence choice logically completes the original sentence because it contrasts Amy's calm demeanor with Megan's panicking action of running away from the police officers. The initial proposition of the sentence indicates a comparison between Amy's and Megan's reactions in a specific situation. It seems to suggest that Amy's calmness led to a different behavior than Megan's. The first part of the sentence, \\"Amy was more calm in this situation than Megan was,\\" builds up a premise of Amy and Megan reacting differently to the same situation. Here, we are presented with their emotional states - Amy being calm and Megan, by implication, being less calm or agitated. To complete such a sentence, we need an action that would reflect this discrepancy in their emotional states. Option (b) \\"Megan ran from the police officers\\" accomplishes this. It presents Megan reacting in a more panicked or agitated manner, which runs counter to Amy's calmness. The action of running from police officers generally portrays fear or panic, which would be less expected of someone who is calm - like Amy in this case. However, the sentence does leave some implicit implications or questions. While we know Megan's reaction, Amy's reaction or behavior isn't detailed. Yet, by contrasting Megan's action with Amy's calmness, we can deduce that Amy probably dealt with the situation in a more composed, and possibly effective manner. On the other hand, option (a) \\"Amy ran from the police officers,\\" contradicts the initial setup. It implies that even though Amy was more calm, she acted in a way that would typically indicate panic or fear, which contradicts the calmness attributed to her. This choice could potentially confuse the reader as it doesn't follow a logical progression in the comparison between Amy's and Megan's reactions. Therefore, option (b) \\"Megan ran from the police officers\\" forms the most coherent, logical, and detailed completion of the sentence, effectively contrasting Megan's fearful reaction with Amy's calmness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hoffman answers many questions for non-profits.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, it is reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis \\"Susan M. Hoffman answers many questions for non-profits\\" is likely true. However, it is essential to analyze the statement and its implications in a more detailed and comprehensive manner. The premise states that Susan M. Hoffman, who holds the position of a pro bono coordinator at Washington D.C.'s Crowell and Moring, regularly receives queries from non-profit organizations via email. This information provides sufficient evidence to support the notion that Susan M. Hoffman is, indeed, involved in interactions with non-profit organizations and is the point of contact for their questions and concerns. Being a pro bono coordinator, her role typically involves managing and supervising legal services provided to clients who cannot afford legal representation and other similar services. In this context, it is safe to assume that Susan M. Hoffman's job would entail assisting non-profit organizations with their legal matters, as these organizations often operate with limited budgets. The premise's inclusion of the word \\"regularly\\" further strengthens the hypothesis by indicating that Susan M. Hoffman interacts with non-profits with a certain level of frequency. This implies that she likely addresses a significant number of questions from non-profit organizations. Consequently, her role as a pro bono coordinator and the frequency of her interactions with these organizations support the hypothesis that Susan M. Hoffman answers many questions for non-profits. However, it is important to note a few caveats. The premise does not specify the exact scope and volume of the questions Susan M. Hoffman receives. The term \\"regularly\\" is subjective and subject to interpretation, and as a result, might not necessarily be interpreted as indicative of large numbers of queries. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the premise only states that she receives queries from non-profit organizations. While it can be assumed that Susan M. Hoffman answers those questions as part of her role, there is no explicit mention of her response to those queries. Although it is highly probable that Susan M. Hoffman would answer and offer assistance to these non-profits, the hypothesis's validity cannot be indisputably confirmed considering this potential limitation. In conclusion, based on the provided information, it is reasonable to infer that the hypothesis \\"Susan M. Hoffman answers many questions for non-profits\\" is likely true. Although there are some minor limitations that could slightly weaken the strength of the hypothesis, the overall evidence strongly supports the idea that Susan M.

After the sediment has been transported by the river and dumped through tributaries into lakes and the ocean, over time, the sediment will settle at the bottom of these bodies of water. This is due to a decrease in velocity or energy of the water which can no longer support the sediment, gravity then pulls it down to the bottom. Sediment is usually sorted by size during the deposition process—larger particles settle first, with smaller particles and silt settling after. This accumulated sediment eventually hardens or compacts into a solid form creating strata or layers over time, in a process known as lithification, which is the creation of sedimentary rock. This entire process is a key part of the rock cycle, which involves the weathering, transport, deposition, and transformation of rock and soil."},{"prompt":"Question: Given the following context: With seven nations competing, the first Eurovision Song Contest took place in Lugano, Switzerland in May 1956. Sweden's first contest was the third, in 1958. Without broadcasting a public selection, Sveriges Radio (SR) chose to send Alice Babs to the contest in Hilversum, Netherlands. The song selected was \\"Samma stjärna lyser för oss två\\" (The same stars shine for the two of us), later renamed \\"Lilla stjärna\\" (Little star). It finished fourth at Eurovision on 12 March 1958. The first Melodifestival, incorporated into the Säg det med musik radio series, took place on 29 January 1959 at Cirkus in Stockholm; eight songs participated. Four \\"expert\\" juries in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, and Luleå decided the winner. The competition was won by Siw Malmkvist performing \\"Augustin\\", but SR decided that the winning song—regardless of its original performer—would be performed by Brita Borg at Eurovision. This policy, of selecting the artist for Eurovision internally and having other artists perform potential Swedish entries at Melodifestivalen, was stopped in 1961. The competition became a stand-alone television programme in 1960, known as the Eurovisionschlagern, svensk final. In the event's early years, it was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network. The competition adopted its current name, Melodifestivalen, in 1967. The Melodifestival has failed to be staged on three occasions. In 1964, the competition was cancelled due to an artist's strike; Sweden did not send a song to Eurovision that year. Sweden was absent at Eurovision for a second time in 1970 because of a Nordic boycott of the voting system, which had led to a four-way tie for first place at the 1969 contest. After SR staged the 1975 contest in Stockholm, left-wing groups argued that Sweden should not spend money to win and host Eurovision again. This led to mass demonstrations against commercial music and the organisation of an anti-commercial Alternativfestivalen. Therefore, Sweden decided not to send a song to Eurovision 1976,... answer the following question: What event was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network in the early years?

Article:","completion":"Title: An Easy DIY Lip Gloss Recipe You'll Love Introduction: Do you love experimenting with makeup and trying out new beauty products? Are you tired of spending a fortune on store-bought lip glosses that may contain questionable ingredients? If your answer to these questions is yes, then this article is perfect for you! Here, we present a quick and easy DIY lip gloss recipe that you can make at home using just a few simple ingredients. Not only will you save money, but you'll also have full control over the quality of the ingredients you use. So, let's get started! Step 1: Boil Water The first step in making your DIY lip gloss is to boil some water. Boiling water is essential for two reasons. First, it will help to sanitize and clean any tools or containers you'll be using for your lip gloss, ensuring that no bacteria or germs are present. Second, you'll be using the heat from the boiling water to melt the ingredients together in the next step. Fill a pot with water and place it on the stove over medium heat. Allow the water to come to a rolling boil before continuing. Step 2: Melt The Ingredients Once your water is boiling, you'll need to gather and melt your lip gloss ingredients. For a basic lip gloss recipe, you'll need: - 2 tablespoons of coconut oil - 1 tablespoon of beeswax or candelilla wax (use candelilla wax for a vegan option) - 1 teaspoon of sweet almond oil - A few drops of your favorite essential oil for fragrance and flavor (optional) Place these ingredients in a heat-resistant glass container like a measuring cup or a Pyrex bowl. Then, create a double boiler by placing the container into the pot of boiling water, gently stirring the ingredients until they melt and blend together. This process ensures that your ingredients melt evenly without overheating or burning. Step 3: Put It In A Container Once your ingredients have melted, carefully remove the glass container from the pot of boiling water using oven mitts or a towel to protect your hands. Let the mixture cool down for a few moments, during which you can add a few drops of your favorite essential oil. Next, pour the melted lip gloss mixture into small, sterilized containers or empty lip gloss tubes. You can find these containers at beauty supply stores or online retailers. Be sure to work carefully and quickly, as the mixture will begin to solidify as it cools. Step 4: Use Your Lip Gloss After pouring the lip gloss into containers, allow it to cool completely and solidify. Once it has reached room temperature and is fully set, your homemade lip gloss is ready to use! Simply apply the lip gloss using your finger or a lip brush, and enjoy the natural, moisturizing benefits of your new DIY creation. Feel free to experiment with different scents, flavors, and even tints by adding natural pigments like beetroot powder or cocoa powder. Conclusion: Making your own lip gloss at home is an easy and cost-effective way to create a beauty product that's customized to your preferences. This simple recipe is a great starting point for anyone who wants to explore the world of DIY beauty. With a little creativity and experimentation, you'll be on your way to building a collection of lip glosses that's uniquely yours!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is the southernmost district of Transnistria, located mostly south of Tiraspol. Its seat is the city of Slobozia, located at , on the river Dniester. The district contains 4 cities/towns and 12 communes (a total of 24 localities, including small villages/hamlets): - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. - Tîrnauca (Romanian \\"Ternivka\\", , \\"Ternovka\\") is a commune and village in the Slobozia District of Transnistria, Moldova, situated on the east bank of the river Dniester, between Tighina and Tiraspol. It is notable for being home to the largest bottle-shaped building in the world, the Butylka hotel and museum. - A is a type of hotel developed in Japan that features a large number of extremely small \\"rooms\\" (capsules) intended to provide cheap, basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require the services offered by more conventional hotels. - Tiraspol (Russian and ) is internationally recognised as the second largest city in Moldova, but is effectively the capital and administrative centre of the unrecognised Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria). The city is located on the eastern bank of the Dniester River. Tiraspol is a regional hub of light industry, such as furniture and electrical goods production. - Butylka ( Russian for bottle ) is the name of a museum and hotel , sometimes also called the Spirit Museum Hotel . It is located in the village Tîrnauca ( Ternovka ) , 10 km from Tiraspol , the capital of Transnistria . The museum is notable for being housed inside a five - story structure shaped like a giant bottle . It is listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest building in the world in the shape of a bottle . The museum features owner Grigory Korzun 's vast collection of liquor . - The Dniester River, or Dnister River ( translit. \\"Dnister\\", , ) is a river in Eastern Europe. It runs first through Ukraine and then through Moldova (from which it separates the breakaway territory of Transnistria), finally discharging into the Black Sea on Ukrainian territory again. - Moldavia (or \\"\\", Romanian Cyrillic alphabet: ) is a historical region, and former principality in Eastern Europe, corresponding to the territory between the Eastern Carpathians and the Dniester river. An initially independent and later autonomous state, it existed from the 14th century to 1859, when it united with Wallachia as the basis of the modern Romanian state; at various times, Moldavia included the regions of Bessarabia (with the Budjak) and all of Bukovina. - A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a fridge and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flatscreen television and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours. In Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities. - A bottle is a rigid container with a neck that is narrower than the body and a mouth. By contrast, a jar has a relatively large mouth or opening which may be as wide as the overall container. Bottles are often made of glass, clay, plastic, aluminium or other impervious materials, and typically used to store liquids such as water, milk, soft drinks, beer, wine, cooking oil, medicine, shampoo, ink, and chemicals. A device applied in the bottling line to seal the mouth of a bottle is termed an external bottle cap, closure, or internal stopper. A bottle can also be sealed by a conductive \\"innerseal\\" by using induction sealing. - A museum is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance and some public museums make them available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. Most large museums are located in major cities throughout the world and more local ones exist in smaller cities, towns and even the countryside. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public. - Transnistria (Moldovan: ), officially the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR ); also called Transdniester, Trans-Dniestr, Transdniestria, or Pridnestrovie, is a self-proclaimed republic on a strip of land between the River Dniester and the border with Ukraine, recognised only by three non-United Nations (UN) states. The region is considered by the UN to be part of Moldova. The PMR controls most of the territory to the east of the River Dniester, and also the city of Bender and its surrounding localities on the west bank, in the historical region of Bessarabia. - Moldova (or sometimes ), or Moldavia, officially the Republic of Moldova, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south. The capital city is Chiinu. - Bessarabia (; \\"Bessarabiya\\"; \\"Besarabiya\\") is a historical region in Eastern Europe, bounded by the Dniester river on the east and the Prut river on the west. Today Bessarabia is mostly occupied by modern-day Moldova, with the Ukrainian Budjak region covering the southern coastal region and part of the Ukrainian Chernivtsi Oblast covering a small area in the north. - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. Ukraine is currently in territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014 but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian. Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world. - Clay is a fine-grained natural rock or soil material that combines one or more clay minerals with traces of metal oxides and organic matter. Clays are plastic due to their water content and become hard, brittle and nonplastic upon drying or firing. Geologic clay deposits are mostly composed of phyllosilicate minerals containing variable amounts of water trapped in the mineral structure. Depending on the soil's content in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red. Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties. The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 45 m, and colloid chemists use 1 m. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 m and silt particles as being larger. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. What is the relationship between 'butylka ' and 'moldova'?

Question: Most surfers used Wide beach because of the areas of shallow water, but some surfers were happy with Sandy beach, although the water was much deeper at the shore there. Which beach had better and larger waves? Hint: When waves travel into areas of shallow water, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom. The free orbital motion of the water is disrupted, and water particles in orbital motion no longer return to their original position. As the water becomes shallower, the swell becomes higher and steeper, ultimately assuming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape. After the wave breaks, it becomes a wave of translation and erosion of the ocean bottom intensifies.

Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S.

By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, in an effort to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What individual drive did Locke believe would control man if belief in a higher power were abandoned?\\" Context: \\"A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions\\".\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"According to Locke, if belief in a higher power were abandoned, the individual drive that would control man is his own self-interest and will.

As the answer given is \\"Bad.\\", I'll have Bob provide that answer. Step 4: Add additional exchanges to provide a fuller conversation. To make the conversation more engaging and natural, I'll add some back-and-forth between the two friends as they react to the news about the bad weather. Step 5: Review the conversation for clarity and flow. Finally, I'll go over the conversation to ensure it reads well and sounds authentic. The conversation: Alice: Hey Bob, we were planning to go for a hike tomorrow, right? Do you know what the weather is going to be like? Bob: Oh, Alice, I just checked the forecast and it looks like the weather is going to be bad tomorrow. Alice: Ah, that's a bummer. Do you think it's going to rain all day? Bob: Unfortunately, yes. The weather report says there's a high chance of heavy rain and strong winds throughout the day. Alice: Well, I guess we'll have to find something else to do then. Maybe we can go for that hike next weekend if the weather is better. Bob: Sounds like a plan! We can keep an eye on the forecast and make a decision closer to next weekend."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Nuclei in the midbrain are to the eye muscles as motor systems are to what? Context: Motor systems are areas of the brain that are directly or indirectly involved in producing body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the first names of the people who purchased a complete set of prints, over which they drew and pasted demonic clown and puppy heads? Despite being one of the most significant anti-war works of art, The Disasters of War had no impact on the European consciousness for two generations, as it was not seen outside a small circle in Spain until it was published by Madrid's Royal Academy of San Fernando in 1863. Since then, interpretations in successive eras have reflected the sensibilities of the time. Goya was seen as a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Théodore Géricault, best known for the politically charged Raft of the Medusa (1818–19). Luis Buñuel identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'Âge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.The series' impact on Dalí is evident in Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War), painted in 1936 in response to events leading to the Spanish Civil War. Here, the distorted limbs, brutal suppression, agonised expressions and ominous clouds are reminiscent of plate 39, Grande hazaña! Con muertos! (A heroic feat! With dead men!), in which mutilated bodies are shown against a backdrop barren landscape.In 1993, Jake and Dinos Chapman of the Young British Artists movement created 82 miniature, toy-like sculptures modelled on The Disasters of War. The works were widely acclaimed and purchased that year by the Tate gallery. For decades, Goya's series of etching served as a constant point of reference for the Chapman brothers; in particular, they created a number of variations based on the plate Grande hazaña! Con muertos!. In 2003, the Chapman brothers exhibited an altered version of The Disasters of War. They purchased a complete set of prints, over which they drew and pasted demonic clown and puppy heads. The Chapmans described their \\"rectified\\" images as making a connection between Napoleon's supposed introduction of Enlightenment ideals to early-19th-century Spain and Tony Blair and George W.

She was born in Farnborough, Hampshire, England, the daughter of Edward Digby, 11th Baron Digby, and his wife, Constance Pamela Alice, the daughter of Henry Campbell Bruce, 2nd Baron Aberdare. Pamela was educated by governesses in the ancestral home at Minterne Magna in Dorset, along with her three younger siblings. Her great-great aunt was the nineteenth-century adventurer and courtesan Jane Digby (1807-1881), notorious for her exotic travels and scandalous personal life. Pamela was to follow in her ancestor's footsteps, being frequently cited as \\"the 20th-century's greatest courtesan.\\" In 1939, while working at the Foreign Office in London doing French-to-English translations, Pamela met Randolph Churchill, the son of Winston Churchill. Randolph proposed to her on the very evening they met, and they were married on 4 October 1939. Two days after Randolph Churchill took his seat in the House of Commons, their son Winston was born. Shortly after giving birth, Pamela and the newborn were photographed by Cecil Beaton for Life magazine, its first cover of a mother with baby. In February 1941, Randolph was sent to Cairo for military service, where he accrued large gambling debts. His letter to Pamela asking her to make good on his liabilities, along with her affair with W. Averell Harriman, combined to shatter their marriage, but the fault probably lay on both sides. Harriman was known at Chequers by the French phrase habitue de la maison for his frequent stays there in 1941. Harriman was one of the aristocratic set from the US Embassy, charming, suave and sophisticated. They had developed a friendship during the London Blitz, so that by 17 April 1941 they were already close and intimate friends. Jack Colville, Churchill's private secretary was well aware of the affair, but their clandestine relationship had to wait thirty years before consummation in marriage. She completed the circle by becoming a US citizen. Her father-in-law however, was too busy visiting bombed-out Blitz sites to be overly-concerned in 1941. During 1944 she worked in the Cabinet's war rooms on a secretive SOE mission for Operation Bodyguard working with Robert E. Sherwood. \\"The days at the office were very sorry,\\" wrote Bobby Bevan, a spy who was directly involved with Bodyguard's activities; long days stretched into lonely nights, when they frequently indulged the senses on champagne and Russian caviar. Bodyguard went ahead without allied knowledge or approval, which upset the Soviets. At a critical point prior to the Top Secret D-Day Normandy landings, allied intelligence feared Germany's strength in the Mediterranean; a diversionary attack on the Balkans was designed to distract the Nazis in France. This further encouraged Churchill to switch sides to Tito's Partisans. After the war, Randolph had an affair with Bevan's wife. Eventually, Pamela filed for divorce in December 1945 on the grounds that Randolph had deserted her for three years. Later, after having converted to Catholicism, she obtained an annulment from the Catholic Church.

Given the question: We had a light bulb that stopped working and when a new bulb was placed it wouldn’t light up. We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system. So what started out for changing a light bulb was going to end up costing 10K. We did later get it looked at by someone else that is qualified in this field,m who was there working on some other project and he said there was nothing wrong with what we had.

Checked the other bulbs: To ensure that there were no other electrical issues in the house, the writer might have checked other light bulbs and fixtures to see if they were working properly. 4.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Yes, the answer to both questions would be the same, as they are essentially inquiring about the same product, Alpha Force Testo, and how it works. Here is a detailed and long answer to describe how Alpha Force Testo functions: Alpha Force Testo is a dietary supplement designed for men, particularly those who are engaged in regular physical activity or fitness regimens. The primary function of this supplement is to help increase testosterone levels in the body, thus improving muscle growth, physical strength, and sexual performance. The supplement achieves these objectives through a combination of ingredients, which work together to support the body's natural testosterone production process. Alpha Force Testo generally contains a blend of natural ingredients, such as herbs, vitamins, and minerals. Some of the common ingredients found in this supplement include: 1. Fenugreek Extract: This herbal ingredient is known to help increase testosterone production by stimulating the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland. Luteinizing hormone, in turn, signals the testes to produce and release more testosterone. 2. Tribulus Terrestris: This plant extract is believed to support the natural production of testosterone by increasing the levels of luteinizing hormone in the body. Additionally, Tribulus Terrestris may improve athletic performance, sexual stamina, and libido. 3. D-Aspartic Acid: This amino acid is essential for testosterone production, as it helps the body release crucial hormones, such as luteinizing hormone. It also increases the production of follicle-stimulating hormone, which contributes to sperm count and overall male fertility. 4. Vitamin D3: Adequate levels of Vitamin D3 are vital for maintaining healthy testosterone levels. This vitamin has been linked to the promotion of testosterone production and optimal hormonal balance. 5. Zinc: This essential mineral is necessary for testosterone production and plays a key role in the body's ability to convert free cholesterol into testosterone. 6. Magnesium: Magnesium is another vital nutrient for testosterone health, as it helps regulate the testosterone levels in the body. It also improves overall athletic performance and endurance. The synergistic combination of these ingredients allows Alpha Force Testo to perform its primary function of boosting testosterone levels in the body. By increasing testosterone levels, the supplement assists users in achieving enhanced muscle growth, improved muscle strength, and increased endurance during workouts. This, in turn, allows users to experience better performance both in and out of the gym. In addition to supporting testosterone production and optimizing physical performance, Alpha Force Testo may also improve users' sexual health. Increased testosterone levels have been associated with improved libido, enhanced sexual stamina, and better overall sexual performance. To summarize, the answer to both questions is the same: Alpha Force Testo works by combining various natural ingredients that together help increase testosterone levels in the body, thus contributing to improved muscle growth, physical strength, and sexual performance. The supplement achieves this goal by stimulating the release of hormones essential for testosterone production, providing the body with the necessary nutrients for optimal testosterone synthesis, and promoting overall hormonal balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This House believes that Europe should weaken its austerity measures to guarantee its citizens greater social support. What argument could one make about this debate topic?","completion":"The argument for the motion posits that Europe should shift some of its focus away from strict austerity measures and towards providing more social support for the citizens, since continued austerity policies have led to several negative consequences for European societies. Although these measures have helped combat fiscal and sovereign debt crises in the past, their impact on the overall well-being of the citizens cannot be ignored. There are several primary arguments that can be made in favor of weakening European austerity measures in order to prioritize the well-being of citizens. 1. Exacerbated inequality: One of the most critical consequences of austerity measures is an increase in income and wealth inequality among the population. When public spending is cut, it disproportionately impacts the economically disadvantaged, since they are most reliant on such support. By reducing the austerity measures, Europe can allocate more resources towards addressing inequality, promoting a more inclusive society where nobody is left behind. 2. Unemployment and underemployment: Austerity measures often involve the reduction of public sector jobs, which tends to increase unemployment rates. This not only causes financial distress to the individuals directly affected but also increases the risk of social and political instability. When people are unable to secure decent paying jobs, they turn to part-time or low-skilled work, contributing to the problem of underemployment. Loosening austerity measures would allow for the creation of more jobs, reduce unemployment and raise living standards. 3. Mental and physical health implications: Austerity measures often affect the delivery and quality of healthcare services, as budget cuts directly impact hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities. In some cases, austerity has led to reductions in mental health services and increased the cost of essential medications. By lessening austerity measures, European nations can allocate more funding towards healthcare, dramatically improving the health and well-being of their citizens. 4. Education and social mobility: Cuts to public education and training have long-term consequences for the European workforce, as austerity policies limit the opportunities for personal and professional development. By re-allocating resources towards education and professional training, Europe can enhance social mobility and create more opportunities for citizens to improve their lives and escape the poverty cycle. 5. Economic growth: A strong argument against austerity measures is that Europe's economic growth is stifled by the focus on fiscal consolidation, as it limits public investment in key areas such as infrastructure, education, and research and development. By adopting a more balanced approach, Europe can invest in measures that contribute to long-term economic growth, benefiting both the individual citizens and the broader economy. 6. Avoiding a lost generation: Among the most concerning consequences of austerity measures has been the impact on young people in Europe. The combination of high youth unemployment and reduced investment in social programs threatens to create a lost generation, with long-lasting implications on Europe's economy and society. By reconsidering austerity policies and prioritizing the needs of the younger population, Europe can avoid this scenario, creating a better future for all its citizens. In conclusion, the argument for weakening austerity measures in Europe is driven by a concern for the social wellbeing and economic sustainability of European societies. By prioritizing the needs of citizens, Europe can foster a more inclusive, equitable, and prosperous future for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was occupied intermittently from the mid 1920s until around 1938? from the following article ? Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since... The answer to this question is:","completion":"The last name of the person who was occupied intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938 mentioned in the article is Sibelius. The referred individual is Jean Sibelius, a well-known composer from Finland. He was working on his Symphony No. 8 during this time period but never published it."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

One such common and suitable manifestation of happiness in children is skipping. Skipping is a playful, energetic movement where a child alternates between hopping on one foot and then the other, often with bursts of laughter and joy. Happy children may also engage in other activities, aside from skipping, that showcase their excitement and contentment. These can include: 1. Laughing and smiling: When children are happy, they will naturally display emotions through laughter and smiling, which are key indicators of happiness. 2. Playing games: Happy children love to play games, whether alone or with peers. These games can range from simple ones like tag or hide-and-seek to more complex games that involve imagination and creativity. 3. Dancing: Joyful music and rhythm can be enticing to children, prompting them to express their happiness through spontaneous dancing, bouncing, and swaying to the beat. 4. Hugging: Happy children often display their affection and happiness through warm hugs to their friends, siblings, or parents. Hugging is a fundamental way to strengthen bonds and share the feeling of happiness with others. 5. Enjoying hobbies: As children explore and discover their interests, they become happy when engaging in their favorite hobbies, such as drawing, painting, playing an instrument, or reading. 6.

The uniforms, which were launched on September 1, have garnered both admiration and criticism, as some crew members claim the outfits are uncomfortable and impractical for work. Step 2: Address the issues raised by the staff Several cabin crew members have reported issues with the new uniforms, including excessively tight clothing that hampers movement and shoes that cause painful blisters. Furthermore, female employees have complained about the high-waisted skirts, while both male and female staff members have expressed discomfort with collars so tight, they've experienced bleeding. Step 3: Include Virgin Atlantic's response Despite the complaints, Virgin Atlantic maintains that the Vivienne Westwood uniforms are \\"comfortable and practical.\\" The airline claims that the outfits underwent extensive trials during which cabin crew had ample opportunity to provide feedback. Virgin Atlantic representatives stated that the airline took the employees' concerns into account and made any necessary adjustments before rolling out the final designs. Step 4: Discuss the implications of the controversy The controversy surrounding the new uniforms highlights the challenges that airlines face when trying to marry style and functionality. While Virgin Atlantic aimed to make a bold fashion statement with its partnership with Vivienne Westwood, the resulting designs seem to have compromised the comfort and practicality crucial for cabin crew members during their long shifts. Step 5: Conclude the article In light of the mixed reviews, it remains to be seen whether Virgin Atlantic will make further adjustments to the current uniforms or if the airline will stand by its initial claim that the outfits are comfortable and practical despite the concerns from its staff. Either way, the collaboration with Vivienne Westwood has undoubtedly drawn attention to the airline, while also sparking a conversation about the importance of balancing form and function in uniform design."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
